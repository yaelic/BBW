          <p>Good morning. My name is <mark type="ph" /> Steven (00:02) and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And after the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note we will take one question and one follow-up question from each participant. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011. Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.</p>
          <p>Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2010 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities and Exchange Commission</p>
          <p>Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website. I want to remind you of three adjustments we recorded in the first quarter of last year. These charges related to the U.S. domestic segment reorganization, the change of tax filing status of a German subsidiary, and the loss on the sale of the supply chain business. They reduced net income by $175 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18.</p>
          <p>In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS' first quarter 2010 results, excluding the impact of these items. We believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. These schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section.</p>
          <p>Now, to begin our review, I'll turn the program over to Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. UPS had great results this quarter, continuing the momentum we had in 2010. Earnings climbed 24% on 7% revenue growth, despite the obstacles we faced like unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, skyrocketing fuel costs, and some of the worst weather conditions in years. So far, the global economic recovery has been resilient, yet the risks are a little greater than they were three months ago. Consensus forecasts have come down slightly. As 2011 GDP growth for the U.S. is now expected to be 2.9% and global GDP is forecast to be 3.5%. Employment has begun to show signs of improvement. Here in the U.S., unemployment dipped below 9% for the first time in almost two years, further evidence that the recovery continues.</p>
          <p>Obviously everyone is aware of the tragic events in Japan. UPS was one of the first to support the humanitarian efforts there, working closely with the relief agency partners in Asia. UPS pledged $1 million in relief aid and has been assisting with logistics support. We've delivered many containers and truckloads of emergency supplies and equipment throughout Japan. Some of these important deliveries include emergency shelters, generators, survival kits and food supplies. UPS will continue to look for other opportunities to help the victims.</p>
          <p>While the immediate impact on the global economy and UPS is not expected to be substantial, the medium-term implications on global supply chains are still not clear. Here in the U.S. it is important for us to demonstrate economic leadership and increase promotion of free trade. Expectations are that Congress will soon address pending free trade legislation that is critical to grow U.S. exports and to create new jobs. The South Korean Free Trade Agreement that President Obama endorsed back in December has not yet passed. This critical piece of legislation is needed to further our progress on meeting the Export Council's goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next five years.</p>
          <p>Other important trade agreements like those with Colombia and Panama are still in the approval process. UPS stands ready to facilitate the growth of trade between countries once these agreements are finalized. I would like to see Columbia and Panama approved as soon as possible. However, I personally disagree with holding up the Korean agreement while waiting for approval of these other two FTAs.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, UPS continued to be active in expanding our capabilities to serve the economies of the world. For instance, UPS launched four direct flights from Hong Kong to Europe, making us the clear leader in guaranteed next day delivery for this important trade lane. We announced more intra-Asia flights from Tokyo to key hubs in Taipei and Guangzhou, exhibiting our commitment to Japan. And UPS formed a new strategic alliance in Colombia that will provide increased access for customers to our superior global network.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we hosted President Obama at our Landover, Maryland, facility where he announced the National Clean Fleets Partnership and made us a charter member. The UPS rolling laboratory of alternative fuel vehicles was on display for the President and his team. With one of the largest alternative fuel fleets in operation today, we are uniquely qualified to discuss issues facing companies as they evaluate their options. In fact in February, we celebrated a milestone when the UPS green fleet surpassed 200 million miles of service.</p>
          <p>Just recently UPS was acknowledged as the industry leader by Fortune magazine when they once again identified us as the world's most admired company in the delivery industry. UPS is rated number one in eight of the nine attributes used for ranking. Some of the key attributes were quality of management, innovation, long-term investment, and quality of products and services. In addition, as reported by Forbes, the Reputation Institute recognized UPS as number one in the transportation industry and number six overall on its list of America's most reputable big companies. We will continue to operate in a way that builds both our economic performance and corporate reputation.</p>
          <p>All in all, it was another successful quarter for the UPS team. We continue to produce the best results in the industry. Our focus on quality of revenue and the value of our integrated network ensures that we continue to be the best. Our innovative solutions, superior technology and efficient use of capital have UPS poised for strong growth well into the future.</p>
          <p>Now let me to it over to Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The UPS earnings growth story continues. Operating profit for the quarter increased $248 million and margins expanded by 130 basis points to 11.3%. UPS benefited from our superior products and our flexible integrated network. The negative effects of escalating fuel prices and difficult weather were more than offset by great execution from UPSers all around the world.</p>
          <p>Now let's review how the segments performed this quarter starting with the U.S. Domestic Package business. Operating profit jumped 29% on over 6% revenue gains. These results were driven by yield improvements and increased network efficiency. Operating margin expanded by 200 basis points. Revenue per piece grew 5%, with the biggest driver being increases in base rates as we get our prices back in line with the value we provide. Higher fuel surcharges and package characteristics also contributed to the yield improvement.</p>
          <p>We are executing our strategy on focusing on the quality of revenue. The key objective of this strategy is to ensure that we are properly compensated for the value we provide customers. And this is paying off as evidenced by our strong yield gains.</p>
          <p>Once again, we did a great job controlling costs in the quarter. Operating efficiency improved substantially as direct labor hours were down 3% and miles driven down 2%. This is phenomenal considering the challenging conditions we faced during the quarter.</p>
          <p>U.S. domestic volume growth was relatively flat to last year. Clearly, this was negatively impacted by severe weather, a softer economy and the timing of Easter. In 2010, the holiday buildup occurred in March while this year, it's occurring in April. We estimate that the combination of weather and the Easter calendar had a negative impact on average daily volume of about 2% for the quarter. While overall, our Next Day air was up about 1%, Next Day Package volume grew at mid-single-digit rate reflecting our focus on the quality of revenue.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, UPS made a substantial commitment to expand our fleet of liquefied natural gas tractors. Later this year, the 48 new LNG tractors will join our fleet of almost 2,000 alternative fuel vehicles. We're encouraged by the ability of this technology to offer an alternative to diesel fuel for large, over-the-road vehicles.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the International segment. Revenue increased 10%, with a solid operating margin of 15.4%. The operating profit of $446 million is the best first quarter result in UPS history, although year-over-year earnings growth did slow to 4.4%. Clearly, the rapid increase in fuel costs had a negative impact. As we stated during our last call, the first quarter of 2010 benefited from our euro-hedging program. This negatively affected the year-over-year comparisons by about $30 million.</p>
          <p>Average daily export volume increased over 7%, outpacing the market. We continue to see strong export growth in Europe to all regions of the world as customers there recognize the benefits of the UPS value proposition. International Package yields grew 4.5% on a currency neutral basis, driven by higher rates, fuel surcharge increases, and product mix.</p>
          <p>UPS was active during the quarter, adding capacity to our Asian air network. In addition, to the direct flights from Hong Kong to Cologne, and the new routes from Japan that Scott mentioned earlier, we also upsized our capacity serving the important South Korea to U.S. trade lane with the addition of a 767 flying in and out of Incheon.</p>
          <p>Further emphasizing the breadth of solutions we provide, in March, UPS opened the 2012 Olympic Games Logistics Center in England. This is an important milestone that will allow UPS to deliver the games. We are responsible for virtually all distribution and logistics services for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympics games.</p>
          <p>Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment, which continues to produce strong results. Operating profits climbed 44% on revenue growth of 7.6%, driven primarily by improvements in UPS Freight and the Forwarding business unit. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 6.1%. In the Forwarding unit, operating margin improved significantly as capacity in the market expanded and buy rates came down. Top line growth moderated somewhat as we focused on revenue management initiatives implemented last year.</p>
          <p>UPS Freight revenue climbed 23%, continuing the strong rebound that started last year. LTL shipments improved 10%, and weight per shipment was up, too. LTL revenue per 100 weight was up more than 8% and continues to be one of the best in the industry. Operating results improved on a year-over-year basis despite challenging weather conditions.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, UPS announced the expansion of our Express Air Freight services to customers in Israel and Slovakia. These developing countries are becoming important hubs for automotive technology and other manufacturing industries. We also expanded our Preferred Less Than Container Load Ocean Freight service in Asia. More customers can now benefit from this unique expedited service that improves ocean freight delivery times to the U.S. by up to 40%.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at one of the hallmarks of UPS, our ability to generate cash. Free cash flow for the period was $900 million in spite of $1.2 billion in accelerated pension contributions made early in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $400 million. With respect to distributions to share owners, we paid $500 million in dividends, reflecting a 10.6% increase per share announced during the quarter, continuing the UPS tradition of more than four decades of raising or maintaining our dividend. The company also spent $500 million to repurchase approximately 6.8 million shares.</p>
          <p>Regarding our outlook for the rest of 2011, the global economic outlook has become a little cloudier than it was three months ago. However, we still expect 2011 to be a great year with record earnings per share for UPS. In fact, our confidence has increased, and we are raising guidance for 2011 to a range of $4.15 to $4.40 per share, representing a 17% to 24% improvement over last year.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. Domestic segment, we expect average daily volume to increase approximately 2% for the second quarter with continued strengthening in the second half of 2011. For the full year, Next Day Air and Ground are expected to grow at a similar pace. Yields will remain strong as we continue to focus on the quality of revenue, and operating profit growth is expected to exceed 20% for the year, up from our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>For the International segment, both revenue and operating profit are expected to grow approximately 10%. Full year operating margins are expected to be similar to 2010. Year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter will be especially difficult as a result of headwinds created by our euro hedging programs. We estimate the impact to be approximately $40 million.</p>
          <p>Our Supply Chain and Freight segment is expected to produce mid- to high single digit revenue growth with continued margin expansion, driven primarily by UPS Freight.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, UPS is off to a good start, performing well in the face of challenging conditions. We are executing our strategy of focusing on the quality of revenue, providing the best service and offering the most comprehensive set of solutions to our customers. The UPS integrated global network is operating with incredible flexibility and efficiency. We are confident in our ability to meet customer needs and excited about the results that UPS shareowners will see in the future.</p>
          <p>Well, thanks for your attention, and now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Gary Chase of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gary.  Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to see, Kurt, if I could ask you to follow up a little bit on some of the volume commentary. I know you noted what you expected was a 2% impact for eastern weather. Even if I adjust that away, still don't seemingly have a lot of volume growth relative to what we're seeing in say, industrial production and some of these other drivers. Is that the impact of these pricing initiatives? Is it de-marketing of some business you don't think is compensatory? What other color can you provide there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't think there's a big impact of our yield focus. We have seen a little bit of a differential though, in the growth certainly at the heavy freight end the market from the small package. As we look at some of the statistics, industrial production is showing strength but the majority of the strength in industrial production is coming from some of the heavier industry side, metals and some of those things that don't necessarily impact small package.</p>
          <p>We do think that the Q1 the economy was a little softer than we had anticipated. I know some of the quarter-to-quarter numbers are now coming in estimated at 1.9%, but we see this as transitory. We think over time, Small Package, the growth will ripple into there and that the Freight is more of a leading indicator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Gary, during the recession, the IP numbers were down a lot more than the Small Package market volume was. So I think part of this recovery, too, is going to distort those correlations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just as a quick follow-up to that, you guys have always talked about the leverage you have in the labor contract as it relates to volume. Do we need a lot of growth in order to recognize that? Or are we were reaching a stage where maybe attrition will allow you a little bit of leverage there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're seeing a pretty good leverage right now. Even with the headwinds we had of some of the most extraordinary weather in the first quarter, we did a great job of expanding domestic margins and comp and benefit adjusted were up just slightly more than volume rates. So we think that the operating efficiencies, the operational technology that's kicking in is showing substantial benefit. So I think we're seeing these benefits even without the tailwind of significant benefit of wage moderation, so still more to come as growth continues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&amp;T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Scott, Kurt and Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kev.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, are you guys seeing customers move up and down the supply chain with the volatility in oil prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think not as much as we would've seen the last time through in 2008. I think, one, we've adjusted our surcharge index where the difference between air and ground is not as dramatic as it was in the past. And what you saw in the first quarter, actually, was better performance in the premium products internationally and better performance on Next Day Package domestically. So were not seeing it at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's been a big priority for us following the spike in fuel in 2008, to revisit the structure of our fuel surcharges. And, in general, the surcharges are lower because we have continued to move some of that rate into the core rates and then as Scott said, we've narrowed the gap so that we don't think the risk of trade-down will be as great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you. And, Kurt, as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that miles driven being down in the quarter. But as volumes pick up this year, do you anticipate this increasing, or given the initiatives that you have in place, can you keep miles driven, say, flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it really depends how great the growth is. I mean, we'd love to see an increase in miles driven by a robust economy and significant increases. We are confident that our miles will continue to grow at a much lower rate than our volume and growth in stops. The operational technology we put in to optimize and the focus on reducing fuel consumption is paying some real dividends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks so much for your time this morning.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ed Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just back at the volumes domestically, did I hear you right, Kurt, that guidance was 2% for second-quarter for domestic volumes and better than that in third and fourth? And if that's the case and you're down a little bit this quarter and a couple points for weather you're saying, were March and April better? Is that what's giving you the confidence to go from minus to positive 2%? And if so, kind of, what were March and April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>March was not really better, Ed, because of the Easter lag. The buildup into Easter comes several weeks before Easter. This year, with a late Easter that's really moved over into April, and so we are seeing the typical seasonal buildup into April. So we don't see the core economic growth picking up dramatically, slightly better than for Q1, but the noise of the unprecedented weather, really all three months saw significant weather headwinds and the calendar impact, and the little slower economy. As we factor through all those, we're pretty confident that the core growth rate coming into Q2 should be about 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And April clearly is performing better than we saw in the first three months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give some number to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's tough, Ed, right now because of the Good Friday, Easter Monday comparisons. Certainly the first two weeks were quite strong. Last week, when compared against Good Friday, down a little bit, but we'll see certainly a better April than we saw in the first three months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a follow up, with the domestic volume not there, you were still able to show the leverage and grow the domestic margin. Can you talk a little bit about what some of those levers are? Is it time and hiring people that's letting you leverage the underlying contract a little bit? Is it something else? Where are you seeing this leverage? And what does 2% means that leverage relative to 0.6%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>The leverage is really coming from two components. Number one is the top line leverage where as I said, one of our top priorities is making sure that we get pricing back to the levels that compensate us for the value we've created. And so the relatively firm stance on pricing and extracting the value that is there is a big driver of that. And at the same time we are seeing the benefits of the deep investments we've made in operational technology and we'll show a lot more of that at our investor conference in September to give you guys a little more understanding of the multiple areas that we're streamlining the network. And all of that is without significant benefits of growth, which will help us both on scale densities and also moderating the wage increases.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow up on Ed's question there a little bit in terms of talking about the yields and the price increases. Obviously you're doing a great job there and it's a big priority, but how easy is it to get the customer acceptance with fuel surcharges rising so rapidly? I know a little bit more of that is in the base, but how are you thinking about that and what's the customer acceptance there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so far at least the customer pushback has been minimal, because certainly the levels are below some of the peaks that we saw. So, so far not too much disruption on that front, but, we have gone back in and worked with customers actively to see how we can realign their supply chains to minimize the impact of that. So far, we haven't seen a significant impact of people really going back and revisiting their blend of premium and standard products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real concern for us is how long and how high energy prices go because that will probably impact the economy more. I think the rule of thumb for economists are that if oil prices go up $10 a barrel that's going to knock down GDP about 0.2% in year one, about 0.5% in year two. We've seen about a $30 run in crude oil, so that could certainly have an impact in 2012, knock out about half the growth. So that's our concern, how high the prices go and how long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And then in terms of &#x2013; we talked a little bit about domestic maybe being just a little bit slower. How are you feeling on the international side in terms of the volume trends there and kind of going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were clearly thrilled by a continued very strong growth, 7% unit growth in our export volumes. Europe continues to outperform even with continued sluggish economy in Europe. So we feel very good that the international business is continuing to move forward. The comparisons to last year were a little tougher as we said because of some very beneficial hedging we had in 2010. But global trade continues to move along fairly strong. As Scott mentioned in his prepared comments, not too much disruption yet on the Japan side but the UPS story continues to be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the global GDP numbers have maybe come down a tick from what we looked at three months ago, and that's pretty impressive when you consider what was now three months ago was the Japan situation, clearly the problems in the Mid East and North Africa, the impact on energy prices. So I think overall, we've seen global GDP dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, so that's pretty encouraging, really, as we move forward. Europe actually has gotten a little bit better in that timeframe, it's up 0.2%, expectations for the rest of the year. So we feel it's a resilient economy and we'll see strong global trade throughout this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think one other thing we're doing is we are continuing to reinvest in that. With the announcement of the direct flights Hong Kong into Europe, you connect those flights into our all points hub in Cologne and we have guaranteed service to 34 countries within Europe next day so we're leveraging that deep integrated network we have in Europe and connecting that to Asia.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Thanks. For domestic yields can you help us think about the positive impact of the dimensional weight changes? What you're seeing there and anything you can tell us about weight changes in general would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general weight is fairly stable, maybe up just a little bit and that's typical with a recovery. It hasn't been perhaps as rapid as some other recoveries, but neither has the absolute economic growth. The dim weight is just a part of our annual recalibration of the appropriate pricing and it just more strongly focuses on those high <mark type="ph" /> queue (28:15) packages that eat up a lot of space in our vehicles. So it is a contributor, but certainly not material. The base rates, the fuel surcharge and some of the characteristic mixes are all a bigger impact than the dim weight in and of itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. That's helpful. Then just following up on a question from before, can you talk about what percentage of drivers are in the highest paid tier? Remind us what kind of typical averages are. Help us think through the mix right now of your drivers. And then can you talk about the timing seasonality of turnover, do get more turnover in Q2 than the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We remain at a very high percentage, over 90% of our drivers are at the full senior rate and as we continue to streamline the network and reduced our direct hours, there's not as much mix of new employees in. So that's still a latent opportunity for us as we show stronger growth and the economy continues to expand, but we did not get any benefit from that in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. Just sticking on that same theme Scott and Kurt, it looks like your comp costs were up 1% year-over-year, obviously well below your revenue growth and obviously a great move there and part of the margin gains, but can you talk about, is that kind of the contribution toward the pension you've made? What is driving that slight increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did have a few cost headwinds into the year that we talked about in our guidance. Our pension expense was up substantially, we reinstated the employee match for the 401(k). At the same time, we were able to limit our unit cost as it were across the whole company to less than 1%. So we feel very good about the trends in our comp and our productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Ken, it's improved productivity and we're continuing to invest in technology in that arena and we'll spend some time at the investor conference in September walking through some of these, but there's more to be had there also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are we seeing actual employment numbers come down aside from the driver number Scott was just talking about? Are we seeing is this increased productivity that gets rid of &#x2013; are you looking at employee numbers coming down on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not dramatically. It depends on the growth. Certainly if the U.S. economy stagnates then there may be some reductions as we improve productivity. But with modest growth we can offset the need to increase employees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We we're so flexible that answer is different every day based on package volume we see coming in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can get my follow-up on the Forwarding business. It looked like again, you had I guess growth slowed there about 3% from the mid-teens the last couple quarters. Is there anything going on, on the Freight side, just trying to find something else, because on the core side you did such a great job on the margin gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually are very pleased with our overall Supply Chain and Trade performance with over 40% profit improvement. I did mention that in the Forwarding we have been clearly going back and focusing on revenue management, margins improved substantially. The other thing that's in that forwarding and logistics line is there is some headwind because we are overlapping the disposition of two businesses that were in that space, one a small German supply chain business that we liquidated last year, and then late last year we did sell our Logistics Technology business. So there is a revenue headwind on that front that took the core logistics growth down from solid mid-single digits to just slightly increasing. So that distorts the numbers a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Air Freight in the first quarter of last year, you'll remember, was extremely strong as there was still a capacity for shortage out there. Rates were high and strong. This year, pretty slow February out of Asia, particularly with the Chinese New Year and people coming back to work late.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your Domestic Package margin performance was very good in the quarter. I guess if you look at it from an incremental margin perspective, it looks like about 43%, which is a pretty strong incremental margin performance. When you look at second quarter, do you think that, that can actually get better? Because first quarter clearly you had the weather and fuel lag impacts and volume's not quite as good. So I guess if you could just offer thoughts of, can you do even better looking forward? Because it would seem that, that would be kind of a natural conclusion given the headwinds in first quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I guess I won't get into the details on incremental margins. There's a lot of moving parts there. Some is driven by total revenue, some is driven by yield, and some by productivity. But, we certainly feel that Q2 will be a better quarter than Q1; a) seasonally it's usually stronger, and b) once again, we had some extraordinary headwinds in Q1. Those of you that live in New York know the kind of weather that we faced. Our Small Package operation, because of the flexible network, was able to adapt. We did see a little more headwind in the Freight. But assuming that we don't get snow in May in Manhattan, we think we'll be in much better shape on the Domestic side. And it's really the Domestic outlook that was the driver of our guidance increase that we gave this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of a follow-up, you were asked earlier about just the broad approach on pricing. Do you think there is a significant difference in the sales force this year versus what you would've been this time last year in terms of how they're approaching the market? And that, that is playing some role in terms of realizing more price and a little less volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, we are placing a slightly stronger focus on yield as opposed to just pure growth for its own sake. So it's possible at the increment that there's some reduction in volumes, although we're not explicitly deciding to slow the growth down. So we feel pretty good that we're finding a good balance. As I said, Q2 &#x2013; or Q1 was a very noisy quarter with calendar issues, with fuel, with the economy slowing and with weather, so I wouldn't read too much into the Q1 results. We think we'll get back on a reasonable growth trend, and that's encompassed in our guidance. But we did say over a year ago that one of our priorities is making sure that UPS gets compensated for the value that it creates, and we feel good that we're on track for that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. On the International side, can you talk about how pricing &#x2013; general pricing trends in the Transpacific, Transatlantic and Intra-Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Pricing has remained pretty positive, and you'll see that if you look at our currency adjusted results, John, that they've actually strengthened. So we do feel pretty good that it's a very stable environment. Certainly there is no one consistent message for each market. Asia can be a little more volatile because of the big swings in capacity and growth, but we are very focused, just as we are in the U.S., on making sure that we're pricing to value, and then for UPS, that unique value proposition is extremely strong with us really being the only one of our major competitors that has a very strong balance position in Asia, in Europe and in the U.S. With the incredible capabilities we have within Europe, with our linkage of Asia to Europe next day, all of those things just continue to give our sales people a very strong value proposition. And on top of that, this ability to align our Supply Chain and Trade capabilities with the Small Package solution makes it so that we really don't have to get aggressive on price to continue to grow reasonably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. And then the same question in the Domestic business, Kurt, you've talked about the small and mid-sized shipper being a hollow recovery, not seeing as much there. Can you comment on any recent trends there and how that segment looks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, that is one of the &#x2013; kind of the side stories in the domestic economy, that we have seen that large global companies have bounced back more quickly and certainly that's the story in the U.S. where our big accounts and our accounts that have a global footprint have seen more growth and that Main Street has been lagging some of these global companies. Liquidity hasn't been available and that the recovery has to some extent been delayed in the middle market. So that trend has continued. We do see higher growth in our global companies than we do in our small and medium-sized ones. We think frankly that could be a tailwind going forward as that part of the economy picks up more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I think I'm optimistic you'll see a pickup later this year in that group. I think clearly the credit availability has improved dramatically from where it was 12 months ago for the SMEs. That will help an awful lot. We're also working hard to get some of these free trade agreements done to help get the SMEs into the exporting part of the business and that's where the future is for them. Again, you heard many times, 95% of the consumers are outside of the U.S. We have to get small and medium-sized enterprises to export.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much. Congratulations, a very solid quarter. Two questions, you spoke a little bit about the heavy versus light and the small shipper versus global shipper, I notice you had seen. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more geographic color? We've been hearing a theme across a lot of companies that the middle of the country and the farm belt was a relatively stronger economy than on the coasts. Could you give us a view, either geographically or industry-wide, of where you're seeing some changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeff, there's not huge differences, although I think your pickup on the Midwest, certainly with some of the manufacturing rebound and some of the commodity and early products and supply chain booming, that we are seeing some firmness there. Although clearly, the automotive group has recovered substantially versus where it was at a year ago. So I think on a year-over-year basis we are seeing some pockets of strength centered around some of those specific industries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a sector perspective, Jeff, for us, it seems like we still saw the first quarter, the major growth in the retail probably the technology side. As Kurt said, we are seeing sequential strengthening in the manufacturing and wholesale durables as we move through the quarter. So it's looking a little bit better as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And the follow-up: You made to comment on the freight forwarding side that I thought was interesting, is that you were able basically to purchase your capacity at better rates which would seem to fly in the face of, we've got rate strength in the international markets. Is it more on the ocean side, is it more customs side, or is it just that you are able to fully pass on price increases to customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we think one of the real opportunities, Jeff, for us, is to take advantage of this very unique business model we have, where we are both an airline and a very large freight forwarder. And one of our top priorities over the last six to nine months has been really perfecting our buy rate capabilities and knowing when to use our network and when to buy capacity. With the softness in Asia, especially because of the Chinese New Year, there were some opportunities to do some spot buys at attractive rates. So if you're opportunistic and you've got comprehensive systems and you can look at alternative ways to get goods to move, there's some real opportunities to get good margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the follow-up question here is just on the buybacks. I guess, given how good the first quarter cash flows were and how well you actually did in 2009, I realize there's uncertainty in the world, but I would think that you're buyback would be a lot more aggressive. And I'm just kind of curious what holds you back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we guided to a fairly substantial increase, up to $2 billion for the year. We increased the dividend almost 11%. Having said that, Bill, I think you're correct that the cash flow outlook is strong even with all those distributions, our forecasts are for an increase in cash balance and we'll continue to look at that. But right now, we're executing around what we guided and we did purchase about 25% of the annual amount. We do some of it, we're doing systematically and some opportunistically and will continue that way.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Thompson, Davis &amp; Co. And thank you very much. I heard your favorable comments about Forwarding and the Supply Chain Solutions divisional profits. But assuming that the Freight division sort of broke even versus a loss a year ago, there wasn't a lot of growth in earnings in the Supply Chain business. What happened there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think that's true. No. We saw significant improvements in both fronts. Our Forwarding Group increased and we did see good improvements in our Freight. David, you're correct. The UPS Freight segment overall was approximately break even. It had a really great March, which had a little better weather, but the flexibility of LTL isn't as much as package so we did see some headwinds in January and February but overall the segment is up 44% and our forwarding unit did see substantial improvements in margins versus last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The LTL didn't lose $40 million last year's first quarter. It was much less than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're optimistic about the forwarding operations in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are. We think we've got the global network put together, we're continuing to enhance our forwarding capabilities. We're expanding cold chain capabilities as we target the health care market and there's clearly a lot of opportunity for high-quality forwarding with temperature control capabilities. So there's a lot of ways we think we can continue to differentiate our forwarding capabilities across the globe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is on the other operating expenses. Outside of fuel, which we know why that was up more than the rest of them, repairs and maintenance was up significantly more than the others. Is there any weather impact in the repairs and maintenance line? Or is that because the fleet's getting a little bit older? Are you due for some normal maintenance checks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's not atypical for us to see repair and maintenance jump in a quarter or two and this is primarily driven by engines and airplanes maintenance there. That will vary by quarter based on timing of C-checks and those type of things. So nothing out of line there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if you look at the UPS Freight segment with yields up high single digits, can you give us a little bit of a breakdown in terms of how much of that was maybe fuel surcharge? How much was mix related and how much pure pricing is going up in the LTL market for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fuel was a little more than half of the 8.5% revenue per hundred weight. So ,we still had very good solid base rate improvements. And so we think we're striking a really good balance of steady prudent growth and also very firm yields. So we're pleased with the progress we're making. We continue to show great results in broadening our market share, especially in the middle market and aligning our capabilities so customers can move back and forth between freight and small package.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. We heard your comments regarding weather's impact on volume, 2 percentage points at Domestic Package. Is there any way to quantify the incremental cost you guys saw during the quarter from weather?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was weather and the timing of Easter.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we really haven't broken out the cost, although certainly there was some. As I said, probably the net operational impact was greater in freight than in package. Our package network is highly flexible. But we did see demand impact and our sense is that will ripple through into Q1 GDP estimates that will be coming out shortly. So it was a headwind for cost, but it was a balanced mix of both a revenue reduction and some additional increase in expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We got your guide for '11 at Supply Chain and Freight all in with respect to the revenue growth. Any chance you want to provide some color on the op margins at that division in '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do think it will continue to show moderate improvements in margins and we feel pretty good about the progress on that. Clearly, we're not going to show 44% improvements every quarter. The comps to last year were a little easier, frankly, this quarter. They'll be a little tougher in the second quarter. We think in general we're going to see good solid upper single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. You guys commented a couple times on trends in Asia. I wonder if you could develop or build on that a little bit? Just what you have seen particularly in March and April as we came out of the Chinese New Year holiday and if we've seen strengthening in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are seeing strengthening.  I think January and February started off a little bit slow due to the factory closure in China, but I think March has strengthened. April is staying strong. The unknown right now obviously is the impact to Supply Chain from Japan. Right now, it's not had a big impact to our volume and revenue numbers but as we go forward, it could be a bigger impact overall to the economy. I heard a lot of things yesterday, I think Johnson Controls mentioned that &#x2013; a big reduction in parts imports for them from Japan going forward.</p>
          <p>So I think clearly you're going to see an impact on the automotive sector. The technology is unknown at this point in time. It's really hard to see. There's lots of rumors of parts shortages. At UPS, we're a big procurer of technology. We've not seen shortages at this point in time. So, could have an impact. But overall, we're seeing pretty good strength out of Asia and global trade should stay strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the back of that ,when you think about your guidance for the full year, marrying in the price of fuel and what we're seeing out of Asia, I'm guessing. Could you just give a little bit of color what your underlying assumption is there, particularly as it relates to fuel? And what we're seeing as Japan, have you included anything in your forecast as you look forward? I know you mentioned domestic is a bit of the driver for the increase going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really have not factored in an explicit Japan impact. We've looked at that and you can come up with numerous positives and negatives. I mean we have seen some customers reaching out to us to help them relocate their distribution capabilities. So depending on how it ripples through the supply chain there may be movement from ocean to air. Certainly there is going to be some demand destruction. So with the Japan factor we've really not explicitly quantified.</p>
          <p>We have estimated fuel to be somewhere, $105, maybe a little more than that for the year.  So there's maybe a little exposure there. But remember that the big issue for us on fuel is rapid change. So when it moves rapidly as it has this year, we do suffer a two month lag and certainly, April has a headwind because we're overlapping February's and then early March's increase. But if that stabilizes, even at its current level, then there shouldn't be too much downside risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have factored in our GDP baseline, we've knocked it down a couple of tenths of a point, primarily due to fuel. As we've said before fuel running about $105, $110 a barrel will probably have a couple of tenths impact on the impact on global and U.S. GDP this year.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the expansion of your Asia-Europe air bridge, can you say bit more about the reasons for expanding at this time? For example has there been a particular shift in capacity put on TNT, DHL or another competitor? And then just as a sort of follow-up can you give us a bit more color on the mix between heavier freight and parcels? Is this additional activity more freight forwarding than parcels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Robin, let me start with the second half of your question first. The separation in our reporting is pretty clean. Our international export growth is definitely package growth. So that's 7% plus we showed was legitimate small and medium-size packages. The freight really shows up elsewhere. So that even though we do see in the U.S. a fairly significant difference between the freight growth and the small package, the spread is not as great internationally, although, that's probably a company specific story.</p>
          <p>We did decide to add those direct flights from Hong Kong and really exercise our structural advantage after seeing that a number of competitors did, frankly. And we do have the capability of linking Asia to Europe in a way that no one else does. And so it did seem that it was an appropriate way. We put up with our 747 direct flight, and it's operating very well, and we're seeing good demand for that. So it's both matching some competitive challenges but also raising the bar and we're comfortable to do that when the returns are there.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Scott and Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. One is and I sense obviously, the competitive environment is fairly benign and you have a lot of noise in the volume numbers in first quarter. Are you at all worried that maybe there's some share loss seeping in on the ground side, because obviously, that number is a bit weaker than I would have expected, understanding there is weather and some noise there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Scott, I wouldn't characterize the market as benign. The market is extremely competitive. Customers have multiple choices, and so we're out there competing like crazy. The comparisons to our competitors are a little confusing because some of them use a different calendar. FedEx, for example, had the December in their last quarter, which makes comparisons a little unusual. And we haven't heard yet from the Post Office, which is another very large player. We suspect they'll show negative results. We do think the economy was a little softer. We're certainly watching carefully, and we think over the longer term, it's been clear that we've been able to maintain share and our expectation is we'll continue to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the other question is, and I know, obviously, from a soft first quarter, things should improve. But I'm just wondering with some of the potential depressing effects of oil and, obviously, you could argue about one-year impacts or two-year impacts but it comes in a lag basis, and government cutbacks and some of the other impacts, maybe of the euro on exports. Why do you feel, other than sort of a pickup from 1Q, that there might not be some softness as we go a little bit later with some of those impacts that may lag a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, you're right. There are a lot of clouds out there between Japan and gasoline prices near $4 and tightening in China. But there's a lot of positives out there also. I think if you look back at the Fed funds are still near zero, very accommodative. Credit conditions, as I mentioned earlier, are improving for small and medium-sized businesses. Emerging markets are likely to continue to drive growth. I think profits are strong, corporate balance sheets are strong, and you're seeing great numbers and the good IP numbers and good retail numbers. So there are some risks out there but I think there's an awful lot of strengths also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will the euro strengthening at all hurt your European export business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It certainly hasn't to date. We just showed strong growth there and obviously ought to get better U.S. exports with a weak dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually, the strongest area we're actually seeing is Europe to Asia, where the comparisons aren't as difficult. Scott, maybe just to put an edge on this, we did increase our guidance for the year. It's not based on an estimate of increased demand across the globe. What it really is based on is our increased confidence in the UPS business model to adapt to conditions and to continue to generate good economic results. So it's more an affirmation that we feel the company is operating well than that the global economy has got a lot of upside. We're not gloomy on where the world is heading but we're also cautious, but we're confident that we can adapt to conditions as they occur.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy. This past quarter presented significant challenges for many companies across the globe. It reminds me of something our founder, Jim Casey, said way back in 1947. He said, "Determined people make conditions; they do not allow themselves to be victims of them." His observation more than 60 years ago still rings true today. UPS did not write the quarter off when faced with challenging conditions. We rose to the occasion and demonstrated the resilience and flexibility of UPS, and it's evidenced in the results that we announced today.</p>
