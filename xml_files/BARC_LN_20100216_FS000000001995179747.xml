        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Good morning, and welcome to this presentation of the Barclays Preliminary Results of 2009. Some of you may have seen that I made a statement this morning about the decision of John Varley and Bob Diamond to waive a bonus for 2009, despite the exceptional results that we published today. Simply to say that I'm going to be here throughout this session and will be happy later to answer any questions you may have on this subject.</p>
          <p>But as for the results, the plan is that there will be presentations from Chris Lucas, our Group Finance Director; from Robert Le Blanc, our Group Risk Director. And we'll conclude with a presentation by John Varley, our Group Chief Executive. And just to set the time context, we expect the presentations will come in at under the hour. But we will hope and plan to wrap up the whole section by 11. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you, Marcus. 2009 was a year of a great deal of activity of Barclays. We've transformed our Investment Banking platform. We continue to build out our Global Equities and M&amp;A businesses.</p>
          <p>In Retail and Commercial banking, we've grown income and actively managed costs to mitigate the impact of market conditions. We sold Barclay's Global Investors and retained a stake in BlackRock. And we've taken very significant steps to increase capital, produce leverage and boost liquidity.</p>
          <p>You can see the outcome of all this activity in the results that we've announced this morning. We delivered profit of &#xA3;5.3 billion, excluding a &#xA3;6.3 billion gain on the BGI transaction; and underlying profit more than trebled.</p>
          <p>This resulted from a very strong income growth of 34%, well ahead of cost growth. At the same time, our core Tier 1 ratio almost doubled to 10%, adjusted gross leverage reduced to 20 times and we've trebled our liquidity pool to &#xA3;127 billion.</p>
          <p>As you know, we announced a new structure for the business in November. We're reporting numbers under the old structure today, and we'll issue a restatement in the end of March. In general, my comments compare our results for the full year with those of the previous financial year.</p>
          <p>If I look at how we performed on underlying basis after reversing out all gains on acquisitions and disposals, as well as movements on own credit and gains on debt buybacks, profits more than trebled to &#xA3;5.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Group performance in more detail, income grew 34% to &#xA3;31 billion and cost growth was lower than income growth at 24%. Discretionary cash compensation in 2009 was &#xA3;1.5 billion. And in addition, we've made long-term awards of &#xA3;1.2 billion, which will vest over a three-year period subject to clawback.</p>
          <p>Impairment grew 49% to &#xA3;8.1 billion. The cost/income ratio improved from 62 to 58%. Earnings per share increased from 0.59 to &#xA3;0.86, and the return on equity was 24% including the BGI gain. Excluding that gain it was 8%, reflecting higher levels of capital retained within the business.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the divisional performance, income in Global Retail and Commercial Banking grew 7% in a difficult operating environment. We reported profits of &#xA3;2.5 billion, despite ongoing margin compression and an increase in impairment of &#xA3;5.4 billion. The cost/income ratio improved by one percentage point to 52%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the individual businesses in GRCB, U.K. Retail Banking delivered profits of &#xA3;612 million. Deposit margin compression resulted in downward pressure of &#xA3;755 million net of hedging. Impairment growth of &#xA3;334 million was mostly in Consumer Lending. As you can see from the slide, we've worked hard to mitigate the impact of margin compression by actively managing both income and costs.</p>
          <p>Overall costs decreased 3%, despite continuing investment in the branch network. We've refurbished 148 branches during the year, bringing the total number refurbished since 2005 to more than 800. This investment is enabling us to drive customer and business growth despite the difficult environment. Year-on-year the number of savings accounts grew 10% from 12 million to just over 13 million, and our Premier customers increased by almost 40% to 735,000.</p>
          <p>The number of customers in local business increased 4% to 686,000. Total loans and advances grew 5% to just over &#xA3;99 billion. Within this, gross new mortgage lending totaled &#xA3;14.2 billion, including net new lending of &#xA3;5.7 billion. We wrote new business without compromising our risk profile. Mortgage impairment charges were &#xA3;26 million, or three basis points on an &#xA3;88 billion book.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Commercial Bank, income of &#xA3;2.75 billion was broadly in-line with last year. Profits declined to &#xA3;749 million as a result of increased impairment and margin compression.</p>
          <p>We've actively managed the business to mitigate the impact of these factors. Asset-driven income and increased fee income compensated for the impact of margin compression. Spending was well controlled and costs declined 3%. Impairment grew by &#xA3;560 million, reflecting continued pressure on corporate liquidity, rising default rates and lower asset values.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we benefited from a well diversified loan book with relatively low exposure to property and leveraged finance. New term lending was &#xA3;14 billion. And while at year-end the balances were down, average lending grew 3%. Average deposits also grew 3% to &#xA3;49 billion.</p>
          <p>At Barclaycard profits of &#xA3;761 million were the result of income growth of 26%, driven by an increase in customer balances and lower funding costs. As well as the benefit from dollar/sterling exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Income growth was offset by an increase in impairment of &#xA3;700 million. More than half this increase was in the International businesses, reflecting higher delinquencies as well as the impact of exchange rates. Delinquency trends in both the U.S. and the U.K. stabilized during the second half despite rising unemployment. This was the result of early intervention to help customers in financial difficulty manage their payments, as well as tightened approval criteria.</p>
          <p>Profits in Western Europe of &#xA3;130 million included a gain of &#xA3;157 million from the sale of a stake in our Spanish Life and Pensions business. As well as a &#xA3;67 million operating loss in Russia and a restructuring charge of &#xA3;24 million, mainly in Spain.</p>
          <p>Income grew 18% to &#xA3;1.7 billion with growth across all five countries, as a result of expanding our distribution network and customer base in recent years. We now serve 2.8 million customers in Western Europe with well over &#xA3;70 billion in total customer assets and liabilities.</p>
          <p>Costs grew 16%, largely as a result of ongoing investment in the distribution network. We've added another 137 distribution points during 2009, mostly in Italy and Portugal, bringing the total number in Western Europe to just over 1,300. The cost/income ratio improved one percentage point to 65%. Impairment charges grew by &#xA3;317 million year-on-year. About two-thirds of this growth was in Spain in our Property and Construction portfolios.</p>
          <p>In GRCB Emerging Markets, income grew 5% to just over &#xA3;1 billion. This income growth was well balanced between Retail and Commercial and was broadly based except in India, where income fell as a result of reduced lending.</p>
          <p>Our mature businesses in Africa, Mauritius and the Seychelles, generated a significant profit. Costs in GRCB Emerging Markets grew 24% as a result of investment in infrastructure. Impairment grew to &#xA3;471 million, mostly in the UAE and India. And taken together, this resulted in a loss in Emerging Markets of &#xA3;254 million.</p>
          <p>In GRCB Absa profits in sterling were down 8% to &#xA3;506 million. Income increased 16%, reflecting average appreciation in the value of the rand against sterling. Cost growth was lower than income growth at 13%. Impairment charges grew by &#xA3;220 million to &#xA3;567 million, driven mainly by delinquencies in Retail Banking.</p>
          <p>Against the backdrop of challenging economic conditions in South Africa, we're controlling lending carefully and focusing on growing customer deposits, which increased 16%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Investment Banking and Investment Management and starting with Barclays Capital, where profits almost doubled to &#xA3;2.5 billion; driven by very strong income growth in the U.K. and Europe. As well as our transformed scale and service offering in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Top line income at Barclay's Capital grew to &#xA3;17.9 billion. Fourth quarter top line income was &#xA3;3.6 billion, which is a strong performance relative to this sector. Total income was &#xA3;11.6 billion, and taking into account credit market losses, losses on own credit and impairment, net income more than trebled to &#xA3;9 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at a breakdown of top line income, fixed income currency and commodities drove income growth of 76% to &#xA3;13 billion. Equities and Prime Services more than doubled to &#xA3;2.8 billion, with an especially strong performance in cash equities and equity derivatives. And revenues in the Investment Banking, which includes underwriting as well as advisory services, doubled to &#xA3;2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Income growth was broadly based. There are now six businesses producing annual revenues of over &#xA3;1 billion. 44% of the top line income came from U.S., and there was very strong income growth across the U.K., Europe and the U.S. during the year. Increased income reflected growth in client base as well as strengthened client relationships. The number of clients generating revenues of more &#xA3;10 million grew by 38% to over 230.</p>
          <p>Total credit market exposures reduced by &#xA3;22 billion. This includes net sales and pay downs of &#xA3;11.7 billion, at or close to our marks, as well as growth write-downs of &#xA3;6.1 billion, and foreign exchange and other movements of &#xA3;4.2 billion.</p>
          <p>As you know, we sold &#xA3;5.1 billion of credit market exposures and &#xA3;2.4 billion of other assets of Protium Finance during the year. We provided a loan of &#xA3;7.5 billion to Protium to fund this purchase, and we're reporting the loan plus accrued interest within our credit market disclosures.</p>
          <p>Costs grew to &#xA3;6.6 billion reflecting the full-year impact of the Lehman acquisition and the build out of our equities and M&amp;A businesses.</p>
          <p>The cost-to-net income ratio improved to 73%. Headcount at the end of the year was 23,200, which is broadly similar to the end of 2008. Compensation costs represented 38% of total income, a decrease of six percentage points.</p>
          <p>We continue to manage our cost base carefully, and our goal is a cost-to-net income ratio in the lower half of a 65 to 75% range. We completed the sale of BGI to BlackRock on December the 1st  and reported a 26% increase in profits to &#xA3;748 million, including a recovery in the cost of support to liquidity funds. As well as the impact of the dollar/sterling exchange rates.</p>
          <p>And total client assets grew 4% to over &#xA3;150 billion with net new assets inflows of seven &#x2013; sorry of &#xA3;3 billion. Underlying profits declined 24% as roughly for salary close like business in 2008 and integrating the Barclays Wealth in that too.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Wealth income was broadly in-line with 2008, and total client assets grew 4% to over &#xA3;150 billion with net new assets inflows of seven &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; of &#xA3;3 billion. Underlying profits declined 24% adjusting for the sale of the Closed Life business in 2008 and the integration of Barclays Wealth Americas.</p>
          <p>Barclays Wealth is now accelerating investment in people and technology. We intend to make an additional &#xA3;350 million of investment over the next five years, resulting in moderated growth expectations initially, followed by accelerated growth after 2012.</p>
          <p>Our geographic focus will be on large wealth pools in the U.K. and the U.S., as well as in the high-growth global markets, which will serve from existing hubs in London, Geneva and Singapore.</p>
          <p>At Head Office we reported a loss before tax of &#xA3;550 million compared to a loss of &#xA3;858 million in 2008. Net interest income declined by &#xA3;689 million as a result of additional costs of funding arising from the dislocation in the money markets, especially in the first half. Increased liquidity requirements and reduced income on shareholders' funds in the low-interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Other income increased by &#xA3;1.2 billion, as a result of net gains from debt exchanges completed during the year. Costs include the impact of the U.K. bonus tax, which resulted in a charge of &#xA3;190 million relating to discretionary cash awards in 2009. As well as an additional &#xA3;35 million relating to certain prior awards, which may forward in the scope of the legislation.</p>
          <p>GRCB and Barclays Wealth deposit margins continued to come under pressure in a low interest rate environment, falling to 131 basis points compared to 172 in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our structural hedge produced a benefit of &#xA3;1.4 billion, mitigating more than 50% of gross compression. We expect the rolling nature of the hedge program to continue to protect us against the impact of lower base rates going forward. The expense of the benefit will depend on the evolution of the yield curve.</p>
          <p>We've been able to increase asset margins from 207 basis points to 236 basis points. And overall, net interest margin across GRCB and Wealth increased from 207 to 211 basis points. Managing the balance sheet was a key priority in 2009, and we've reduced total assets by one-third year-on-year. The majority of this came from a decrease in derivative assets. The reduction in loans and advances was largely in Barclays Capital, especially in relation to financial institutions. We were still able to extend &#xA3;35 billion of new loans in the U.K. during the year, despite reducing the size of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Looking at balance sheet leverage excluding the derivatives gross up, assets under management, settlement balances and goodwill; adjusted gross leverage improved from 28 times to 20 times year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The derivatives gross up represents receivables and payables with the same counterparties, which is subject to netting agreement under U.S. GAAP. We've worked with our counterparties throughout the year to eliminate offsetting contracts at no cost and with no capital impact. This has contributed to the reduction in derivatives gross up of well over &#xA3;500 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to look at our capital position, our risk-weighted assets reduced by 12% to &#xA3;383 billion with the bulk of that reduction coming from Barclay's Capital. Currency movements contributed 28% of this reduction. Our core Tier 1 ratio almost doubled to 10%, and our Tier 1 ratio reached 13% as we retained earnings of &#xA3;9.6 billion.</p>
          <p>There's a slide showing the breakdown of the increase in core Tier 1 capital in the appendix. After resuming dividend payments in the third quarter, we announced a final dividend of 1.5 pence a share this morning, bringing the total payment for the year to 2.5 pence per share.</p>
          <p>Turning now to liquidity. We've improved our profile this year by trebling the size of our liquidity grew to &#xA3;127 billion by improving our loan-to-deposit ratio from 138 to 130% by actively managing the profile of maturing financing. And by extending the maturity profile of our unsecured wholesale funding. Only Absa and Barclays Capital have any reliance on wholesale funding. Barclays Capital has borne its additional funding costs caused by market dislocation, and has increased the average term of outstanding net unsecured liabilities from 14 to 26 months during the year.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, the results we announced this morning are the outcome of a great deal of activity. We've delivered profits of &#xA3;5.3 billion, excluding the gain on the BGI transaction; and underlying profit more than trebled. The performance resulted from very strong income growth of 34%, well ahead of cost growth. At the same time, our core Tier 1 ratio increased to 10%, adjusted gross leverage reduced to 20 times and our liquidity pool trebled to &#xA3;127 billion. Taken together, we believe these results place us in a strong position going forward.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to hand over to Robert to discuss our management of risk in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. Good morning. I'm going to review impairment across Barclays in 2009 and look at trends in our main portfolios. I'll also cover market risk and our outlook for this year. At this time last year, I gave you our planning assumptions for 2009 impairment.</p>
          <p>We could see that credit conditions were declining rapidly in many countries, as economies slowed and unemployment picked up. We expected the Group's loan loss rate in 2009 to rise to between 130 and 150 basis points.</p>
          <p>And I explained that this planning was based on three broad assumptions; that economies performed at consensus levels with steady FX rates and a constant balance sheet. By the half year the major economies were weaker than expected. And we updated you that full-year impairment could move higher.</p>
          <p>We saw some improvement in impairment trends during the fourth quarter, and our full-year loan loss rate came in at 135 basis points on a comparable basis. The improvement in the last quarter was driven by a good performance in the wholesale books where we avoided large, single-name losses as well as better trends in the retail books. I'll take a few minutes now to explain how those impairment trends developed.</p>
          <p>Total loan impairment in '09 was 7.4 billion. And with the 700 million charge against available for-sale assets, total impairment was 8.1 billion. The 7.4 billion gives an observed loan loss rate of 156 basis points using the actual balance sheet and FX rates.</p>
          <p>We believe impairment for Barclays will peak well below the level we saw at the height of the property crisis in the early '90s. Barclays has a strong institutional memory of that experience and has worked hard to protect our portfolios from the effects of severe credit stress.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the 2009 impairment across broad business groups. Beginning with our U.K. and International Retail portfolios, where I said a year ago that we expected a large increase in credit losses. In the U.K., higher unemployment have fed through to increased delinquency and charge-off rates in Cards and Loans.</p>
          <p>The International trend reflects the more difficult credit conditions in areas like the U.S. and Spain, as well as portfolio maturation. As a result, the Retail loan loss rate moved up to above 180 basis points.</p>
          <p>In BarCap we said we expected impairment against credit market exposures to decline, and that happened in the second half. Impairment on BarCap's loan portfolio increased as we expected, although this was moderated because we've not been hit by the significant single-name losses that affected the industry.</p>
          <p>Impairment increased in Commercial Lending in the U.K. with further deterioration across the portfolios. And the charge in our International Commercial portfolios also rose, which in scale is about 7% of Group impairment. At a result of these trends, we've seen a rise in the wholesale loan loss rate to just over 130 basis points. This shows how Group impairment allowances have grown.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we increased our impairment reserves by more than &#xA3;4 billion to almost 11 billion. That 64% increase has built up a significant buffer of impairment allowances across all Credit categories. To see how those higher reserves increase our coverage ratios, we divide the book into three categories.</p>
          <p>Looking across all the Retail Mortgage books, the ratio of impairment stock &#x2013; pardon me &#x2013; to Credit Risk loans increased during 2009 driven by the International books, and is consistent with the fallen house prices in those markets. In our Corporate Loan portfolios including credit market exposures, the coverage ratios also increased, as we adjusted our severity models given credit conditions last year.</p>
          <p>And in our other Retail books, mostly the unsecured portfolios, we have increased coverage to match the declining recovery rates. To compare coverage ratios across banks you do need to look at the detail of these different categories. These three coverage levels are fully appropriate at this point in the cycle for the severity rates we expect in these challenging credit conditions.</p>
          <p>Looking across these three categories, the Group coverage ratio increased from 42 to 48% during the year.</p>
          <p>Now I want to review some portfolio trends. Let's begin with our U.K. Mortgage business. We have a mortgage book of almost &#xA3;90 billion, and our asset quality remains very solid. Our rate of arrears increased only slightly during the 2009 and remains well below the industry average. Our mortgage impairment charge increased by only &#xA3;2 million last year, and our loan loss rate remained very low at three basis points as we maintained our very strong credit profile.</p>
          <p>At the end of '09, our average loan-to-value in the U.K. was 43%, and of more than 830,000 mortgages we had less than 200 properties in possession.</p>
          <p>To show you portfolio trends in our main unsecured books in the U.K., we've combined Cards and Loans. The balance sheet has remained steady across the year, as we've continue to make credit available.</p>
          <p>In U.K. Cards, we have managed down limits in higher risk and dormant accounts, and improved the quality of new lending. And in U.K. Loans, we've been controlling risk by originating almost 100% of our new loans from our existing banking customers.</p>
          <p>Those loans that have been delinquent from more than 90 days have increased slightly year-over-year to about 2.1% of the portfolio. As assets flow through our book, there's been a reduction in the roll rate coming through to later-stage delinquency. The annual charge operate increased during the year from bankruptcies and other factors, but was steadier in the second half.</p>
          <p>Let's look at delinquency in U.K. Cards, as an example of what is driving current impairment trends. I want to explain that you cannot forecast impairment trends only by looking at total delinquency levels or accounting impairment numbers.</p>
          <p>As we entered 2009, we had expected early-cycle delinquency to continue to decrease as we improved our credit quality on new underwriting and through better collections processes. And as we expected, late-cycle delinquency has increased from 1.4 to 1.9% as more cases have rolled through because of the economic slowdown and higher unemployment.</p>
          <p>As a result, overall delinquency levels have been steady. However, the increase in late-cycle delinquency is important because that is where the impairment charge is much higher. And that has led to the higher loan loss rate, even though total delinquency is the same.</p>
          <p>So the point is that late-cycle delinquency trends are very important in driving impairment. We therefore need to see a steady trend and then a decrease before we see a material reduction in impairment charges. At the moment we see stabilization, and we believe that late-cycle trends will improve from here.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the U.S. Card portfolios. You will remember that the portfolio grew in the second half of '08 after a large partnership acquisition. In early '09 we again tightened credit criteria and reduced balances, particularly in the more risky Open Market segment. And our growth since then has been almost entirely in the lower-risk partnership channel, where we are seeing good income growth.</p>
          <p>We've been conservative in our credit models over the last two years by using very high stress levels of future unemployment to help protect our lending criteria. As a result, 90-day delinquency started to level off in the second half as flows into delinquency have slowed. And we are seeing improvements in the level of payments and the number of accounts in arrears. These trends will take some time to work through to charge-off rates, which have risen as U.S. unemployment has continued to increase.</p>
          <p>Moving to the U.K. Commercial Bank, we said a year ago that lower business activity and lower asset values would put pressure on the portfolio. And Credit Risk loans rose 45% in the first half as a result of the more difficult operating conditions for companies, although we are reassured that the growth in CRLs slowed significantly in the second half.</p>
          <p>The loan loss rate has increased, mainly for two reasons. First the denominator is smaller because companies have reduced leverage and conserved, lowering the demand for credit and reducing our loan balances. And because the stress on corporate cash flow has caused impairment to move higher. For many years, we have avoided concentrations in high-risk areas like Commercial Property Lending. So our impairment in that sector was only &#xA3;50 million last year.</p>
          <p>In Barclays Capital, Credit Risk loans increased quickly during '08. However, '09 was better with a small increase in the first half and a flat second half as credit conditions steadied.</p>
          <p>The BarCap loan loss rate fell in the second half as impairment dropped by over &#xA3;1 billion from the first to the second half. With lower charges across BarCap's credit market exposures, the available for-sale assets and the traditional loan portfolio. This decline from the first half was the key driver of the stronger impairment performance by the Group in the second half.</p>
          <p>Looking at GRCB's International business &#x2013; and here I'm combining Retail and Wholesale &#x2013; CRLs have continued to increase with the largest rises in Spanish Wholesale and South African Retail portfolios; in-line with the weaker conditions in those countries.</p>
          <p>Following a large increase in the first half, impairment and loan loss rates were more stable in the second, half as Wholesale and Retail trends began to stabilize across most International portfolios.</p>
          <p>Single-name corporate losses are important drivers of impairment. In general, the low level of single-name losses in our Wholesale portfolios has been a benefit to us in '09. The largest single-name corporate loss in BarCap was &#xA3;109 million, and the average of the next 10 losses was 34 million.</p>
          <p>Across all of our business with smaller corporates, we keep single-name exposures low; and the largest losses were in-line with those portfolios. We know that the risk of corporate failure normally remains high, even as economies recover. So we remain cautious about the outlook for single-name losses 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning now to market risk. I want to update you on the number of positive daily revenue days at Barclays Capital. This is the 2008 distribution, which includes fees and commissions and shows that even in the turbulent markets of 2008 the large majority of business days were positive. In 2009 BarCap client flows increased again; and an even larger majority of business days were profitable, demonstrating the extent and the value of that client franchise.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the 2009 performance in even more detail. Daily Value at Risk was higher early in the year and then declined gradually as our management of client flows resulted in more moderate levels of risk. Although VaR is reported as a positive number, it is of course the possibility of a loss that would concern us. And so we always look at the mirror image of VaR to show the possible expected downside. When we look at actual income from risk positions in DVaR we track those days where income gain or loss on any day is more than 25% VaR.</p>
          <p>Two things are clear. We remained well within risk limits during 2009. And there were only a few days when we made a loss of more than 25% of VaR, and no days when we made a loss greater than VaR. The majority of days were positive with an average daily income of &#xA3;34 million. And these figures do not include the extra revenue from fees and commissions, which would bring the daily average up to &#xA3;71 million and which drove the &#xA3;18 billion of top line income at BarCap.</p>
          <p>This positive daily income pattern shows that BarCap's trading profitability is driven by its client franchise contributing steadily to income. BarCap continues to grow revenue faster than risk. And this performance is only possible because BarCap is client-driven, relying on business flow; not on proprietary trading.</p>
          <p>Before I finish, let me look quickly at two measures that show our risk-adjusted performance. We focus on the stability of our earnings stream, tracking revenue relative to volatility of that revenue.</p>
          <p>In this chart, we show a ratio of revenue-to-risk for BarCap. This is a simplified Sharpe ratio using monthly revenue divided by the standard deviation within each month and grouping these results into averages for the half-year periods.</p>
          <p>To make the comparison, we start back in '05. At that point we saw good revenues and lower volatility, and the trend was positive. And as we went into the difficult period of '07 and '08, we would expect that trend to drop as revenues decreased and as volatility of revenues was greater during that period.</p>
          <p>We've seen an improvement in early '09 and an even better performance in the second half of '09, as revenue streams rebuilt and volatility decreased. This shows two things. That BarCap's quality of earning in '09 has rebounded very well; and that BarCap's client franchise is driving a risk-adjusted performance, even better than we saw during the years before the financials crisis.</p>
          <p>This is the way I look at risk-adjusted performance across all of Barclays. The white line is the annual income, and it shows that the Group has generated strong income over many years. The yellow line is impairment as a percentage of total income, which remained within a narrowband during those years.</p>
          <p>We look ahead through stress testing to estimate our credit performance in severe and extreme conditions. For 2009 we estimated that in a severe stress, our impairment would be 23% of income. And in an extreme stress, we estimated that impairment could be as much as 38% of income. And we manage our portfolios to control our risk in those conditions.</p>
          <p>In '08 and '09, actual impairment increased significantly. But our performance during these very difficult credit conditions remained within the ranges of our stress estimates. And during this time, income again increased significantly. Even our 2008 income level would have adequately covered our impairment charges. And our very strong 2009 income provided an even larger buffer against the higher credit losses. This shows me that Barclays' risk-adjusted performance was resilient even through the down cycle; and that going forward as conditions return to more normalized level, we will see further improvement.</p>
          <p>Now let's look forward this year across our main markets. The consensus view is for moderate economic growth and for interest rates to remain low. House prices are expected to be more stable, and unemployment to remain at recent high levels. Of course, these economic factors are very important for credit conditions and for our planning work on impairments levels.</p>
          <p>Last year we shared with you our planning range for loan loss rates because we expected a very significant shift in impairment levels. This year, although the rate of change will be much less, we will again give you some guidance. Based on the central economic views I've described and based on the trends in our portfolios, we expect to see four things.</p>
          <p>I expect a gradual improvement in Retail Credit trends to continue. And that Wholesale Credit trends will stabilize and begin to improve later in the year. We also expect credit market exposure and available for-sale impairment to be lower again in 2010. And we expect single-name corporate losses to remain difficult to predict, as you would expect in these conditions.</p>
          <p>To form an overall view for impairment in 2010, we should keep in mind that last year impairment dropped about 20% from the first half to the second half, as BarCap impairment improved significantly. My view now is that across the Group, we are past the worst and have now seen the turning point in impairment. Therefore, I expect a moderate decline in impairment year-on-year from '09 to 2010. But not as fast as the 20% drop we saw from the first half to the second half last year.</p>
          <p>Economic conditions are still fragile, but on track for recovery across many regions. And as this continues, I believe that the risk-adjusted performance of Barclays will continue to improve in many areas; and overall will begin to move towards more normalized levels.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll now hand over to John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robert. Good morning. Chris has described the main components of our 2009 financial performance, and you've just heard from Robert about risk. My intention is mostly to look forward this morning. But before I do that, I want to start with two points of perspective. And I also want to show you how've performed versus the scorecard for 2009 that we gave you a year ago.</p>
          <p>Perspectives. First when I reflect on the last three years, I am struck by how often we've had to make explicit choices about which path to follow. The signposts haven't always been clear, and the consequence of taking the wrong path might have been bad. At the Board and at the Executive Committee, we thought carefully about those choices. And it would candidly have been easy to be fatalistic about them. But we decided in 2007 that we must impose our will on the course of events to be extent that we could.</p>
          <p>Second, the objective of a bank is to generate returns for shareholders. But banks can and should, in ways consistent with that objective, contribute to the well-being of society by conducting their business responsibly. And by performing well, on behalf of their customers, their core functions of payments and money transmission, safe storage of deposits, maturity transmission and lending. And the provision of advice and execution in underwriting and trading.</p>
          <p>These activities lie at the heart of every modern economy. And if economies are to grow with all the beneficial consequences that flow from that, then banks must help their customers take appropriate risks. A key differentiating factor in the performance of banks has been their ability to understand and manage risk. And managing risk was a big part of our focus last year; a strategic risk, business risk and financial risk.</p>
          <p>The 2009 scorecard is on the screen now. On the strategic front, we did the BlackRock transaction. We moved quickly to build out our European and Asian equities and M&amp;A businesses before last year's hiring in the capital markets gathered pace. And we acquired the Credit Card business in Portugal. We entered a joint venture in Life Assurance in Spain, Portugal and Italy with CNP. And we acquired Standard Life Bank in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Operationally, we try to be conservative. Managing capital stood out like a beacon of necessity. In the areas of capital and liquidity, we made a lot of progress during 2009 anticipating the requirements of central banks and supervisors. And thereby positioning us well to accommodate the further changes that are coming.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, 2009 demonstrated our ability to create equity by profit generation and to strengthen capital ratios and/or absorb regulatory impacts by managing the balance sheet tightly. We put the pursuit of returns before growth. We reduced the size of the balance sheet and we reduced leverage.</p>
          <p>An explicit objective in growing our distribution network has been deposit gathering. In 2009 we improved our loan-to-deposit ratio, largely due to a net increase of &#xA3;15 billion in GRCB's deposits. We said that we'd manage the relationship between income growth and cost growth carefully, and we produced jaws of 10% for the year. So 2009 was a year of more income, more profit but less risk in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>One postscript on last year. You'll remember that we committed to make an additional &#xA3;11 billion of credit available to the U.K. economy. We actually lent an additional 35 billion; about half to households and half to businesses. And we supported more business start-ups in 2009 and for many years.</p>
          <p>You need clear objectives during a crisis. Ours have been staying close to customers and clients, managing our risks and maintaining strategic momentum. These objectives remain completely appropriate for 2010 as well. I believe that the steadiness of our profit performance during the crisis is largely attributable to the diversification of income that we worked at during the last years. Not least because it's enabled us to absorb the significant increase in write-downs and impairment, but are consequences of the credit crunch and the economic slowdown.</p>
          <p>The history of the last 20 years has revealed on many occasions the benefits of having a Capital Markets business, and a Retail and Commercial Banking business in the same group. The asymmetry of their income and impairment cycles is often a source of risk diversification and resilience. So we're seeing that again in this cycle. This is one of the benefits of running a universal banking business.</p>
          <p>In November we announced several changes to the structure of the Group. We created a new business called Barclays Corporate, which comprises the larger business relationships from what was Barclays Commercial. We placed Barclays Corporate alongside Barclays Capital to form Corporate and Investment Banking. And we created Global Retail Banking comprising U.K. Retail, Barclaycard, GRCB Western Europe and GRCB Emerging Markets. These changes have at their heart the alignment of the specialist capabilities in Barclays with the needs of the Customer and Client segments that we serve.</p>
          <p>A few words first about GRB. We have significantly grown our Retail and Commercial Banking customer footprint over the last three years. I've asked Antony Jenkins, the New Chief Executive of GRB to push that strategy forward, strengthening the U.K. franchises. But increasing through time the ratio of non-U.K. to U.K. business, with emphasis on creating critical mass in markets where we have a greater presence.</p>
          <p>Our goal is depth; not breadth. Antony and I've agreed four objectives for GRB:  Profit growth; an improved loan-to-deposit ratio; deeper penetration in existing markets leading to further international diversification; and the generation of net equity.</p>
          <p>And I acknowledge that we've been too aggressive in our approach to a business expansion in certain Emerging Markets. We've built scale quickly, and we now serve almost four million customers across those businesses. But we must convert the investment in people, in customer recruitments and in sales outlets, which has driven good progress in the income line into sustainable profits.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, where we serve almost three million customers and where we have a presence in the right markets, I want to see sustainable profits, too; which will mean a business that is less reliant on one-offs in the future.</p>
          <p>Our Retail and Corporate Banking businesses; GRB, Absa and Corporate Banking are heavily geared to the turn in the cycle. Their loan loss rates are high today by historical standards. We saw some improvements in these in the second half of 2009, but we remain cautious about the lagging effect of rising unemployment on these businesses.</p>
          <p>As we execute our strategy and when the cycle turns, and it will, the profits of GRB, Absa and Corporate Banking and the scale of their relative contributions to the Group's profits will rise materially.</p>
          <p>These businesses already generate &#xA3;8 billion of pre-provision operating profit which is over 60% of the group. Our plan is to have the new GRB and Barclays Corporate teams present to the market at a seminar of this summer, which will allow them to set out their business plans for you.</p>
          <p>Now when announced the formation of CIB in November, we said that we saw the close relationship between Barclays Corporate and Barclays Capital, particularly in the areas of relationship management and sector expertise, as a source of significant synergy in the future. All around the world we see growing fungibility of client requirements as between corporate banking and investment banking needs. The opportunity is global, and it should be a source of significant income and cost performance for our new CIB division in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>The competitive landscape in the global wealth industry has changed, and that creates opportunity too. Barclays Wealth is too small today, and we intend to grow it. Some years back, we had the same point of view about both Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors. Indeed, 10 years ago, Barclays Capital's annual profits were about &#xA3;300 million and BGI's about &#xA3;50 million, and as you know, both of those profit lines grew quickly in the years that followed.</p>
          <p>So I believe that we have a track record of growing businesses organically. At our board meeting last December, we agreed to adopt a growth plan for Barclays Wealth. We intend, as you've heard from Chris, to invest about &#xA3;350 million over the next five years in an organic buildout operated on a pay-as-you-go basis and, our objective is to change the scale of this business.</p>
          <p>Turning now to managing our risks. Our risk management was subjected to a further vicious test during 2009. Given how difficult it was to predict the outlook a year ago, I think it was quite brave of us to share our planning assumptions with you and to give you a loan loss range for 2009. It reflects well on our planning and risk management that the outturn was at the bottom end of that range.</p>
          <p>Robert has set out his expectations for our loan loss performance in 2010, so I won't add to what he said. For many years, we've been big users of stress testing at Barclays. We run weekly stress tests on key portfolios and we regularly assembly a consolidated top down view of the resilience of our capital and liquidity positions to stress scenarios. The FSA has increased its focus on stress testing as part of its regular supervision cycle.</p>
          <p>Probably the greatest risk for us is the uncertain outlook for regulatory reform. It's a risk we must mange, and we shouldn't be fatalistic about it. Some commentators think that the reform agenda could require the deconstruction of universal banks.</p>
          <p>We believe a safer system does not require narrow banking. Indeed, there's no correlation at all between failure and big or small, narrow or broad, domestic or international.</p>
          <p>We see big banks as risk diversifiers, not risk aggregators, but we know that if our view is to prevail, and I think it will, then governments and supervisors need to see the banks adopting a responsible attitude towards capital, liquidity, leverage, credit supply, counter cyclical provisioning, remuneration and disclosure.</p>
          <p>The Basel authorities announced a package of proposed reforms in December on which they are consulting through the first half of this year. We will need to accommodate such changes as are finally enacted over the coming years, and we have the ability over that period to take mitigating action.</p>
          <p>The impact studies which will be conducted by the authorities must model the consequences of the aggregate reform package for the global economy, not least because the economic recovery is fragile and the principle and understandable requirements of governments and central banks is for banks to increase their lending activities.</p>
          <p>A system that has higher Tier 1 capital, higher liquidity, lower leverage, counter-cyclical capital buffers, a capital premium for systemically significant banks, higher risk weightings and higher capital deductions is a system which is likely to generate lower shareholder returns and/or higher costs to customers. We think these points are intuitively well understood by stakeholders, so careful analysis, including an understanding of what implementation timetable best serves sustained economic recovery, must be completed, because we have one shot at getting it right.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to our third objective, maintaining strategic momentum. Barclays' strategy has been stress tested over the last three years, and we think it's withstood the test quite well. Our strategy is to increase our growth potential over time by diversifying our business.</p>
          <p>Despite the regulatory uncertainty that I've described, our strategic flight path is very clear: to consolidate the position of Barclays Capital in a transformed investment banking industry; to convert into sustained profits the investments we've made in our International Retail and local business franchises, including in Absa; to continue to diversify Barclaycard, where the number of customers outside the United Kingdom now exceeds the number inside; to build out Barclays Corporate with a focus on internationalizing it further; to implement the growth plan at Barclays Wealth, transforming the scale of that business over time.</p>
          <p>On group shape, we see the optimal profit mix as being two-thirds from Retail, Corporate Banking and Wealth Management and one-third from Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>I'm careful not to point you to a timetable for getting there, because I don't want you think that we're hell-bent on getting to that shape by a particular date, and therefore that we're hell-bent on acquisition; we're not. What matters here is the direction of travel.</p>
          <p>The change in organizational structure that we announced last November is intended to help us implement the strategic objectives that I've just outlined.</p>
          <p>I'll cover dividends and goals in a moment, but first some words about remuneration, looked at from the angles of objectives, architecture and outcome.</p>
          <p>First objectives, we must be compliant. Our policies and practices are fully compliant with the new FSA code and with the G20 principals. The remuneration policies we have adopted in 2009 have had the protection and enchantment of capital ratios as an explicit goal. We see remuneration as a means to an end. That end is the implementation of strategy in a way that serves the interest of shareholders.</p>
          <p>Next architecture, we've ensured that for senior staff, a significant percentage of compensation is deferred with vesting in equal thirds over a three-year period. The amount of deferred compensation has increased by about 70%.</p>
          <p>The 2009 bonuses paid to members of the Group Executive Committee and of the Barclays Capital Executive Committee are 100% deferred. Where we use shares to pay deferred remuneration, there will be no dilution of existing shareholders because we will buy shares in the market to fund this year's awards. All deferred awards are subject to clawback.</p>
          <p>The decisions that we've taken are based on a risk-adjusted view of 2009 performance with independent reports for the Group Remuneration Committee from the Finance Director and the Chief Risk Officer.</p>
          <p>And then turning to outcomes, while Chris has reported to you on the size of our discretionary bonus pool and he's also talked about the amount of payroll tax we're paying, since that tax was announced in December, we've managed the compensation pool down so that the cost of the tax for the Company broadly equates to the reduction in the size of the pool, with that reduction being borne by senior employees, where payroll taxes payable in subsequent years will follow the same approach.</p>
          <p>We set out some of the key data on compensation in the appendix of Chris' presentation. I don't pretend that the judgments we have to make in the area of pay are easy or straightforward. The market for the best people is both global and intensely competitive, and if we're to remain successful, we must attract and retain the best people, but our objective is to pay the minimum consistent with competitiveness. Pay must be affordable in the context of generating a profit, investing in the business, maintaining strong capital ratios and paying dividends.</p>
          <p>On dividends, we'll pay a final dividend in March 2010. Given the regulatory uncertainty, it would be imprudent for us to move needle on dividends significantly, but subject to that caveat, which I hope our shareholders will understand, our dividend policy is intended to be progressive relative to a 2009 annualized dividend rate of &#xA3;0.045 per share.</p>
          <p>Lastly, goals. The output goal is that our TSR should be top quartile relative to our peer group over time. We believe that that goal will best be served by managing multiple input goals. These include economic profits, balance sheet size and leverage, RWAs and returns, core Tier 1 capital, return on equity, funding and liquidity, the jaws and dividends.</p>
          <p>In the medium-term, we will seek to generate an average return on equity that exceeds our cost of equity over the cycle. In the short-term, I don't pretend that generating a return in excess of the cost of equity will be simple, because we will continue to hold high levels of capital and the cost of equity for banks is likely to remain high.</p>
          <p>2010 is only a few weeks old, but we've had a strong start. Profit in January exceeded the monthly run rate of the first half of 2009 and of the full year 2009. As we look ahead, we're very focused on our obligation to deliver another year of substantial profitability. So that's it from me. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>We're happy to take your questions now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning. JP, John-Paul Crutchley from UBS. I want to ask a question on the GRCB emerging market portion as was. I appreciate it is now under the new group structure. One strategic question, maybe one tactical question. It was always perceived that the growth trajectory you hoped for that business would somewhat counterbalance the strong growth on the institutional side of the business. It sounds like there's clearly a degree of refocus there. So I just want to get some comments on whether you still see that as strong counterbalance too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second question was maybe just in terms of there's some particular territories which clearly haven't panned out as you had expected, and I just wondered what we should particularly expect for say, clean up or restructuring or withdrawal costs if that's the case for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>JP, let me make a few general comments and then I'll ask Antony to add to what I say. Can I caveat it, though? I mentioned that there's going to be seminar in the summer and at that stage we'll give you somewhat more detailed views in the area that you're referring to, and indeed in other areas of GRB and Barclays Corporate. But the starting point is that in the context of the Group strategy of finding higher growth through time by diversification, one of things we've been seeking to do is to increase rapidly the income in GRCB on an international side relative to the U.K.</p>
          <p>Of course we want the U.K. businesses to continue to grow, but if you look at that relationship today, about 45% of the income in the old GRCB is from the International businesses. And that's a very big change as you know relative to two or three years ago. And our goal through time, if we were expressing it in the old GRCB format, was that the profit contribution from the International businesses in GRCB would be equivalent in time to the U.K. contribution.</p>
          <p>Now clearly that needs to be income-led and I think we have turbocharged income in the International businesses in this space significantly over the last three years including indeed in the emerging markets. But I acknowledge, as I said in my presentation, that I think in some cases we were too aggressive in building in certain markets into what turned out to be the downturn.</p>
          <p>So the strategy is unchanged, I think there are ways in which we can improve the performance and as I said also in my remarks, what we have to do is we've got to convert the investment that we've made thus far into sustained profit. Let me just turn to Antony and ask him to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. I'd say two things; one is we have a fantastic franchise in the emerging markets in sub-Saharan Africa where we have Tier 1 or 2 positions, and we feel good about the opportunities presented by those economies over the medium-term and particularly with our relationship with Absa.</p>
          <p>Secondarily, I would say that we have entered additional markets such as India, the UAE of course, where we were before, Pakistan, Indonesia and so on. In some of those markets, we found a number of opportunities that work quite well, most of those were in the Corporate Banking space; and some of them that have been more difficult, particularly in the Retail space. And what you'll find us doing is re-balancing over time towards the things that work and away from the things that don't work.</p>
          <p>We're looking right now at what that will constitute &#x2013; the second part of your question, around significant clean up or write-down. That's not what we're looking at right now. It's more of a re-balancing.</p>
          <p>In terms of our international footprint, in general, in Retail, we do think that  there are some good opportunities given the positions that we have in Western Europe, where we've shown our ability to grow organically and also through filling acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa as I mentioned, and also in our U.S. Cards business where we've been able to demonstrate good growth there.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the current cyclical and regulatory pressures, we continue to believe there'll be opportunities there. So in the round for the Global Retail Banking, we are very much of the belief that we can balance our strong domestic positions with international growth over time, and this is a fine tuning of activities.</p>

          <p>The answer to that is none. We looked through the Protium transaction for the purpose of RWAs</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Secondly, could you give us some guidance please on the outlook for RWA in voluntary growth this year both from grade migration and market risk weightings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the market risk weighting piece, we've given you a range of 40 to &#xA3;60 billion of RWAs. I think it had still range but at least it's going to be at the top end of it. Involuntary grading migration, evidence to-date is showing a relatively small impact on RWAs and I'm not expecting it to be major.</p>
          <p>When I look though, at one point at RWAs progression over this year, there is a transfer out of RWAs into deductions for securitizations, which we know has an impact on improving core Tier 1, because only half the deduction goes against core Tier 1, the other half against Tier 2. But that is included in our calculations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then more broadly, could you comment on where we think &#x2013; where you think where we're going on capital leverage now? So there's obviously been a significant improvement this year. Do you think you're now running at where you would need to be in the longer run both on levels of capital on a risk basis and on a straight leverage basis? Or how much further do you think you're going to need to build this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me talk about capital, and Chris might want to add on leverage. On capital, it's clearly been right both from the point of view of equity market sentiment, but also from the point of view of what our regulators want to move the needle and we have in the way that you've seen. And I think it is fair to say that although we set out on this journey back in 2007 in fact, and indeed I would say the banking sector as a whole has improved its capital ratios significantly, so the journey doesn't start from here. If you ask me, is there likely to be on a permanent basis a requirement for more capital in the system as a result of what's happened in the world over the course of the last two or three years, I mean no surprise that my answer that is yes emphatically.</p>
          <p>We have been trying as we built capital this year &#x2013; in 2009 to anticipate what might come out of Basel, for example. I think it's right for us to be thoughtful about the implementation timetable of Basel and indeed thoughtful about the full package of things to be implemented. But we need to take a generally conservative stance and protect our capital ratios, because whatever is implemented over time, I think that the capital requirements will go up or the deductions will come down. I think we start in a very good place, by the way. Having a 10% core Tier 1 ratio, having a 13% Tier 1 ratio; that's the right place to start.  And remember that the implementation timetable will be multi-year.</p>
          <p>Leverage, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On leverage. When we were at 28 times, I think I identified that I was hoping to get it nearer to 20. We were careful not to give a specific target. But that was directionally where we wanted to go. I have to be honest. I think we got to 20 more quickly than I was expecting, which is good news. But it's therefore in the range that I would want to keep it, which means I don't have a specific target to drive it down further in the current environment. If it sits around 20, I think that'll be fine.</p>

          <p>Morning. Thank you. It's Ian Smillie from RBS. Two questions, please. The first one again on RWAs. Could you give us a bit more disclosure as to why the counterparty component went down so sharply in the second half of the year, please, Chris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because there was just less activity around the year-end. If you look at the balance sheet on a non-weighted basis, you'll see that most of the reduction in balance sheet was on wholesale institutions and particularly on certain imbalances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The second question. Of the 13 billion FICC revenues, could you just give us some idea what proportion of that comes from OTC derivatives? And what might happen if that was to be brought back onto central clearing with no offsets, which presumably you would be trying hard to push through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm not sure how precise we really want to be on that. But I think in terms of the broader question, what is the impact of derivatives regulation? I think &#x2013; and Jerry, I'll ask you to pick up on this; on both pieces of it. I think the most important thing for us is that as the legislation has worked its way through Congress in the U.S., we have seen so many corporates come and testify to the House and to the Senate about the importance of end-user derivatives for our corporate clients. So we think this is going to end in a very good place, which is that the significant amount derivatives go onto exchanges. But there's an opportunity to do structured transactions with our corporate clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jerry, do you want to add? We'll just get the microphone to you. We have a microphone up front. Here we go. Thanks. Jerry?</p>
          <p>&lt;Jerry del Missier&gt;: Yeah. I mean the only thing I would add is that with the increased transparency that comes from electronic execution and the stability that comes from central clearing; we would actually expect to see volume growth and a more developed market. That's certainly been our experience. And frankly we had built our businesses around transparency in derivatives, given the role that we had in putting a lot of these markets onto electronic execution platforms in the first place back six, seven years ago. And in fact our very early embracing of central clearing as a way of improving the capital efficiency of these businesses, as well as the stability of the system. So...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I push a bit harder? Because one of your U.S. competitors has actually given an indication of what proportion of their FICC revenues come from OTC derivatives. And I'm just wondering; I understand you were trying very hard to offset any impacts that might come through. But just think of it as an understanding of the starting point of that 13 billion, how much might come from OTC derivatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And it's not something that we have disclosed by way of further breakdown. And I hope you feel that on Barclays Capital generally we've given a lot more data and disclosure over recent years. And we give that chart that shows you income by origin. But I think going down into a further set of detail is somewhere we'd be reluctant to go.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. In the second half of the year you saw an extraordinary increase in the cash balances on the balance sheet. And you've given us an indication of how much it costs to hold that liquidity portfolio for the full year '09. I wonder if you could give us an indication of &#x2013; if you maintain that liquidity portfolio through 2010 what the incremental costs would be, because presumably it was second-half weighted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So I think the number I would have for full year would be something in the order of &#xA3;800 million. That sort of number.</p>
          <p>Yes. Total so 150 more incrementally.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. My second question related to the assets acquired with Lehman. I noticed you're still waiting to receive about &#xA3;2.3 billion of assets from Lehman, and you've booked 1.8 billion of those assets on the balance sheet. Given the time that's passed &#x2013; I know there are legal cases going on, But is there a point at which there is a risk that you would have to de-recognize those assets if you don't actually receive them anytime soon?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Chris. You may want to comment on the technicalities of the accounting. But we are in the middle of ongoing litigations, so it's difficult to make specific comments. But I can tell you that in the booking of the 1.8 billion and not the full 2.3 billion, we recognized there may be some delay or whatever in doing that. And we believe as do our accountants that we're adequately provided, if you will, currently for where the litigation stands.</p>
          <p>Second of all, we're very confident that the litigation will end in our favor. And you will have seen our response to the filing by the estate. We remain confident; we're looking forward to the hearing in March or April, and it's not something that we're concerned about at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Manus, I wouldn't add much more than that other than to say we also know that the estate has assets or other assets significantly in excess of that. So we're on the resolution of the legal case, which as you've heard; Rich says we think we have a very strong position. Obtaining the assets mechanically is something that's relatively easy to do.</p>

          <p>Peter Toeman from HSBC. You presented a slide, which tells us that all the wholesale funding in BarCap is now more than one year maturity. And I suppose there was a cost attached to that, which you haven't actually given us. But I wondered if we could assume that the cost of the maturity transformation at BarCap is actually going to fall predominantly in 2009 with very little further incremental cost in 2010?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, there. Aaron Ibbotson from Goldman Sachs. Two questions, if I may. The first one is just on the cost-to-net income or net revenues in BarCap. Is it fair to assume that you expect it to continue to be around the low 70s despite trading write-downs and own gain losses &#x2013; own debt losses tailing off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll ask Bob to comment. But just to remind you what Chris said. I mean Chris said that we &#x2013; our target is to be in the lower end of the range of 65 to 75% net ratio. Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I think that's exactly the place to go. Our budgeted goal is in the lower half of that range, as Chris said. But if you look back on 2009, the &#xA3;18 billion of top line revenues; well that's very, very strong. And as we look forward, clearly we want to budget our business around our client business and our revenues.</p>
          <p>But in 2009 you have to also look at close to 2 billion in own credit; a number that's unlikely to recur again, as that's gone up and down. And close to &#xA3;7 billion in both provisions and credit market write-downs when you total everything up. And certainly going forward, we wouldn't expect to be anyway near those types of level. So you see quite clearly how we can see the cost/income ratio coming down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; just very quickly. Just to clarify Rob's comment on the Group impairments. You said that for 2010 you expect positive trends to continue but not &#x2013; we shouldn't expect as a significant drop as we saw in the second half. I'm just wondering if you could clarify if we are supposed to take the base, I assume on the whole year of 2009, rather than the second half which was quite a difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was thinking of the base as the 8.1 billion of portfolio; that year-over-year we would see that type of decline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was two questions. It's Fiona Swaffield from Execution Nobel. On the fixed income revenues you mentioned they were quite resilient versus peers, and I think they're down about 36% second half/first half. And could you talk about what's going on? Is the second half a very good &#x2013; adequate base for us to forecast off for 2010? Have we got a normalization of spreads in there, or are volumes weak?  Just some idea of what 2010 could look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me have Bob take that, and then we'll come to your second question. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to answer in general on the business and then ask Jerry to pick up on the specifics of fixed income. But I think &#x2013; keep in mind what we said at the end of first half. And what I always say at the end of the first half is that we always expect our second half; we adjust for about one month's worth for seasonal reasons because you lose about a half a month of revenues between the summer &#x2013; somewhere in July or August; this year it was August &#x2013; and around December. And December generally closes earlier. So we definitely expect a stronger first half than second half, everything else being equal.</p>
          <p>Secondly I would say that the fixed income portion of FICC, Fixed Income Currencies and Commodities was very, very strong in the first half last year, as you said. And we wouldn't expect it &#x2013; we didn't see it as strong in the second half. We wouldn't expect it this year. It would be wonderful if it was. But we would see better opportunities in our Equities business, particularly now that Europe is up and running; and parts of Asia will be up and running soon. In our Advisory business, we are pleasantly surprised that we could finish in the top five in the U.S. M&amp;A. And now Europe and Asia are up and running. And also in our Emerging Markets and Prime Services businesses.</p>
          <p>Jerry, do you want to say anything more about fixed income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just specifically to add on fixed income, I do think we have a normalized spread environment now. And volumes again will be driven very much by the environment, where I think we have still significant volatility; a lot of uncertainty around the direction of interest rates. A significant amount of financing and a very healthy calendar across government-sector, corporate financial institutions. And so clearly the first half of '09 was a very, very favorable environment, and difficult to see something like that repeated in fixed income. But this remains a very positive environment for the Fixed Income business overall. And we have a very, very strong franchise position across Europe, the U.S. and Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Bob just wants to add one thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While we're on the topic, I would just say that what we're seeing also in terms of sovereign spreads, whether it was in Dubai or more recently in Greece; that's very, very good for business. Clients, whether they're issues or investors, are going to be very, very thoughtful and serious about the banks they use. And our position of being number one in Sales, Trading Research and Fixed Income both in Europe and in the U.S. is a huge advantage now. And it's going to create significant volatility and significant opportunities in those markets.</p>
          <p>And a market environment where every sovereign trades at the same spread from our point of view is not necessarily good for business. So there's a lot of things going on out there, as Jerry said from a Fixed Income point of view that will be very, very different than the first half of last year, which was a different kind of environment. But it's going to be a very interesting year in Fixed Income. And I think clients will be very thoughtful about using the banks that they know can execute.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In terms of economic capital versus core Tier 1, I can't see that you've allocated the BGI gain or the increase in core Tier 1 capital in the second half into economic capital. Is that just due to the averaging, or is that something that will happen if...</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>I just wanted to ask about the growth aspiration because if &#x2013; you're saying in the outlook statement about the cost of equity and struggling to make that sort of return that -.it doesn't feel at the moment like a huge amount of capacity has been taken off the system, even though Lehmans is gone, etc. Just looking around this room. And I just wonder about this &#x2013; this aspiration for growth</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's rather an eccentric thing to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it would just be helpful to get a little more clarity about how you think about growth adding value for shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think there are some markets where there has been just a genuine transformation in the competitive landscape and we would certainly make that comment of investment banking and wealth. I mean you know just as I do how seismic have been those shifts. I think what you say is fair in some areas of the retail and commercial banking world where less capacity has gone. I would say, though, that the competitive dynamics, I mean take United Kingdom, the competitive dynamics in the United Kingdom in retail and commercial banking have changed quite a lot. And what you have seen not entirely a beneficial trend, I would say, is a retreating of foreign competitors to national markets. I worry about that because I think with that may go a nationalist and protectionist agenda, so from a macro point of view I that's rather a troubling trend, but actually as those withdraws have taken place then there have been good opportunities.</p>
          <p>If I look for example at how we performed in a mortgage market here in the United Kingdom over the course of the last 24 months, absolutely, no doubt that it's benefited significantly from the change in capacity. If I look at what's happened to corporate banking and commercial banking activity here in the United Kingdom, again, I mean big changes, as you know, in the competitive line up. So I wouldn't be too shy about talking about the opportunities at the aggregate level presented by the crisis because the landscape has changed. But certainly the areas of greatest opportunity, one we have grabbed already, in investment banking, one we are intending to grab in wealth, those are the two areas where we should, we hope in time, be the biggest beneficiaries and our shareholders from that.</p>
          <p>We'll take a question on the telephone and then I'll come to the questions at back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your question comes from the line of Arturo De Frias from Evolution. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions, in fact I will go one-by-one. First of all, the comp ratio in BarCap, you have mentioned it is 38%. My question is, is this affected in any way by the accounting of deferrals and if yes, what kind of comp ratio you could be happy with in the investment bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I'll ask Chris Lucas to handle that one first of all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Because the accounting is for in calculating the comp ratio on the accounting basis it does include brought forward deferrals, but not the &#xA3;1.2 billion that we're awarding across the Group. And we have to think about BarCap separately, so it does get impacted. There is a carry forward deferral as well and the impact on the 38% is broadly &#xA3;500 million of brought forward deferrals that are included in that calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Changing to retail, you were mentioning that your coverage of NPLs in the mortgage book is 18% and that's broadly in line with the severity you would expect. And I would &#x2013; I have the feeling that that's a bit low severity expectation, I mean in many of the countries where you operate the housing market is falling by 20, 30, 40%. So can you explain why you think 18% severity will be enough? And I will have a very brief third question after that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. I'll ask Robert to comment, but the starting point is a very conservative loan to value ratio spectrum within the Group. So if you look at the U.K. mortgage book, 43% loan to value ratio, if you look at the Spanish book, 51% loan to value ratio, if you look at the South African book, 41% loan to value ratio, that's why we form the view that we do because the going in position even at this point in the crisis is a cautious one. Robert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add to that that the international portfolio to mention really would be the Spanish one, which is our large international one. And our Spanish book is actually even more conservative than our U.K. book when you look at exposure to property price declines because although the average LTV is a little bit higher than here in the U.K. and you'll recognize that we are have a very conservative book here in the U.K. If you look at the amount of exposure currently above an 85% LTV, in the U.K. that's about 14% of our exposure today is above an 85 LTV and in Spain it's only half of that level, it's just below 7%. So the average LTV is a bit higher, but the exposure to expected price moves in Spain is even lower and that's why the overall reserve ratios I think are completely adequate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert. You had one last question, did you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah. Thanks very much for that. That was very useful. The last question was capital particularly talking about the BlackRock stake, if the Basel proposals go through as they are now, minority stakes in financial institutions are going to become extremely capital intensive. If I understand the proposals correctly, that will carry 100% weighting. So you would have to allocate five or six billion to your BlackRock stake, which obviously is a lot of capital. Could you share with us what's your view on that one, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean I'll say two things and Bob may want to add. First of all we in the BGI transaction with our eyes open we took as part consideration a stake in BlackRock. That's because we think that it has strategic opportunities for the Group and therefore for the Group shareholders. It was a conscious decision. The second thing is that we should bear in mind that the Basel proposals are just that, they are proposal. We will see what is implemented. It's right for us to assume a conservative approach to implementation. But there is a long way to go and there is a long timetable of implementation and therefore I don't think it would be right for us to discount the view immediately that everything that's been published so far will be implemented. Bob?</p>
          <p>I promised a question at the back. There we are, microphone coming.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I have a couple of quick questions. The first one actually, Robert showed us a very interesting slide showing 20-year average loan impairment rate in 91 basis points. I wonder whether you're encouraging us to think of that as a normalized level for the future, if not which direction either side of that 91 might we be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've tried to be very helpful even our stares today, but I know you're pressing for more. Robert, what would you like to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say is if it was going to be 91, it would have to be a very long future, so I think it will come down. But I don't think we'll get down to 91 any time very soon, that 20-year history it doesn't really apply I think in today's market conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a section question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the second question was actually just really following that on returns, I think there was a question earlier, just you made some comments about long-term returns. You've had a target of ROE I think sort of high teens in the past. I wonder whether you are signaling a change in what you think your long-term ROE target will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean our objective remains the same. I think the task of getting to the objective will be the harder, in any event for the time being because of the phenomena that I've described, I mean high levels of regulatory capital requirement, high levels of equity market requirements and high cost of capital. So I think we should be realistic about the challenge, but could we see a time in the future where the industry is able to get back to those levels, I mean we've tried, as you know historically to be in double-digit return on equity.</p>
          <p>Can we see that again, can we see it operating in the 12 to 20 range in the future? Yes, we certainly can. But I emphasize short-term these challenges are going to be significant. We understand full well that the supply of capital to banks, debt capital and equity capital, will demand a proper return. I mean we understand that entirely and that will be the reality of the industry going forward for sure. I think we've got time, the Chairman said we'd try and try and finish by about 11:00, we've got time for two more questions, if there are two more. One here, Michael, mic coming.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not quite. Bob, you painted clearly a picture of where thick was clearly a fantastic 2009, but clearly there are a lot of other things going on in your business. So I was just wondering if when you look at 2010 and 2011 whether you see 2009 as a base level on an underlying basis that you can actually grow from or if that's just a peak revenue that's sort of unlikely to be met? And I've just got one follow-up question on costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's probably a good way put it. We were &#x2013; I mean we couldn't have been more delighted with the speed of the integration which gave us an opportunity, John mentioned it earlier, to get out of the gates early hiring for Europe and Asia and equity and the advisory business. But we look at the top line revenue, &#xA3;9 billion higher than we'd ever had before. It was a terrific year. Do we expect that we can out-achieve that? Of course we do. You know how we run the business. There was nothing there that we would say certainly some market conditions were better here, there.</p>
          <p>But here is a way I would think about it. If we can continue with that level and the significance or the severity of own credit and credit market write-downs are behind us, then even at those levels and as I said, maybe fixed income comes down and other things go up, the impact on profitability is enormous. And that's why we have the confidence we have going in, is the kind of profitability and ratio we ran this year reducing capital, while reducing leverage and weathering the storm on the credit market write-downs and the own credit give us a lot of confidence in the profitability of the business going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that's what I'm thinking, if I take your cost to net revenue range and push it down towards the bottom where you're guiding then it kind of implies a profit in 2010 for BarCap of around about 5 billion or maybe more pounds. Is that something that we should be &#x2013; I know it's kind of a tricky question for you to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a tricky question. Nice of you to acknowledge it, Michael.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just back on the growth question, two for Bob maybe related, the first was on BarCap, can you just talk about you've obviously been building out the franchise in equities in both Europe and Asia. Can you just talk about where you've got to in that process in terms of people and infrastructure, how much more cost is to come or have you basically got the platforms in shape? And the second was just on wealth where you obviously talked about the strategic spend which is coming over the next five years and I guess the question is now is that quantum enough, I mean given that the amount you talked about if you take it on an annualized basis is about a 6% increase on the cost of the wealth business, which given that, John, you were talking about a clear transformational change in that business just doesn't feel like a sort of cost investment to get you to where you want to be. So maybe you could just talk to it, a, in terms of market currently and b, do you need more to spend in wealth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On BarCap the equity build-out went extremely well last year. And I think again to go to back to what John said, we got out of the gate early, so before a year was up we had a fully functioning, fully running sales, trading, research, advisory business across the entire time zone, which was terrific. Japan will open very soon and we would expect it's going to take us close to at least the mid-year to have Asia at the same position. Last year our head count was flat doing that. So we probably had in the order of 2,000 plus in terms of hiring front and back office for just what we're talking about, the equity and advisory build-out.</p>
          <p>But we found ways to get other efficiencies in the business. I don't think it's going to be a million miles from that this year. I think as we continue to build-out Asia and we have other opportunities in prime services in Emerging Markets we maybe up a little. It's probably going to be broadly flat to up a little because we're going to continue to find, as we do every year, other areas to become more efficient in the business. So maybe a small up in terms of head count, but not dramatic, not the kind of things you've seen in the past from BarCap.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Bob, on wealth do you want to make a &#x2013; maybe Tom would like to add?</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John mentioned earlier that the examples we were using for Barclays wealth were Barclays capital in BGI and I think the hallmark of that was disciplined growth over time. So I think the first thing to leave you with is that the investment will be disciplined investment. The second thing is, is that in &#x2013; if we're looking at the five year period lots of that will be slightly front-loaded. So we certainly expect that we'll have good base to begin with. And the aspirations that we have are obviously to change the scale of this business. We've done a reasonable amount of investment over the course of the last four years. We've gone from 27th largest wealth manager in the world to about nine or 10. So this is sort of the last push.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add one thing, this is an incredible opportunity for us to have the board approve the Gamma Plan, which, Tom, we will be executing it at a time when four of the top five players in global wealth are running into serious headwinds and have seen a decline in their business and a decline in their assets. So how often do you build while four of the top five participants in a market are in some form of decline, it's a very good environment for this.</p>
