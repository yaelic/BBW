        <plist>
          <p>We're going to begin the presentation of the First Quarter Results 2009. Thanks very much for your presence here today. Ignacio, you have the floor, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. First I'd like to thank all of you for your attendance here at the presentation of our results, and those of you who are following us on the web page or over the telephone. Together with me I have Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, he is the Economics and Financial Director and Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, the Operations Director.</p>
          <p>Now as always the presentation will consist first of all of the results, basically results of the first quarter. And then Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz will get into greater depth on the analysis of those results and the financial position. And finally, I will make some brief conclusions on the perspectives of the company for this quarter before we get into the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Now the first quarter of this year has been characterized in all markets where the Group is operating by a drop in the electricity demand, which we have not seen for many years, now the fruit of this economic situation and with energy prices, which are very low as well.</p>
          <p>Now given this scenario, the business model of IBERDROLA has allowed us to continue increasing our activity and maintaining our bottom line. So the Group has increased its production by 4% as well as distributed electricity by 15%.</p>
          <p>Now this together with the policy of holding down cost has meant that the gross profits were up by &#x2013; and EBITDA were up by 9%. Now especially in the United States and the UK, both in terms of renewables and the rest of the regulated and non-regulated activities, given the diversification followed by the Group over the past several years have been the key issues to maintain this growth that I have just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to &#x2013; the net profit were &#x20AC;793 million and after the capital gains of the first quarter of last year, they are over &#x20AC;15 million due to the sale of our financial participation, and the Galp company, now we have the ordinary profit in the first quarter was in line with that of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now in the financial situation as it is, with greater difficulty and access to capital for companies, IBERDROLA has shown its capacity to maintain liquidity and it has increased the cash flow. Also over the last several months, we have carried out several financial operations and have obtained around &#x20AC;5 billion at the end of March, our liquidity is at 9.1 billion. Also we increased 14% in operational cash flow to &#x20AC;1.27 billion.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter 2009, the output, as I said, was increased by 4% and there has been a fall in demand in the market, and we are over 36,800 gigawatts right now. This has been possible thanks to our diverse output with low emissions.</p>
          <p>In this connection, we should point out the wind capacity which has increased by &#x2013; which now comes for 25% of the company and it's the second technology of the Group, it's very close to hydro power. Now in terms of output in the first quarter, the increase in wind energy over 15% of the total, and it's very close to the production of nuclear and hydro, and has increased by 73% of the hydro production. There is also increased production in a very difficult environment with a firm demand in the all markets as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we've grown by 2.3% in output, thanks basically to hydro and wind energy despite the fall in demand by 7.5%. In the UK, increase in wind and the reinstallation of Longannet and the desulfurization equipment has resulted in an increase of output by 10%, despite a fall in consumption of 3%.</p>
          <p>In the US also, with a 3% fall in demand, the increase in our installed capacity of wind meant a 19% increase in output. And finally in Mexico and Brazil, with an average fall in demand over 5%, the production of IBERDROLA has only fallen by 2%.</p>
          <p>Also in terms of distributed electricity of the Group, we've supplied 52,800 gigawatts to more than 28 million customers, which is an increase of 15%. This has contributed to the &#x2013; this is explained by the incorporation of Energy East. So the distributed electricity outside of Spain now is greater than 50% of the total.</p>
          <p>We've produced more than 50% of our energy outside of the Spanish borders. Energy East has also supplied close to 25,000 gigawatts to 2 million gas customers. Now in terms of operational costs, the economic situation has meant that many companies have &#x2013; are holding down costs. Now this philosophy, which IBERDROLA has been applying for many years in our traditional business, and is now implementing in our new business as well.</p>
          <p>So despite the increases in output that I've mentioned earlier, the expenses have only increased by 1% due to renewables and the holding down of cost in Spain as well.</p>
          <p>Over the next several months, we will continue with the exchange of best practices between the different companies of the Group, which surely will have a positive impact on the reducing costs over the next several months.</p>
          <p>Now the increase of the major magnitude and the greater efficiency allows EBITDA to increase by 9% to almost &#x20AC;2 billion. Now the development here is the fruit of the diversified growth by the Group over the last several years. We now have five major sources of cash flow, all of these, which are quite balanced.</p>
          <p>In this connection the incorporation of Energy East to the Group has allowed us to continue improving our portfolio and the regulated activities grow by 30% and now account for 43% of the total Group EBITDA, which together with renewables reached 60% of the total operational result.</p>
          <p>Now this portfolio allows IBERDROLA to have a growing cash flow, and during the first quarter in 2009, we had a growth of 14% in cash flow to &#x20AC;1.27 billion is a good example of this cash flow. And finally the net profit has reached a figure of close to &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>Now once we exclude the non-recurring results, we have &#x20AC;535 million before taxes in March 2008 compared to 27 million in the first quarter, which is 0.4%, showing a capacity of the Group to have positive results even in this crisis environment. It's a very complicated economic situation.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the financial evolution of the Group, the bond issues over the last several months are close to &#x20AC;5 billion, which together with the reconfiguration of the relative credit of ScottishPower, allows us to, at the end of March, to have liquidity of 9.1 billion and the average maturity of 5.9 years. And this has contributed to the confidence that the market has and the solidity of IBERDROLA.</p>
          <p>Now before finishing this first section, I just wanted to make a few comments about the main headway made in terms of regulation in this first quarter. In terms of Spain, the government has continued approving measures that allow us to delve deeper into the effective liberalization and resolution of the tariff deficit. And this will prevent risk of future deficits. On the one hand, this increase of the tariff is at the beginning of the year, especially in terms of access tariffs, and will allow the retailers to compete with the official rate.</p>
          <p>Also the government has just passed in April the regime for the Last Resort Tariff for those customers of less than 10 kilowatt hours, and by the 1 July, we'll have more than 75 &#x2013; 70% of the liberalised market in our country. Now, this Last Resort Tariff will be applied to users who aren't in the free market and will be administered by the Last Resort retailers.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the financing of the upending deficit during the period, we've had different headway made in terms of solving this. On the one hand, the government has announced several times that it's working to resolve this issue. And one of the milestones &#x2013; it was the approval, just in the last few days, of the deficit corresponding to 2006. Although this was recognized, but we still need the official document of this acknowledgement and this was &#x2013; happened just a few days ago, together with the approval of the Royal Decree for the Last Resort Tariffs.</p>
          <p>Now this means that &#x20AC;2.6 billion, which right now are completely documented, and this obligation also this acknowledgement of the deficit and this is &#x2013; in the lot, has been recognized in a recent judgment by the Supreme Court of Spain, which I will talk about in just a moment.</p>
          <p>Also the Energy Commission, which is responsible for the liquidation of this system, has the legal obligation. This is the mandate from the Ministry to provide the necessary resources so that this deficit can be &#x2013; the money can be received. So these &#x2013; that will be paid. And this will be done in the condition that we consider suitable.</p>
          <p>You can be assured in any case that in this issue, IBERDROLA will continue carrying out all of the necessary legal action to defend the interest of the shareholders, as has been the standard for our company over the last several years. So in this connection, as I said, the Supreme Court, in the 28 January judgment, given the appeal made by IBERDROLA, has recognized the obligation of the as a national debt to compensate any deficits that arise. And given, as a result of the Court, the current &#x2013; the income and expenses need to be put in balance and this compensation needs to be made. So independent of all of this, we will continue collaborating with the government, and we have been, as we have been in the past, to carrying out all of the necessary actions to end this structural problem, that if not satisfied would hold down the possibility of companies to be the driving force behind the company for new investments and new purchases. So, in our view, this is a very important role played by IBERDROLA in this current economic situation.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the United States, during this first quarter, we've also had different regulatory improvements affecting the Group's interest on the one hand, the incentives for renewable, the Obama administration has approved certain regulations to making &#x2013; to possibly double wind energy to reach 48,000 installed megawatts. And also the Stimulus Bill, which covers the PTCs and also the possibility of companies to substitute this system for another one of tax credits reaching 30% of the value of the investment.</p>
          <p>So these ITCs, these credits can be received in cash with a subsidy or a grant for all the assets installed between 2009-2010. So IBERDROLA hopes to receive in 2009 between 400 and $500 million through this system. And this will allow us to increase our initial objective of the new capacity of the company this year by 300 megawatts reaching 1,600 installed megawatts for &#x2013; at the beginning &#x2013; at the end of 2009 or beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>We also expect that the procedural details for these funds will be prepared by July as announced by the Treasury Secretary in the United States. We will continue using this structure, the TAEI structure. So we will also have the same tax base as the rest of the Group in the United States.</p>
          <p>We should also point out the importance for the development of renewables in the United States. The recent report from the environmental protection report that openly recognizes the need to reduce CO2 emissions in the U.S. Now this report together with implementation as well as the emissions market in the Congress will fortify the Obama's plans for clean energy and the infrastructure to carry out this clean energy.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the distribution of electricity and gas, the New York regulators have understood that their financial situation is not &#x2013; is such that the procedure will take place according to the calendar and is beginning in September. So the regulator of the state will look at some of the aspects of remuneration in our application and we'll have a positive impact in 2009.</p>
          <p>I'm going to give the floor now to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada who will get into greater depth in these financial issues.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you very much, Chairman. I shall review now the highlights of our income statement for the first quarter 2009. Then I shall analyze in depth the most relevant data of our businesses. And then I shall conclude with an analysis of the financial situation of the Group.</p>
          <p>The results improved and there is an operational rate of growth of 9% of our EBITDA. This good development is due to our balanced portfolio and our international growth as indicated by our President.</p>
          <p>Energy started contributing during the last quarter of 2008 with &#x20AC;228 million during the first quarter of 2009. The ordinary profit grew by 0.4% up to &#x20AC;1.1 million, whereas the net profit that represented &#x20AC;539 million in 2008 has dropped by 34% to 793.</p>
          <p>Talking about the different items of our accounts, the revenues of the Group has increased by 21.3% up to &#x20AC;7.6 billion. The Energy business in Spain has grown by 2.6% in spite of lower prices and a reduction of demand.</p>
          <p>IBERDROLA has had an increase of output of 2.5%. Furthermore, there is a positive impact due to the increase of the retribution of our regulated business by 8.1%. ScottishPower brings some 2.4 billion revenues, which means 32% of the Group with an increase of output, up 8.5%, that has compensated the drop in distributed energy of 2.3%.</p>
          <p>Renewables business increases by 7.5%. The increase of production year-on-year compensates the drop of average price by 11.8%.</p>
          <p>Our business in Latin America has gone down by 22.2%, in particular, in Brazil, where we had a tariff revision as well as the rate of exchange. The non-energy products have a drop of 6.8% due to the slowing down of our real estate business, but the good behavior of engineering and construction has grown by 8, 9 &#x2013; by 9% has compensated that drop.</p>
          <p>Concerning the procurement, they grow by 26.1% up to &#x20AC;4.5 billion. The new businesses represent 43% of the total cost. ScottishPower represents 37%, growing by 16%. Energy East, 16%. As to our Spanish business, it represents 27% of the total with a year-on-year 11% rate of growth.</p>
          <p>Gross margin has grown by 15.7%, up to &#x20AC;2.9 billion. The traditional business in Spain grows by 34%. 19% is brought by the liberalised business and 15% by the regulated business.</p>
          <p>The contribution of international and renewable explains the change in the composition of the gross margin of the Group. ScottishPower represents 22% with &#x20AC;646 million, Energy East 16% with &#x20AC;468 million, and Renovable 15% with &#x20AC;450 million, which is a total of 53% of the Group.</p>
          <p>The basic margin grows by 14.3%, which is 1.4% less than the reported gross margin. This evolution can be explained by the drop in prices of the CO2 rights by &#x2013; &#x20AC;22.4 to &#x20AC;13.9 per ton during the first quarter of 2009. The reported gross margin represents a negative impact, which is the result of the emission allowances. This represents a cost of &#x20AC;153.8 million, 33.4 for the Spanish business and 120 for ScottishPower.</p>
          <p>The basic margin has been &#x2013; is obtained adding the gross margin to the positive effect of 85% derived from the revenues from the free allowances. In other words the net operational expense without including the CO2 allowances, grows by 27.7% up to &#x20AC;887 million. If we exclude the contribution of Energy East, which represents 21%, the growth is reduced to 1.1% because we have a good cost control policy, and this policy is going to be strengthened and intensified in 2009.</p>
          <p>The net operational expense of the Group has grown by 4.6%. ScottishPower represents 17% of our net operational expense, which is a drop of 16.4%, which proves that we have improved our efficiencies and that this is also due to the positive rate of exchange.</p>
          <p>Renovables has increased by 22.5% up to 99% (sic) [&#x20AC;99 million]. The tax -- the levies increases by 14.2% up to minus 199. The provision for clawback is lesser than last year by &#x20AC;38 million. The provision is due to certain facilities and other facilities pursuant to the application to Royal Decree 11/2007.</p>
          <p>As far as IBERDROLA is concerned, most of the provision for CO2 clawback corresponds to non &#x2013; to plans that have &#x2013; are not entitled to these clawbacks, and this is &#x20AC;34.4 million out of the &#x20AC;45 million. This development, which has been appealed, has been also criticized by Unesa.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of our Group reaches &#x20AC;1.9 billion with a rate of growth of 9%, which is the evidence of the capacity of the Group to keep growing at an operational level. Energy East represents &#x20AC;228 million and there is an increase of local currency in the rest of the businesses of the Group by &#x20AC;52 million. This positive operational evolution is penalized by the impact of the rate of exchange, which represents &#x20AC;109 million, and the impact of the mark to market which reduces it by &#x20AC;9.3 million.</p>
          <p>If we look at the purely operational EBITDA is, without taking into account the rate of exchange in Energy East, this rate of growth would have been 2.7% during the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we look at the different items, ScottishPower and Energy East are the main authorities due to this rate of growth. ScottishPower represents &#x20AC;529 million, growing by 4.4%, and Energy East has increased by &#x20AC;228 million. This contribution of the new businesses has managed to compensate the drop of 9.4% in our traditional businesses in Spain and Latin America.</p>
          <p>The traditional business in Spain has dropped by 6.4%, down to &#x20AC;589 million, in a difficult environment with lower prices and a drop in demand. In Latin America, the drop has been 10.7%, down to &#x20AC;187 million. And this has been affected by the impact of the real rate of exchange and the lesser distribution in Spain &#x2013; in Brazil.</p>
          <p>As far as the non-energy products, they dropped by 24%. The EBIT of the Group has grown by 8.1%, up to &#x20AC;1.4 billion, in line with the evolution of our EBITDA. The amortization grew by 11.7%, up to &#x20AC;527 million. The Group has maintained a good, prudent and cautious policies.</p>
          <p>Amortization has increased, has achieved &#x20AC;514 million. The procurement represent &#x20AC;12.8 million. The financial results of the Group increases by 44.5%, up to &#x20AC;326 million. This is mainly due to the greater expenses due to the average maturity, which is 46%. This contributes to the deficit of the accumulative tariff and the debt associated to the purchase of Energy East.</p>
          <p>In spite of this average &#x2013; this increase of this average maturity, we should stress that the financial expenses have increased less than expected. There is a reduction of our financial costs from 5.1 to 4.9%. The positive contribution of our portfolio of derivate has also meant a drop in the first quarter of 2009 up to 43%.</p>
          <p>The Group has managed to increase its ordinary profit up to &#x20AC;1.1 billion and the EBITDA has dropped by 30.6%. During the first quarter of 2008, we've had this investment &#x2013; divestment, which represented &#x20AC;535 million.</p>
          <p>The net profit has gone down by 34.2%, down to &#x20AC;792 million. This drop is greater than the EBIT because of the tax rate. And this is due to the effect of the consolidation of Energy East in the accounts of the Group. However, as our Chairman said, there is a growth of our operational cash flow by 13.8%, up to &#x20AC;1.200 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to analyze these results per businesses. In Spain, we'll talk about the output and the regulated gas. These results are due to a drop of 34% of the average price of the Spanish current. This is due to a drop of the total demand of the system by 7.5%, with a drop of output in the ordinary regime of 14.1%, due to an increase of 9.2% of increase in our special regime.</p>
          <p>In this difficult environment, IBERDROLA has been able to improve its output result. We have increased our ordinary input &#x2013; output by 2.5% due to the increase of hydro output, 94%, has compensated the drop in nuclear output, 12%.</p>
          <p>The production through combined cycles has been reduced by 2%. The unit average cost has increased by 13.1% up to &#x20AC;53.5 per megawatt hour, in spite of a difficult environment. This is a transitional effect, which will be corrected during the next month after reviewing the prices of the gas contract because there is a difference of three to six months between spot price of the gas and the petroleum.</p>
          <p>The CO2 prices have gone down by 37.9%, down to &#x20AC;13.9 per ton. The basic margin of our liberalised business has dropped by 13.1%, down to &#x20AC;593 million due to a drop of the revenues in derived generation, which has not been compensated by a drop of the fuel cost.</p>
          <p>There is a greater contribution of the gas operations due to the deterioration of the market conditions.</p>
          <p>In this environment, the net operational expenditure has been contained and limited with a growth of 2.5% due to the liberalisation of the market. As a consequence, the EBITDA has dropped by 14.4%, down to &#x20AC;349 billion.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of our regulated business has increased by 11.3%, with an increase of our gross margin of 8.4%, since the net operational expense has increased by 4.9%, which is 3.5% less than our gross margin. The business gross margin has increased by 8.4%, up to 419% (sic) [&#x20AC;419 million], and there is a slight positive impact due to the new legal settlements.</p>
          <p>In Renovables, during the first quarter, the output has grown by 20%, reaching 5.390 gigawatts, in line with the increase of our average operational output. The installed capacity has increased by 320 megawatts, achieving 9.6 (sic) [9,624] megawatts installed. The prices have gone down by 11.8%, but this is compensated by the stable development in the rest of our businesses.</p>
          <p>The operational costs grow in line with the installed capacity. As a consequence, the gross margin grows by 6%, up to 450 million, and the EBITDA grows slightly by 0.1%. Let me stress the increase of the levels of geographical diversification of our business with more than 48.5% of our installed capacity international market. The informed EBITDA of ScottishPower reaches &#x20AC;529 million due to the improvement of our efficiency and the reduction of a negative impact of the rate of exchange.</p>
          <p>The operational aspect is the most important &#x2013; or that production increased by 8.4% due to the entry into operation of Longannet, as the Chairman pointed out. Energy, distributed energy fell by 2.3%. This was lower than the fall of energy in the UK. Better operational efficiency is important. The net operational cost over gross margin ratio improved by 26%.</p>
          <p>Now by business units in terms of contribution to EBITDA, the wholesale and retail contributed &#x20AC;363.7 million and the networks business contributes &#x20AC;169.9 million. Energy East contributes &#x20AC;228.1 million to Group EBITDA. Now these results are in line with the results &#x2013; expected results and there is a slight improvement due to the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Now the accounting adjustments due to the US GAAP and <mark type="inaudible" /> which you'll remember in the first or the last quarter, were very negative, are now &#x2013; they are now turned around this month, in this quarter, and they're contributing &#x20AC;6.7 billion now.</p>
          <p>The impossibility of recognizing these tariff assets is &#x2013; affects the results of the bottom line. Now the fall of 10.7%, to &#x20AC;187.8 million, in line with that registered and gross margin, the operational net costs fell by 8.9%.</p>
          <p>Right now Brazil and Mexico are working and diametrically opposed. Now Brazil supplies &#x20AC;91.8 million to EBITDA, which is a fall of 32% due to the tariff fall. And that certainly that partial deal was a fall of 12.1% and the fall of demand also, and also due to the negative effect of exchange rate with the devaluation of the Brazilian real of 17%.</p>
          <p>Now Mexico supplies &#x20AC;96 million to EBITDA, which is a growth of 28%. Now the exchange rate is positive in the business with 12% revaluation of the dollar and also we have greater behavior of &#x2013; due to the availability of the plants. Now there is a 24.3% fall of non-energy due to the less real estate activity. And so we had EBITDA falling by 73%. Now the engineering business due to the contribution of international business has also fallen.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the analysis of the financial situation, we'll get into the tariff deficit, which is in the balance sheet in the first quarter. Now this tariff insufficiency accumulated from December 2008 is &#x20AC;2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now during the first quarter of 2009, there were funds for &#x20AC;53 million received and we had a new tariff insufficiency for IBERDROLA that reached &#x20AC;323 million additional. Now at the close of the first quarter 2009, the tariff insufficiency and impending charge is at &#x20AC;2.63 billion right now.</p>
          <p>And now shareholders' equity at the close of 2009 account for &#x20AC;26.1 billion, and the net debt, without considering the tariff deficit, is in &#x20AC;28.54 billion. Now the leverage therefore is at 52.2%. If we include the tariff deficit, the debt reaches &#x20AC;31.17 billion and the leverage is at 54.4.</p>
          <p>Now the level of leverage will reach its highest rate in 2009 &#x2013; in the first quarter of 2009, given the following reasons; first, the debt situation in the first quarter of 2009 was affected by the end of the payments, which are always behind in terms of the accounting of the investments made in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now this payment is going to be around &#x20AC;2 billion. Also we had the payment of the dividend and also the tariff deficit. Now this level of debt is going to be reduced during the year. First of all because it will &#x2013; we'll begin to see the reduction of the investment, which in the first quarter of 2009 were at &#x20AC;1 billion. And we'll be in that &#x2013; in line throughout the year, about 1 billion per quarter.</p>
          <p>We are also accelerating the divestment and we are hoping to pass in 2009 the &#x20AC;2.5 billion of divestment, and considering the recuperation of the tariff deficit during 2009, as in irrenounceable objective of the company as the Chairman pointed out.</p>
          <p>So with all that we expect to reach the following objectives by the end of 2009, which means a ratio of generated funds over debt, which will be over 19% and a coverage ratio of interest over 4.5 times, and retain cash flow over debt at a rate of 12.5%. And we hope to end the year with leverage below 48%.</p>
          <p>So we can improve our ratios by the end of 2009, reaffirming our financial solidity.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the breakdown of the debt by financial sources, we should point out that during the quarter, the weight of the debt in the capital market will increase due to the recent emissions, bond emissions will be compensated by the reduction in the bank financing.</p>
          <p>In terms of the structure of the debt by currencies, we try to balance this to minimize the volatility of the financial markets and gives us around 40% in euros and 25 or 30% in pounds and dollars.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the interest rates, as we spoke up, the variability of the debt of the Group at the end of, which is now, it went from 41 to 45% in this first quarter, this has allowed us to more than compensate for the increased spreads of the average cost of the debt.</p>
          <p>Now right now we have, as the Chairman pointed out, &#x20AC;9.1 billion of liquidity. At the end of 2009 we'll still be 6 billion, which covers all of the financing needs of the company foreseen for 2010 and for a good part of 2010 as well.</p>
          <p>Now we are going to finish up by looking at the maturity dates of which is the average maturity is around six years. We should also point out that we don't have a high concentration of maturity over the upcoming years given the balanced structure, and therefore we have low risk financing right now.</p>
          <p>Now the Chairman will conclude with his presentation of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that, Pep&#xE9;. So, once again, these results of the first quarter, now I'd like to just go through the main perspectives of the Group for 2009.</p>
          <p>Now we think that from a macroeconomic and energy standpoint, we expect that the main variables affecting the Group will have an improving trend, especially at the last part of the year. In other words, this situation couldn't be any worse, so it can only improve.</p>
          <p>So according to our estimates, electricity demand will recuperate gradually, especially in those markets where we had the biggest falls in the first part of this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of margins, we also expect progressive improvement, driven by the combination of more stable prices and fuel prices, which as the Financial Director said, will begin to reflect the lower prices of raw materials which were not reflected in the first quarter of the year. Now and in this context, IBERDROLA will also be favored by their competitive generation mix.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to delve deeper into our operational expenses control during the period. Now based on this, we will have a positive development in businesses in Spain.</p>
          <p>We will expect an increased hydro and nuclear production given the hydro plants that we have, more than 6,200 gigawatts, more than last year. And the renovation of some of our nuclear power plants during this first quarter, they've been recharging. Although this &#x2013; the thing they we're doing on the market will affect our 2009 generation, also energy prices will recuperate gradually by the end of the year, it's recuperating from these very low prices during the first quarter. Now also our contracts will reduce the cost of gas in Spain.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of regulated business, we trust that the positive trend will continue, as seen in the first quarter. In the UK, after the modification of prices of ScottishPower, which entered into force in the 1st of April, a comparison of the average of the year is still positive compared to last year, but we'll continue to monitor the market conditions for the rest of the year. Also we will continue to reduce costs that will allow us to reach the objectives &#x2013; the efficiency objectives that were established for our integration.</p>
          <p>Now in regulated business in the United States, we will delve deeper into benchmarking and best practices. And we'll continue the negotiating process with the regulators of the different states where we're working, in order to optimize the conditions of our company. This will have a major effect in 2010. But as I said before we also expect to have some of these positive impacts also by the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>In Latin America we will look to stability in Mexico where the development is very much affected by demand. And also in Renovables, as I mentioned, we expect the company to benefit during the year in the increase of the operational installed capacity, which is increasing. Also, by the end of the fourth quarter, we will have between 10.6 and 10,900 installed gigawatts, and 10,300 will be fully operational and therefore generating cash flow.</p>
          <p>We also expect to benefit from the prices that I talked about, the rise in prices also. During the course of the year, the different regulatory changes in the United States will benefit us, especially the tax incentives and their monetization, which will allow the company between 400 and $500 million of cash flow just in 2009 in the United States.</p>
          <p>Now, just to conclude, the results here show the solidity of our business model in very adverse economic conditions. Now in a period like the first quarter 2009, characterized by the fall in demand never seen in the past, very low prices, IBERDROLA has been able to maintain solid results. Now for the rest of the year, we expect the Group to have an important rise in EBITDA and recurring net profit. Now this trend to recuperation should continue throughout 2010 as well.</p>
          <p>And it's also we will continue to be cautious, however, given the situation. But the data that we have indicates greater recovery both in terms of demand and the futures prices. Also we expect that the regulatory framework will continue developing in a positive sense, both in Spain, where we are resolving the tariff deficit, and also in the U.S. and the UK, and also the advantages for renewables.</p>
          <p>So, with all of this, our projection is based on the estimates that we've made. We expect that the deviation will not affect us more than 10%. However, be rest assured that during the rest of the year, given the market conditions that I've talked about, we will do everything that we can, all the people in the company to reach the initial objectives established, as we always had in IBERDROLA.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll begin with the questions from the floor here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alejandro, I have various questions. My first question refers to the tariff deficit. I think the situation was very clear, but would you please give us more details concerning the timetable, concerning the recovery of this deficit? Second question, prices. Prices in Spain and in the United Kingdom, do you expect an improvement by the end of the year? Could you give us some indication of the sort of recovery you expect by the end of the year? Third question, the debt and the divestment, I have a feeling that you have increased your objective of divestment. Can you give us some additional indication concerning this divestment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning our deficit, you have looked the official statements by the government. The government intends to finish and conclude this deficit as soon as possible. We should be paid what we are supposed to pay in the less costly way for the citizens.</p>
          <p>In other words, the government has in mind a system that would give a guarantee of the government to use the debt as a cost. At the moment, we have a AA rating. And so the government is going to try and do it. The government shouldn't stop there. Last year, they decided to launch some spread in the months of March and April. And they said this was very expensive then. They could try it again now.</p>
          <p>Now what has been happening with AA, the spread that we will have to pay will be probably higher. And the cost for the citizens, the bills of the citizens will be lesser. In other words, we are all trying to reduce the cost for the citizens in the long term. We've been asking for such a decision and we'll see what happens on the market. And if they have to pay 300 basis points, they will have to pay for it. We have a right to get this money and this compensation. This has been recognized by the Supreme Court. In other words, the government should make the necessary measures. They could do it with a caution or a guarantee from the government, but we want to be paid. That has been recognized by the State and we &#x2013; there is an obligation for the state to pay, first of all.</p>
          <p>Secondly, this sector is a driver of the economy, and we don't want to be a problem for the economy. We want to give support to this economy. This is exactly what they've been doing in other countries. In other countries, they have found out that the energy sector could give a push to the economy. Some measures have been made in the United Kingdom, in the European Union and in the United States. And this is what we all want to do in Spain. We want to be part of the solution. We don't want to be a problem.</p>
          <p>Consequently we need to receive what we are supposed to get. I do believe this is going to be &#x2013; there is going to be a positive result and the government wants to do something for the benefit of the company. When? Well, we don't know. The government has been saying that they would do it immediately. Then a change of government a few days ago, so let's give them a few days to breathe, to start with, and be aware of the situation.</p>
          <p>I have a very positive feeling. As I said before, IBERDROLA is not going to stop there. Our legal proceedings will go on, and that's exactly what we are doing. There is a decision. We have launched a few appeals already against the government.</p>
          <p>Now concerning your second question, which is divestment. Our initial idea was to divest about &#x20AC;3 billion and we have divested more &#x2013; about &#x20AC;500 million. This is a little bit more that we expected. In IBERDROLA, we have many things. We have a lot of real estate. We have many buildings on the market. We also have other gas activities that do not fit with our electrical model. And we also have other assets that we could execute.</p>
          <p>Some of these things will be implemented and in a few days our colleagues will give us some very &#x2013; some additional information. So this is pending. We are acting. And we'll inform you in due time during our next meeting &#x2013; during the next weeks or month.</p>
          <p>Now concerning your third question related to prices in Spain, I'd give the floor to my colleague.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to give you the futures price in Spain or the forward prices in Spain. I'll try to explain to you how we analyze this trend. What's been happening during the first quarter in Spain? First of all, there has been a drop of demand of about 6%. There has been an increase of our output of the special regime that has reduced this thermal gap. And we have reduced it by 10-target. And this has reduced the refueling of coal and gas, so we had to burn it. There was an excess of supply, which means that there has been a drop in prices. Our prices have been lower than in the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>What is going to happen in the future? Now, first of all, the cost of fuel is going to go down, and so the price will be lower. But the Brent &#x2013; the futures of Brent will go up. This increase of the price will enable to reduce this increase of output. In other words, there won't be an excess of supply. The drop in demand will be attenuated, will be slowed down as well.</p>
          <p>In other words, these three factors will mean that prices will go up. In all futures and markets, the prices are growing. Every week, the prices are growing by &#x20AC;2 per megawatt hour. In other words, there is a clear trend to increase prices in Europe and in Spain in 2009, in particular, in 2010. Virginia?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My name is Virginia Sanz [Deutsche Bank]. Well, if we could contemplate a negative environment, the sales of assets would become very difficult and the tariff deficit would not be securitized as you expect this year, but next year. Is there a risk for the rating agencies to reduce your rating? And if so, do you still have a flexibility to reduce your investment? As you said yesterday, Renovables has not reduced its investment. Would you contemplate such a reduction? And would you introduce any changes in your dividend policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the deficit, I do not contemplate receiving the payment this year. We have the cash and we did it in 2002 already. Either we get this deficit this year or we don't. So, we don't even contemplate this sort of situation. Either we get it or we don't get it. In 2002, we managed to get it. In other words, this sort of situation is not contemplated at all. Now concerning the divestment, we do have a wide range of liquidities and assets because if you have a building you can sell it at any time. In other words, we have assets that can be easily sold when there is a demand. In other words, we don't contemplate not selling them. Now, of course, we probably won't get as much capital gain as we did in the past, but this is liquidity that can be easily sold. There is no doubt about it concerning the investment.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you that we have investment and we have current cost. We can play with the purchases and the investments. Not only we have investment, but we also have current cost in our OpEx, and we can control or postpone this cost. Sometimes it's necessary to have certain investments, other types of investments can be done in the future, in other words, a few aspects that will help us to manage this situation. As far as the deficit is concerned, this is not contemplated because we are getting the money either we get paid or we compensated. Concerning the dividend policy, there is no reason to change this dividend policy at the moment. Cesar?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Cesar Gonzalez. I have two questions. First one refers to the forward sales. Could you tell us what is the percentage of the 2009/2010 output in Spain that has already been sold, and what are the prices of the new contract? Secondly, what will be the evolution of the deficit? Who should contribute to this effort, which is required by the government? Some other companies are financing this deficit. Should we also include operators that work on the free market, including renewable companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We should put an end to this deficit. Decision of the government is to put an end to this deficit as soon as possible. Today, the legislation explains how we have to distribute this deficit during this spending period. Our major objective is to eliminate this deficit. As I said in the media, it should &#x2013; it can be eliminated because the regulated cost should be paid as they are. If the photovoltaic energy costs 16% but represents only 1.6%, someone has to pay for it. The cost is &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>And either this is part of the Spanish budget or this is paid by the consumers or by the distributing companies. We want to put an end to it. So we have to distribute the corresponding costs or establish the corresponding prices. And the time has come to do it. Here, we have a lower energy price so we can introduce this compensation without increasing the price for the consumers. We're talking about 1 or &#x20AC;2 per family and per month. We are talking about peanuts.</p>
          <p>And, in terms of the futures, Pedro, would you take that question, or the forward sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, beginning with 2009, I'll answer it directly, around 50% of our production is already sold. And the price levels we are talking about 50% above the average prices that we are seeing now. Now, this could seem high, but as we have said on other occasions, the prices of the kilowatt hours are diverse because we have the peak ones, the low rates, and therefore, so that 50% is because we put much more energy at the peak hours where the prices are the highest. Now for 2010, one-third of the base production is already sold.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of prices around 35% above the average foreseen prices now, this low &#x2013; the prices are higher than 2009. So maintaining these prices so that the customers what they want is stable prices, so the percentage of the higher pool is a little bit lower at 35%, but it's about practically the same amount.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin it's still even greater because three-fourth of the objective margin for 2009 is already closed. So not all of the energy achieves this standard margin. There is a lower percentage of energy that has the greater part of the margin. So three-fourth of the objective margin has already been closed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now just a clarification please, my question on the deficit is really to &#x2013; what we see in the press about subsidies and so forth in principle to the contributors, those who are now financing that deficit, or are we talking about companies &#x2013; renewable companies in this that are only on the free market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now what I said to the press, I don't know if I agree with what the Ministry is doing. I think we need to wait and see for what the Ministry does and we can't trust the newspapers. Right now, I think it's too early to talk about whether there is going to be &#x2013; or what it's going to be like we just have a definition of three subjects. We want &#x2013; this government wants to end the deficit, that's the first thing, to pay past debts and to eliminate future debts. Secondly, they want to do this in the least costly fashion for consumers or for those most disadvantaged consumers, and based on that, everything else is still on the table about how they are going to do it. And so I &#x2013; well there is a strong will to end the deficit. That's all I can really say at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we have one more question from the floor here. Let's get now into the telephone questions. I think there is going to be a number of questions from Rome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The first question comes from Pablo Cuadrado from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have three questions. The first has to do with ScottishPower. Now the results show strength despite the depreciation of the pound and the results have been quite positive. So I wanted to know if you could give me some guidance for the next quarters, given the fall in retail prices, electricity and gas, and also more standard production in terms of output?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with distribution in Spain. Pedro mentioned that part of the growth in the first quarter, there is some liquidations from previous years, maybe you can give us a figure of that amount. And the last has to do with the guidance for this year. The Chairman just mentioned that there is still a growth in EBITDA and also growth in net profit, but I thought that for this year net profit, when we saw the results of 2008, they were talking about growth in line with last year, and then there was also some comments that I didn't understand very well about the objective for 2010. So maybe if you could just talk about the vision in terms of operational guidance for 2009. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer your last questions first. In terms of the profits in Spain, I think, we are repeating the same. Our EBITDA will grow and our ordinary profit removing the extraordinary as we saw last year, there was 500 million, we'll see &#x2013; so, it depends on the divestments that we make, therefore we are going to have some big capital gains or average capital gains or lower capital gains. But with the business, the actual business that we are talking about, our guidance is that that ordinary profit in this quarter 790 or 780 some million in net profit.</p>
          <p>We will have a very similar or slightly better result, ordinary bottom line, compared to last year, now extraordinary would be variable with important growth in EBITDA. We haven't changed anything that's going to be exactly the same terms. Maybe I didn't explain things very well, but our vision is to maintain this year our ordinary profit to be similar or slightly better than last year. And in terms of extraordinary, well, we'll have to see the ability of Pedro Azagra to get good prices from the divestments to have, and you have the best selling price for those assets.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of 2010, well, I was being very careful. I talked about the scenario, each week the prices were going up by &#x20AC;2, to make forecast with such a volatile market is very difficult. So what we're seeing with our best estimates, and we think that in the worst-case scenario, or the scenario that we are envisaging, our net profit for 2010 will not be or &#x2013; will have a negative effect in the worst-case scenario by 10%, based on that we had envisaged for 2010.</p>
          <p>I think that if this happened, then we would have gone from a crisis situation that we like one that we have never seen to very favorable conditions. But I'm being very, very careful, because it's very difficult to predict such volatility in the markets, in terms of demand, the exchange rates and so forth. So our macroeconomic experts here, well, they are doing their best they can to try to give us this overview, but it's very difficult with the futures markets that are changing by &#x20AC;2 per week and rising.</p>
          <p>Well then, we could find that this situation could be very fantastic in the future, or if the volatility goes in the opposite direction, then we have to analyze that. But our vision right now is that we are talking about that range of 10% vis-&#xE0;-vis what we had estimated for 2010, we will at least maintain the ordinary results. Excuse me. In 2009, we'll maintain the ordinary results of 2008. And the liquidation of distribution this year, in terms of this first quarter, were insignificant, not even &#x20AC;4 million. So that's not at all relevant. And ScottishPower, would you answer that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of ScottishPower, we expect a very solid year despite the price tension that we saw in the first quarter. But we are seeing a year that's going to very positive based on the synergies of the Group that we are achieving.</p>
          <p>Secondly, based on the austerity policy that the ScottishPower team is using and they're being very, very &#x2013; controlling costs very, very well. And thirdly, we are also carrying out a commercial policy, focusing on the high-value customers and we expect there to have a greater impact on our bottom line and maintain this same trend that we've seen in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You just mentioned that you want to talk about guidance for 2009, and I'm going to repeat this. We have this scenario that Amparo talked about, and so with the same stress situation for the Group, but in no case are we envisaging lower ordinary profits, but rather rises compared to last year. So I just want to talk &#x2013; just as I mentioned that 10%, I do want to say we'll have better results than last year. And I'm talking about the worst-case scenario here, a situation &#x2013; a kind of a rock-bottom situation. Next question please.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Alberto Gandolfi [UBS].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. The first question, I've been hearing that you are quite positive about generation costs, but we still have 20% discount, for example, compared to the German prices. Can you talk a little bit about what you foresee in 2010 for generation prices and your outlook of profits? Because this year, you're &#x2013; also you are profiting from a rise in prices, an average rise with bilateral contacts, 56, plus the payment of capacity.</p>
          <p>Now the forward market is around 45%, so for 2010 it could be another challenging year. And you have that &#x20AC;3.5 billion optimistic outlook. Can you talk about that? Now, my second question, leverage. If we look at the net debt, with this &#x2013; adjusted with this tariff deficit would be around 3.8, 3.9 over EBITDA. Now, it could be borderline for the rating. Can you talk a little bit about your priorities? If tomorrow, for example, a rating agency said that they're going to give you a BBB, what would be your strategy, your contingency plan? Would you cut the dividend? Would you sell assets? How would you compensate or do you envisage a capital increase?</p>

          <p>Right now, the forward prices in Spain are lower than the rest of Europe. They are around 40, &#x20AC;45 per megawatt hour. But, for example, we are seeing now prices in Germany, France, Holland, for 2010, right now, around 55, 54, &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour. And my opinion is that there is no reason that in 2010 there would be lower prices in Spain than those of the rest of Europe. So for &#x2013; we are envisaging for 2010 prices at least of around 55, 54, &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour for the basic charge, the basic load. Now several comments. First, Alberto, I think that the Chairman mentioned the vision for 2010. You're talking about that 3.5 billion that we just talked about &#x2013; talked about the vision of 2010, around 10% that the Chairman just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to the subject of ratios, the first thing is IBERDROLA has a business model which, as you know, has a percentage almost of 50% in regulated business. IBERDROLA business is basically in high-stability countries, the U.S., the UK and Spain. Therefore the rating agencies are assigned, more or less, ratios based on their perspectives and characteristics of the business. We have a very good relationship with the rating agencies. And they're very much aware of the &#x2013; our plans for the future. And therefore we've been talking with them about our plans and our perspectives. And here we just presented in our results an acceleration of divestment in 2009. We're talking now about over &#x20AC;2.5 billion in divestment. And we've also presented objective ratios for the end of the year. And there we expect to comply with what we &#x2013; with the information that we've given to the agencies.</p>
          <p>So, first of all, we're taking the necessary initiatives. And we hope to finish the year with debt levels and leverage ratios and coverage of cash flow that will allow us to maintain our financial situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions and a clarification. First of all, concerning Energy East. Once you have discounted the bookkeeping effects, which are rather stable in the regulated business, do you expect the same level of EBITDA for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>Second question, concerning the financing or funding, we're talking about divestments. Let's assume that you don't divest as quickly as you can. Do you expect to go to the capital market? And do you expect to reduce the part of the fixed interest in the variable interest?</p>
          <p>Then a clarification concerning the forward contracts. You said that 50% of those, of the 2009 production, is already sold in the market. This is more or less the same percentage that you mentioned three months ago. Could you explain to me why there is no evolution, no change in this percentage, vis-&#xE0;-vis three months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you all know, the American business is a regulated business. It is related to a certain stability, but the income curve is related to the energy consumption. Revenues in the first quarter are greater than the rest of the year, so we don't &#x2013; we won't get the same results in the rest of the year. But the development, the evolution, will correspond to our annual forecasts for the Group. These results, of course, are related to a certain stability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now concerning the fixed and variable interest rates, let me tell you that we have achieved more or less the level that we wanted. Introducing a variable element is something positive. But we need to be very cautious in our structure because if things were changing, the rate of interest may grow, may increase. So we have to very cautious and prudent. We'll have maintained a level of 45, 50% between the fixed and variable interest.</p>
          <p>Concerning the divestment, as our Chairman said, these divestments are in process at the moment. So we expect to conduct these divestments this year. As our Chairman said, all these assets can be easily sold in the market. You know that there is no reason to think that we are not going to comply with our objective this year in 2009. And this is based on objective data.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And congratulations for your results. If I may, I'd like to put four questions. First question, I'd like to refer to the expectations concerning the price increase. What will be the estimation of the price established at the end of this year or next year? You're comparing to German prices, but the coal is establishing this price. In Spain the price is based on gas and apparently the situation of the gas at international level doesn't change.</p>
          <p>Could you also quantify the cost reduction that you contemplate for this year?</p>
          <p>And third, what is the energy component of the domestic price that you charge at the moment if we compare to a universal tariff?</p>
          <p>And last question, in local currency can you tell us to what has been the cost reduction or expense reduction in ScottishPower during the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is true that we're talking about the forward price in Germany, but in the rest of Europe the forward prices are also in line. In the United Kingdom they have &#x20AC;60, they have 56 in France, 54 in Germany. Whatever the origin, gas or carbon or coal, the forward prices are all what all others achieved the same level. Pedro?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the forward prices, the gas and the coal prices become more and more competitive and are getting closer. This is probably due to the structure of the gas and coal sales forces. CO2 price of Brent and gas are very similar and there is a high competition between all of us, as this can be seen in Spain and in Germany where we have an important volume of operation even if we don't have assets. This is the current situation at the moment. I wouldn't say this has been influenced by coal in Germany and gas in Spain.</p>
          <p>Concerning this adjacent price, this is &#x2013; I don't understand the question. If I understand correctly your question, I shall say that not all the consumers pay the same price, but the range would be between five and &#x2013; 50 and &#x20AC;57. Some consumers consume less and others consume more. So the price would &#x2013; the range would be between 50 and &#x20AC;57.</p>
          <p>Concerning the operation cost in sterling, in pounds, that dropped slightly. But there is an increase of output of about 10%. In other words we've managed to reduce the cost but we've increased the output.</p>
          <p>And concerning the cost and the expenses in our company, we have, on the one hand, energy, Energy East, where we're just starting. We have not sold anything yet because we're trying to know the company. And as to the other companies of our Group, our objective is not to overcome the expense of last year. We want to reduce our expenses every last year. The current expenditure of the company will be either the same or less than last year. There shouldn't be any increase vis-&#xE0;-vis last year, with the exception of Energy East, which is a special case.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has increased slightly. During the first quarter of 2008 we had some very positive results. During the first quarter of 2008 we conducted many operations. That market was very buoyant. Then this year it's been slightly positive, but if we have a year-on-year comparison, that means a drop vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter of 2008. In other words it's still positive, but do not forget that the first quarter 2008 meant some very good results in our gas operations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all. I have a few questions. Firstly if we can revisit this issue of the 2010 guidance. The way I look at it, your target at the moment, at least on paper, is &#x20AC;3.5 billion. You are suggesting that you could be 10% short of that. So that strikes me that you are, at this particular moment in time, issuing somewhat of a thinly veiled profit warning. So could I have your comments on that, please?</p>
          <p>If we look at the 2009 guidance of getting at least EBITDAR of being equivalent to last year's level, obviously you've got a significant consolidation impact from the inclusion of Energy East for a full year, which suggests to me that certain of the other business lines are going to be in retreat. So if you could give a little bit of color around that.</p>
          <p>And then on the tariff deficit issue, I hear what you're saying about what the government has promised, but we are quite clearly in tough economic situations. The Spanish unemployment is going up. I'm sure the Spaniards need to balance the books at a country level. Taking from the utility companies is potentially an easy way to do this. And if we go back in time, quite clearly the Spanish government has made unexpected and adverse raids on the utility companies before. So I kind of feel that your optimism that you will get full receipt of the tariff deficit is somewhat misplaced.</p>
          <p>And then finally I hear exactly what you're saying about the prices in other countries being higher, but one of the things that Spain has that perhaps places like the UK and Germany don't have, is a surplus of generation capacity. Quite clearly you're in an over-capacity situation at the moment, with generous reserve margins. And that strikes me as a reason why prices in Spain can stay lower than prices in some other countries for a reasonable period of time, hence further hurting your objectives for 2010. So your thoughts on that, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't hear your questions very clearly but we will try to answer them. If not, maybe you'll have to ask them again because the sound was not very good. And the Chairman also said that you could even send your questions by email we could answer those for you. But anyway, we'll try to answer the questions. First of all the first two questions, I understood those. And then when you got on to the tariff deficit and the sound wasn't so good there. And then there was the subject of working capital.</p>
          <p>I think that the Chairman was very clear. We can state this again, but given the current circumstances in terms of the objectives that we have for 2010, we are seeing that, given the evolution of prices and so forth right now, we're seeing around 10% below what we had envisaged, those 3.5 billion. So I don't think we can be anymore clear than that. That's one thing.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I don't think that you understood the EBITDA issue. The EBITDA is going to grow significantly in 2010 vis-&#xE0;-vis 2009. What we're also saying is that we expect that net profit, the recurring net profit, will grow, so &#x2013; or the profit, recurring net profit will grow also vis-&#xE0;-vis 2008, just as EBITDA. I want to make that very, very clear.</p>
          <p>First of all 10%, we're saying around 10% around that 3.5 billion for 2010. And we continue to expect for this year significant growth of EBITDA and also significant growth of recurring net profit as well. I want to be very clear on that.</p>
          <p>I'm going to see &#x2013; maybe if I understood your deficit question. Firstly, I repeat, the deficit is an obligation &#x2013; compulsory payment from the state. This is recognized in the &#x2013; by the Supreme Court in a judgment of 28th January this year. The spirit and declarations of the government is that they want to end the deficit during this legislative period.</p>
          <p>Therefore there's two parts, one to pay the amount from the past that they owe, and also to take the necessary measures so there's no future deficit. Now to pay their debt, the responsibility to make &#x2013; to provide the necessary resources is at the National Energy Commission, therefore they have the capacity to emit bonds for that debt, to pay that debt.</p>
          <p>Now debt from &#x2013; this was done successfully last year. Then the financial markets changed and it was not successful. Maybe in one case given the conditions &#x2013; the conditions were excessively outside of what the market was stating at that time. But they continued to do that. Right now they do have margin to do that.</p>
          <p>Now what we're talking or what is being talked about in different for is how that this bond, the selling of bonds for the debt can be as least expensive as possible for the customers. And, first of all, it's better to sell bonds and therefore it's less costly to sell bonds, therefore the repercussions in the future regulated terms will have a lesser impact.</p>
          <p>Now when do we think that we will be given this? In principle the scenario that we're looking at is that this debt, and this was even stated by the President of the Businessmen's Organization, stated that this should be finished by or before this summer. So we're still talking about the same scenario here. So I hope that all of the necessary instruments to carry this out are in place in a very short period of time.</p>
          <p>The third question, I don't &#x2013; about the generation process and the pressure of the installed capacity or, I think, extra capacity or excessive capacity, installed capacity in Spain, I think that was the question. Paco, maybe you could take that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The question was if maybe in terms of the lower prices in Spain compared to other countries, maybe that's because that we have an over-capacity in Spain that doesn't exist in other countries. That was the question, I think.</p>
          <p>More than an over-capacity in terms of installed generation, I think Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro mentioned this, what we have is an over-contracting at a very particular point in time where the thermal gap fell by one third. And this was just in one quarter. Now at that time, effectively, the prices, in my opinion, have reached rock bottom because there was that over-contracting of fuel that Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro talked about.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the future I don't really agree that this over-capacity or in terms of the reserve margin could cause in a fall in prices. In fact, the reality is that almost all of this energy is practically at the same level of cost. So at the end it won't matter that it's one or the other. We'll look at the competitive edge of which one is more operationally efficient. But the price, at the end of the day, will be fixed by that. We're talking about variable costs over the short term. Then we have to see that the offers also do have to recover the marginal long-term cost. In any case, Martin, excuse us for the low quality of the telephone line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we're going to look at the web questions. But first I'm going to put on my glasses to read what I have here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's from Pernice Anelka. He wants to know if we're going to go to the bond market this year again. That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do expect to do that. But more towards the end of the year whether due to constantly being with 12 months of liquidity on the horizon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is on the debt from James Sparrow from the Royal Bank of Scotland. Can we explain the movement of the circulating capital of that &#x20AC;1 billion in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this basically has two components. The first is the increase in the tariff deficit of &#x20AC;300 million, and also it's going &#x2013; something else is going to improve throughout the year. Both Energy East and ScottishPower have a trend to charge on a flat rate through the year. So typically in the first quarter, since there's more consumption of electricity, they have &#x2013; they generate a lack of circulating capital because these are elements that will &#x2013; then are recovered throughout the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>So this 1 billion will tend to improve during the year, improving the profile of debt of the Group. But these are two of the fundamental elements that explain this growth that you referred to.</p>
          <p>And that's the end of the questions. If there are any more questions, please use the web page for that and we would be very happy to answer those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question here about the subject of leverage. That 48%, if that's included in the target, and whether this does include the tariff deficit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the quick answer is that we hope that this is relevant. The idea is that we are going to receive the money from the tariff deficit during the year so that 48% does take it in. We will be receiving that money from the tariff deficit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks very much to all of you. And we hope that these forecasts and we hope that markets react as we expect them and that the prices go &#x2013; are even better than we're expecting.</p>
          <p>So thanks very much and we'll see you next time.</p>
