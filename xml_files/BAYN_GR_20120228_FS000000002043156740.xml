        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cleo. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome, also on behalf of my colleagues, to our conference call during which we will review our fourth quarter and full-year figures with you. With me on the call are Marijn Dekkers, our CEO, and Werner Baumann, our CFO. HealthCare is represented by J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt; CropScience by Sandra Peterson; and MaterialScience by Patrick Thomas.</p>
          <p>Marijn will start off with a brief summary of the developments in the fourth quarter and our achievements in the full year. We assume you have all received and reviewed the briefing document and the slides, so we'll just run you through the main points. Before handing over to Marijn, I'd also like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alexander. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. 2011 was a very good year for Bayer. We grew our business and we substantially improved earnings. We achieved the targets that we raised after the first quarter, and against this background, we are proposing at the shareholders meeting to increase the dividend to &#x20AC;1.65 per share.</p>
          <p>As the global economic recovery lost momentum during the second half of 2011, we were faced with mixed business performance in the fourth quarter. HealthCare and CropSciences performed in line, but MaterialScience clearly below our expectations.</p>
          <p>During 2011, we continued to aggressively pursue our strategy of targeted investment in our innovation capability, and in this respect, we were especially successful in 2011. At Pharma, we now have four new products with blockbuster potential which are launching or expect to launch near-term. Our Crop Protection new product pipeline includes products with a combined sales potential of approximately &#x20AC;2 billion. We also successfully strengthened our presence in the dynamic emerging markets, where sales moved ahead by 9% in 2011.</p>
          <p>We're creating the necessary financial flexibility through the restructuring program we communicated in November 2010, to improve efficiency and reduce internal complexity. This program is proceeding as planned, according the principle More Innovation, Less Administration." We're looking with a good level of confidence to 2012 and are targeting higher sales and earnings, although the outlook for the global economy, and especially for the eurozone, is marked by uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Let me now elaborate on some key figures for the fourth quarter. When talking about sales, I will concentrate on portfolio and currency-adjusted data. Group sales rose by 2%, to &#x20AC;9.2 billion, in the quarter. This was largely attributable to a good performance at Consumer Health and CropScience. Reported EBIT rose significantly, to &#x20AC;629 billion (sic) [million], mainly due to lower special charges. In Q4 2011, earnings were diminished by net special charges of &#x20AC;250 million, mainly from restructuring, compared to net special charges of &#x20AC;954 million in the previous-year quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA declined by 9%, mainly caused by a sharp drop in earnings at MaterialScience. HealthCare and CropScience were able to increase earnings. Net cash flow receded by 41%, to &#x20AC;1.152 billion, and was impacted by the payments made in connection with litigations concerning LibertyLink Rice of &#x20AC;484 million.</p>
          <p>After investments of &#x20AC;725 million, the operating free cash flow came in at &#x20AC;427 million. Net income in the fourth quarter amounted to &#x20AC;397 million. Earnings per share rose to &#x20AC;0.48, while core earnings per share came in at &#x20AC;0.97, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter.</p>
          <p>How does this development break down by segment? HealthCare sales rose by 2%. Business in Pharma slightly increased, by 1%, with declines in Europe and the U.S. offset by higher sales in the emerging economies and Japan. Sales of Consumer Health moved ahead by 5%, with all divisions contributing to the growth. The adjusted EBITDA of HealthCare was up 4%, driven by the business expansion in Consumer Health.</p>
          <p>CropScience sales increased by 3% due to higher volumes, especially at Crop Protection in Latin America, as well as due to a favorable BioScience development. The adjusted EBITDA increased slightly. It included a divestment gain of &#x20AC;22 million, half the size of the gain in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience sales were on last year's level, with higher prices compensating for lower volumes. The adjusted EBITDA fell sharply, by 64%. Higher selling prices were not able to compensate for the impact of higher raw material price.</p>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, let me now briefly comment on our full-year performance against the targets we set ourselves for 2011. Group sales in fiscal 2011 rose by 6%, to a record &#x20AC;36.5 billion, exceeding our original target of &#x20AC;35 billion to &#x20AC;36 billion sales. With an adjusted EBITDA of &#x20AC;7.6 billion generated in 2011, we clearly exceeded our original target to increase adjusted EBITDA towards &#x20AC;7.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Core EPS was originally forecast to improve by 10%. We achieved a 15%-plus; again, more than we communicated early 2011. And we were also able to substantially reduce our net financial debt by &#x20AC;0.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let me discuss 2011 for the three subgroups versus their respective targets. HealthCare showed only modest growth in 2011, but its operating result improved significantly. As in the previous year, the Pharma segment was hampered by the efforts of many countries to reduce health system costs.</p>
          <p>Intense competition from generic products also presented an ongoing challenge. That makes it all the more important that our cost management was successful, that our Consumer Health segment outperformed the market, and that we achieved or exceeded our communicated targets.</p>
          <p>Boosted by improved weather conditions in the major growing regions and good prices for agricultural commodities, our CropScience subgroup posted encouraging sales growth and an even better increase in earnings compared with a relatively weak 2010, and thus achieved or exceeded our communicated target.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience, however, clearly experienced the increasing volatility in the global economy. In 2010, this subgroup had re-attained its pre-crisis sales level more quickly than expected, and continued to expand in the early part of 2011, but in the fourth quarter, particularly, we felt the impact of the cooling economy and the growing burden of high raw material costs. As a result, MaterialScience posted continuing sales growth but a drop in the operating result, and thus fell short of our communicated earnings target.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, 2011 as a whole was operationally a very successful year for Bayer. In addition, we made significant strategic progress. I personally believe the highlight of 2011 from a strategic point of view was the fantastic regulatory and scientific progress we achieved in our Pharma pipeline. This was well ahead of the expectations we had at the start of the year and allowed us to selectively raise the peak sales estimates for some of these future products.</p>
          <p>We currently have four drug products with blockbuster potential which are either already marketed or at an advanced stage of development. This is good news for patients and also for Bayer, as each of these products could achieve peak annual sales in excess of &#x20AC;1 billion. They include the eye medicine VEGF Trap-Eye and the cancer drugs Alpharadin and Regorafenib, and we can confirm the peak sales potential of more than &#x20AC;2 billion per year for our innovative anticoagulant, Xarelto, following its approval in new indications in the United States, the EU, and Japan.</p>
          <p>For many years, CropSciences has steadily brought new innovative solutions for farmers to the market. With products launched since 2006, we expect to cross the &#x20AC;1 billion mark this year. A good example &#x2013; a recent example of our new product strength is the Xpro family of fungicides introduced in 2011. This novel technology improves disease control in cereals and has positive effects on plant physiology, which in turn increases stress tolerance and boosts grain yields. We believe this product family has a peak annual sales potential of more than &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>With innovative crop protection products launched in 2011 and to be introduced until 2015, we intend to generate combined peak sales of approximately &#x20AC;2 billion. This is a strong commitment that shows how confident we are that our CropScience's research pipeline will deliver.</p>
          <p>In addition to innovation, another major factor for our future success is of course our presence in the dynamic emerging markets. As always, our definition of emerging markets comprises those outside of the industrialized countries such as the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. In this context, I'm very pleased to report that during 2011 we posted 9% growth in the emerging economies, which account for 36% of Group sales.</p>
          <p>The figure is well above average growth rates of other regions and underscores how well-positioned we are in these countries and that our significant investments there are really paying off. Let me give you some examples of our emerging markets investments.</p>
          <p>China is the fastest-growing country for our HealthCare franchise. To ensure that we are sufficiently staffed in this rapidly-growing nation, we hired around 1,000 additional sales reps in 2011. Furthermore, we relocated the headquarters of our primary care business to Beijing. At CropScience, we opened up a new seed treatment application center in Brazil and received approval for Liberty Link Soybean in Argentina.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience inaugurated a new TDI production facility with a planned capacity of 250,000 tons per year at the Bayer integrated site in Shanghai. And we moved our polycarbonates headquarters to Shanghai in order to be there where most of our customers are. So all our subgroups delivered strong growth in the emerging markets. HealthCare posted a 10% growth in emerging markets. Pharma even grew by 24% in China.</p>
          <p>CropSciences grew by 11% in emerging markets. Highlights were a 50% increase in Brazil and a 21% growth in Eastern Europe. MaterialScience increased by 7% in emerging markets. Sales in China receded growth by 3%, driven by volume losses in all business units.</p>
          <p>So we aggressively pursued our strategy of targeted investments in our innovation capability and in emerging markets. We are creating the necessary financial flexibility through the restructuring program we communicated in November 2010 to improve efficiency and reduce internal complexity. Measures leading to annualized savings of &#x20AC;543 million were already implemented by the end of Q4.</p>
          <p>Now let me look at our planning for 2012. Our budgets for 2012 build on the following timing assumptions. In our opinion, the outlook for the global economy in 2012, and especially for the eurozone, is marked by uncertainty. GDP growth in Europe and North America will be most likely significantly lower compared to last year. By contrast, the major emerging economies are forecast to grow rapidly again in 2012, with China albeit at reduced speed. We have based our budgets on a U.S. exchange rate of $1.40 to the euro and an average crude oil price of US$110 per barrel.</p>
          <p>We're fairly optimistic for the development of our life science markets during 2012. We expect the growth rate for the pharma market to be in the mid-single-digits, driven by the emerging countries. The OTC market is likely to expand at low -to mid-single-digit percentages, with higher rates in the emerging markets being offset by slower expansion in Europe and the U.S. The diabetes care market will probably see growth at a low-single-digit rate, and the animal health market will probably show moderate growth.</p>
          <p>The market environment for the global seed and crop protection business is expected to remain favorable in 2012. We expect crop commodity prices to remain relatively high, prompting further investment in seed and crop protection products in order to safeguard and raise crop yields. We anticipate that the MaterialScience main customer industries will continue to grow, though perhaps more slowly. We continue to expect robust global growth in the automotive industry, as well as for the global electrical and electronics industries. The recovery in the construction industry is likely to continue in 2012, whereas global furniture sales in 2012 are likely to show small growth.</p>
          <p>Now, in this context, we can look to 2012 with cautious optimism. For the Group, we are targeting a sales increase of about 3%. Based on our currency assumptions, we therefore expect Group sales to come in at around &#x20AC;37 billion. We're planning a slight improvement in adjusted EBITDA. We also plan to slightly improve core earnings per share. What does this mean for our subgroups?</p>
          <p>HealthCare's top priority for 2012 is to successfully commercialize the new pharmaceutical products. We expect sales to increase by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. We plan to slightly improve adjusted EBITDA, although earnings are likely to be hampered by higher marketing expenses and the effects of the genericization of Yasmin in Europe.</p>
          <p>We forecast sales of the Pharmaceutical segment in 2012 to remain stable or move slightly higher, and adjusted EBITDA to approximately match the prior-year level. In the Consumer Health segment, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in sales and in adjusted EBITDA. We expect market conditions for our CropScience business to remain favorable in 2012. We predict above-market growth and anticipate that sales and adjusted EBITDA will advance by mid-single-digit percentages.</p>
          <p>In light of the weaker development in 2011, we currently forecast sales and adjusted EBITDA in 2012 for MaterialScience to remain level with the prior year. Should the market environment develop more favorably than anticipated, we could see sales and earnings to increase accordingly.</p>
          <p>For MaterialScience, forecast sales in the first quarter of 2012 to be roughly level with the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be well above the figure for the fourth quarter of 2011 but below the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our budget for R&amp;D and CapEx remains at a high level. We've planned capital expenditures of &#x20AC;1.5 billion for property, plant, and equipment, and &#x20AC;0.4 billion for intangible assets. We expect research and development spending to continue on the high level of recent years, at about &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>So, before opening the Q&amp;A session, let me summarize the main points. 2011 was a very good year for Bayer. We set records in terms of sales and earnings. Growth in the emerging markets came in well above the global average. Our Pharma pipeline exceeded our expectations in 2011. We are looking with confidence to 2012 and are targeting higher sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>This now concludes my remarks, and we are now happy to entertain your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Tim Race. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, guys. This is Tim Race here from Deutsche Bank. Two Pharma questions, if I may, and a CropScience question. First of all, the obligatory Xarelto question, just on the chronics use; we've had a few weeks of sales by you in Europe and perhaps the U.S. sales by your partner. Could you just comment on what trends you're seeing and how you think the launch is going so far? Looking at the U.S. prescription trends, it looks a little bit slow, but obviously we're talking about a chronic market and new patients here, so maybe you could talk about the dynamics between new patients and switch patients perhaps.</p>
          <p>Then the second question on Pharma, just on Yasmin, obviously relatively strong still in the fourth quarter; when should we start seeing weakness in Europe hitting in the tape as it were, and just if you could help describe the dynamics of its decline in Europe perhaps? And then just on CropScience, we saw in the fourth quarter, negative pricing effects. Could you talk about what to expect in pricing in 2012 and whether the fourth quarter was just a blip? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So the two Pharma questions, J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Yeah, let me give you some color on our launch of Xarelto, as much as that's possible after a few weeks in the market now. We have launched in the meantime in 24 countries. This is exclusive to U.S., so it's 25 with the U.S. The most important launch, obviously, from a Bayer's perspective, is our performance in Germany. We have now been in the market for around seven weeks.</p>
          <p>Our market share, in the meantime, is at a level of 6.8%, which is absolutely in line with our expectations and is totally in line with plan. We do see a good response in the market in Germany from cardiologists and also from primary care physicians. We see this market share growing quite nicely. So, all together, after these few weeks in Germany, we are quite happy with the launch.</p>
          <p>When we look into the U.K., the situation is a little bit different. As you know, we are still negotiating, discussing with NICE. We do expect some feedback from NICE now by the middle of March. In the meantime, you have seen that we got approval from the Scottish NHS system at a favorable price of &#xA3;2.10. That is according to expectations and really is a good sign also for the overall U.K. market, but obviously we'll have to wait for the final outcome somewhere in the second half of March.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we are preparing for the launch in April. We'll get the NHI price listing in April and we'll then launch immediately, so first sales should happen towards the end of April, beginning of May. As you know, in the rest of Europe, we are going through price negotiations and reimbursements discussions. Current expectation is that in the major markets like Italy, France, and Spain, we will be on the market in the third quarter. We expect there agreements on price and reimbursement in summertime. But that's at the moment still a little bit open. In Canada, we have launched, and we are actually quite happy with the launch after the second week, so there is not much I can refer to.</p>
          <p>Now, in the U.S., obviously, you have listened to our partner, J&amp;J, and I don't want to comment that much. I can only repeat what J&amp;J is saying. They are quite happy with the launch so far and it's according to their expectations. I think what we can also see is that we are gaining market share in new patients. When you look at patients that are totally new to the brand, we see a continuous increase in the share for Xarelto and we see some decline in the share for Pradaxa.</p>
          <p>What is also interesting is to observe that the percent of new patients on warfarin is still relatively high. One might have expected that the majority of new patients gets onto the new drugs, which apparently is still not the case. We are still at a level close to 50% of new patients going onto warfarin. This is declining, but it takes time. So, overall, we are quite pleased with what we are seeing. We are confident that we will make Xarelto the success that we're all expecting it to be.</p>
          <p>Regarding Yasmin, yes, we do see some initial impact in Europe, which is compensated by growth that we have for these brands in Latin America and also in Japan, but that was the rest of last year. We do now, in the first quarter and second quarter, expect a stronger impact on Yasmin. We have been guiding for a &#x20AC;100 million decline in Europe for 2012, and we are still sticking to that. We do see a pretty stable business in the U.S. and some growth in other parts of the world, so overall we believe that Yasmin, the whole franchise will see a single-digit decline for 2012 going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, J&#xF6;rg; and then, Sandy, about pricing in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks for the question. I think the simple answer to your question is fourth quarter pricing is somewhat of a blip, but I think we should put it in context, that if you look back in 2010, we actually were able to sustain our pricing, unlike many other in the marketplace, so we're cycling that effect. And in the fourth quarter, we actually, in our European markets as well as in our BioScience business, saw a positive increase in pricing in the marketplace. And as we're in the middle of the first quarter, pricing seems to be relatively stable, and we've been able to take price in a number of markets, and it seems to be sticking. So I think that we're feeling pretty good about where we are from a pricing and a margin standpoint going into 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, are you with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch; a few questions, if I could. Firstly, on Xarelto, just wondered on physician feedback from launch, what aspects of the profile are you getting the most traction with relative to Pradaxa? And then in terms of &#x2013; you mentioned, I think, 50% of new patients still staying on warfarin. What seems to be the biggest sticking point preventing docs from switching to the novel agents? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question; I think within your release you pointed to an increase in R&amp;D as you move into 2013. Given the end of Xarelto/Riociguat/Eylea programs are largely coming to an end, just wondering what Phase II to III transitions could be driving an increase in spend as we look into 2013. And then just one question on MaterialScience, raw material cost sensitivity; you're guiding at $110. Clearly, your price is above that. Just wondered if you could discuss the sensitivity around that and ability to pass on those prices? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah, J&#xF6;rg, can you take the first one on Xarelto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding the profile, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody that, at the end of the day, convenience is playing a significant role here, and the once-a-day profile of Xarelto is certainly very attractive for physicians and also patients. Other than that, I believe that the perspective in the market and among physicians is that these products are comparable, as long as they haven't gained their own experience with it, and I believe that's also a reason why to switch out of warfarin takes more time.</p>
          <p>People want to gain experience with a handful of patients with these new products before they feel comfortable to switch fully onto them, and that's why I believe that the replacement of warfarin may take a little bit longer than what some people would have expected. But it will happen. We, the feedback that we hear is that physicians, once they have patients on Xarelto, are very happy with the product and stick to it.</p>
          <p>So that's also a comment on the second question, why do we still see a significant percentage on warfarin. I also believe that we may see a difference over time here between the U.S. and the rest of the world. I believe that you can see from the German market share that this switch out of warfarin may be faster in other parts of the world than it is in the U.S., but it's something that you will simply have to observe going forward.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll take the R&amp;D question because I'm not sure that we communicated the right way, if you say it's going to increase significantly. We were, in 2011, around &#x20AC;2.9 billion R&amp;D. We're planning &#x20AC;3 billion for this year. We were &#x20AC;3.1 in 2010. So we've been hanging around the &#x20AC;3 billion level. Of course, some expensive studies from Xarelto have come to an end, but they are being replaced with other studies like Riociguat, Regorafenib, Alpharadin on the Pharma side. We're also aggressively expanding our R&amp;D in BioSciences in anything that has to do with seeds and seed traits. So, overall, this &#x20AC;3 billion level feels right at the moment, but is not really a significant increase from the levels where we have been in the last years.</p>
          <p>And then oil price sensitivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Sachin, thanks for the question on oil price. I don't have a magic formula any more to get from oil price to feedstock impact, quite simply, because most of the margin bridges have become significantly disturbed with the volatility, so the traditional margins of benzene over naphtha have become detached from any of the traditional rules. So where we got the numbers from was we looked at last year and saw $112 a barrel as the average oil price for the full year, which is the highest in our history, and we budgeted this year at $110. As you correctly pointed out, we've already seen prices spiking above that, although in other years we've seen that effect as well.</p>
          <p>What I can say is, on price, we've now seen in quarter four the seventh consecutive quarter of price increases, and we intend to continue with those price increases to try and recover those raw material increases. If we take a full year for 2011, roughly &#x20AC;800 million of increased raw material price were offset by roughly &#x20AC;720 million of increased price effects, so we are achieving that compensation, although there is always some lag in the process, as you would expect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for each business. Coming back to a couple of the questions about Xarelto, and just from a different angle, are you comfortable with the pace of ramp-up &#x2013; not the peak, but the pace of ramp-up and consensus sales estimates for Xarelto, given the extreme foot-dragging we've seen by some governments in major European markets when it comes to providing reimbursement and access to new treatments? Do you feel the analysts have the pace of the launch right? Second, in MaterialScience, could you talk us through the raw material dynamic that impacted Q4 so strongly, and how do you see it evolving from here?</p>
          <p>Also, what do we have to believe for TDI margins to start to improve from 2011 levels? Could supply and demand just be so out of balance that improvement is several years away still? And then, thirdly, on CropScience, what are your expectations for market growth in crop protection and then also in seeds? Where do you expect to make the biggest gains, and do you expect to step up costs in order to capture this growth? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for the question. I forgot to mention this because I wanted to make a comment regarding consensus. We are absolutely fine with the consensus numbers that are out there. I understand they are around &#x20AC;270 million for this year, which is pretty much in line with what we expect to be the ramp-up for 2012. Obviously, it's too early to comment on further numbers, but I believe both parties &#x2013; you guys as well as we here have the same perspective as to how this product is developing this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Then, Patrick, raw material prices in BMS, how they are evolving in TDI margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeremy, let me just put the fourth quarter raw material beat in context, just very crudely. So we suffered in terms of EBITDA year-on-year by about &#x20AC;50 million in volume and offset that with about &#x20AC;100 million in price, just to put that in context. The raw material impact is about &#x20AC;165 million negative, so that gives you some idea of the relative effects of raw material compared to price and volume. The other big effect that we saw in the fourth quarter was &#x20AC;100 million of unusual costs coming through, primarily relating to planned and unplanned shutdowns and the associated inventory reduction that went through. So I think probably that helps you get a better feel for the gap that was created in quarter four at an EBITDA level year-on-year, and the context in which raw materials fit.</p>
          <p>On TDI, let's just look at our capacity, so overall industry utilization in 2011 in total was around about 83%. Normally, prices start rising significantly at around about top-80% level, 88% and above. The market itself declined very slightly, although we grew, and we expect a recovery of back to the normal growth rate during the beginning of this year. There's been one tick up, which was one of the soft spots in furniture in China, because we just heard the Chinese government is announcing a stimulus program for the furniture industry in China because that's one of the problem areas that has been affected by the constraint on construction.</p>
          <p>TDI in Europe and America is supported strongly by the automotive sector, although less so by the furniture sector. And overall in Asia there's been some significant capacity coming off stream, so there's been some mothballing and maybe even some plants that will not restart. We've seen that in Japan, in China, and in Taiwan and also we've seen it in Brazil, where one of our competitors has taken their TDI plant off line. So that means that the utilization rates heading into 2012 are actually starting to look a bit better, and certainly because of the deep drop in price, a number of the smaller players are desperate to raise pricing, and we're seeing the market beginning to move back up again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. And then, Sandy, yeah, expectations of market growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So you asked a couple questions; one is expectations of market growth and then how are we going to take advantage of it from a cost perspective. It's obviously much too early in the season to have a really good sense of what the market is going to look like this year, but at the moment, I think most people believe that the crop protection market will see moderate growth in 2012, and the seeds and traits part of the business will see a slightly higher level of growth than that, consistent with probably what we saw in 2011. And our goal, which we've consistently said, is that our intent is to continue to grow above that market, both in Crop Protection and in BioScience, in 2012.</p>
          <p>And the way in which we're going to do this is we actually &#x2013; as you know, we announced a significant restructuring program at the end of 2010. That is still running. It's on track to achieve the &#x20AC;265 million in structural costs that we're taking out of the business, some of which is being invested behind growth in emerging markets. So the way in which we're going to take advantage of the upside growth potential is by redeploying some of those funds. But we're also, as you know, have really changed the way in which we manage our whole supply chain infrastructure, and that's leading to us being able to see year-over-year improvement in our COGS level, and we'll see that again in 2012, a further improvement in our COGS that we saw in 2011, where we saw a step function improvement in our COGS level.</p>
          <p>So that's how we're going to manage getting the value out of that growth. We'll be investing behind it, but we're taking money out of other places, so we should not see any substantive increase in our expenses.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Richard Vosser of JPMorgan. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. One question, just on your financing structure; I think there's about &#x20AC;2.5 billion of bonds for repayment in 2012, and given the low interest environment, just wondering how you think of these refinancing, whether you would refinance those bonds to keep the level of net debt similar or look to continue to deleverage. And if you choose not to refinance, where can we think of the uses of cash through 2012? Second question, sort of related to that in terms of the Pharma business; with the launch of Xarelto ongoing and other launches coming this year, do you feel that management has enough capacity to look for outside opportunities now, or do you feel that they still need to spend time executing those launches?</p>
          <p>And then a final Pharma-related product question, just on Alpharadin, I noticed that you've started an expanded access program; just wondering how many patients you're targeting for that program and what other activities you're planning to increase the awareness of the brand ahead of a potential launch this year or early next year, and finally, when you think you might be able to complete the start-up of the manufacturing plant for that product. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Richard, the first question on the bonds, our CFO, Werner Baumann, will answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Richard. There are actually two tranches, we said, up to &#x20AC;2.4, billion, one is a euro-denominated EMTN bond, which is still a leftover of our Aventis acquisition. It's the last piece we are paying back. It's &#x20AC;2 billion we are paying back now at the end of the April. We do that out of our existing cash and liquidity position as of year-end, which amounts to a little bit more than &#x20AC;4 billion. There's a second smaller tranche of about a little bit more than &#x20AC;400 million, which is a yen-denominated EMTN bond, and that is the only piece which we are going to refinance. So that other &#x20AC;2 billion we are not going to refinance. We're actually using some of our liquidity to further de-lever.</p>
          <p>In terms of full-year targets for our net debt position, we are expecting to be down to a level of around &#x20AC;6 billion, so that means &#x20AC;1 billion less of net financial debt compared to year-end 2011. And last but not least, if you look at the state of affairs in terms of our financial position and our total debt, you always have to add our pension obligations on top, so we are at a &#x20AC;14.8 billion overall debt position, which is now coming down by that roughly &#x20AC;1 billion in net financial debt by the end of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, Werner. J&#xF6;rg, do we have capacity to look at outside opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Richard, as much as I want Pharma management to focus fully on the launches, I would also expect that some of us still have some free capacity to look for opportunistic &#x2013; opportunities outside. So, yes, of course we will watch what's going on, but as you know, it depends on the opportunity, and then we look at it more deeply.</p>
          <p>Regarding Alpharadin, yes, we have started an expanded patient program, expanded access program, especially in the U.S., but we will expand this also to Europe. As you know, we have only limited exposure of U.S. physicians to Alpharadin so far, so it was very necessary to actually give them more access to the compound and let them work with the compound and get patients on the product. An absolute number of patients I can't give you because that will also be depending a little bit on the availability of material, but you can assume that it will be several hundreds.</p>
          <p>Regarding the production side, yes, we are making progress. We are still sticking to our middle of 2012 forecast as to when we will be ready and we can produce larger amounts there, and that also applies to the submission of the registration files, which are still planned to be submitted around middle of the year.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Fabian Wenner of Kepler. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Fabian Wenner from Kepler. Two questions, please; first one for Marijn, on a chemical cost coverage in MaterialScience. Bayer adheres to stringent cash-value-based metrics. Now, out of the last four years, MaterialScience has failed to meet your return targets twice, and in the other two years, barely met it. It seems as if the above-GDP-growth Bayer wants to reap is not sufficient to cover the cost of capital. What exactly can and will be done to sustainably raise returns in this business on top of the recent efficiency program? And the other question, with regard to acquisitions, maybe for Werner; let's assume there was a large acquisition target that you're interested in. What net debt, including pensions, to EBITDA do you and the rating agencies still deem acceptable to keep your current rating? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll take the first question on the BMS and earning the rate of capital returns. We've had an interesting combination over the last four years of significant investments in our Caojing facility in China to get that up to speed, which is obviously not something we do with a one- or two-year outlook, but more of a 20- to 30-year outlook, and then exceptional fluctuations in the economy and in the demand for products. So I would not characterize the last four years as characteristic for BMS in the longer run. That's certainly not how we are thinking about it. But we are very focused on earning our cost of capital, of course, in the long run, and Patrick and the team in MaterialScience are working very hard to leverage our investments to the best of our abilities. We have actually adjusted the bonus program for the MaterialScience employees in 2012, where the size of the bonus has a strong influence of our capability to earn cost of capital.</p>
          <p>And, Werner, the rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, Fabian, it's a little bit like buying a suit for a person I don't know. In absence of knowing the profiles of the acquisition target, it's actually impossible to talk about a certain absolute debt level, but in general terms, there is an FS [fiscal scenario] alternate debt ratio you can take as an orientation, which we need to maintain in order to maintain and defend our A- rating, and that is two times FS alternate debt, yeah, so we have to be at that level in order to justify our A rating. And that is also stated company policy. We think that we need it, looking at the profile of the businesses we are running, and we would only, for a very short transitional period of time, sacrifice the A rating, only with the perspective of gaining it back within a year's time or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a follow-up to that, and have you stated recently any maximum cap for an acquisition target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the sky's the limit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, probably, I think it's very difficult to answer that question because you would look at financing structure in a very different manner if you had a business which doesn't generate any cash or, in turn, is actually burning cash, compared to an operating business which comes with a bottom line and then some synergy potential.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that has already helped me, your comment. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Fabian, just in general, a comment, in the last decade or so, I think Bayer has been very disciplined in how it has done its acquisitions and how it has dealt with its debt and how it has dealt with bringing down debt levels after larger acquisitions. And we have no intention of changing that pattern of discipline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael from Barclays. Patrick, one question on MaterialScience; you were kind of enough to give us the TDI utilization rates. I was wondering whether you could also do that for MDI and polycarbonates. Then a question on Betaseron, quite a step down in the momentum in the fourth quarter in the U.S., just wondered what's driven that. And then lastly, you're moving the Diagnostics division into Consumer Health. I just wondered how, from an operational perspective, that makes sense. There doesn't seem to be a lot of overlap between that and diabetes care.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, the MDI full-year utilization at an industry level is around about 85%, and that was against the background of seeing full-year growth at around about 7% 2011 versus 2010, so MDI was actually quite strong in growth last year. And then on polycarbonates, global utilization rate is probably at around about top-80s, so dropping back a little bit from the 90% we saw in 2010 because of the new capacity that's come on-stream in the Middle East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then Betaseron?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the most significant decline that we had in the fourth quarter came actually out of Spain, which shouldn't be a surprise to anybody, given the situation in Spain for a years or so. We see pressure on products like Betaseron. But it's not only in Spain. Also in the U.S. we had a decline by 10%, which to a large extent is driven by Extavia sales, which were strong. But we also see some impact of Gilenya. So, overall, the forecast is still that Betaseron is going to have mid- to high-single-digit decline in the years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the move of -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the move. Well, you need to look a little bit deeper than what you just described in medical care, because it does not only consist of diabetes care &#x2013; and there I fully agree there is not much of an overlap &#x2013; but we also do have our MEDRAD business in medical care, and there is a strong overlap between MEDRAD and our diagnostic business. Essentially, they have been cooperating already in the past, but coming from two different divisions, and we thought it makes a lot of sense to bring these two groups together, not only from a top-line perspective &#x2013; because they're talking to the same channel and to the same customer &#x2013; but also from an R&amp;D perspective because both of these businesses, MEDRAD and our diagnostic business, do work on, for example, computer-based analysis systems for radiologists, where there is significant overlap in terms of what they are doing there. So that, together with the sales channel overlap, made us to come to this decision, which makes a lot of sense.</p>

Can you talk about current pricing trends &#x2013; i.e., going into the 2012 season? And then on CropScience, a question for Sandy; at the start of the season, how is pricing developing at the moment, and do you see any volume discounts by competitors at the moment in the market in any of the indications? And then just quickly on HealthCare, Levitra and Avelox, can you elucidate a bit on the restructured contracts regarding the U.S. distribution? It seems like you have lost sales for that.

On TDI, we think the selling price dropped to the lowest level at the end of 2011, so we would hope to see some improvement through quarter one and quarter two. On the polyols, we've seen the pricing actually up last year, and that continues to pass on the [input material] costs. And then, on polycarbonates, the Saudi Kayan facility, which came on-stream in softer demand, meant that we saw declining prices, so quarter four was actually below quarter three, and that we will hope to start pushing through as we get the raw material price increase effect compensated during the first half of this year.</p>

          <p>So it's start of the season. It's still probably about a month too early to give you a good sense of it, but generally speaking, I think that in the North America and the West European market, people are feeling relatively positive about the marketplace in general, and we have not yet seen a lot of volume discount schemes, and our customers have not been saying that others have been doing them. My only caution in all of that is because it is so early, you never know whether the back half of the season, depending upon how it develops, whether there is some rebate associated with volume that kicks in at the end of the second quarter, but at the moment, the season in general is starting off relatively well.</p>
          <p>The one soft spot which will impact probably the market a little bit is the vegetable market, partly because of some of the issues in the Middle East and the hangover from last year, the problems that happened in Western Europe. But even there, in general, that market should be pretty good, so we're feeling pretty good at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to Levitra and Avelox, you are absolutely right with your assumption that, yes, we lost sales, but we had a benefit in profit. Actually, both products, Levitra and Avelox, do grow outside of the U.S., Avelox even double-digit. You would have to expect still a negative impact in the first quarter of this year on sales, given the fact that this deal did only happen, I believe it was in March last year, but after that, the strong decline that you have seen so far will disappear for both products.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Baum of Citi. Please state you name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Andrew Baum from Citi. I heard you &#x2013; Dr. Dekkers, I heard you mention complexity a number of times, and again, previously. Perhaps you could share with us some of the measures you're putting in place as examples of reducing complexity that are feeding into both the P&amp;L and cash flow. My assumption is much of those benefits re actually going to be reinvested in the business, if you could again confirm that. And finally, you outlined, I think, the &#x20AC;541 million annual savings result that you've measured. Could you give us some idea of how much more there is to come from rooting out residual complexity inside Bayer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yes, thanks for the question. We have announced a program back in November of 2010, so about a year-and-a-half ago, a restructuring program where we said we were going to, under the sort of motto "more innovation and less administration," try to bring down the administrative burden that the company has, to free up resources to invest in our innovation capability and also in driving growth in the growth countries. And we said at the time we will eliminate 4,500 positions in total and then add 2,500, for a net reduction of 2,000, and this is what I'm talking about here with these programs.</p>
          <p>At the time, we also said we will have an annual savings rate out of those restructuring programs of &#x20AC;800 million, and then we'll reinvest &#x20AC;400 million of that in innovation and growth countries, and the other &#x20AC;400 million we'll take to the bottom line as EBITDA and cash flow, so a reinvestment in the &#x2013; with &#x20AC;800 million and then the &#x20AC;500 million you mentioned, we're sort of halfway realizing the savings of these restructuring programs.</p>
          <p>Examples are &#x2013; particularly on the administration side &#x2013; more simplicity and standardization in how, in the many countries where we are in the world, support our businesses with back-office support, so financial, IT, legal, communication, HR. That is all being standardized there rather than being done differently in each different country, and that helps saving. We also have a program where we are trying to overall reduce our accounting savings in the company significantly till 2015 &#x2013; we spend a quite a lot of money also when we benchmark ourselves &#x2013; accounting, and there was nothing wrong with good accounting, but it comes at a cost, and we think we can be more efficient there. So just to give you a few examples, but there are many programs across the company where we are trying to decrease the complexity of our, particularly, administrative functions.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I could have just one follow-up I did want ask at the same time. Regarding the tax rate, the trend we're seeing across your peers is the effective tax rate looking like it's coming down due to either more aggressive tax avoidance or optimization structure, together with the adoption of patent boxes in many European countries. Could you just outline, directionally, where you see trends for Bayer going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll let Werner Baumann answer that question on tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have given guidance for 2012 that we see our tax rate in &#x2013; the ETR in the range of 26% to 27%, which is somewhat lower than the tax rate we had in prior years. 2010 as an exception in that regard because of the atypical regional distribution of our tax payments and our ETR. Overall, we are also aiming at further improving our ETR via a multitude of different tax-planning instruments and measures. Patent boxes are a part of it, as well as international financing companies. But you also have to look &#x2013; if you would take a horizontal view and benchmark the ETR, you also and always have to look at the domiciliation of the companies, which means we are kind of okay with where we are going, comparing ourselves to a Germany-headquartered company, so you never ever reach the tax rates Switzerland-based companies.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. (sic) [Ms.] Jo Walton from Credit Suisse. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo Walton from Credit Suisse; just a few questions, please. Looking at the Pharma business, R&amp;D as a percentage of sales on the new re-stated basis went down exactly the same amount as the EBIT before special charges went up, so presumably, there was no significant change in the marketing cost in 2011. Can you help us just understand the timeframe for an improvement in the overall margin for the Pharma business, given the large number of launches &#x2013; not just of Xarelto, but of other products to come through &#x2013; so what sort of timeframe of launch investments we should be thinking of? And I wonder if you can also just affirm for us what the impact of austerity measures in Europe was last year and what your expectation is going forwards.</p>
          <p>In chemicals, I have just a question on the TDI market. You've talked about some people retiring capacity. You obviously added capacity yourself. I understand BASF has another 200,000 ore tons to come by 2014. Do you think that, over the next couple of years, the balance between new capacity and demand will be able to sustain the TDI price, or could we have a real risk of some further weakness? And a short one on Crop Protection; you're investing a lot in seed traits, but you still don't have much germplasm sort of get that seed investment to the market. Can you see any way of doing that going forwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jo. Let's start with the Pharma R&amp;D and marketing balance in terms of cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo, as you know, P&amp;L does not only exist of R&amp;D and marketing and sales. You are right that we did control our R&amp;D expenditure well last year, but at the same time, we were working on cost of goods, we were working on G&amp;A, where we did also see movement in the P&amp;L, which then helped to support marketing and sales expenses that were higher. So, overall, we keep on working in this direction. And as we have discussed before, the simplification measures do have an impact, especially on G&amp;A, but to some extent also on costs, so from that perspective, don't just look at R&amp;D and M&amp;S. Now, going forward, as we have guided for this year, obviously, all these launches, as you pointed out, plus the generic competition that we get now for YAZ and Yasmin in Europe, will have an impact, and whatever we do from a productivity perspective may not be able to fully compensate for that, so that's why we guided for a slight increase in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Going forward, obviously, the situation will depend on how well our products will perform and whether all these launches are in time and whether they're all successful, but it is certainly our mid-term expectation and hope &#x2013; and we are going to strive for it &#x2013; to keep on improving the margin in Pharma, but also in Healthcare.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. You want to about austerity or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can do that too. So, Jo, we had an impact of &#x20AC;300 million in 2011 on a worldwide basis. In Europe, it was an impact of &#x20AC;140 million. This is all cumulative, so that's not only in 2011; that has been building over the last, actually, two to three years. When we look at 2012, there is an incremental impact that we see at the level of another &#x20AC;150 million. Out of that would be &#x20AC;40 million coming from Europe. That's our current expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, Werner. And then TDI capacity, what's going to happen over the next few years, how does it affect that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Jo, there are some fairly clear announcements out there, but they need some clarification, I think. We announced an increase of 300,000 tons of capacity in Dormagen, which will come on-stream &#x2013; well, we just got project approval. That will come on-stream in about two-and-a-half, three years. Net, that's only 95,000 tons of capacity because we will close a 145,000 in Brunsb&#xFC;ttel and 60,000 in Dormagen. So a lot of these new facilities that are being announced, including the other one that you mentioned, are also replacing older assets. Now, what's the driver for that? That's all about efficiency. The program that we are running will use our new gas-based technology, that we've already pioneered in China, in Dormagen.</p>
          <p>And that will then give us three large world-scale units in the world &#x2013; one in America, one in Asia, one in Europe &#x2013; and we will have then closed all of our other TDI plants globally. That gives us a very strong cost position. If you look at the number of the other announced facilities, you'll find a lot of the smaller ones in Asia and in India now appear to have also been delayed, partly because of the current pricing levels. So I'm reasonably confident with the 4% to 5% growth rate that we see in TDI normally. Then these additional plants will mean that we will be able to operate more efficiently without adding significant capacity, so I expect the pricing position to return to normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you. And then, Sandy, traits and germplasm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jo, I think to clarify, we actually &#x2013; in the crops in which we currently compete, we think we've got actually the broadest germplasm pool in those crops. So in canola and in cotton, part of our success is not just the technology, but it's actually the quality of the germplasm and the breeding that we've done with those, and that's why we've been able to continue to grow share and grow those businesses significantly. The same thing is true with our vegetable business as well as our rice business, which is a hybrid rice business, and last year we also &#x2013; I think, as you know &#x2013; did a small germplasm acquisition deal that actually broadened that germplasm pool.</p>
          <p>So those core set of crops, and then we've also made a significant investment and acquired significant numbers of germplasm pools in wheat in the last 12 months, and so we now probably have the broadest germplasm pool of any of our core competitors, and we're now working through that to sort through it and start really doing some breeding programs on wheat.</p>
          <p>And the last crop area that's the focus of ours is soybeans, and we are in the early stages through an acquisition in the United States, Hornbeck, and a few other gene pools in North America and Latin America to broaden our germplasm pools in soybeans. That one today is the smallest of all of them, but the other ones we actually think we've got world-class germplasm pools, and our customers actually say that that's part of why we are very competitive, because of that.</p>
          <p>The one area where we have consciously decided we are not going to be in the germplasm seed part of the business is in corn. We are a trait provider to others, but we actually are not in the corn seed business itself, and we don't have any plans to be in that business.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. Peter Spengler at DZ Bank. I have two questions, one on polycarbonates/polyurethanes and one on Pharma. I start with the MaterialScience questions. You mentioned that you are trying to go back to normal growth rate rates &#x2013; or that the market is going back to normal growth rates for 2012, so could you specify what you think the market could grow in this year? And the second question is on Pharma. Do you expect the positive EBITDA contribution from Eylea and Xarelto and &#x2013; or the whole group of four new products in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Patrick, market growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, market growth, I'm talking here of total industry expectations based upon our analysis would suggest that MDI will grow slightly slower in 2012 than the 7% we saw in 2011. On TDI we saw only about a 1% growth during 2011, and we expect that to increase during 2012. On the poly, the polyol market supports both of those two. We expect a growth rate of somewhat above 5%. That's driven by the combination of MDI and TDI. And then on polycarbonates, we've got a combination of effects going on. We're seeing quite strong automotive drive and some contraction in the short term on electronics because there was a kind of stock out over Christmas on a lot of electronics goods.</p>
          <p>If you talk, for example, in Germany, to media markets, you'll find they're actually stocked out of flat screen TVs, so everybody is running their inventory of such low levels, people are actually stocking out. There was also the shortage of hard disks out of Thailand following the flooding, which affected the electronics industry dramatically, but assuming that comes back to normality, and certainly the Japanese effect has now come out of the system following the tsunami, then we'd expect to see the normal underlying growth rate for BCS at around about 6% up to 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And the piles of money we're going to make on Xarelto and Eylea in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will make piles of money, but not in 2012. So my answer is relatively straightforward. None of these four products will have a positive EBITDA or EBIT contribution in 2012. Eylea is only going to be launched towards the end of the year, the other products maybe towards the end or early 2013, and Xarelto is not yet making a positive contribution either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen; Florent Cespedes from Exane BNP Paribas. Thank you for taking my questions. Three quick ones on HealthCare. First, an easy one, product, on Kogenate, could we have an update on your long-acting program? The second one, which is a follow-up on the austerity measures impact, could you confirm that for 2012 the impact in Europe should be &#x20AC;40 million, which is rather small in relative terms versus the impact in Europe for 2011, could we know why? And the last one, the guidance, would you consider giving a long-term guidance as you did a few years ago, as you have many transforming products emerging, or do you believe the consensus is right, so there is no reason to adjust the forecast? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so maybe I start with the Kogenate question. As you know, we have a program for long-acting Kogenate in development since now quite a number of years. We had changed formulation several time, and now ended last year with a formulation that actually created very good Phase I/II results, so we are now planning to start a Phase III program with our long-acting Kogenate formulation this year within the next few months. Regarding austerity measures, yes, it's correct. It depends always a little bit on what do you call Europe, and for example, in my &#x20AC;40 million number for 2012, we don't have Turkey in there, which we have in a different bucket, but if you add Turkey, the overall impact will be higher than &#x20AC;40 million.</p>
          <p>But, in general, it's the expectation that the price cuts that were really dramatic that we saw, especially in countries like Spain in 2011, may not come to the same extent in 2012, but it of course is just speculation at the moment, but we are a little bit more optimistic for Europe in 2012 than we were in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Damien Conover with Morningstar. Just a question on Betaseron, following up on your longer-term outlook there for mid- to high-single-digit declines; just wanted to get your thoughts on the margin impact of losing this product, and the level of marketing support on the product right now and how that might shift, given the dynamics going on in the MS market. And then also a follow-up question on Xarelto, just kind of want to gauge a little bit more granularity on your expectations of over &#x20AC;2 billion, just wondering if you could talk to how you see the contributions coming from the different indications, as well as within the atrial fibrillation indication, your thoughts on market share versus overall growth within that therapeutic class. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, so regarding Betaseron, obviously, you can assume that Betaseron, after many years of market introduction, is a relatively high-margin product, which of course is also supported by the fact that we have been reducing overall marketing support for the product over the last few years, so going forward, we do not intend to continue to invest significantly in the product. It is a franchise where we are losing share, almost independent of how much support we actually give to the product.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we, of course, fight for what we have got, and we see still growing sales in a number of countries. We are under pressure, especially in the U.S., but we do, for example, also see growth in Germany. So we will be very select this year and support the product in those markets where we have a good share and a good standing, and where we still see either flat sales or growth.</p>
          <p>Regarding Xarelto, yes, we stick to our &#x20AC;2 billion &#x2013; or more than &#x20AC;2 billion projection, and given the launch that I just described at the beginning of the call, we are confident that that number is achievable. We see a very good uptake in AF, in atrial fibrillation, in Germany. We assume that that will be similar in the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. We do also see growth in orthopedic surgery. We see that in Europe, but we also see growth in the U.S. and in some other markets where there is a certain halo effect that supports the brand in this indication as well.</p>
          <p>And then don't forget we got just priority review for ACS in the U.S. This is an indication where you know there is overlap between AF and ACS patients. We can debate forever whether that overlap is 20% or 30% or 40%, but it's there. And our expectation is that once we got approval in ACS, that again, that will be a halo effect also on the atrial fibrillation indication, and also believe that a significant part of these patients which overlap between the two indications may then be switched or put on Xarelto.</p>
          <p>But having said that, overall, certainly we expect the most significant share of these &#x20AC;2 billion coming from the atrial fibrillation market, but one should not totally disregard the orthopedic surgery indication, the ACS indication and &#x2013; I didn't mention this &#x2013; the VTE treatment indication, which we have got in Europe and other parts of the world but not yet in the U.S. So there is more to come for Xarelto, and overall, I think that the &#x20AC;2 billion are absolutely reachable.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Ronald K&#xF6;hler of MainFirst. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. I have several questions. First question on restructuring program; you provided kindly a chart on your progress here, but could you give us a number how much P&amp;L influence you had positively from the restructuring program in 2011 &#x2013; if possible, net of your investments, how you calculated that, and little bit to give an indication how the further &#x20AC;800 million, that they will come through in 2012/2013?</p>
          <p>Second question, on Bio MaterialScience, you're quite cautiously guiding for EBIT flattish, and on the other side, on the market assumption, you have, in my view, relatively positive assumption, like the construction market growing by 6%, furniture by 5%, electronics by 5%. So, obviously, if I would look at these assumptions, at these growth rates, I would assume you should have a chance to increase earnings, actually, if I put that volume assumption into my model. What would keep that lower? Is it really the higher raw material prices? But obviously you mentioned you could almost pass them on in 2011, so is there an additional risk on that side, or what makes you so cautious?</p>
          <p>For diagnostic imaging, you obviously now moved it to OTC. We just see the headline products, unfortunately, which are, let's say, the major products are declining. I believe diagnostic imaging is overall a kind of a flat developing part of your business in 2011. Could you a little bit confirm that how were the overall growth and how is, let's say, the outlook? Is it diminishing sales growth in OTC from, let's say, previously around 5%, or what would you expect from the contribution diagnostic imaging?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the financial impact of the restructuring program, Werner Baumann, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ronald, let me first start talking gross numbers, and that will be somewhat difficult. Gross, we achieved annualized savings of &#x20AC;543 million, so that means there is roughly &#x20AC;260 million still to come in 2012 to be realized. Looking at how much of that has become bottom-line effective in 2011, it's actually next to impossible to quantify that, but let me say so much that if you look at original expectations for 2011 and where we ended up, we generated significant bottom-line dynamics, specifically in HealthCare, that improved by 1.4 percentage points in the margin, and that would not have been possible without the significant contributions of the restructuring programs.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we saw an even higher margin improvement in CropScience, which was heavily supported by roughly &#x20AC;150 million contribution out of the restructuring program. So there is somewhat more to come in 2012. Of course, the last part of that will go into the financing of our further launch and marketing expenses for our new products in HealthCare, and then to a certain extent, also to fend off some of the inflation-based cost increases in Crop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to get that clear, if you'd mentioned annualized, I guess that's a rolling forward the program for the next 12 months, but obviously, what I would like to get is the effect in 2011, not on annualized basis, but what you just had in the P&amp;L, so to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can only give you annualized, which is rolling. That's absolutely correct. It's &#x20AC;540 million by the end of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. And BMS, flattish EBITDA outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Ronald, your comment's perfectly fair and the question is the good one. We've given flat guidance based upon the time at which we put the guidance together. As I look at what's actually happening in the market in January and February, I guess I'd be more optimistic. But I think we have to be cautious here because, with oil price volatility and the impact that has on our raw materials, and also on our capacity levels, because we're not convinced we've seen all of the new capacity back fully on-stream yet, so that gives us a concern around our pricing power despite our success last year. I'm not convinced that the oil capacity levels will tighten fast enough for us to get the pricing that we really may need in the case of a high oil price.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then the outlook for diagnostic imaging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you are absolutely correct with your expectation that is a business that is not growing that much. However, it has been growing over the last two years in the low single-digits, and that's also the forecast going forward, between flat and low single-digits. However, the combination that we have now done with the MEDRAD business will not have an impact immediately, but in the mid to long term, we really expect a better service that we can provide to our customers, given this combination of the two businesses. They have some positive effect on that growth rate as well. And then also I believe that, long-term, the improved capability that we have in research and development in the combined business may help us to support the business as well; so short-term, relatively flat; long-term, hopefully better.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. It's Matt Lowe from JPMorgan. Thank you for taking my question. Just wondering if you could provide a geographic breakdown in euros for the fourth quarter Nexavar sales, so basically a breakdown of the &#x20AC;205 by geography. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So sales in the fourth quarter in France were &#x20AC;13 million; in Italy, &#x20AC;15 million; in Germany, &#x20AC;11 million; and in Spain, &#x20AC;7 million. And the rest is spread around a number of countries. In China, sales for Nexavar in the fourth quarter were &#x20AC;17 million, and in Japan, &#x20AC;34 million.</p>
