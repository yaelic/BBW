          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2012. For your information, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Oliver Schmidt, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon to everybody and welcome to our conference call about the result of the third quarter 2012. I know it has been a very busy week for all of you, but I hope you still have some energy left for the next 90 minutes to come.</p>
          <p>Oliver will present the key facts and figures to you, and afterwards, we will be available for questions as well. Now, I don't want to become sentimental and it is still too early for goodbye, but let me remind you that this will be the last conference call Oliver will conduct in his current role. So let's at least have some fun. Oliver?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about fun, good afternoon, everybody. We have some fun numbers to share with you for this quarter that was obviously very carefully planned and timed to make my life easier today. I hope for your understanding we've been out, so I think on the headline numbers, there shouldn't have been too many surprises. What I think is important to note is this was not due to one-offs but all the operating cylinders of Allianz firing well.</p>
          <p>Let's go through the deck. As last time, I'll try to be through with the presentation and the comments in about 30 minutes, focusing on the highlight, so I'm not going to touch every slide and try to leave you through what from our perspective would be the key messages, then I'd like to have the Q&amp;A focus on the main drivers. I think you probably have questions around sustainability of some of the earnings that you are seeing. And if there are any detailed questions, technical ones, Oliver Schmidt and team are happy to address them.</p>
          <p>Another comment before we dive into the substance matter, my colleague Max Zimmerer is going to host next Tuesday at 11 o'clock in Frankfurt, a talk to go through what the main element are of our investment strategy. So if you have questions around where are and how are we investing new moneys, what do we think about renewable energy, what is our view on government debt, please focus on that day, you're invited by Allianz to attend this session.</p>
          <p>Now, let's go to the facts. Page three and I'll start with a view on the nine-month number and dive into the 3Q data. And nine-month numbers are very nice, &#x20AC;80.5 billion revenues, $7.2 billion in operating profit, net income at &#x20AC;4.2 billion and the capital position was strong, remains strong, and is going to be strong as we are spending a lot of energy on continuously fortifying our balance sheet position.</p>
          <p>Now, page number 4 gives you an overview of the movements in the segments. All operating KPIs have improved. Combined ratio stood at 96.6% for nine months. New business margin at 1.7%, but operating profit at almost &#x20AC;2.5 billion in life, asset management almost &#x20AC;2.1 billion, and corporate and other segment at &#x20AC;747 minus for the quarter because of lower interest income, but we're talking about it.</p>
          <p>So, these are the nine-month number. They're very strong and they let us to change our outlook for the year, and despite everything we know as of today about Sandy, we are real confident to be north of &#x20AC;9 billion in our operating profit for the total year.</p>
          <p>Now, third quarter details, starting at page number 6, &#x20AC;25.2 billion in revenues, &#x20AC;2.5 billion in OP and net income at &#x20AC;1.4 billion are a very good base in terms of our financials. Page number 7 gives you the typical run up, and you see very nicely the strong profitability numbers, particularly for the last three quarters that have shaped our outlook debate.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity on page 8 is up, no surprise given the strong earnings and the decline in interest rate which is supporting unrealized gains, particularly on the fixed income side, and our conglomerate solvency, as depicted on page number 9, continues to trend up, of course, because it's insensitive to interest rate.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of economic solvency that we are describing on page number 10, we'll be probably talking about it. It has improved back to more than 200% like where we were at the end of the first quarter. The improvements here are driven by a decline in the risk capital requirements as the available funds are basically stable, small decrease.</p>
          <p>Now for those that are ready that have the sharp pencil and says how does this work because your MCEV is considerably up, let me remind you what we told you in the first quarter, we've introduced fairly strict transferability restriction in the AFR computation. A lot of the MCEV movements are restricted and can't be transferred to the Group level and therefore don't move the Group AFR. I think that's a very conservative view on things.</p>
          <p>The other item is on the required capital, just to address some of the question, the calming and recovering markets have increased policyholder participation in stress scenarios, that's about an &#x20AC;800 million movement.</p>
          <p>We've continued our de-risking, for example, selling some of the Commerzbank and Hartford exposures. We've increased the duration of our German Life book, this has reduced the risk position by more than &#x20AC;500 million and it continues. And we've done an update on correlations and that means we are now reflecting the policy of correlation of interest rates and nominal future claims at a higher level in the Group that is agreed, that's about another &#x20AC;900 million and we have a few additional local changes. So, that explains the picture of the solvency. We feel very comfortable with that. The stress scenario still remains interest rates down further 100 basis points and equity markets down. With that, we'll still be, I think, well capitalized.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to the Group section and the various revenue movements on an internal basis. We see the strongest growth in Asset Management, 25.5% up, in nominal terms, it's more than 39%. P&amp;C up 1.7% and Life and Health shrinking on an adjusted basis by 1.6%. This is in line with our expectation, because we are continuously protecting our margin, we will talk about it when we get to the Life section;.</p>
          <p>Page 13 show you the movement of the operating profits, I don't want to comment about it.</p>
          <p>Page 14 gives you a view on the operating profit in the corporate segment. Lower interest income is really what is driving it here and some smaller cost items. The non-operating items this quarter are also mercifully easy to understand. When you look at the right hand side, impairments are significantly lower both for equities and debt, and we are also having less realized gains and losses, so some people were asking whether that is leading to an improvement in our result, that is not the case on the non-OP side.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating is also significantly improved. Please remember last year, we had trading losses out of the Hartford warrants of &#x20AC;200 odd million that have not repeated themselves, and we have had some amortization again on intangibles for this quarter at &#x20AC;91 million that leaves us with a positive balance of &#x20AC;233 million for other non-operating. The balance of unrealized gains now is approaching &#x20AC;10 billion, the number for gains that are unrealized on equity stands now at &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>If we move on to the net income slide, the comment I'd like to make is on the tax rates, for those that are up &#x2013; constantly updating their spreadsheets because you see tax rate at 34% that is not in line with our planed tax rate. We had planned with a tax rate of about 29%. What has happened now, as before, if we write on equities or intangibles as we did, you don't get any tax benefit, that's a part of it.</p>
          <p>A key part, however, is that we're seeing an increase in trade taxes. As fiscal budgets are under pressure, the taxman is trying everything in order to increase revenues and we are feeling that across the Group and that has been driving up our tax rate by about 2.5 percentage points and I'd like to make sure and be transparent about the fact that what you've seen in the past, tax rates of about 29% will not be the tax rates for the future. We have to expect tax rates more in the range of 33% for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Now, with that, I'd like to move on to the segment starting with P&amp;C on page 18. Good revenue growth, good operating profit, however, supported by lower NatCat claims, combined ratio at 96.3%, run-offs at 1.5T. This reflects the fact that we have significantly strengthened our reserves at Fireman's Fund. Without the Fireman's Fund reserves strengthening, we would be at about 3.5% to 3.6% run-off, which is in line with our expectations for this year. In terms of medium term run-off, you can expect anything, as we said in the past, between 2% and 3% in this type of an environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of reserve strength, I just would like to point out to the study that's been done by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch that gives you a very good indication of how we're doing that is we have significantly strengthened our reserve position, and with what we're doing at Fireman's Fund now, we're taking the last steps to make sure we're best-in-class here.</p>
          <p>Now, revenue development pie business you see on page number 19, very positive momentum in a number of markets. We're growing very strongly in emerging markets, double-digit. We're growing in our core markets. It's also very good. We have a few exceptions where we are either de-risking or we have a tough economic environment like Eastern Europe or in Spain or where we are making sure that certain under profitable lines are being addressed. So, for example, in Russia, that's accounting for a big part. In Eastern Europe, we have been cleaning our healthcare portfolio with very good results. In the U.S., you see a decline in crop revenues that's reflecting in a lot of the numbers that make &#x2013; that are relevant for Fireman's Fund.</p>
          <p>In terms of profit, page number 20, &#x20AC;148 million improvement, the vast majority is driven by either the higher NPE base and in particular the lower NatCat that we've experienced this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, combined ratio improved to 96.3% says, page number 21. When you go across the portfolio, you see very, very strong numbers. Except for Fireman's Fund, I think many of them are the envy of anybody that wants to play in P&amp;C, but I would like to comment on a few. One of the questions we received is whether Italy with an 81.2% combined ratio can sustain these numbers. Now, we're seeing extremely strong numbers because of strongly falling frequency and severity in Italy and we'll see very good numbers for a while, but obviously that cannot be sustained over the mid-term period. But for the foreseeable future, we will have very strong profitability in Italy which we're going to reinvest to strengthen our market position.</p>
          <p>You can see also when you look at Spain that being in a difficult economic spot, and particularly in terms of revenue, doesn't mean you need to have low margins. Our Spanish colleagues are demonstrating yet again their superior performance, and you see that across the portfolio, many, many combined ratios significantly below 100% and in some cases even being below 90%, and I think that's a very strong result.</p>
          <p>Now, when you look at the accident year loss ratio, and we've changed a little bit the format, that's why I would like to spend two or three minutes on the page 22. We show you now the nine quarter average accident year loss ratio including excluding NatCat with the new middle bar, it's hovering around 69.9%, but to be fair, it actually looks worse than it is because the crop losses are in for this quarter and that is adding about 60 to 80 basis points. So we have had a positive trend on the accident year loss ratio down that is masked by some specific events here in the portfolio and some movement on the credit side as well, but we're carefully monitoring this number, and given the price increases we're taking on the portfolio, it needs to improve going forward.</p>
          <p>Run-off ratio, I've mentioned, it's impacted by the reserve strengthening that we've done again in the third quarter; otherwise, again it is more at 3.5% to 3.6%.</p>
          <p>Talking about investments, I'd like to point out page number 25. We have &#x20AC;795 million operating investment for the quarter. It's a little lower than usual. You should be focusing more around &#x20AC;810 million, &#x20AC;830 million per quarter investment income for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>And on pricing, on page 26, we've seen positive momentum amounting to a total of 2.1% in the first nine months of the year and we're taking pricing wherever we can. Please remember, our rate numbers are including adjustments like bonus/malus in our net numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, that's P&amp;C. Life/Health similarly strong. Page 28 gives you the highlight and let me directly go to page 29 to show you the gross numbers. Now, just to give you a few highlights, the first one is around Germany. Here, we have a reduction particularly in short-term single premiums or so called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:09) and that has lower margins that we didn't renew. The underlying business is doing extremely well, has nice margins as you see later in the deck.</p>
          <p>We have had growth in the number of markets that we are very happy about, except for Italy. There we still have outflows in the bancassurance side. On the bancassurance side, we know that banks are competing for deposits with very high rates, and if you want as a life insurer to get flows, you need to offer uneconomically high guarantees, which we're not going to do. So, it's a conscious decision to have appropriate margins and going towards appropriate margins rather than going for top line.</p>
          <p>The same is true for Eastern Europe; we had a number of products that are deposit light with very low margins which we've discontinued. That's why you see the numbers decline. And in the U.S., the story is exactly the same. The U.S market overall is not profitable at this point in time. We had a low new business margin for the third quarter, which we've used the opportunity now to re-price and rather let volume go to protect our margin.</p>
          <p>In the Benelux, you have &#x2013; you see a lot of growth in terms of percentages. Mind you, as explained the last time, a number of sales in Luxembourg happened on behalf of the French company. So there is an accounting gimmick here, please note the footnote.</p>
          <p>New business margin is at 1.6%, leading together with present value of new business premiums to &#x20AC;149 million in new business value. And the interesting numbers are on page 31, showing still strong margins on Germany, and in particular on our strong growth markets in Latin America and in Asia. The U.S. I mentioned is 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now what's important, we've been using the opportunity to re-price. AZ Life measures its new business margin on a biweekly basis. As of September, the margin is back is up to 69 basis points. So we are doing everything we can in order to improve margins there. And we are working also on Western and Southern Europe, that's by and large France and Italy, to improve the margins and the capital returns. Please note the capital returns we've provided you on the right hand side of the page.</p>
          <p>The operating asset base grows further. We had some good flows, net flows in Germany, in particular, and we are having back positive flows in Asia which is important for us. After we've been closing Japan last year, we had a number of quarters of outflows. Now that's back in positive territory, given that we have very strong margins there. That's very important for us. Still have some slight outflows in Eastern Europe. I mentioned the closure of some of the deposit products. And Italy, as I said, correlates to the effect on the bancassurance channel that is driving the outflows here, again, in line with strategy to protect margins.</p>
          <p>The operating profit is depicted on page 33, very strong at &#x20AC;822 million. It's the third strong quarter. Now again, we get the question, what is a sustainable number? I told you last year, normally in a good year, we should be expecting around &#x20AC;700 million per quarter. That is still the guidance leading you to about &#x20AC;2.8 billion on most of the KPI. So, we are currently slightly above that run rate given that we have used the opportunity to lengthen our duration that has led to some investment gains on the bond side.</p>
          <p>However, if I may show you on the investment slide, page 35, where you have interest and similar income and net harvesting, the movement and the strong positive movement is not driven by taking huge gains on the harvesting side, but the reversal of the impairments we had to take last year in the third quarter. Now as to realized gains and losses which you see later down is exactly at the level of the prior year. So, there is no monetization of reserves going on that you should be worried about.</p>
          <p>MCEV was quickly talked about. There is lots of technical backup. We provided a huge backup for that. Any belated question, Oliver Schmidt will be happy to answer including with the help from our Chief Actuary, Oskar Buchauer.</p>
          <p>So, let's move on the Asset Management section starting at page 38, please. We've had excellent results again. The asset base growing 15% now to &#x20AC;1.8 trillion. Third party flows have been second best quarter ever &#x20AC;31.5 billion, the operating profit is stellar, exceeding &#x20AC;800 million and cost income ratio is now at 54%.</p>
          <p>Let's look at some of the details. Page 39 gives you the movement on the AUMs, both internal and third party. The flows are 2.3% of &#x2013; end of period AUM, which are very strong, and net fee and commission income is up 36%.</p>
          <p>So, let's stay on page 41 for a second. You see here in the third quarter, we had performance fees of about &#x20AC;284 million and people are saying therefore the results are non-sustainable. Let me point out that is not the case. The other fee &#x2013; net fee and commission income has grown strongly from three years ago &#x20AC;1.2 billion to &#x20AC;1.3 billion, now to &#x20AC;1.5 billion. So, we had an extremely strong growth in the underlying profitability before performance fee.</p>
          <p>They are a very nice icing on the cake. They're significant, but the underlying performance improvements are also very strong. Moreover, we will have more performance fees to come in the fourth quarter. I cannot tell you exactly how large they are because they're dependent on when and how assets are being sold. And also for 2013, we are expecting significant performance fees, however, you cannot expect them to be always at the same level that we've just experienced.</p>
          <p>So, let's move to page 42, where you see the movement of the OP, and here you can clearly see the strong increase in net fee and commission income has moved the numbers up despite an increase in operating expenses. We continue to invest in the broadening of our platform, we have a lot of a wind under our wings to support the business and we'll be investing.</p>
          <p>Now, given that we have reduced investments in the first quarter when markets were very tough, some of the investments are catch up and they will continue to go, so we will not always see &#x20AC;850 million in quarterly OP, but you see the quarters before, they are significantly above &#x20AC;600 million and that's about a 20% increase from what we have seen in prior quarters before. So, there is a systematic improvement and structural improvement in profitability that is going to continue given the fundamentally raised level of assets under management, of performance and of scale advantages.</p>
          <p>Let's move to PIMCO. That's page 43, outperformance at staggering 97%. Flows, I have talked about and operating profit for PIMCO stands at &#x20AC;748 million. Now, I would like to dispel a few myths about PIMCO today, because I'm still amazed how little that performance is reflected in our share price and so let's spend a minute on page 44.</p>
          <p>We provided you with three splits here, regional split, client groups and investment strategies. So, here is the first myth, PIMCO is only a U.S. company. Now, while we are continuing to build out the core of PIMCO in the U.S. still and doing this extremely successfully as you see, they're also growing very strongly outside of the U.S. and that's in Europe and in Asia. All of these numbers are continuously up.</p>
          <p>Second myth is it's an institutional investment company, that's why the margins are low. It's not true as we've been discussing the last three years, the margins are going up with volume and it's not just because of scale but also because of product and client mix. You see &#x2013; nicely see in the numbers, the institutional business continues to grow 10% relative to last year, but the big growth is also in retail and by the way also in retail Europe.</p>
          <p>And the last myth is that this is all extending the core fixed income strategies, but the reality is another one. The so-called non-core products, the new platforms are growing very strongly and they already accounting for 58% of the investment strategies in terms of share of the third-party AUM. So, an extremely encouraging story that will continue to drive growth and profitability.</p>
          <p>Now, going back to Allianz Global Investors, page 45, we saw an uptick in 3-year outperformance, the flows have been slightly negative given the environment that's okay, and the new setup manages &#x20AC;300 billion in assets; that's also not small. The profitability with &#x20AC;77 million is in line with a decent <mark type="ph" /> OE (25:00) in Allianz; however, we're targeting a cost income ratio below 70% and hopefully rather sooner than later.</p>
          <p>With that being said, I'd like to summarize my comments on the third quarter with the page on 47. We had a good third quarter contributing to very strong nine month results, with more than &#x20AC;80 billion in revenues, more than &#x20AC;7.2 billion in operating profit and &#x20AC;4.2 billion in net income. At the same time, we've been able and willing to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our solvency, and therefore, we have decided to change our outlook from &#x20AC;8.2 billion plus or minus &#x20AC;500 million to now exceeding &#x20AC;9 billion.</p>
          <p>However, I have two comments. First, as you saw in the first two quarters and it goes through in the third, net income development doesn't go parallel with operating profitability because we're using every opportunity in this still very, very unclear environment with lots of risks to de-risk the investment side and to conduct restructuring activities that allow us to outcompete in the future.</p>
          <p>Second, even with Sandy in, we feel comfortable at this point in time to achieve the $9 billion plus result, but we can at this point make no comment and give you no number on what exactly the losses on Sandy are going to be. This is an extremely complex storm that has happened. It has started as a hurricane, we don't know how it ended up at landfall, we had a lot of flood losses that are very difficult to settle. So we will not provide you with a precise number. On whatever we've looked at, again, it keeps us comfortable to meet our revised outlook.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm done, and I am happy to have beaten my 30 minutes and we're now ready for your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will now take the first question which comes from Thomas Seidl of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you and good afternoon. I have two questions, one on the P&amp;C and one on the Asset Management. P&amp;C, you outlined the one-off effect of the crops on the accident year loss ratio. However, anyway look at it on an annual basis and there it seems to be fairly less and although the chart on the page seems to indicate that price changes is not that good enough to make up claims inflations so I just wonder shouldn't we see now with stronger price increases reported this year more of a turnaround sooner in the P&amp;C?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the asset allocation, I wonder if you could give us a bit of a color on outlook here in terms of asset mix and duration, 2% net equity exposure, 2% real estate. Is Allianz sort of at a peak invested in fixed income at the moment and you also extended the asset duration. Is this part of a longer strategy or could we see some reversal in that future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with the second one. And that sounds defensive, but it is not meant in this way, we don't make forward-looking statements on asset allocation. Again, what we have to say, Max Zimmerer is going to say on Tuesday, because if I were to say we're selling this and that, then the market will move. So, that, I think, is very important to bear that in mind.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously given the liability structure, we are a core fixed income investors, and given capital charges on equities, we have to chance then to invest less in equity than we would probably otherwise do. Now, however, we are diversifying our investment significantly. If you look south of the Alps we had historically a very large share of our investment in government debt, which we are investing less of our new money, and we are looking into other products beyond government. So that's covered corporate EBS and so on and so forth. The total yield at 9 months was by the way 3.6%, so comfortably in line with what we were expecting and we were needing. So that's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is on the accident year loss ratio, yeah, you are right. You see exactly that the trend is flat and that we've only slightly had, and that's the lower left hand side, increased the prices more strongly than the movements on frequencies and severities. But I hope that the pricing strength and we have planned further price moves over the next few quarters will help us to outpace frequency and severity movements. But I would agree with you, it has been a flattish trend. But by the way, I wouldn't call it for a turnaround. If you run a 96.6% combined ratio, I wouldn't call this a turnaround case, we have a few other turnaround cases in the industry if you think about that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have and that's particularly happening in the Life segment where we have in the German book too much of a mismatch between the duration &#x2013; of the duration between the liabilities and the assets, and we've been driving that up. Some people have commented why do you do that with Italian government bonds, because we bought some of that in the first quarter, and I can tell you for everybody in hindsight that it was probably one of the smartest things we ever did. We by the way made $2 billion along the way in terms of risk reductions. So, I don't think that was a bad move to the opposite.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you very much. This slightly picks up on your last comment, Oliver. In recent meetings, I think you've been discussing the risk management measures you've been taking in the context of euro zone crisis. And I'm not quite sure myself exactly what you have doing. So, could you highlight to us what's your intention has been with regards to managing risk in the euro zone? What you've done and what you still have left to do?</p>
          <p>And if I can finish off them with just a precise question, to the extent that I understand you're managing to be able to withstand an extreme tail risk, and acknowledging that is an extreme tail risk. In the contest of that tail risk, what would happen to your economic solvency ratio that's 202% at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're not forecasting &#x2013; sort of the stress testers, Will, that we have in the deck give you an indication of what of the most severe stresses are. But you're right, we have decided that we don't look at the diversified exposures that you typically see in VAR based model, but we define absolute shocks like a 50% haircut on any major government, a very severe downturn or financial markets, particularly on equities and financial equities. And we've decided that none of these scenarios should lead us to having to take capital measures. Let's leave it at that.</p>
          <p>And therefore, we've been systematically de-risking our exposures. So, for example, you go on the Spanish position, we've significantly decreased our exposure just since the full year, for example, on government debt in Spain by more than 50%. The overall position by the way on Spain being down more than 25%. The same is true for Portugal. The same is to for Ireland so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>Now then you'll say, so how about Italy. We've explained our position on Italy various times, so I'm not thinking about repeating that so much. The important factual explanation I'd like to give you is, if you compare the position of the Italian government and differentiate nominal values versus market values. Now, given that the spreads have tightened a lot, market values for Italian debt are significantly up, but they mark the fact that on a nominal terms, we've reduced our exposure by about &#x20AC;2 billion just over the last three months and we've taken the profit as part of the process as I just mentioned a minute ago.</p>
          <p>What we are going to do going forward is to slowly but surely rebalance our portfolios in the investment side, particularly south of the Alps from being predominantly government debt focused into a diversified investment strategy. For example, if you go to Germany, we never had more than 25% of the investments of Allianz <mark type="ph" /> limited (34:39), if I remember correctly, in government debt. For Southern Europe, that was up to 50%, right. Also you can see the misalignment and we'll get some more diversification in local portfolios. Again for details, talk to Max next Tuesday, he's going to be your happy host on investments; Frankfurt, 11 o'clock is the exact timing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three questions, please. First, could you just talk a little bit through the reserve addition at Fireman's Funds, what the process was to assess the year end reserve review and the materiality of the additions you've made to the reserves by line of business, that's the first question?</p>
          <p>Second question, in Italy, given that frequency and severity are falling pretty quickly, would you expect prices to fall eventually, and how are you seeing prices tracking at the moment on new business? And third question, just coming back on our comment about the tax rate, to what extent is actually corporate tax rates in countries going up or countries getting more aggressive about multinationals managing cross-border tax rates for transfer pricing, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me quickly hit. Thank you for the question, Jon. The last one is less about what you described but more on trade taxes. And you have, for example, in France the <mark type="ph" /> reserve <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:12) coming, where they are suddenly describing it as something they need to do &#x2013; to monitor. So, it's not yet corporate tax rates that are moving, but one cannot exclude that for the future. But at the moment, they've a more, how do I say that, below the carpet approach in order to raise more money, maybe that's a nice phrasing for that.</p>
          <p>The second point is on reserve strengthening for Fireman's Fund, just a pure fact, what we're doing, we are consistently reviewing the reserve in all of our units in America, we're now doing it on a continuous basis, looking at the various lines of business ranging, not just on asbestosis and environmental, which I explained to you in the past, that we did that big review in 2010 across the group, not just for Fireman's Fund, and have moved from three-year update to an annual update.</p>
          <p>That also therefore leads to annual increases in reserves, if they are needed. We have the Group level reserves at Allianz that we're partially using to offset the effect. So, we are down streaming a Group level reserve to the businesses that is referring to asbestosis only. And then we go into specific lines like for example in the U.S. commercial lines, workers compensation or professional liability. If you look at the reserve strengthening we've done on the U.S., the numbers are &#x20AC;227 million, professional liability has been around $100 million, workers' comp was around $90 million, asbestosis was around $35 million and various others were around $58 million. This is all sort of in dollars, the individual numbers whereas the total was in euros.</p>
          <p>And then on the U.S. side, as I said, you had a crop effect also in the quarter. By the way, we might have some more losses on crop coming which we don't know about. It will only at the end of the fourth quarter when we will know the total number, and we'll continuously be monitoring inflation and we will be booking the reserves as appropriate.</p>
          <p>Now, the last item was on Italy and what is happening going forward? Now, clearly the industry overall is having higher levels of profitability, not at the level of Allianz, of course, but still better results, and therefore we expect competition on prices to increase. For us, however, we believe we can maintain very high levels of profitability, because our tariff is really superior to the rest of the industry. And therefore, we can maintain higher profitability even if prices go down a bit. More I cannot say at this point in time because that would be reading tea leaves.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now take the next question. It comes from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. And I have two questions. Can you possibly walk us through the movement in the solvency &#x2013; the economic solvency from 178% to 202%, what the moving parts are? And specifically maybe give an example, because I'm not quite sure how it works. If MCEV moves, you made all these adjustments by say $700 million, how much does it move the solvency, is that kind of double whammy effect?</p>
          <p>And the other is on German Motor pricing, my favorite topic, could you give us a little bit more outlook here and maybe what's happening, because I heard that's fleet business was improving and that seemed quite interesting.</p>
          <p>And then the last point on Fire Fund. So I worked out excluding crop and reserving that you are roughly at 114% combined ratio, which is still very, very, high. And I just wondered when this underlying &#x2013; when does the underlying combined ratio actually trend to 100 or below? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, solvency Michael, having 15 different pages in front of myself to explain the numbers, let me try it without the page and explain it to you in detail. Now, the first one and I'll explain that together with the MCEV because obviously these two are hopefully connected, right. So, the first thing is that the MCEV is significantly up because of the factors that I had mentioned earlier that have been driving it. In particular, falling interest rate volatility, falling spreads in Italy, but also adjustments on annuitization rates in Germany.</p>
          <p>Now, the MCEV movements do not translate automatically in improvement of the available financial resources. Now, why do they not do that, because at the Group level, we consider capital only and that's consistent at least with the most conservative interpretation of solvency tool, because you can only use fungible and transferable capital to count for Group solvency. And we've decided with the movement at the year-end and the first quarter to put &#x2013; become a lot more conservative in terms of what we considered to be fungible. So for example, we had almost &#x20AC;4 billion in improvement in MCEV that we do not deem to be fungible and transferable to the Group level, so they are not improving our solvency ratio.</p>
          <p>So you can call that's being overly prudent or overly conservative but that's why the MCEV increase is not funneling itself through to the economic solvency. On top of that, just to give you an example, we have taken a &#x20AC;1 billion in activated IT assets out of the computation, because we've checked all of the conservative requirements from our regulators and it says you can only activate the following assets if you can clearly prove that you can sell them. We have decided in the past we don't take any gambles anymore, we become the most prudent shop around and that's why we've been taking it out. So that's another one just to take an example.</p>
          <p>So the movement really on the solvency has been coming from the decline in risk capital that I have described earlier that you need to bear in mind. And the risk capital movements, if you look at the position changes, have a number of effects that relate out of, for example, the correlations that we had between interest rates and combined ratios that I mentioned earlier and other items. In particular because of the increase of policyholder participations in the event of a shock due to the fact that spreads have tightened, we have less effect on shareholders. So that's the explanation, and with the 202%, we're back to where we were at Q1, right. But I think that's in terms of quality of the number that is at least as good or even better.</p>
          <p>Now, your favorite subject, German Motor, the year-to-date price movements for asset lease were 4.1% on the retail side, 3.4% on the commercial side and that fits to what you have on page 26 please. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Two questions, please. One on economic solvency and just one on your use of U.S. Life captives as well. So on the economic solvency, given the volatility of your solvency so far &#x2013; I know you're working on reducing that and the absolute level of over 200%, how are you thinking about target levels at the moment given the financial &#x2013; or the economic markets? And how &#x2013; have you got a certain level you think or a range that you are not comfortable in, and that you might think about other things beyond it or not, so is it too soon to think about that?</p>
          <p>Second question, you mentioned earlier about the tax challenges, local regulators and governments being a little bit more onerous in terms of tax captures. Do you have any of those similar issues in terms of &#x2013; I suppose the first question is, do you use captives in your U.S. Life business and elsewhere? And if you do, are you finding that that's getting tougher in terms of the benefits you're getting possibly being <mark type="ph" /> with it removed (45:03) by regulators and taxmen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can directly answer the second one, we don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's very important. There obviously historically have been moves to optimize taxes between countries, but we are a big tax payer in the U.S., particularly due to PIMCO. We are proudly supporting the American recovery.</p>
          <p>And on the economic solvency side, the numbers are volatile. As we've said in the past, they reflect the best estimates of Solvency II and they show you that they are at an &#x2013; in my mind unacceptably high economic volatility, and we are indeed working to reduce the volatility and have taken a number of measures not just on the model side, but for example actually managing duration on the life book, appropriately de-risking our exposure to peripheral debt, we've talked about that today, in order to make the number more stable.</p>
          <p>In terms of the target level, I think given where Solvency II is, it's a little bit futile to talk about a Solvency II level, but we have communicated in the past that we want to see this number to be north of 130% even though that is no hard line and we &#x2013; as you can see, it's very important that the shock that we have put in there, which is not the worst case but it's a very strong one given where we are with interest rates today, still leaves us comfortably above the 130%.</p>
          <p>Now at the same time, please don't forget another capital criteria for us is our rating position. We've worked very strongly on supporting our rating. While at the beginning of the year, we were significantly deficient, for example, in terms of capitalization to a Standard &amp; Poor's AA rating, as of today, we have completely closed that gap and so we are feeling very well on the capitalization side at this point in time. That would be my answers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I have actually two only questions. The first one is I noticed that on the Swiss market, you are actually growing very fast. I mean for being a very steady market plus 26% in Life in Q3. In general, since the past nine months, 14% in Life, so &#x2013; and also in P&amp;C with 5%, while your combined ratio is actually worsening. So my question is are you actually executing a price war in Switzerland or did you just start a price war in Switzerland?</p>
          <p>And the second question is more related to the crackling of the trust towards U.S. We just saw that Germany is trying to get its gold back from U.S., and in that frame, I mean, PIMCO is sensational. I mean, how better could it go from now? And so here the question is, are you thinking sometime to some sort of IPO, because I saw that still 71% is U.S. related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer on the IPO is no, and it doesn't make any sense and PIMCO doesn't want it and we don't want it either. We love the cash flow that's coming now. I think if we're right, we can almost pay the dividend just out of PIMCO cash flow, so that's pretty cool.</p>
          <p>Now, on Switzerland, I don't know how you got there. Actually, the combined ratio, if you look at the table on page 21, shows a significant improvement relative to the third quarter of 2011, so I haven't really understood the question. And on the Life side, this is reflected from &#x2013; by some special items on the Group Life side. The contracts here are designed in a way that we can exit the contracts within a year, so we're not locking in very long-term guarantees at negative spreads, if that's what the question is implying. But we are satisfied with the new business margin on this business. And PIMCO can obviously go further up of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just have two questions, please. First of all, the cost income ratio for asset management, it's been very good. It's just doing nothing but coming down. You talked about a target to take the AGI ratio down a bit further. Is there anything else that you need to mention here? I mean, I don't want to over-extrapolate how it's been very good so far. In the past when you've set targets, it comes down to below that target. Is there any kind of caution you want to inject into that discussion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, I think that's very helpful question. We'll talk about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And the other one is on the target, you &#x2013; kind of the rule of thumb you mentioned on the Life operating profit, about &#x20AC;700 million a quarter. Given that your expense margin seems to have turned the corner now and you're back in positive territory, given the mechanics of how you are running income is coming out in Life and the asset base is growing and the kind of guidance you mentioned for how the non-life running income should come down, it's hard to see how the Life earnings will be as low as &#x20AC;700 million. The mechanics don't really support that, it seems that it should be holding a bit more stable than that. Can you just &#x2013; is there anything else going on here that I am missing here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So let me talk about the cost income ratio. Historically, we've been giving guidance to say we want to be below 60% cost income ratio and we've been beating that for a while given the strong growth in PIMCO in particular that had better numbers for now the last three years. Remember, third quarter 2010 was already at 58.5% and has improved from there. So, we can expect below 60% CIRs for the foreseeable future if nothing happens on a shock basis, which we can never fully exclude.</p>
          <p>The second point that you've mentioned on the life insurance side, yes, we're improving the expense side of things and we're also planning to improve the risk component, but we do not have the stability yet in the development that I'd like to see. So, before I start to the raise the outlook for the life segment, let's continue to work on the improvements for a while, but we're on the way.</p>
          <p>We've been at some point at &#x20AC;1 billion in terms of technical income that fell then to &#x20AC;700 million by 2009 when I came. We want to bring it back up to &#x20AC;1 billion, but we're not &#x2013; given the strong headwinds that we've seen and the significant investments we'll have to do to change the business model, that might take a while.</p>
          <p>The declining yields are also affecting it, even though they're not strong over the next few quarters. And to be very transparent, Brian, we're not out of the woods in terms of capital markets. While everybody is happy at this point and markets are in a lull, you cannot continuously plan with such a low level of impairments. So, some might actually happen to come. So, I'd rather be, as you know, on the conservative side in terms of forecasting results, but they are conservative.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just on this first question, so you target below 60%, I mean, you're at 56% now. Is it going to &#x2013; you probably don't want to be too precise here, but I guess the question is can it stay at 56% is my question.</p>

          <p>No, I don't give precise numbers. I'm sorry. The movement can be so extreme. If you have remember, last year we had one or two bad quarters in PIMCO and then suddenly you see outflows that then came quickly back, so the movement can be quite strong. Now we have some comfort in, but we also remain cautious here, maybe because the party has been too good.</p>

          <p>I want, before we move to the next question, Tom Wilson was so nice to point out on a clarification, because one of the prior questions was on whether we have captives, Life captives. We do have onshore Life captives in the U.S., in Missouri and others, but we don't use them for tax purposes, but to better support risk management. I just wanted to make sure and hedging that there is no misunderstanding, right, because the question was around do we have captives to manage tax positions, so the answer is no, but we have captives for other purposes.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Two questions, first on Central and Eastern Europe, in your quarterly report, you mentioned increased competition in Poland motor insurance. Also I read on Bloomberg that you were quoted that life insurance in the Central and Eastern Europe region was becoming more competitive. Could you elaborate a little bit on the competitive situation in the CEE area overall?</p>
          <p>And the second question is again on Italy, obviously you showed very good results after nine months. To my understanding, Italy decided on some changes in motor insurance, which could increase competition. It's kind of what I heard is kind of a Bersani II law steadily towards significant increase in competition from your perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, let me address them in turn. In terms of the competitive situation, we need to separate margin on profit pools from the revenues. There is a lot of competition for market share that's depressing margins, and Allianz measures itself in terms of how successful are we in terms of addressing the profit pools, where we have relative to the top-line a very, very strong position that we're protecting. So, for example, Poland Motor was an interesting example because the competition on the pricing side is very significant.</p>
          <p>Second, in terms of the Life products, our products that we can sell through agents and through the broker partners are very good. The new business margin is very strong. At the same time, we have had in the past products that we've been selling through banks that more &#x2013; do more resemble deposits. There the margins have been extremely under pressure, because the banks are trying to put money into their own deposit base. By the way, that is not restricted to Eastern Europe. We see that in many, many other places.</p>
          <p>And there, the margins have deteriorated to a point where we say enough is enough, we don't play anymore. The Polish Life deposit products were a case in point and in time and there we have discontinued that. We remain committed to protecting margins. The same is true by the way, as I mentioned earlier in Russia, we have been restructuring and re-underwriting our healthcare business. We had a lot of large corporate accounts that were providing lot of revenues but very little profitability we've been letting go, just to give you another example. So, that's Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Italy. Bersani II was the question and how do you feel. They call it a little bit differently, gross 2.0, that's really funny because I am not sure what gross is meant by. It's probably gross in something, I don't know. And that it might be mandatory discounts increase and price increases only every two years, la, la, la, la. This Decreto Sviluppo and previous laws have been designed, but we do lack final interpretation or even execution of so called secondary laws. So we don't really know what the outcome is.</p>
          <p>However, the outcome is there will be a most likely negative for the average NT premium, and I personally believe that the impact is not going to be as negative because there are counter measures also in the laws. So for example, we do have support on anti-fraud, we do have support, if I remember correctly, on bodily injured claims. So in a strong technical environment like in Allianz Italy, you might see actually very balanced effects. That's different for other players potentially.</p>
          <p>However, margins will come under pressure, and as I said earlier, we will see for a while extremely strong results from Allianz Italy. I cannot predict the same strength for the mid-term however.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First one is on U.S. Life, and I wonder can you explain some more why the margins fell so much when you were re-pricing the product, because I would have thought that should have actually helped the margin?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on German P&amp;C, you've got a target for the combined ratio pool to 95% by 2014, and this is a really nice question, Oliver, you've already got to 97%. So, does this mean that we should be expecting better than 95%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm very confident that the German colleagues will deliver on their targets. They've done a great job in restructuring the shop. It's been a lot of work in distribution in the back offices. You saw a number of further restructuring this year. and in combination with the significant price increases that we've been taking and are planning to take further, I'm confident they will reach their results, I'm very confident. And it's very important for Allianz Group, not just for Germany.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second point, in terms of re-pricing the cost, what is really driving that, it's very important we have in order to protect margin, let a lot of top line go and one of the effects is that because we've been investing a new distribution, we had some cost overruns. These will go away in 2013, because we've been culling costs in order to balance the lower revenue so that will disappear, but very well spotted, Nick. Thank you very much for the question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is around net profits, because actually you raised the guidance for the operating profits, but you also highlight several elements for Q4 that will weight on net income and it gives the impression that you have a clear view on what's going to happen in terms of restructuring and impairment. So, what could you say about the net income maybe in relation to the level of 2010?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on deferred acquisition cost, that decreased by &#x20AC;1 billion during Q3. Is it a change in methodology or mainly driven by forex movements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will dig out the second question, good spot. I don't have that from the top of my head but somebody will dig that out while we're talking. Now, in terms of the net profit, we have the reason why we don't provide guidance on net profit. By the way, most of our competitors don't even give guidance of operating profit, just to be clear.</p>
          <p>And the reason is very, very simple. Number one, we have explained earlier that we do de-risking of the balance sheet and we've been very lucky with the spread movements and have timed our de-risking very well, so that it hasn't caused any P&amp;L impact of any size that we need to report on. So, well done to our colleagues on the investment side.</p>
          <p>At the same, we cannot say that for the last eight weeks of the year, that will remain the same. And on top of that, we are still debating on how to further improve competitiveness, and therefore might decide on further restructuring in the weeks to come. We've a number of things that we're looking at, particularly on the P&amp;C side in Europe that might come through.</p>
          <p>So, I'm not ready to provide you with any specific guidance. The thing I can give you, however, is that as in the first two quarters, you cannot see a parallel upward movement. So, if somebody is speculating on a huge increase in dividends or something like that, I have kind of already disappointed you today, you don't need to wait for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, second point is in terms of that deck movements, my experts tell me the movement in the Life and Health, that is actually due to what we call the so-called shadow deck, i.e. when the unrealized gains and losses moves, then the deck accounting also moves. For any technical details, please see Oliver Schmidt's team. As usually, he will give you a fantastic technical answer.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will take the next question from Vinit Malhotra of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Vinit here. Hi. good morning &#x2013; afternoon rather. So, a few things there. Firstly, I've been curious for a couple of quarters now that the total return fund when you look at the fund flows is not &#x2013; is becoming smaller and smaller portion of the pie of the total flows we've seen this quarter. And we try our best to track it during the quarter, but it's becoming less and less.</p>
          <p>And is this linked somewhere to this higher profitability we are getting excluding the performance fees? Is there some kind of a geographical mix or some other thing that you think it's commenting &#x2013; it can be commented on? And lastly, my understanding has been that 70% has been the number you're looking at on this headline accident year loss ratio? And you're getting there, so what's stopping or what are the drivers that you could get &#x2013; would make you go towards 69% there, a number that you would look at. Is it that right...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking 59% or 69%. 69%, I think is plain, 59% will be tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, 69%, sorry. 69%, sorry, 69% &#x2013; sorry, to be clear, 69%, just 1% more or better. And the ideas is that, is it that in the few quarters ago, we've discussed about how the German restructuring was happening and you just answered the question as well, so is it linked to that which stops you from thinking about 69% as the better number?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just on the dividend policy, from the previous year, was it not the correct understanding that you're also going to look at a certain ratio on operating profit as an indicator as well? That's the three questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Let me start with the last one, we've historically said 40% payout of net income and that will remain stable. And we've said in years where we have unusual volatility like in 2011, we're using the OP and balance sheet strength as a symbol to say we can support that despite enormous volatility in accounting net income.</p>
          <p>Remember, last year, it was driven by a lot of write-downs on the Greek government debt and financial titles. What is important for us here is dividend stability, and I'd like to point that out. So, the objective number one is not having to cut dividend is the most important thing, because many of our core investors do want to see dividend stability. But we remain committed that if net income grows continuously, that our shareholders will participate in the increased payout through increased payouts, but we're far from being there yet. So, let's wait for where we're at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we'll make sure that we stay at least stable. Sorry, no promises on the upside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, total return flows in the third quarter was &#x20AC;3 billion. This is a very profitable product. So, I think that it has anything to do, but what is really important is that we're growing the retail side of the business and the structured product size across the asset management space and that also comes with higher margins. It has nothing to do with that we're deemphasizing the total return fund.</p>
          <p>But the promise of PIMCO to become an investment authority rather than a bond house is reflected in the growth that we're seeing both in terms of absolute earnings but in terms of margins. Last item, accident year loss ratio, yes 69% is a nicer number than 70%, of course, and that's what we're trying to shoot for. As I mentioned earlier, the crop losses that do not count as NatCat have really had a impact here in some movements on the credit side, and in terms of the target we need to go there. So, we need to have pricing strength outpace severity growth, and that is one of the key objectives together with maintaining some progress on productivity on the admin side for next year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. I have two questions left. First of all on volatility of your requirement capital according to the Solvency II model, I would like to know what is the timeframe that you use to evaluate the volatility correlation to market given that there was a quite significant swing between Q1, Q2 and Q3 in your requirement capital?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the investment income, I saw that there was some volatility of your ordinary income in both the businesses, in spite, that this quarter should be quite positive in term of forex, so if you can give us some more color on this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom is preparing a few items on the capital movement. I think what we &#x2013; what we need to think about in terms of the investment income, quarterly numbers, to be honest, are very difficult to interpret. So I always caution people to take quarterly numbers on the investment side as any indicator. I think it makes more sense to look at the nine month numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, going back to page 25 on the P&amp;C side, you actually see very stable interest and similar income numbers that are hovering between &#x20AC;890 million and the peak was around &#x20AC;960 million, and that's the mid corridor. We had a decrease of net harvesting and that's the thing that moves out the most, if you look to the second line, and then we had unusually high investment expenses and that's really impacted this quarter numbers. These are more around one-offs rather than anything else that is structural here. So, I can assure to you there are no major movements.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the life insurance side, let's move to the respective page that is on 35. You also see very consistent levels of interest and similar income that have been trending upwards with the increase in assets under management. The volatility again here is coming from the net harvesting and other side. So, in the difficult quarters like the third quarter of 2011, you see significant negative sensitivity down and we are with &#x20AC;400 million back up to a good value. The longer term average is between &#x20AC;250 million and &#x20AC;300 million, so with that, we are slightly above what we normally have. And in that, you have some fair value movements. You mentioned that the change has been &#x20AC;200 million this quarter, but it can also be $200 million down.</p>
          <p>Overall together with the investment movements, we are expecting around &#x20AC;4.1 billion to &#x20AC;4.2 billion in operating investment income for the next few quarters. But again, lower interest rates will eventually have a cost to it, and we're trying to balance that through better diversification and moving out of government debt into other asset classes as we can and see fit.</p>
          <p>Now, the technical question and the technical answer, you answered what has happened in terms what were the timeframes. I didn't know that, so my experts gave me the numbers. Market correlations are based on weekly observations and they are doing that since 2004. And what we do with the correlations, we actually update them every year based on both experience and also expectations going forward. We have a big group that is actually looking at that.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the model, we've been overly conservative in the past, in particularly as it comes to think through interest rate movements on the one hand side and the losses, and I think we're now where we need to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Two very quick questions. Obviously part of the de-risking has benefited you to the extent it's lowered your required capital over the quarter. You've indicated there's going to be further significant de-risking in Q4. Would you therefore anticipate that the required capital would fall again in Q4, if we assume there is no major market movements at credit spreads or interest rates obviously?</p>
          <p>Second question. I mean, part of the MCEV change is you've recognized to your benefit a much lower annuitization rate in Germany. I don't suppose you can tell us what the change is in terms of annuitization rate, how dramatic a change that is?</p>
          <p>And secondly, are there not policy holder behavior issues going the other way in other parts of the world? So have you looked at policy holder behavior all over the world? Obviously it has benefited you, your assumption change in Germany. What about other parts of the world? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's a good question. Let me start with the last one, the first one is fairly technical and <mark type="ph" /> I don't do (1:13:15) forecasts on the required capital. So, I cannot tell you, this is an if-then question. But let's focus on the second one, which I very much like.</p>
          <p>The annuitization assumptions are driven in part by what we're seeing, and then you obviously are correct to say what is the rational behavior of clients. Given that interest rates are down and that you have a certain guarantee, shouldn't people be annuitizing more rather than less. Now, that is very specific to a country's position and to the attractiveness of the terms and conditions that you lock-in when you annuitize.</p>
          <p>Very important to understand that there are certain conditions that do apply when you annuitize, and we have found in the German environment that some clients actually perceive it to be less attractive to annuitize rather than take the money out and, for example, invest it in other products, and that actually happens to improve our profitability relative to the underlying guarantee.</p>
          <p>So there's nothing to do with only client behavior based on where interest rates are, but that are specific to the concrete terms and conditions under which annuitization happens, because you are locking in certain returns, but, by the way, also limit the upside as part of the policy.</p>
          <p>One part of that is also interesting because just to give you an example, in the future, you will see more products that upon the annuitization allow you a reset of the annuity. That also means a reset upwards in case that interest rates rise as we should be expecting going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And they are never efficient.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, to what extent &#x2013; I mean, have you halved the annuitization rate? What &#x2013; I mean, what...?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. Not that I know of at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, just in regard to my first question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, sorry, this is very important, so let's not quickly move on. Let me give you a comment. It also obviously depends on what the competing offer is. Let me give you an example from the U.S. Why did you see on U.S. VA in the past very significant lapses towards your 6, 7, and 8 of VA products, and there're two reasons. Number one, the lockup period was ending, but number two, the industry was so competitive that everybody else was offering ever higher benefits to clients that made it rational for brokers and clients to move the assets out of one product into another one.</p>
          <p>Now, if the environment changes where, for example, new product offerings become less generous, it becomes less logical and legally problematic for brokers to move clients from one product to another. So, you cannot just look at client behavior in isolation. You also need to look at it relative to other offers. So let's not just look at the client behavior, it also depends on what the competing offers in the market are and what is distribution behavior, because only the vector of the three drive the effective annuitization behavior.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Sorry, just back to my first question, I mean, the broad &#x2013; first off, I'm not asking to make a forecast for what required capital will do in Q4, but I'm just trying to understand, you've done quite a lot to reduce required capital. Is that the kind of easy stuff done or is there other stuff that you can just still do to reduce required capital or is it that any sort of delta in that number are going to be a lot less going forwards <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:08)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you shouldn't be expecting a lot less. If &#x2013; I can help you with your forecasting a bit and that you shouldn't be expecting huge movements.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll now take a follow-up question from William Hawkins of KBW. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just briefly, Oliver, it would be travesty if I let you do your last conference call without telling us the surplus value of Life business in force in the MCEV?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming in a second. Ollie Schmidt is sitting next to me; he was just waiting for this question. He is flipping the pages and very quickly will be there. And the exact number at the end of the third quarter of 2012 would be &#x20AC;2.624 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're ending on a high. Is that the end? Is there any other question out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have one last question, a follow-up question as well from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Will Hawkins, this is not the last question, Michael is behind you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's not a very serious question. What I really wanted to know is these numbers feel as if there is more to come; it's not &#x2013; you haven't actually shot the lights out. There is more for your successor. But you mentioned also a little bit that you'd transferred some of the excess reserves, which I guess were held by the holding, into the U.S. for asbestos and stuff like that. And then you mentioned Brian's research showing that your reserves were sky high. But as a feel, did you actually &#x2013; in the quarter, did you strengthen reserves or did you weaken them? I mean, just as a feel. There's no numbers. Just to get a feel for how things have happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never weaken the reserves. We're always strengthening them, Michael. But kidding aside, it's just what we have been working on, <mark type="ph" /> the 32 (1:19:07). The margin has been going up. We've also balanced out the reserve strengths across the group. We had a mismatch at three years ago between some that were extremely high and others that were less high. We're also trying to bed that out with Oskar joining the team. And so, there is indeed more to come and there is more strength to come.</p>
          <p>Now please &#x2013; you said, we've pushed down some excess reserves to asbestos and like that. The comment was only focusing on asbestosis after a global study we've done in 2010 and utilizing the Group level reserve that we put for that. It only applies to asbestosis, which, by the way, does not apply only to the U.S., but what we've been globally doing, because asbestosis is so unpredictable relative to what we do. Otherwise, as you know, Allianz is not a big liability writer, particularly not in long-term lines. That's the only area that we from a Group level pay a lot of attention to, and I'm very happy to report that what we've been doing has been very comforting on the reserve side.</p>

I thank you personally for all of your support. It has been real fun, unfortunately also a lot of work and I'm very much looking forward to some more sun in the south of Europe.
