          <p>Good morning. As you know this is the first time that we presented our results solely on the web from our offices here in London. Our aim is to make it easy for you to access this presentation and use your time more efficiently. The change in medium is the only change that we've made today. Nick and I will present the results in the usual format and then we will be joined by the four regional Presidents to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Our results today show the consistent growth which we aim to deliver across these key financial measures. Against the same period last year, we've seen an acceleration in top-line growth from 6 to 7%, driven by our robust pricing strategies across many markets. Growth in marketing spend was impacted by the reduction in spend in Korea, but outside of Korea spend on our non-ready-to-drink brands again increased ahead of sales up 8% in the half.</p>
          <p>Operating margin increased yet again this year, up 80 basis points on an organic basis to 25%, despite increases in commodity costs. Operating profit growth is in line with our previous guidance, and we have reiterated our full year guidance for 9% organic operating profit growth.</p>
          <p>This time last year we said our investment in the future growth of scotch would impact our free cash flow, this together with some factors, which are specific to the half and which Nick will cover later, means our free cash flow is lower than in the prior period. However, given the overall strong cash flow characteristics of the business, we returned over &#xA3;1 billion to shareholders and we have increased our dividend by a further 5%.</p>
          <p>The result for this half again demonstrates the successful execution of our strategy. We are investing behind our brands and our routes to market and delivering consistent growth. As usual, Nick is going to take you through the key drivers of our financial performance and then later I will look at the investments that we've made in the four regions to build our platform for future growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Good morning everyone. As Paul said, this is the first set of results that we've presented without an audience in front of us. But on previous -- as on previous occasion, I am going to assume that you've seen this morning's announcement and just take you through the key points.</p>
          <p>This slide looks at the proportion of our net sales growth that we have delivered by region and by category. Paul spoke earlier about our growth being consistent and I think that this slide shows that it's also broadly based.</p>
          <p>North America and International again made the biggest contribution to growth. In North America, well marketed strong brands continued to drive growth. In International consumer demand continued for scotch across the region and for our beer brands in Africa, including both our local brands and the iconic Guinness brand.</p>
          <p>The changes we had to make to our route-to-market in Korea this half has constrained the growth rate of our Asia-Pacific business. And I'll come onto this in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>Looking at our growth by category, excluding RTD, Spirit net sales grew 7% with growth across all the major Spirits categories led by strong individual brand performances from Smirnoff, from Crown Royal, Captain Morgan and Bushmills.</p>
          <p>Scotch is our biggest category as you know and overall growth here is being driven by emerging markets. We saw very strong performances across our core brands: Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Buchanan's.</p>
          <p>In Beer, net sales were up 8% and our wine brands grew net sales by 11%. As Paul will cover later, we believe that our broad geographic and category reach together with our focus on brands with price points above the value segment is key to our consistent performance.</p>
          <p>So, moving now to our performance by region. In North America, we delivered good net sales growth. Spirits excluding RTD were up 8%, Beer, up 6% and Wine, up 12%. Price increases and innovation were the main drivers. Even in ready-to-drink where net sales were down 9%, we saw mixed improvement from the new Smirnoff cocktails introduction.</p>
          <p>Performance in the US Spirits industry continues to be polarized with weakness in the value segment, that is, brands retailing below $10. This segment is not a priority for us and it represents less than 10% of our US Spirits business. However, we have lost share in this segment and therefore in total our share of US Spirits was down 10 basis points in the half.</p>
          <p>In contrast, our priority Spirits brands continue to grow, with particularly strong performances and share gains by Crown Royal, Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum. In addition dedicated focus within our Reserve Brand Group is now driving stronger growth of our super-premium brands such as Don Julio. This out-performance meant that our priority brands grew share by 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>Marketing increased 4%, spend on Parrot Bay RTD reduced following its launch last year and excluding this marketing increased 6% with focus on our proven growth drivers.</p>
          <p>Innovation drove about of third of net sales growth; primarily Crown Royal Cask No. 16, Tanqueray Rangpur and the addition of a new range of ready-made cocktails Smirnoff Grand Cosmopolitan and Smirnoff Mojito.</p>
          <p>In wine, our premium brands outpaced the market as we gained 70 basis points of share, driven principally by the performance of Sterling and Chalone. New releases supported by sampling, gift packs, and great coverage in wine magazines drove strong mix improvement.</p>
          <p>In Europe, volume was up 3%, continuing the growth trend of the second half of last year. We saw further improvements in our GB business with net sales up 4%. Our priority brands returned to growth following continued focus on marketing spend and our simplified pricing strategy at Christmas.</p>
          <p>We also saw a recovery of Guinness in the period with net sales up 4%. In GB, this success was attributable to a new advertising campaign and the benefits of the brand's association with International Rugby during the World Cup. In a declining UK beer market Guinness continued to gain on-trade share, up 50 basis points, consolidating its position as the number three on-trade beer brand. In Ireland, new advertising was key to the improved performance of Guinness and we gained 1.3 percentages points of share in the on-trade.</p>
          <p>Strong growth our scotch business across Europe was driven by Johnnie Walker in Spain, Russia and Eastern Europe, J&amp;B in Spain, Eastern Europe and France and Bell's in GB, following a good Christmas selling period.</p>
          <p>Price increases across our scotch brands and growth Johnnie Walker Black Label and Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe delivered overall mix improvement of 4 percentages points. As in the US, wine performed well, with net sales up 11% versus last year with strong growth in GB and Ireland.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend increased 7% in total and 8% across the priority brands well ahead of net sales growth with particularly focus on Guinness, Smirnoff and Baileys. We expect this trend to continue for the full year. The increased marketing spend held back operating profit growth to 2%.</p>
          <p>Growth in our International region was widely spread across a number of brands and in all three hubs, which each delivered double-digit net sales growth.</p>
          <p>Looking firstly at scotch. In Latin America our premium scotch brands continue to deliver strong growth. Price increases were put through on our secondary scotch brands to support our focus on leading brands and this led to a decline in volume in the secondary segment and therefore total scotch volume was down 2%. However, a combination of mix improvement and price increases drove net sales growth of 10%. Buchanan's was up 16%, Johnnie Walker up 10% and Old Parr up 17%.</p>
          <p>Africa also delivered very strong growth in scotch led by Bell's in South Africa and Johnnie Walker across the continent. Our Global Travel and Middle East business delivered 14% net sales growth, with strong growth of Johnnie Walker Black and Super Deluxe and with price increases across the Johnnie Walker range.</p>
          <p>Turning to Beer, in Africa we again delivered strong growth with net sales up 19% as a result of price increases and 10% volume growth. We increased marketing spend significantly with the launch of two campaigns Guinness Greatness and our sponsorship of the Africa Cup of Nations football tournament. Guinness grew 13% and Malta, Pilsner, Tusker performed very well in the half, with strong net sales growth driven by both trade and consumer activity.</p>
          <p>And finally looking at Smirnoff, the principal drivers were Smirnoff Red and RTD in Brazil and Venezuela followed by RTD in Nigeria and Red in South Africa. In Brazil Smirnoff Red, Caipiroska and Ice all delivered double-digit growth even with significant price increases.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, continued strong performance, saw Smirnoff core spirit gain 4.7 percentage points of share. We've continued to see strong performance by our brands in Asia Pacific as a result of good consumer demand in these markets. However, these underlying trends are not reflected in our reported performance due to some one-off challenges we've had to contend with.</p>
          <p>In India, volume increased 28% driven by our bottled in India brands as we achieved greater critical mass. But this was partly offset by disruption of the duty-free channel caused by the closure and delayed reopening of travel retail shops across the country. This halved our volume of Johnnie Walker sold in duty free, currently the main channel for scotch whiskey in India.</p>
          <p>In Korea, as a result of the loss of our import license in July 2007, we had to operate through a third party distributor in the half. In spite of this, Windsor remained the market leader in scotch. Our sales through the distributor were of course at the lower net sales value reducing total net sales growth of Asia Pacific by 5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>In China our deluxe scotch brands, mainly Johnnie Walker made further share gains in a growing scotch category. The strength of the renminbi has however meant that our local price to wholesalers has been significantly higher than the dollar based price of Johnnie Walker globally. Stock has therefore come into China from other markets and our sales of Johnnie Walker were down. We're now realigning our US dollar prices of Johnnie Walker to reflect the recent weakness of the dollar.</p>
          <p>Volume of the brands managed by Diageo China mainly Baileys, Smirnoff and J&amp;B increased significantly as a result of the focus we can now give these brands through the Diageo China Organization.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we've concentrated on driving value and prices were increased supported by increased marketing spend. As a result, net sales were up 9% as Bundaberg, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff all grew net sales by double-digit demands. The Ready-to-drink business is well established in Australia, competing with beer in the long alcoholic drink segment. Our largest ready-to-drink, Bundaberg and Cola, grew 21% on the back of increased focus and investment.</p>
          <p>The results we've posted for our Asia Pacific region reflect the changes made in the half to improve our routes to market in the region's most important growth areas. For example, in China we've taken the 200 strong sales team from our previous third party distributor into our in-market company, increasing our overheads in the half. In total, overheads were up by nearly 20 million pounds. This together with lower profits in Korea contributed to the full, in full year operating profit.</p>
          <p>While marketing spend increased by 4% overall, this was impacted by the reduction in spend in Korea, which Paul referred to earlier. Excluding this impact, spend on our non-ready-to-drink business was up 8%. Guinness marketing spend grew by over 20% in total increasing across all four regions. The biggest increases were in the key markets of GB, Nigeria and Ireland and I've already talked about the beneficial impact.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend for Smirnoff also grew and this is reflected in the half year results with increased volume, value and improved brand health measures on the back of a new global campaign and a new GB specific campaign. Where a growth driver works we look to take it to other markets and we've done this with the Smirnoff Diamonds campaign in the US, which started in GB two years ago with its focus on Smirnoff purity.</p>
          <p>Investment in Baileys was up, driving growth in the mature markets such as GB, supporting innovation and driving sales in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Once again, we've seen operating margin expansion in our business up 80 basis points in the half. The principal driver of this was International where margin grew by 80 basis points. International has the second highest margin and has the fastest growing top line so it makes a real contribution to our overall margin position through market mix improvement.</p>
          <p>Gross margins were up 40 basis points. The main driver was the price mix improvement in North America and International. In the half, we were able to contain much of the input price pressure. I expect this to be more difficult in the second half.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our reported income statement, the negative impact of exchange was 13 million pounds, less than we had anticipated at the start of the year. Weakness in the US dollar has been partly offset by the strength of the euro. For the full year, we estimate that at current exchange rates operating profits will not be materially impacted by exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>Profit from associates increased by 14 million pounds, mainly driven by Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy. Net finance charges increased by 58 million pounds. Let me break this number out for you. The net interest charge increased by 37 million pounds to 157 million for the half year largely due to the increase in average net debt from 4.3 billion pounds in the first half of fiscal '07 to 5.3 billion pounds in this half which was mainly driven by our share buyback program and the dividend payment. Our effective interest rate after foreign exchange movements increased 30 basis points, from 5.5% to 5.8% mainly due to maturing US dollar fixed-rate debt being refinanced at market rates of about 5.5%.</p>
          <p>In addition floating rates increased significantly in the first half. As usual we've recognized the exchange rate movements on short-term inter-company loans and loans for which hedge accounting is not applicable. It's not possible to forecast this exchange rate effect, but as you can see the impact is volatile with an 11 million pounds movement period-on-period.</p>
          <p>The movement in other finance charges relates to a write-down in the value of cash balances as we released previously trapped cash from market with exchange controls. I still expect our full year interest rate will be about 5.9%. As we have outlined at our prelims our underlying tax rate has increased from about 25% to 26% and I expect it will stay at this level for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>As you know we are currently running below our ongoing cash tax rate of 21%. This year I expect the full year cash tax payment will be about 400 million pounds. That's just a little up on fiscal '07.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow for the period was lower than the prior period. Interest and tax paid were up in the half, although as I said earlier I don't expect the tax paid will be up significantly for the full year.</p>
          <p>Working capital increased beyond the normal business growth requirement, which I estimate to be about 50 million pounds. As I anticipated last year, when we announced our investment in additional scotch capacity, stock of maturing spirits is up about 50 million pounds as we build our holdings to meet the global demand for scotch.</p>
          <p>In addition a number of market specific movements led to an increase in working capital in the half, for example we saw significant inflation in Venezuela, which increased our working capital position there. And we saw a late ordering pattern in our North American Beer business. These factors are not expected to impact our full year cash flow position.</p>
          <p>The increasing capital expenditure is due to the investment we've already announced for the new distillery in Scotland and to lower disposal against last year when we recognized 30 million pounds of cash relating to Park Royal.</p>
          <p>Net borrowings increased to 5.7 billion at December the 31st, 2007. The main drivers were the return of a further 1 billion pounds to shareholders in dividends and buybacks offset by 436 million of free cash flow. Exchange and other costs of 300 million was driven principally by the retranslation of our period end debt.</p>
          <p>At the 31st December, 2007, Sterling was weaker against both the US dollar and the euro than at the 30th of June, 2007 and this impacted year end debt by about 200 million pounds. In addition, the hedging of our employee share options scheme increased net debt by 85 million pounds, however, this impact will reduce in the second half. For a number of years, we've managed our debt to a series of ratios, which are broadly consistent with a single-A credit rating. I continue to believe that this is the best policy for the company, especially in these volatile financial markets.</p>
          <p>In the last few weeks, we have announced strategic investments, totaling over $1 billion, for our equity stake in Ketel One and for Rosenblum Cellars. This higher level investment will not impact the level of our 2008 share buyback program but may reduce our buyback program in 2009 from current levels.</p>
          <p>Excluding exceptional items, reported EPS in the first half was 37.5 pence per share against 32.8 pence per share in the first half of fiscal 2007. This is an increase of 14%. Adjusting for the higher tax rate last year of 28% and for exchange rate movements the comparable EPS for the first half of fiscal '07 would be 33.5 pence, giving an underlying growth in this half year of 12%.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver improvements in our other key measures of shareholder value creation. Economic profit was up by 62 million pounds to 577 million pounds and our return on invested capital was 18.5% in the half, an increase of 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>So, before I finished I want to spend a moment looking at our first half trading performance positions for the second half. We've again delivered the strong growth in North America and since the period end we've not seen any significant changes in consumer trends. Low price point brands in Spirits continue to decline.</p>
          <p>However, those segments which form the base of our business in North America have continued to see good consumer demand and we've seen our superior route to market continue to deliver share gains for our priority brands.</p>
          <p>In Europe, for the full year we will increase our marketing spend in line with the first half. Strong performance in Eastern Europe and Russia, together with the benefits of our focus behind consumer demand for premium brands will drive our second half performance. And therefore I expect that for the full year performance in Europe is likely to be in line with the first half.</p>
          <p>Looking at international, the current unrest in Kenya will impact our business in East Africa. However, the first half performance has demonstrated the strength of our market and brand positions. And we'll continue to drive top line growth and margin improvement, from beer in Africa, from Vodka in Brazil and South Africa, and scotch across the region.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to invest in our Asia Pacific business in the second half. This will impact our margin in the short-term. But these markets will be increasingly important, as consumer demand for premium brands continues to grow. The first half was impacted by the loss of our import license in Korea and by the disruption we saw in the Indian Duty Free business. In the second half the impact is likely to be smaller.</p>
          <p>Now I will hand back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Nick. Earlier today, I spoke about Diageo's strength being our diversity. As slide shows we have scale in the world leading beverage alcohol markets and we have leading brands in all major categories. In addition, our brands cover all price points. However, we focus on the most popular price points with less than 3% of our sales from low price value brands and around 5% of our sales at the super and ultra premium price points. Together with our financial strength, this allows us to build great routes to market.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to spend a few minutes looking at what we've done region-by-region in the half to invest behind this strength. Firstly North America, our strategy here capitalizes on three factors. Consumers there continue to demand premium brands. The most recent data shows that Spirits is growing, while low price brands have seen further decline. Super premium and ultra premium brands remain the fastest growing segment in North America.</p>
          <p>In the US favorable demographic changes have had and will continue to have a positive impact on the Spirits market. Each year the legal drinking age population is increasing, and multicultural consumer groups now represent a key driver of the increasing consumer demand for Spirits. And finally, our dedicated distributor system already has a proven track record and we are now taking it to the next level. Let me look at each of those in turn.</p>
          <p>Social trends, even more than demographics and wealth effects, have driven consumer demand for higher-end products over the last few years. As I have said before, our brands represent affordable luxury. With further growth of our priority Spirits brands of 8% in the half, the growth rate on these brands is unchanged. Over the last few years, our marketing campaigns have built our brand equity allowing stronger pricing initiatives.</p>
          <p>Improved mix has also driven top-line growth. We've made changes to our Reserve Brand Group organization to improve our performance in the super premium segment. This together with increased focus by our marketing teams and our distribution sales teams has driven 30% net sales growth for our reserve brands.</p>
          <p>We're also thinking more broadly about how we can grow our super and ultra premium brands. C&#xEE;roc's tie-up with Shawn "Diddy" Combs is a great example there, it's early days but net sales growth for the first three months has already improved by 70%.</p>
          <p>Innovation, as Nick said, has been a major driver of growth in North America. Much of this growth is focused on the consumers' demand for premium line extensions such as Tanqueray Rangpur and Crown Royal Cask Number 16.</p>
          <p>In Tequila, consumer demand is switching to the more premium drink and again we are responding through innovation with the introduction of Jos&#xE9; Cuervo Reserva Platino. But innovation isn't limited to premium migration in spirits. Innovation in wine has also been a key driver of our 12% growth.</p>
          <p>The increased ethnic diversity of the legal drinking age population in the US is a big opportunity for Diageo. We've seen the result of our investment on appropriate media and events connecting with multi-cultured consumers in the way that is most relevant to them.</p>
          <p>Baileys for example has increased its appeal to African American consumers with sponsorship of music acts such as John Legend. Baileys is also attracting Hispanic consumers with increased presence across Hispanic media channels.</p>
          <p>Crown Royal now has marketing programs on Spanish language TV and Radio. And we have Korean focused advertising for Crown Royal Special Reserve. We are also using the success of Buchanan's in Latin America to reach Hispanic consumers in the US who represent over half of the brand's volume. This has resulted in net sales growth of 30% for the brand.</p>
          <p>Diageo's dedicated distribution system continues to deliver tangible benefits. We provide our distributors with a comprehensive range of brands across categories and across price points. They provide us with a more efficient way in which we can deploy our brand sales and our growth drivers through dedicated sales teams.</p>
          <p>In the last six months, we've made progress in further differentiating our distributor sales forces from those of the competition. We've been working with our distributors to incorporate specialist teams and expertise which align our strategic priorities, especially I've just mentioned around focus on reserve brands. Additional resources are now aligned against other growth opportunities such as increasing on premise coverage, and aligning resources against the multi cultural opportunity again in line with our focus. Our distributor development program is now in place and we've worked with each distributor established an action plan identifying specific areas for further improvement.</p>
          <p>As you know the European beverage alcohol market has seen a number of social and demographic changes in the last few years. And we have affected overall consumer demand. Our strategy in Europe is to leverage the opportunities which our strong market positions give us to expand our margins.</p>
          <p>We're investing behind the growth opportunities which exist in Europe by category for example, in scotch and by consumer occasion for example the trend toward premiumisation and in addition, we are investing in our sales organization in the growth markets of Europe.</p>
          <p>In GB and Ireland, there has been a consumer shift to the off-trade, where the margin for beverage alcohol is lower. We therefore, have to capture a greater share of the off-trade and improve category dynamics. Some of you saw at our sales conference that we're already implementing a number of changes which have already improved top line performance.</p>
          <p>At Christmas in GB Diageo brands drove 80% of the category growth and even when compared across all branded consumer goods companies, we were recognized as having the best brand visibility in this important trading period.</p>
          <p>In Ireland, our focus used to be on the on-trade which is the largest part of our business. Now, we are increasing our focus in the off-trade which is the growing channel for beverage alcohol and using similar programs to those that we have established in GB. As we go forward, our aim is to maintain this top line growth but improve margins through more focused sales activity.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the Spirits market continues to be tough with a further 3% decline over last year. Our focus has been on improving margin through increasing prices, driving premiumisation and simplifying our terms of trade. By simplifying our trading terms, we'll also improve our relationship with our customers allowing sales forces to focus on brand building and to focus on growth. In the half, we've held share on J&amp;B and Johnnie Walker Red and increased share in Johnnie Walker Black.</p>
          <p>Three years ago, our super premium brands were 15% of our European business. They now represent 20% of our net sales. In continental Europe, we have again delivered top line growth through our focus on premiumisation with 40% of our growth from the performance of our deluxe and ultra-premium brands. Smirnoff Black was up 60% and Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe brand grew over 20%. Our approach to premiumisation is best illustrated by our performance in scotch. Here we are using our brand range to create a defined ladder of price points for our consumers.</p>
          <p>In France for example, net sales of our Scotch brands grew 9% with growth in J&amp;B in the premium segment and the classic malt in the deluxe segment. The share gain in scotch contributed to an increase in our total share of the French Spirits market.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe and Russia, our growth accelerated in the half as we have stepped our marketing and made changes to our organizations. These markets make up less than 10% of our sales in Europe, but they grew 48% making a significant contribution to overall growth.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to build our presence in Russia. We have again added to our sales teams as we increase our penetration in Moscow and St. Petersburg and now expand into other cities. We launched the new Johnnie Walker campaign, "Seriously Black" to enhance the "Keep Walking" message.</p>
          <p>The combined impact has been an estimated eight percentage points of share gain by Johnnie Walker Black Label in the deluxe Scotch segment. We've also made changes to our organization in Eastern Europe. We now have the single hub organization and growth has accelerated in the half.</p>
          <p>In Poland our in-market companies focused on the premiumisation opportunity and marketing has increased behind the key priorities. Smirnoff Black, Johnnie Walker Black Label and Baileys, as a result net sales grew 30% in the half.</p>
          <p>In other markets in Eastern Europe, we operate through distributors. This gives us greater reach and we are transferring the learning from our US distributor system to these distributors, implementing capability building programs that will improve sales execution.</p>
          <p>Our International region not only makes a significant contribution to our growth but it's now a significant part of our business. This is the result of three years of consistent investment in our organization, in our routes to market and in our brands with high levels of marking behind them and that's coupled with a great innovation program.</p>
          <p>Across our International region, we've seen continued consumer demand for scotch. As the market leader, we are driving this growth. In Africa, we remain one of the best performing Beer companies on the continent. Guinness leads this growth. But the strength of our business in Africa is the combination of Guinness with our local lager brands, which have leading market positions. These brands provide us with a platform of future growth for our spirits brands in Africa.</p>
          <p>As this slide shows scotch is nearly 50% of our business at International and it's the biggest driver of growth. We've established category leading positions in the major markets of the regions. This is true in established markets where we already hold strong leadership positions such as Venezuela and Brazil, as well as newer markets such as South Africa and Mexico. Given the importance of scotch to the international region we're focusing on the most profitable opportunities.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we've improved the profitability of our secondary scotch brands by taking price increases significantly above the rate of inflation. Our focus is at the highest value segment in our key brands Buchanan's, Johnnie Walker and Old Parr. All grew strongly as a result of great marketing campaign and successful innovation.</p>
          <p>Focus on the key brands brought 12 percentage points of mix improvement in Latin America as a volume on our scotch brands decline 2%, whilst net sales increased 10. In Mexico, we are gaining share in all scotch categories and in Brazil, we gained share on Buchanan's while in Venezuela we gained share on Old Parr.</p>
          <p>Scotch is 15% of our business in Africa, but the performance of our Scotch brands delivered over a quarter of our growth there. In South Africa, Bell's continues to lead the category and gain share, while Johnnie Walker has constantly grown share in the deluxe segment.</p>
          <p>In Africa, our business is based on long established routes to market across the continent. Beer is the foundation of this and our strength comes from the range of brands across price points. This means we can grow by switching consumers out of the informal alcohol category to Senator. And then by recruiting a different set of consumers into the premium lager segment such as Tusker. We continue to invest in these brands with new markets and the new brands with innovation as a key driver of growth. In addition, we are growing our ready-to-drink brands across International, in particular Smirnoff RTDs, grew 17% in the half.</p>
          <p>We will also widen our Spirits business. I talked a moment ago about the development our scotch brands in Africa. This will broaden our Spirits range in Africa. However, growth in Smirnoff and Baileys is also widening the brand range throughout the region.</p>
          <p>And finally, our Asia-Pacific region where we have some of our biggest opportunities. Markets here are opening up and the growth of these economies means that increasingly the consumers have the purchasing power to buy the International Spirits brands that they aspire to. Our focus is clear. We have to broaden our brand range and invest in our organizations to ensure that we capture this growth opportunity.</p>
          <p>We have made considerable progress in the half in laying down the platform for future growth. Our markets fall into two categories: Markets such as Australia, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Thailand which have establish routes to market and those such as India and China, where we see consumer demand for International Spirits increase as a result of very strong economic growth.</p>
          <p>Our focus in the established markets is to use our brand range to access the biggest growth opportunities. For example, in Australia, innovation in the ready-to-drink segment has contributed to the 9% growth that we delivered there.</p>
          <p>Our strategic focus in India has been to expand our bottled in India business as this will provide us with a platform for our duty paid imported Spirits such as Johnnie Walker. The performance has been impressive. Smirnoff grew 40% and our innovation brands Shark Tooth, Hague and Masterstroke have each got off to a very successful start. Duties have already declined to some extent. We've benefited with strong growth in our imported spirits in this channel.</p>
          <p>In China, we're investing behind a wider range of brands. Baileys, Smirnoff, J&amp;B, Dimple and Guinness have all seen increased distribution and up-weighting marketing campaigns, including the Baileys sponsorship of the Chinese equivalent of Pop Idol. While currently a small proportion of the international spirits market in China, the consumer appeal of these brands will over the long-term be as strong as for super deluxe scotch.</p>
          <p>When we created Asia Pacific as our fourth region last year, we did it in anticipation of the investments we would have to make in these markets. We've already talked to you about the new logistics center that we've established in Singapore. During this half we've outsourced both systems support and transaction processing. This has allowed the in-market companies to focus on the sales and marketing of our brands, in the same way that the creation of our shared services function in Budapest has benefited our mature market businesses.</p>
          <p>As a result, we've increased our sales function in a number of markets. The biggest increase has been in China where we transferred the sales force from our distribution partner CITIC/Sims to our own in-market company Diageo China.</p>
          <p>In India we've recently established a dedicated sales function to cater for bottled in origin duty paid business and this has resulted in a significant increase in our business in that channel with sales on Johnnie Walker Black of nearly 80% and Johnnie Walker Red has virtually doubled.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we are also establishing a directly controlled sales force, which will improve the way that we get our innovation to market there. We've also seen in the last few weeks, that we have agreed one acquisition and two new alliances, which not only brings three great brands into Diageo, but also enhance our presence in key growth areas.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of Rosenblum Cellars adds a Zinfandel to our premium wine range in North America. Zinfandel is one of the fastest growing categories in the US premium wine category. And the highly rated Rosenblum gives us better presence in that segment.</p>
          <p>On Ketel One, as you know, I'm delighted that we now our great brand across the Vodka spread. We have Smirnoff, Ketel One and C&#xEE;roc. The brand Ketel is tremendous and the fit is excellent and I look forward to reporting further on its growth performance. And thirdly, Zacapa, much smaller in scale, but truly a gem in the growing ultra-premium rum category.</p>
          <p>And finally a word about Bushmills, the industry is rich with tradition, but celebrating 400 years of heritage will be a major event for us. The celebration will begin in April as part of this and the Irish Government will recognize the distillery's history on its bank note.</p>
          <p>In summary then, this half has seen Diageo deliver broadly based growth. As Nick has described, we faced some issues in the half and we will have some in the second half, however, the performance that we delivered demonstrates the resilience of our business. In the half we have made further investments behind our successful marketing campaigns and behind our sales organizations in all four regions. These investments have strengthened our platform for growth. Given the performance that we delivered in the first half and the investments that we've made, we can reiterate our guidance for full year organic operating profit growth of 9%. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Now Nick, Ivan, Stuart, John and I will take your questions, if I can invite my colleagues to come forward. If you have a question for us please use the appropriate telephone number that you will see on your screen. It will take a few moments for this to actually register and get set up but while you're getting ready for this, I'd like to share with you some examples, some great examples of our recent advertising campaigns. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our first question from Trevor Stirling of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen, this is Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. A few questions for you. First one, Ireland and Guinness, you mentioned the impact of a new advertising, but also Ireland had very poor weather in July and August, typically with this poor weather Guinness increases its share of the on-trade. If you look at trends over the year are we likely to see that improvement in Ireland diminish as we return to more normal weather patterns?</p>
          <p>Second one, corporate expenses had been running at a run rate of around 75 million per half, we've had 32 million for the last two periods which I understand comes from the exchange rate adjustments on the charges. Are we likely to see 75 million as a run rate over the medium term -- 75 million per half, 150 million per full year?</p>
          <p>And the final thing about China, Nick mentioned that you took on board another 20 million of overhead but I presume you also took on board the gross margin that was associated with that wholesaling business as well. So could you just clarify what was the net impact on operating profit of the new distribution arrangements in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'll ask Andrew to maybe start by responding to the question on Ireland, as you know Andrew is responsible for our European business and then maybe Nick you can take the question on corporate and John on the whole cost in China. So Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Trevor. You're very well informed, indeed when the weather's poor in the summer less people trade out of Guinness into a more refreshing colder product and we did indeed benefit from that in the latter part of the summer last year. However, that's not by any means the only reason why performance has improved on Guinness in Ireland.</p>
          <p>We have taken the decision to put a little bit more money behind our marketing now that we're very clear about which growth drivers work for us on the brand. So we've spent more on our television advertising and behind several very, very effective sponsorships, mainly sport sponsorships. We also benefited from the fact that the World Cup Rugby took place in the autumn as well.</p>
          <p>As to how sustainable the current performance is, I think for us to expect volume growth to continue in a declining on-premise market would be asking for a lot, but certainly the trajectory we feel has improved on a sustainable basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again just on the Guinness point, you've heard me say before that the potential for Guinness really does lie outside of Europe where we're seeing phenomenal performance for the brand. Nick, corporate costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trevor, just one piece of context around corporate overheads, although the line reads fairly simply there is actually quite a range of things that go into that line. Yes, the pure overheads number that you would expect, but there are also some project costs, Gleneagles, for instance, would sit in there. And as you rightly say the foreign exchange impact that happens if you like between the center, i.e. our treasury organization and the markets, any move between what we would call budget rate and actual rate sits in that corporate overhead line. And of the roughly 30 million improvement period-over-period about 10 is underlying improvement in costs; about 20 comes from that exchange rate impact.</p>
          <p>The other side of that impact is effectively in the region, so this is not when you get to looking at things like organic growth, a factor for Diageo, it's actually a corporate change. To your question I would expect the favorable half year effect to translate through to the full year so you will see certainly full year to full year a benefit, I think in corporate overheads. I'm not sure that it will necessarily double in size; I think you're more likely to see the running rate go through to the full year.</p>
          <p>Going forward the corporate overhead number could easily go back to the sort of 70 million running rate number if there's no foreign exchange impact. However, that will not be a negative for Diageo because the other side of it will indeed be back in the regions.</p>
          <p>So if corporate overhead is a little more complicated than it might sound you might say, why don't you just allocate that back out to the regions? You probably know that in today's world the regulators are less and less comfortable with pure allocations, they want to see segment data more reflect the way we run the business and the way we do run the business is that internal hedging between corporate and the regions sits in corporate. So that's unfortunately a rather longer and more complicated explanation to what appears to be a very simple number, but that's why it is the way it is in the half year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trevor, just to clarify, the figures that Nick referred to relate to the overhead increase across all of Asia Pacific, and reflects the investments we made this year in expanding the India sales force, the China sales force, Japan and in Vietnam. As it relates to CITIC/Sims, in bringing across the CITIC/Sims business to create Diageo China we've effectively brought across the NSV and the investment. The impact on operating profit is negligible given that we are continuing to invest, in essentially opening up Baileys, vodka in the form of Smirnoff and J&amp;B as new category entrants in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ian Shackleton of Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Ian Shackleton here. A couple of further financial questions. Firstly, historically you've given us some updates round the supply chain initiatives, and I know you're going to come back to that in May, but I wonder if you'd give us some idea of the net benefit that's gone through in this period? And secondly around that, what are the plans around the Irish production footprint?</p>
          <p>Second question's on input costs. Nick talked about a second half being more material than the first half. Are we still looking at 80 million for the year and is there any thoughts about '09?</p>
          <p>And the third question is around the other finance items which Nick touched upon. All things being equal, could we expect given current exchange rates that 11 million of related exchange movements to reverse in the second half? And it sounds like the 9 million movement is really a one-off in the first half that shouldn't be repeated in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me maybe take the question on the Guinness production footprint in Ireland first, and then I think the others squarely fall into Nick's arena. We are still reviewing our footprint and the opportunities that stem from that in Ireland. The one thing that I would say is critical in our process of evaluation is that we will do nothing that in any way undermines the provenance or the quality credentials of the brand. We feel very good that we've got Guinness performing as it is now performing and therefore we are very keen to protect both provenance and critical credentials that lie behind it. But in due process, we will be making announcements, but we're not ready to do so at this stage. Nick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, a couple of things, maybe I'll link together a little bit your questions on supply chain initiatives and input cost pressure. I think the number that we gave at the start of the year, 80 million pounds of incremental cost year-over-year, or about 4% inflation against our underlying cost base is still at the right order of magnitude. I think if anything it's probably pushed up a little bit since then. I think barley and wheat prices for instance have gone up even more than we expected and we expected a fairly hefty increase when we started the year. And the amount of money that we continue to invest to drive efficiencies out of supply chain or our supply footprint is broadly undiminished.</p>
          <p>In other words, if you recall in the past we used to give you a number around what we called our one-off charges. They became ongoing charges to drive improvement in the business. That overall number for Diageo hasn't really changed very much and supplies component of that hasn't really changed very much. I think the difference is, early on those supply chain initiatives used to have some contribution to the bottom line, and indeed we used to quote the year-over-year benefit. I think now we're leading those efforts to actually offset input price pressure in the form of the 80 million.</p>
          <p>I have to say in the first half, we're extremely pleased to be able to report an improvement in gross margin, because it is clear that the efforts by the supply team and others to offset that input cost pressure have been if you like more than successful in the first half. I do see, as I think we said earlier this morning, in the second half that is going to get even tougher and partly because if you like, there is pressure on that &#x20A4;80 million number to increase in the second half. What does that mean? I think we'll do very well to see any form of gross margin improvement in the second half. And we'll need all of that great kind of innovation if you like, in supply, to offset that. I'm more confident that we will see operating margin expansion in the second half because we just have so many more levers. But I think the way I'm seeing that is that second half gross margin is more likely to trend back towards a flatter position than the 40 basis points that we saw in the first half.</p>
          <p>On your question around finance charges, it's very difficult, in fact I'd say nigh impossible, to forecast what that 11 million number will be in the full year because you're right, it does depend on exchange rates. It also depends on the number and type of inter-company loans that we've got in place for instance. Some of those will qualify for hedge treatment, some of them won't necessarily and therefore, that 11 million is quite a complex mixture of assumptions that ultimately, we'll only know when we know how they have played out. And so that's why I think we keep frustrating you by saying that that number's hard to forecast. It really is hard to forecast.</p>
          <p>The second number you referred to, the 9 million, which again was generated by principally, bringing back some trapped cash from one or two specific markets. I wouldn't expect that number to repeat in the second half because we've actually I think, done, or found some of the larger pockets of cash that we can bring back into the center. That doesn't mean to say there isn't any left that we won't keep working on, but actually the large scale of it I think has now been done. And therefore, on the 9 million, I actually wouldn't expect that to repeat. On the 11 million much as I'd love to, because I'd love to give myself some guidance, it is actually very difficult to say where that will end up in the full year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just coming back to the input costs, are you able to give us any sort of steer for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only to say that, as we begin our budgeting process in 2009, which is now quite frankly, the kinds of numbers that we're expecting to have to factor into our planning I would say are at least as great as the number that we factored in this year. So we are planning as a business, as an exec committee if you like, not to have any lessening impact year-over-year than we saw this year. So I would say my marker in the ground right now is at least another &#x20A4;80 million to have to deal with in the next financial year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. Two questions on the US from me, first is, when we look at your premium brands in the US, the ones that basically have put on a 40 basis point share gain in the half, can you just tell us what the actual split is on those brands in between what's sold through the on-trade and what's sold through the off-trade? And give us a little bit of a steer as to what is happening in those two channels at premium brands at this point?</p>
          <p>And the second major question is, if we take a look at the US, obviously the operating leverage that you can get out of that sort of element in the business could perhaps improve. I'm just trying to figure out how much do you think you might see operating leverage improve without a major investment in the sort of reserve brands that you've put in, in the last half, how much do you think that operating leverage can improve going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ivan, do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, if I talk first about our performance in premium brands and what's happening by channel. As you can see, our strong brands like Crown Royal and Captain Morgan and Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, do very well. Our reserve brands was very strong. In the US market, the split between on and off is roughly I'd say, 25/75. It varies by brand. Captain Morgan is a stronger on-premise brand for example. We've seen growth in both channels in the first half, but the on-premise in total, is a little softer than the off-premise, right now in the US marketplace. And things like casual dining etcetera are little more challenged, than they were a year ago. But our overall business in the on-premise, on priority brands, is up, a brand like Smirnoff, we're up 6% in the on-premise. Our reserve brands are up 22% in the on-premise, so brands like C&#xEE;roc and Don Julio continue to do very well. So that's the mix there.</p>
          <p>Your question on operating leverage, if you look at our first half performance where we've taken fixed growth in NSV to 7% on the bottom line. The first point I'd make is the actual product price mix improvements we're getting in the marketplace are very strong. Our Spirits business has volume growth of about 4%, translating to 8% in NSV. About half of that is from pricing and half about from mix improvements. We have gross margin improvement as we go through the P&amp;L, but in the first half, what's brought down our operating leverage is indeed what you refer to, Michael, the investments we made in the reserve brand organization, some major systems investments in our platform in the US, and in innovation. Over time I do expect our operating leverage to improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ivan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very kind. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to add to Ivan's point. Whilst we believe we have very effective sales coverage in both the on and off, I would say we have very clear strength in the off-channel. So I think we will benefit from that. And as Ivan said, certainly in the on-premise we're putting a lot of emphasis behind our reserve brand portfolio. It's very interesting if you look at retail sales in the US through December, as you would expect, sort of gas stations, their year-on-year percentage increase was very robust, obviously driven by gasoline prices. The second best performing retail chain was the alcohol stores which actually grew at about 8% in the first half. I think again underpinning the strength in the off-premise. Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow along with some questions on the US market. It seems recent control state data may have indicated that we're seeing somewhat -- a little bit of slowing in the premium brands, so I was curious on your comments on that segment? And then could you give me an update on how the holiday sales in the US -- were they in line with your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am going to take that, Ann. The overall trend in the US, if you look at how we're looking at this coming year, we see the spirits industry growing about 2% in volume. However, if you look at the segmentation by price point, premium and premium plus, super and ultra-premium will grow at a much faster rate. So the underlying trend to premiumisation, we see continuing. Indeed the low end, the value end is what's depressing the marketplace, and we have a relatively small position in the under $10 a bottle. So as we look at the industry over the next year, strong well-marketed brands that are positioned at the premium and premium plus end of the marketplace, we believe will continue to do well. And that's why we're confident about our position and continuing the out-performance we're seeing on our priority brands.</p>
          <p>On the NABCA [National Alcoholic Beverage Control Association] data you referred to, I mean NABCA is still running about 2.5% up. You have seen a slight shift in the growth rate slowing down in the ultra premium end, and picking slightly up in the value end, however we don't see this as a material shift, because the fundamental demographic trends and trends towards drinking better in the US, we think will continue through this economic cycle.</p>

          <p>I think also if you look at recent IRI data it shows that the holiday trading period was pretty robust.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we had strong performance, both depletion and NABCA and IRI data through December and indeed the month of January as well where we outperformed the industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were strong in the holidays. Our depletions were strong, and our market share performance in open states and controlled states, in December and January has been good and our premium brands did well.</p>

          <p>In fact, just on the question of holiday trading, I would say across the piece, we orchestrated fantastic displays all around the world, in Europe, in the States, Latin America, and Asia. So we feel good about our performance during that critical period. Next question please.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Two quick questions. First of all, on scotch, it's clearly been a sort of key driver for the business with mix and pricing. Can you give us some sort of sense as to what was kind of broad sort of price increase that you managed to put through on the scotch portfolio.</p>
          <p>And a second question for Nick, just on the share buyback. You said in your commentary that we would probably expect to see less than a &#xA3;1 billion being invested on share repurchasing next year. Could you give us your thoughts on that because obviously interest cover remains pretty high, and as to why you're a bit more cautious on that? And perhaps also if you can just give us some sort of sense as to what you'll be looking to sort of acquire next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask Stuart to comment on scotch, because we have configured quite a high-level working group to coordinate our scotch growth activities around the world, particularly as we basically want to migrate the consumer from the lower aged offerings to the longer aged offerings that bring with them far better margins. And clearly we have to manage the whole supply chain around that and we have to manage the pricing dynamic very, very carefully. So maybe Stuart, on scotch, you can give an overview of how we are looking at pricing opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Graeme, what we saw in terms of impact in the half was about an 8 point of price mix combined impact on scotch. So, volume up 4 and net sales up 12, about half of that was price, half of it was mix. But as we started to take price during the first half, obviously the full weight of that impact is not showing through. We'd expect more of that to show through in half two. And certainly that kind of price mix improvement is what we're looking to achieve, as we manage, as Paul has said, as we manage through really driving value out of the Scotch category. And as we have done in a number of markets around the world, move price up on our secondary Scotch entrants, such that we are losing some volume in that part of the market. That's completely expected, and it's giving us the best value outcome for the category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Graeme, on share buyback, I think probably, I don't need to remind everybody  that the mix that goes into determining what we can do in terms of share buyback, up alongside our single-A credit rating is reasonably complex. Yes, it's a function of the debt and the cash flow of the business, but it does include things like, where is our pension deficit, what do the rating agencies see as other potential contingent liabilities, et cetera, et cetera. So the reason why we didn't give a definitive number for '09, but signaled perhaps there might be some change is because sitting here today, we don't know all of the answers to that complex mix. And as you rightly say be somewhat dependent on do any other inorganic opportunities come along between now and, let's say, the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So I think what we've tried to do is put down a marker to say that there may well be a scenario where we want to come off the buyback program, I would say in a modest amount, we're not talking about halving the program, we're talking about a modest amount here. I can also, by the way, see a set of assumptions and scenarios where we don't actually need to change the program at all. So I realize that's not a black and white definitive answer, but I feel right now, given the possible changes in assumptions that can happen, being too definitive here today may not be a great idea.</p>
          <p>I will put a stake in the ground and say, I'm thinking of something rather modest, if you like, at one end of the spectrum, but I'm also thinking of a set of assumptions that may see us not needing to change from where we are today as well. And I think clearly, as we go through this year, I'm sure we can rely on you and others to rephrase the question again, and as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll obviously be more definitive about those assumptions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane of BoA [Banc of America]. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Bryan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question about some of the assumptions you're going to be making as you head into your planning cycle for next year, and really just over the medium term. If you look at the environment we're in today, cost inflation has certainly moved up relative to where we've been over the last few years. There's some questions about the consumer in certain parts of the world, or at least amongst certain constituents in the market. So, as you think about the medium term, have you made any adjustments to some of the macro-assumptions that you're making? For instance, for input costs, do you see this as a permanent reset, or do you expect them to come back? Does it imply more pricing in your model than you had originally anticipated? And also do you expect the consumer demand to be smooth, or is there more volatility potentially in the assumptions that you're incorporating into your planning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can ask Nick to comment on that, but maybe I can offer an overview first of all. Regarding input costs, yes, they are continuing to rise, but I would say that in terms of pricing, this is one of the better environments we've been in to take price increases. It's never easy with one's customers to go forward with some of the increases that we have, but given the inflationary pressures we're seeing, particularly on input costs, and given the strength of our brands and the fact that we've got real momentum behind these brands, I think the discussion is an easier discussion than it would otherwise have been.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I would say is that within our company, we have great resilience. Yes, we will face issues in any given market, but usually we can mine for opportunities elsewhere. We operate in 180 countries, so problems over here, we can look to offset over here, and that therefore makes our whole planning process quite complex, but equally we remain very confident around the overall resilience of our business.</p>
          <p>The other thing I just want to say about the consumer is that whilst clearly the media is totally occupied with subprime, monoline, all the rest of it, a lot of the people who consume our brands are going about their everyday business unaffected. They're earning virtually what they earned last year, there are some markets where that may not be the case, where we may be concerned about job losses or whatever. But by far the mainstream consumer is continuing to enjoy our products as a way of accessing affordable indulgence. This is not a big-ticket item and we don't see that changing materially.</p>
          <p>Nick, do you want to talk more about the broad assumptions that we're contemplating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I think Paul's probably covered most of the key points for me. I think volatility is going to be more of a watch-word for us as we go into the planning cycle and how does that translate? I think it translates into us having to be relatively fleet of foot as an executive team, and I think you've already seen that we've, over the last period, reshaped where we want to focus some of our resources. Clearly Europe is getting more right now, as we find some of those growth drivers. You've heard about us investing in Asia Pacific in a big way, etc., etc. I think therefore you may well see from Diageo period-to-period our resources searching out the growth as it changes and materializes across the world. So there's probably more embedded thinking in our planning process about dealing with the volatility and being fleet of foot.</p>
          <p>I think from an input cost side of the equation, there's probably more innovation, originality, creativity going into thinking about where can we find opportunities to offset costs? So you're certainly seeing more thought going into new sourcing opportunities, new supplier opportunities, across the patch. And again, I think we do need to be more innovative around the supply end of the business. I'd also say, it's still a huge focus on innovation at the brand end of the business because we need again to create for ourselves some of those opportunities in that particular team, so obviously Rob and the team driving really hard across the innovation agenda.</p>
          <p>So those things definitely are, I'd say, really embedded in our planning process. We don't tend to change global macro-factors in our model because of the very reason Paul talked about, we are so much a portfolio of 200 economic indicators or factors, and therefore we have to think about it more at that level, than kind of, well, world growth feels a bit tougher this year than it did last year, or that kind of analysis. So I think that's more about how we approach the planning process.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We've got time for one last question, if anyone's out there with a burning issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Antoine Belge of HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, it's Antoine Belge at HSBC. Three questions if I may. First of all, your outlook in terms of operating income is, for the second half, is rather similar to the first half. Is it the same for the top line growth, i.e., around 7% on an organic basis?</p>
          <p>Second question relates to Asia Pacific. You said that the outlook for the second half was slightly better, but can you quantify maybe the decline in EBIT? I think it was 12% in the first half?</p>
          <p>And finally, regarding the agreement regarding Ketel One, why did you choose to go into that direction rather than bid for Absolut?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe I can take the last question first. We think Ketel is a phenomenal brand, it has great growth potential. We believe the growth potential is better than other options that we looked at. We have been in dialog with the family for some time. They clearly see the upside potential by aligning with our distribution system, and therefore for us, it offered certainty, a great brand, and better growth. That's why we pursued it.</p>
          <p>Regarding outlook, I think we've reiterated our 9% guidance. We see overall sales trends continuing as they unfolded in the first half, and we really don't want to go into cascading that guidance by region. But what I would say is that we do progressively expect some of the headwinds that we faced in the first half in Asia, some of them that are quite out of our control, to improve. We don't want to call the rate of that improvement, but they will improve. So, thank you, Antoine.</p>
