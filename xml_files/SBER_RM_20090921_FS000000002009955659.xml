          <p>Good day, and welcome to the Sberbank Q2 Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to your host today. Mr. Anton Karamzin, Deputy Chairman of the Board and CFO of the company. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hello, ladies and gentlemen. Sberbank is pleased to announce that it's posted its condensed interim consolidated IFRS financial statements for the first half of 2009, including a review report from our auditors, Ernst &amp; Young. We're very much welcoming you to this call and I'm pleased to say that the key indicators for the financials we've posted are the following:</p>
          <p>The operating income before provisioning for loan impairment has increased by 44.5% to the comparable first half of last year. For the same period, net interest income grew 45.3%. Net commission income grew 21.2%. Staff cost decreased in nominal terms by 4.9%. Provisioning for loan impairment increased eleven-fold, in line with our expectation. Net profit totaled RUB 6 billion for the first half of 2009 against RUB 67 billion for the first half 2008. And cost-to-income ratio stood at 35.6%.</p>
          <p>We are pointing your attention towards the financial statements that are on our Web site, www.sberbank.ru. We have also posted there a presentation for the convenience of your use and analysis that highlights the main data points of the published financials.</p>
          <p>We also would like to emphasize that at this point we continue to stick to the new tradition of transparency and timeliness that we've established. Last quarter, we're publishing roughly 60 days after the reporting date and we are offering the level of disclosure and transparency in our financials and notes to them that has previously not been achieved by us and has only two or three comparatives in the Russian banking sector in terms of level of disclosure at the moment. But I can comfortably say that no one else is providing more detail and more transparency in the Russian banking sector financial reporting under IFRS to-date.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll be very much pleased to invite your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll now move to our first question from Alex Kantarovich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Anton, congratulations on the very robust numbers. I have two questions. One is to provide an update on your guidance regarding the operating cost for 2009 versus 2008. And the second question is regarding net interest margin, what can we expect sequentially in the third and the fourth quarter from these visibly high levels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd say we will probably change &#x2013; keep our outlook for the cost and change the main measure so that would still be the const to income ratio. It is so far yet a bit on the lower side that we would have been expected as compared to the year end, say 5.6 is more -- merely reflecting that we've been executing the cost part of our budget more cautiously in the first half of the year. There is well scheduled plans for the rest of the year on how much we would spend on &#x2013; what on our current and business-driven types of cost as well as the development of strategic budget. But we're still targeting low 40s, high 30s cost to income ratio.</p>
          <p>On the margins, you can see we have spiked to 7.8% from 7.2 we reported last time. I see a little bit of a seasonality component in that, and again, would probably expect that the full year numbers should be around somewhere between 7.2, 7.7 rather than continuing creeping up throughout the year. But then again, I'd rather stay conservative on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Can I just have a follow-up on operating costs? Would it be fair to say that year-on-year operating costs in 2009 may be down to the tune of 10% ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, talking about costs in mid terms, we better be then distinguishing between nominal and real terms. I'd probably say even in both terms down 10% -- could be, but I'd probably be a bit more conservative on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and now move to our next question from Cristina Marzea of BoA-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Maybe a follow up on the margin trends. Last time we heard from you, you were cautioning us that the lower interest rate environment in Russia plus some pressures to bring the interest rates on lending down would see margins eroding. Could you just give us a sense of anything changing there? Are you able to reprice using deposits down to offset these pressures on lending side, or do you actually think lending pricing will not be coming down as much you first would have thought? And then I have a follow up on NPLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again on the margins, my outlook for the end of the year is between 7.2 and 7.7, and I'm being rather conservative. Yes, we do sense that on the liability side -- on -- for the retail segment, which is the biggest part of our balance sheet, we probably wouldn't be able to reduce the cost of funding further whilst the repricing on the asset side especially in the corporate segment down from the peak levels of that we've seen in the first half year continues as we speak and as the -- generally interest rate environment is returning back from the peak levels down from the big peak levels. So, yes, I'd still be cautioning for a bit of a margin compression from this record numbers that <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your line is connected, sir. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Apologies, there was some disconnection. So I guess that's the outlook for the margins. What was your question about the NPLs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us -- or just an update on the percentage of your loan book that has been restructured? I think in the first quarter, it was 5% overall, 6% on the corporate side. And then maybe just a bit more descriptive, how are these restructured loans performing? Are you seeing that they are actually performing or do they need to be continuously restructured? And then the follow-up on your coverage, which has been coming down year-to-date, how much lower would you be comfortable to see a drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were talking about around 5% first quarter. To remind everyone, that's the proportion of restructured loans within the corporate loan book portfolio, not the total. This number is just under 10% now, which we see as a metric of proactive work that we're asking our credit officers to do to anticipate the problems, possible problems and find solutions as early as possible whilst the cost of such solution can be lower at the earliest stages. Because we are following quite robust set of rules on how we restructure, we therefore are not sensing further deterioration in the restructured loans that we restructured so far. They show sensible levels of performance.</p>
          <p>In terms of the coverage ratio, I think we are in 1.1 now, that's page 18 of our presentation. This is a sensible level around which we should gravitate. We are confident that we can afford to stick to those sensible levels. We've got sufficient capital to do that. In fact, from this quarter, we are showing a bit more disclosure on the capital in the notes to our statements showing the dynamics of two components, Tier 1, Tier 2, and it's still sufficient.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1, after all this provisioning year-to-date remains under Basel I, 11.7 versus 12.1% at the beginning of the year. And overall Tier 1, Tier 2 capital remains healthy at 18.4% compared to 18.9% at the beginning of the year. In the meantime, since the beginning of the year, we've provided for 4% roughly of our loan book, still remain profitable, still retain capital. So far we feel that we will be comfortable to continue creating provisions in accordance with our expected dynamics and as much as the risk profile requires it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I can have one last question. You very kindly gave us some guidance on where you saw provisioning, loan loss reserves moving towards the year-end. Has your view on that changed in anyway or are you trying to be more aggressive on provisioning because your operating profitability is higher? Anything on the outlook for 2010, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not inclined to change our outlook. However, emotionally, overall, our perception on where the country and the sector are going is far less pessimistic than it used to be in three, four months ago. However, I would reemphasize that the way the risks are filtering through to our financial parameters from the deteriorating credit quality of the borrowers is such that they realize with the lag of six, nine months. So there will be a tail of provisioning that will continue to be -- provisioning and realized risks that we will continue to see.</p>
          <p>This is included in our outlooks. This is probably not going to all of a sudden drop in the first quarter of 2010. 2010 is a &#x2013; going to see the results of this process. So it will be tailing off much of more gradually and over a prolonged period of time. So it is hard to be a bit more specific about 2010. But the pace could be still comparable to what we're doing in the second quarter, but still comparable in the third, fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. Yes, that's the way I'll put it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and I'll move to our next question from Maciej Szczesny from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good evening. I've got a question, which is around the topic of interest income on the overdue loans. I'd like to understand your treatment of this interest income. At which point do you stop accruing them in your profit and loss statement once a loan becomes overdue? And if you could maybe explain the same thing for loans that has been restructured. The second question is, do you charge any penalty rates when a loan becomes overdue and you start being accrued as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do charge penalty rates. The accruals or non-accruals are as per the usual practice in the accounting policy under IFRS and the Russian requirements. Generally, well it's subject to indeed the risk assessment and the situation, but generally the rule is that the accrual stops after 90 days on overdues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And for the restructured loans, that means you continue to accrue the interest they are not overdues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the restructured loans, again, the basis of restructuring as we've mentioned a number of times before that we do is that it's essentially becoming a kind of almost a new loan. We sometimes postpone the part of an interest rate to the latter part of the repayment schedule.</p>
          <p>But our main principle that we very rarely step aside from is that, that maybe a problem loan and the risk and reward balance may warrant a very high interest rate, which may not be sustainable and serviceable by the business in its current situation. But even if there is a basis to postpone some of that, the current rate that the restructured loan should be able to service shouldn't be lower than your standard market rate for this timing in this market situation for a well-collateralized performing loan.</p>
          <p>For example, if the risk/reward balance requires 16% rate, but the business can only sustain 12, and 12 is your normal rate at which you would lend now to a good business, that's fine. We can structure the difference to be received a bit later, but we're not compromising our current margin levels by going below what would be 12 in this example.</p>
          <p>If the underlying business of the borrower cannot carry the adequate, sort of prime type rate, then that means that there's something wrong in our risk assessment, you have to go back to square one and test the survivability of the business model, again, because maybe credit restructuring is not the right tool for this particular business. You have to be taking some other more radical measures to recover your loan, so that's the way we approach it. And that means that if we restructured, we've done just a credit restructuring, then in vast majority of the cases, the loan continues to perform at a decent level, and therefore, we're not only accruing, but we're getting interest payments and cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. But when you have payment holidays for interest, let's say, you might postpone for a client the principal and interest proportion for let's say...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our general rule that -- we maybe also change the repayment schedule for the principal, but our general rule, we don't allow our regional product business units to provide interest payment holidays for longer than one or two months. And if they sense that there's a need to do that, they're required to come to the highest level of authority, which is the big credit committee here in the Center. And I myself in the past six months do not recall more than maybe one or two times that people have been coming to ask for this. And we have not even allowed that on those occasions. So there are exemptions possible, but there haven't been any so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Mark MacRae of KBC Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just want to follow up on NPLs. If I understood correctly, you're suggesting that the provisioning level will be similarly high in the remainder of the year. Was that correct? It was the provisioning level not the NPL formation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to say that the provisioning level is the right track for the investors and analysts to focus on because a), we can afford it to be the adequate reflection of our real risk perception.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure of course....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And b), we ourselves are focusing on that. So I would say not exactly the same pace of provisioning. It may slow down a little bit. There may be some short term spikes as well, but I'd say it will still be very much meaningful material numbers although we are hoping for a slowing trend that we will be afford to slow the trend, but if the risk level dictates us to continue provide even at the same pace we'll have to be doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And the coverage level I thought I understood as well that you're planning to maintain the coverage level at a similar level to that which you have in the second quarter. Is that right or you can let it -- because with collateral I would think that like other banks in the sort of broader region you could let it drop considerably below 100%, if you chose to do so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can and we perceive the good practice to be between 0.8 and 1.2, 1.3. So, we are now at 1.1; we're comfortable with that type of a level and we'll probably stay within that range that I've just mentioned we're considering to be a good practice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I believe I'd have to look at the figures, but I believe that on the basis of what you said if you do maintain coverage above 0.8% and you don't provision materially more than you did in the last quarter, which was 1.8% of the portfolio just on a quarterly basis and that does imply that you are expecting NPL formation at least to slow down in the remainder of the year. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, but then again, you know us long enough to see that we are usually conservative. I still wouldn't say more than I've already said, yes, we do sense the signals for the slowdown in deterioration and sometimes even signals for the situation improving. And we are hoping very much that this will transform itself into a sustainable statistical trend. I think we're all going to be pleased when we see that. So, yes, we are cautiously optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair enough. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And now move to our next question from Natalia Orlova of Alfa Bank, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Anton. I actually have a number of questions. First, in terms of margin seasonality you have mentioned in the second quarter, while I'm looking for your slide number eight, you managed to reprice at least to show very good return on loan book. Can you please give some colors in terms of the seasonality? Was it coming from the short-term loans you were providing in the second quarter or was it due to -- loans you repriced in the end of 2008? Any comments will be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, there's some seasonality. But rather there's more effect of the fact that with a huge portfolio that we've got and with the manual negotiating mechanics of how you reprice on the asset side, there's normally a lag between ourselves seeing in the market the downward interest rate trend and when this actually filters through to the actual transactions that we reprice and actual loans that we reprice and how they start accruing through to the P&amp;L through the income statement. And, therefore, there probably is a good basis for the downward trend to start filtering through to our interest income line and to -- now, and to become visible sometime from the fourth quarter, I'd say. So there's some seasonality but as you can see on page eight, look, it's always in the decimals of the percentage point. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say it's quite mature Anton, can I ask more openly I would say in I think September or October you were repricing -- while some loss maybe a big part of your loan book if I remember we're discussing this and well it was out of press discussion, so is this a fact of jumping return on your loan book, it's coming from repricement you did last fall or is it different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the increase that we see now in this financial statement is a reflection of the repricing up that we've been actively doing. Now we're saying with the interest rate environment getting back to closer to normal, we are now busy repricing downwards to be competitive in the market and to maintain the trust of our good corporate client base because I'd like to remind you that we're the only corporate bank in Russia who has a template loan agreement, the unilateral right to reprice, which we have used actively when repricing upwards earlier this year. But the reason why it exists there and the clients sign up to this unilateral rights stated in our template agreement is based on the trust that, yes, when the environment goes up we'll reprice upwards, but when it goes down, we're not going to be greedy and we'll follow the market. So that is what we're starting to do. That is why I'm saying this is probably the peak of the interest rate margin. It may, in the shorter terms, still inevitably go a few decimals up, but it will soon start turning back down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Well, another question, in terms of your loan growth dynamic, it was virtual flat for the first half, we are now in mid of September, any guidance for the third quarter or maybe until year-end? Do you see any acceleration in your lending activity in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I still expect the environment to be benign. The reason for that is, again there is still quite an uncertainty about the pace of the recovery and whether the recovery is sustainable in overall in the society. That still dictates a lot of cautiousness amongst the smart and the good, practiced corporate borrowers. So, they are not particularly willing to leverage back up again until there is more certainty in their particular industrial segments. That is yet to be overcome.</p>
          <p>Also, the good borrowers, who even in the difficult times, did manage to get access to resources they have created significant cash buffers by borrowing from us as well and from the banking sector. And those borrowings have been done at the peak rates prevailing back at that time. So now the smart CFOs of our corporate clients are saying, okay, while there's still uncertainty, it's not as bad as it used to have been before so we can afford to reduce the cash buffers and to repay some of those expensive loans back to the banks. So we are seeing that and the interest rate environment is also dictating them that look, okay, even if we still need financing, now it's in -- it's much less expensive than it used to have been three, four months ago. Let's find a way to refinance it cheaper, so this is now again in the high-quality borrower segment. This is now, again, a borrower's market.</p>
          <p>We're still very cautious to lending above our risk appetite. We're not lending above our risk appetite, but within our risk appetite, it's still -- it is again becoming quite competitive. So these are the factors that would probably dictate relatively benign loan portfolio size for us. We're still &#x2013; we are pushing, we're still actively stimulating our business people to get access to the best clients, which haven't still been up-to-date banking with us or increase the wallet share of the corporate -- of the strongest, good corporate clients where we would want to do that. So we're pushing ourselves for lending to good clients and for increasing the loan book, but it's just difficult to do.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Well two obvious questions, hope to be short. Question about profit guidance, again, since we're in the mid-September, maybe you can give some figure or some guidance for this year profit much appreciated, if possible? And second question, in terms of your appetite for the equity capital. If you will be thinking to place new shares, which were approved by the AGM in June, well any comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Profit guidance we're much more certain that we're going to be in the positive territory in the profits this year. But still it's going to be considerably below the profitability numbers that we were showing last year. I would be probably be better positioned to put up a range on it closer to the end of Autumn. But so far I'd say it is -- we're very pretty certain that we're going to be positive.</p>
          <p>Now equity appetite, I will let you draw your own conclusion from the following numbers that I will mention now. Our Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios are comfortably above the strong levels that we've been showing around the beginning of the year. Again, as I've mentioned, 11.7 Tier 1, 18.4 Tier 1 &#x2013; Tier 2 under IFRS. Russian one stands at 22 plus percent.</p>
          <p>And this is already after we've provided over 7% of our loan portfolio of which around four we've done this year. So, our war chest is still healthy. Our underlying revenue generating capacity is still healthy. We're still generating profits, so I don't see us needing more capital this year and early next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Two questions, if I may. Can you please disclose the amount of state funding that is coming due in the rest of 2009 and <mark type="inaudible" /> financing to roll it over? Can you please update ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, I didn't quite get that. The amount of which financing that is coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Amount of state funding that is due in the rest of 2009. And secondly, can you please update us on the situation with BTA acquisition and when would you expect to make a decision on this subject? And finally, would you expect to make any Euro bond issuance before the end of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, state funding, as everyone is well aware and it's shown in our financials, we have received the subordinated debt from the Central Bank in October, November, December last year. We have been accessing other short-term financing provided from the state sources through the auctions and repo markets back in sometime first quarter. But ever since then, the amount of state financing other than the subordinated debt has been staying zero for the past, I don't know, at least four months. So the brief answer is zero.</p>
          <p>BTA, the detailed due diligence is fully underway. Hopefully by some time closer to the end of November we should have the basis for making a decision. I was earlier mentioning September, October, but unfortunately it's taking us a bit longer. I know there's been some news flow on -- from the BTA itself in the public domain in the past week. So that is the evidence that the process and the situation is developing and we're closely looking at it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Euro bonds, we have got excessive liquidity. We -- and this is seen from both IFRS and Russian reporting. I don't think it is likely for us in the tactical perspective to think about this.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just wanted to follow up on the asset quality cycle really. Would you be able to give us a little bit more detail regarding either your provisioning level or your non-performing levels per portfolio so that we sort of have a little bit more sense regarding where the deterioration is broadly coming from, the corporate and retail? Any more detail on that would be really useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would probably still point you to note five on pages 13 and 14 of the financial statements, where we are providing both unprecedented for us and very rare for the banking sector level of disclosure on these particular items in the financials. Therefore, there's virtually nothing for me to add up to that without venturing into the confidential client data or the information that is not normally being made public by our competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no. Fair enough. If I can also just ask a little bit more of a sort of general question. What is your and sort of the bank's view on this sort of -- on the residential and commercial property market in Russia at the moment? How do you see the sort of the -- both the assets and the value, which I suppose is important for your &#x2013; in terms of the collateral valuations as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're watching the data that is coming from the market and from our own portfolio. We, as everybody else, have noted that the public sources are reporting a pick-up in the volume of transactions with real estate in the lowest segment of retail. There's no reliable or even if there is some reliable, I would -- it's early to say whether the data is sustainable to form a trend, a positive trend. So, at this stage, our perception of the market is again cautiously optimistic but based more on the signals in the public domain and emotion that is dominating the markets rather than statistically based data flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to come back a little bit to the sort of first question in a little bit sort of different way. If you were to think about the negative surprises on the asset quality front, would you sort of -- would you consider it to coming or where within the sort of corporate world would you consider it coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the situation is such that the most suffering sectors of the economy are very well known to everyone now. But both in those sectors, and in many other sectors, as the time goes by, the situation gets more polarized. There's more people in each sector that are actually working their way out of the problems and are feeling much better and that means we are happier to maintain or even increase our exposure to those sectors -- to those people within those sectors. But equally, both in more and less suffering sectors, there's clients that are feeling worse and worse.</p>
          <p>And that is -- at this stage, this is not really driven by what sector you're in, but rather individually what kind of a company you're looking at, what kind of the quality of the financial management and planning that they've executed throughout all these difficult times. So, surprises could be expected with probably -- similar probability in every sector and it is now down to the continuing persistent work in analysis and interaction with each particular client in every single sector to see whether there's still room for any negative surprises. That's the way we perceive it now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just literally my last one I suppose it's also a bit about the perceptions. The credit market over the last couple of months have sort of re-opened for the Russian blue chips. We are seeing new issues and the sort of -- and the availability of sort of international financing increasing, but of course there is a -- all of these companies, all of these corporate world below that sort of blue chip level, which still -- for which still the credit markets are broadly closed and which would depend on you and the sort of domestic banking sector for access to credit. Would you say that the sort of bank's appetite in general both the banking system and your own appetite for sort of corporate credit would be increasing in the third and fourth quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we ourselves have formulated our risk appetite pretty well in terms of the risk -- the level of risk. So, where the level of risk is comfortably within that, our appetite to that risk profile gets stronger and stronger every day. We're stronger and stronger every day working with a good part of our clients and trying to do more business with them.</p>
          <p>Now, that is us. If you look at the rest of the banking sector and the banking system, there's also a question of what is their -- in addition to what is their risk level comfortable for them, but also how much of that appetite, whatever that is, they can actually afford to satisfy. Whether they've got enough capital, whether they've got enough access to liquidity and whether they've got enough long-term balance sheet stamina that their clients -- even their good clients that are within their appetites are really asking for.</p>
          <p>So for the rest of the sector, the answers to these are very much different from bank to bank. So, it's hard to rationalize and drive trends out of it. Yes, one would expect the rest of the banking sector to be increasing appetites like we do. But the problem is not -- is that not many people out there can probably afford that. So, how do you measure the result? Well, we're carefully looking at the Central Bank's statistics that keep coming out every month and every quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Congratulations on this bold result. I have a question regarding your Russian accounting number. The numbers you provided for seven months, Russian accounting standards, like -- the question is how much loans under RAS did you issue in July? The reason I'm asking is that if you compare July and June Russian Accounting Standards numbers, I ended up that Sberbank issued RUB 850 billion in July only. And then I read some different numbers in the news. The question is how much Sberbank issued new corporate loans in July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suggest we focus the detailed questions on the Russian accounts offline. I can offer you to give a call to Dmitry Zhdanovich, our IR Head, who I'm sure you know the number of. Otherwise it is on our Web site. He will give you all the necessary comments. I do remember these types of numbers, but I suggest we stick to the IFRS-related questions in this call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And another question regarding possible loan to RusHydro. Okay, I sort of understand it, that's about 20 billion. Can you give us more details on this -- on the tenure and percentage-wise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just -- look, it is a bit strange for me to hear that type of a question. I suspect that if I were to try and answer that I would venture into breach of trust and banking -- of my client and banking legislation in the country.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Olga Veselova of Troika Dialog. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question is again please about provisions. May you please clarify when you say you expect the same pace of provisions for next quarters, do you mean the same cost of risk for the next couple of quarters or possibly the first quarter next year as well as it was in the second quarter? Or you mean the growth in absolute terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I probably were referring to, yes, comparable number in gross terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In gross terms, okay. Good. And just a quote...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because in relative terms, we're still sticking to the outlook of around 10% by the end of the year, so combine the two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good, good. And you also mentioned about the slowdown in the deterioration of asset quality and there were quite a lot of questions about that. Can I please just come back to this question again and ask where you see the overdue trends right now in August, September and what's the -- is the payment discipline better in corporate clients and the semi-clients and -- or not significant true really yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Early to say; the data is still very much volatile. Because you're asking how do we observe that on the pace of just a couple of months. On the portfolio of -- pretty much bilateral vanilla loans, that's too short a period to draw up trend conclusions from that. It is kind of getting better, but I cannot really be more specific than that, because it would be unfair and I'm very much hoping that this is a sustainable trend. But, honestly, which one of us really is sure that this is going to be so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure, that's understandable. Thank you. And there was a question about the interest rate, two questions. Do you plan now to cut interest rates on retail deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do review the situation week by week very closely. We've done some interest rate moves recently. I don't think in the very, very nearest term, we will have an updated to rationalize further cuts. And we're yet to see the effect of what we've just done, on one side. And on another side, I think we're approaching the levels of the resistance in the clients base. So we're watching it closely not in the very nearest terms that we're planning to do the moves, but then again, that may change with the situation anytime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And so I might have missed that. What were this, recent cuts? Were these new types of retail deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some redesign of the retail deposit product line that continuously goes on in the past few months. So we're rolling out some minor changes and updates to the individual products. Sometimes we may introduce a new deposit, sometimes it may be relevant to a particular season offer or regional specifics. So there &#x2013; it is a constant development. Little by little we're amending that, making it more convenient. The cuts that we've done in a recent month or two, I don't think I have an update to hand you but Dmitry would be happy to give you a bit more analysis on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Good. And one more question about the yields. You gave expectation on net interest margin at least the range and may you please say on which expectations of decline of loan yields do you base these net yields 7.2, 7.7%? And also, any outlook on loan yields for next year would be really appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next year, anybody's call, too many parameters impacting that inflation, macro parameters, oil price, currencies, et cetera, too far away. Similarly, the range that I've mentioned is more kind of an empirical personal expectation rather than result of significant &#x2013; of very much scientific modeling. And is not to say that we don't have a scientific and sophisticated modeling tools and smart brains that are daily crunching them but it's probably going to be unwise for me to make public statements on the basis of these calculations. Again, the trends are too recent and too fragile yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Then let me ask this way, you have started to decline interest rates on loan book from the summer. And what would be your decline of asset yields for this year? Let's say its range as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Difficult again. This is dependent on a number of parameters, and too early to say. We're getting into too much details that I am uncomfortable yet to give specific outlook on because the probability of me getting of the history proving me wrong is too high and I wouldn't expect any bank fee for these days to be making so specific forecasts now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. Thank you. A really small question as well on the costs. You have already cut almost 4% of staff by this end of this first half. Do you stick with the plan 3% to 5% per year, or it's probably you would go more than that this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may &#x2013; it is very likely to end up a bit more this year and we will be sticking to 5% every year and the following years as a factor us improving our efficiency. For this year, in fact, I think our CEO may have been mentioning the numbers the other day that we're between 5 and 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much for your answers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we'll now move to our next question from Clev Spilervoi from Refis, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Some of my questions have been already answered, but still we have some on asset quality if I may. And that's just if I look at the collective <mark type="inaudible" /> portion of commercial loans, and then I see that overdues less than 30 days, it's almost doubled the previous quarter, while elsewhere in the corporate portfolio, Sberbank recorded a slowdown. So, is this discrepancy a result of your restructuring activities or do we really observe a turnaround on the line trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, statistically again, we're saying less than 10% of the portfolio is restructured. So in relative terms, being back from restructuring is sort of limited on those things. You're highlighting that this may be interpreted as the first green shoots. But again, my personal perception of thing is yet saying to me this may be green shoots, but statistically, it's a bit too early to rationalize that look. They've only just started to show themselves up and we're all just left to hope that maybe it is the turn of the trend, but who knows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I see. This is so enough. And, I have a second one more like an accounting question. How do you account for the restructured loans? Are they essentially booked back to performing or does some portion of them remains among the non-performing loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think it's pretty technical. The definition of performing loan is very technical in terms of whether you can consider it performing or you cannot consider it performing. So, the majority of our restructured loans are essentially new transactions. They show some discipline in the cash flows of interest paid to us and the vast majority of them aren't performing. But then again, we don't really have any freedom on that. The accounting policy and then the rules are saying how to distinguish one from another. And if you're restructured and still not performing, what would have been the point? You probably have done something wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, does that mean that those loans which are restructured and aren't performing booked to performing loans back, so they reduce the amount of non-performing loans on the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of them are, but then again, that doesn't mean to say that if something we've restructured, all of a sudden stopped performing, that was still recorded as performing, well, it's moved back to non-performing if something happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And the last one is on the retail loan book. Well, it seems that it performed better than the corporate one in terms of asset quality. However, we've seen some reduction of the retail exposure in the terms of the size. So, what is the reason there for that? Do you expect the NPL formation in retail to come with the lack of the corporates or is it any other reason?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>There is normally a bit of a lag. But one has to bear in mind that most of the contraction in our loan portfolio, well, actually all of the contraction in our retail loan portfolio is caused by the sharp decline in the demand for this product. So we ourselves are actually putting a lot of effort in reversing that trend and making our product more convenient and better accessible to people while still remaining on a very &#x2013; on our traditionally conservative risk appetite.</p>
          <p>Well, historically, to be fair our risk appetite may have been too conservative. We're moving it back to reasonably conservative as it's normally received in the market, and that move makes the product more attractive and convenient, but still the demand is not coming back as yet. We do see some growth in the applications in the recent couple of months, so we're hoping that again it will transform itself into statistically sustainable trend, but then again, we'll see.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I have four questions. Your year-on-year fee growth in the second quarter slowed down versus Q1. I was just wondering if you could reiterate what your fee income guidance was for the full year and whether that still stands. My second question is, can you just remind us what was the cost guidance you gave earlier in the year? I'm just trying to remember what it was, just the last set of official guidance.</p>
          <p>My third question is, you mentioned that you have the right to even actually reprice the loan book, and the reason you are allowed to do that was the relationship of trust with your clients. And that when conditions improve, you'd be expected to lower the rates. I'm assuming that that will happen at the time when funding costs are more benign and interest rates lower, and that sort of will enable you to manage on an interest margin even if you are lowering rate from the lending side. My final question is about some loan growth in the second half, whether you would give any guidance on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the last one on the loan growth, I have already been given the guidance earlier on this call that we're expecting it to be relatively benign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our cost guidance wasn't particularly focused on any absolute numbers or forecast in the relative terms. What we are saying -- what we are more comfortable to say is that we can hopefully sustain low 40s in the cost income ratios. Hopefully, may be even better than that, but let it be a nice surprise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On fee income, we didn't give any particular guidance actually. We were just mentioning on the earlier calls that we are setting quite aggressive business targets to our front office. And I am perceiving the result that we're showing for the second half of the year, which is 21% better than the &#x2013; sorry, for the first half of the year that we are reporting now, which is 21% better than the first half of last year. And quarter on &#x2013; to comparable quarter comparison of last year plus 17.5% to be very positive.</p>
          <p>Now fourth quarter of '08 was better than the number that we're showing now, but that is traditionally the seasonality. Fourth quarter is the richest in terms of fees and commissions because of the number of the working days and because of the seasonality. Our second quarter is still better than the first quarter, although somewhat less than the fourth quarter. So I'm perceiving our fees and commission results as extremely positive.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to the margins, I'm not sure exactly what I can add to what we've said again. Yes, we are refreshing now. We don't &#x2013; as I've mentioned earlier, we don't <mark type="inaudible" /> much. Well, I put it this way, our interest rate margins are very healthy, more than healthy, in fact, record for quite a long period of time. There is some room for interaction, that is fair, to pass to our clients for the sake of continuing to cherish good and endearing relationships with them and to ensure a continuous high wallet share and revenue flows in the future months and years.</p>
          <p>So we're quite comfortable that we can both afford to reduce the margin without hurting our financial performance this year and using that to buy better financial performance in the future years.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Can I just follow up on the questions that have just been asked? On the fees, you say that you perceive the current results, which is roughly 18% up year-on-year as very good. Would you say that the same result for the full year will also be good for you? Will you guide us for the same number for the full year on the fee income?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Now, on the margins also, just one question. Am I right to understand that you are not only underwriting loans at the lower rate but you're also repricing the existing stock, the vintage loans that you have repriced previously. Do I understand this correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the corporate loan book, there is a bit of that going on too, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But I presume this is for the biggest clients, right? So that's like for maybe 20, 30% of the loan book or that's for 100% of the loan book you are doing this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is available to pretty much all of the segments, but it doesn't mean to say that we are doing it for everyone. It is to &#x2013; I don't think we're ready to disclose the percentage of clients that we're doing this to. But this is &#x2013; because also, for some of the client segment when we were repricing upwards we didn't touch on their rate. So equally, we're not touching on it now. didn't touch it, didn't increase it back then.</p>
          <p>So there's also investment project financing where the project has a certain parameters within which it can be sustainable, and normally you don't change interest rates in those. So I don't think we should be disclosing those proportions for the portfolio and its entirety and we're not going to be comfortable to disclose these numbers for specific segment or parts of the portfolio. I don't think our competition is doing that and we wouldn't be comfortable doing it ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Now on the cost side, I just wanted to ask you, so the second quarter costs came at roughly 9% higher than the second quarter of 2008 if I'm not mistaken. So, just again would you &#x2013; for the full year, I guess you were previously guiding 3%, 5% down, this is still the case, right? Just for me because your non-payroll cost especially increased quite significantly in the second quarter. That's a worsened trend for me but &#x2013; so would you like...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't draw too much worry on a quarter-to-quarter comparison across the year. What I still focus on is that in real terms we are showing very strong positive dynamic in the cost reduction after inflation, right? And after the effect of the deval of the ruble as well for those parts of the cost that are currency based. So, I'm far less worried about that particular quarter two to quarter two comparison that we're talking about because seeing in front of me the whole business plans of this year and business plan for last year and the base of spending and the cost discipline if anything, I'm saying, yes, 35% cost income ratio is amongst the best in the world.</p>
          <p>And to me that means that the reasonable target for this year compared to cost income ratio is over 50 that we were displaying not so long ago. Low 40s is a very sensible number and I'm not &#x2013; we're not planning to stay at 35 for this year because that would mean that we have under-invested in our development and we've under-utilized the opportunities for realigning our business making it more efficient than the crisis is offering to us for relatively short period of time. So please, please don't focus on those individual practical short-term, quarter-to-quarter comparisons that are falling out of the overall context where all other perimeters are showing that the management &#x2013; many &#x2013; for the first time in many years just started delivering on the process &#x2013; on the promises of improving the cost efficiency of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So broadly speaking, the guidance will be not like a nominal cost cut which has most likely expecting a 3%, 5% year-over-year cost cut but the cost income of like low 40s. That would be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; yeah, I don't think it will be fair to expect from us cost reductions in the nominal term because that would mean we would have under-invested into the significant transformation of our business, strategic and tactical one that we're undergoing now. And that would means we wouldn't have used the opportunity to further improve our efficiency in a sustainable manner. So for us the development cost budget and the development investment budget are very important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I see. The last one will be, I'm just &#x2013; if I'm looking on your &#x2013; I mean, again you always say &#x2013; saying that we should consider reserves more than NPLs and I appreciate that. But, anyway, I mean given that you started to disclose it pretty well, your NPL formation in the second quarter pretty much doubled comparing to the first quarter, it was 11%, 11.7% in the first quarter, the NPL formation was 6.7%. And if one assumes the same level of NPL formation going forward in the third and fourth quarter, and the same level of provisioning that you show to us in the second quarter, it will be very hard for you to finish it above 100. So my question would be given that you still told us that you would prefer to be above 100, would you &#x2013; do you think that we have an inflection point in an NPL formation here? Or do you think that's maybe the reserves that you will be creating will be higher in the third and fourth quarter than you showed them in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow. You're asking the question that would probably, answering which would require a bit more details. I would just limit myself with saying that the NPL formation in the first quarter have seen couple of big amounts, big transactions where very, very small part is actually physically non-performing but the size of the exposure itself is quite big and those types of businesses are well-diversified and not necessarily cross &#x2013; the parts of those exposure are not necessarily cross-contaminating in terms of their performance.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but this &#x2013; there &#x2013; I don't think there is a basis of direct extrapolation, right? So in terms of the outlook, I'd still guide you towards the coverage ratio of good practice between 0.8, 1.3 times which we see comfortable. Yes, obviously, as any representative of management, in particular the CFO, my preference would be stay above 100 and I can see that there's a good probability that we should be able to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but just to clear up, you wouldn't be extrapolating the trend of this NPL formation going from 6% to 11% for the third and fourth quarter. You wouldn't be doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. At least no direct straight line linear <mark type="inaudible" /> extrapolation. The picture and the model is a bit more complex there. There's a number of one-offs, there's a number of external factors impacting that and a set of things so, at least no linear extrapolation. I cannot be more specific and no one probably can without disclosing confidential information. So I think the guidance I've just given is where we should be comfortable with.</p>

          <p>The DRs, as I've mentioned in the press call earlier today, we're continuing the technical work with the regulator to see if we can create the basis and the regulation for us to try and do a zero balance DR program which just converts existing shares. It's too early to say what is going to be the result of it and when is it going to crystallize. Unfortunately I cannot offer more details on that.</p>
          <p>Opel, there are probably going to be more official statements coming out of us later today and I don't know, I think the press is probably about to see our CEO around seven.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...just a few questions. Hi. Just regarding this capital. I'm just a little bit confused. I think you got a mandate from your shareholders to issue new shares and the main reason was just to make sure that if the NPL  <mark type="inaudible" /> out of control, you could go through an equity issue. Now it looks like, at least to me, although the guidance is unchanged, looks like the landscape is improving and you're basically saying we don't need new capital in either second half or in the first quarter next year. But I'm just confused. I mean, what else would you need capital for? And why aren't you just categorically ruling out an equity increase at this stage, where the NPL outlook seem to be slightly improved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not saying we're going to need any more capital. If you're talking about the DRs, I'm just saying that it will be good for us to get a zero balance DR program without issuing new money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand that. But I mean, initially you were saying when you were questioned about the coverage ratio and the NPLs, you were basically saying, I feel very comfortable that we can keep the coverage ratio at 0.8 to 1.3 times and we also have sufficient capital to keep that. And particularly given that the NPL outlook seems to deteriorate, it's not accelerating, so the outlook seems to become a bit better. So my question is just I mean, with your Tier 1 ratio now at 11.5%, I mean why &#x2013; I mean what would you need capital for? I mean do you expect fascinatingly fast asset growth next year? Are you planning to make some acquisitions? What would you need -- what could be a scenario that you would need new equity for in the quarter of 2010?</p>

          <p>Well I'm not &#x2013; I didn't mean anything specific. It's just that I'm generally conservative in saying like it'll be sensible to keep your forecasting and outlook horizon closer to your chest and not beyond quarter one. You're probably right in your rationalizing and I probably agree with that. But, it's just too far. But who knows, maybe we will not need capital and we will not do that. But just being very cautious with what I say publicly.</p>

          <p>Yes, I understand. My second question is maybe what one thing you mentioned and also Gref mentioned earlier, is that the loan repayments are improving. Could you just quantify that?

          <p>Hi. Most of my questions have been asked. So, just maybe one &#x2013; two very quick questions. First, on Tier 1, I think in the past you said that you'd like to keep the Tier 1 ratio at 10%. Is that still hold, or what is your target at Tier 1 level?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're specifically targeting that. We're just saying that it remains at healthy levels. Our underlying revenue generating capacity is making us somewhat comfortable that we could sustain it at the comfortable levels and that's it. I don't think we are kind of putting any particular target.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean just on staff cost, I mean I think I saw somewhere that announcement that you're moving bonuses back to a higher level. Have you accrued for those already? Or will we see some seasonality in staff cost because of bonuses, say, in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all our staff cost reporting is on accrual basis. We have, I would say, a bit &#x2013; played it a bit overcautiously...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...with what we're paying our people on a month-to-month basis in the first, second quarter. So, the signals we're sending to the troupes that your routine monthly incomings are going to be looking a bit less but &#x2013; than they &#x2013; that they were in the first and second quarter. So I don't think that means that we're going to &#x2013; in saying that our staff costs are going to be more than we were planning at &#x2013; in absolute terms and we were planning them for the full year back at the beginning of the year. We're just saying that, oh okay, we can afford to get back to a more reasonable levels of what we paid people monthly and quarterly and still stay within our business plan.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, okay, thank you.</p>
