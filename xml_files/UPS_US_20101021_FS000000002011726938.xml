          <p>Good morning. My name is Steven and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Now it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In a moment Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, will discuss third quarter results and expectations going forward. Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.</p>
          <p>Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K and 2010 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>In our earnings announcement today, you'll notice that we recognized a gain of $109 million on the sale of real estate. This provided an after-tax benefit of $61 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding this transaction, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.93. In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS' third quarter 2010 results excluding the impact of this gain. Additionally, all 2010 full year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance.</p>
          <p>Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section.</p>
          <p>To begin our review, I'll turn the program over to Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. The results that UPS announced today are another step in getting back to peak earnings and historical margins. Considering the slow growth economic environment that exists, I find it extremely encouraging to see our three segments hitting on all cylinders. UPSers were on top of their game, generating significant operating profit improvement. This validates our comprehensive supply chain strategy.</p>
          <p>As for the economy, over the past few months, experts have reduced expectations for fourth quarter economic output. Included in their outlook for U.S. GDP were "modest growth is still expected." When it comes to inventory levels there's a lot of debate. Some inventory building has occurred this year, but due to low inventory-to-sales ratios and other indices, it appears there may still be room for additional restocking.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we announced a new global communications platform. Given the complexities of today's marketplace, we designed our advertising campaign to spotlight the power of logistics. Our experience and worldwide capabilities make UPS uniquely qualified to provide solutions to our customers throughout their supply chain. We don't just talk about global trade; we make it happen. UPS provides new tools to customers to help them expand their business, like UPS Import Control, a solution allows them to better manage inbound shipments.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to enhance our Paperless Invoice technology. UPS introduced this to the market more than two years ahead of the competition. This tool now provides expedited customs clearance in 92 countries, more than any competitor. Not only have we added tools to help businesses compete on a global basis, but we are growing our footprint so they can grow theirs. UPS continues to expand in important emerging markets, announcing a joint venture in Indonesia with JNE this quarter. And that's on the heels of the alliances announced earlier this year in Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., to help our customers better manage returns, we now offer UPS Returns Flexible Access, a low-cost, high-quality service that provides unmatched alternatives to customers. As you can see, UPS is never standing still. In fact, just this month, we opened our first Olympic Logistics Center in London. This gives UPS an excellent opportunity to showcase our capabilities to the world. As the official logistics provider for the 2012 Olympics, UPS will ensure the largest logistics event goes off without a hitch.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to take a moment to talk about the UPS team. During the quarter, we suffered the loss of two UPSers in a tragic plane crash. On behalf of UPS employees around the world, I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to their families. I also want to personally thank UPS employees for providing the best service in the industry, going the extra mile to ensure our customers continue to trust UPS with their business. No matter where I go, people comment on how they appreciate the professionalism of UPSers around the world and the quality of our service. Many times customers talk about our drivers as an extension of their company. Let me tell you, that makes me very proud of the great team we have here at UPS.</p>
          <p>Not only are UPSers committed to providing great service, they are also dedicated to their communities. In July, the United Way recognized UPS and our employees as the first company ever with donations of more than $1 billion. This generosity of our active and retired employees is unmatched.</p>
          <p>Overall, another great quarter for UPS. We continue to achieve results that exceed expectations. Even though our operating margin is the best in the industry, we are not satisfied. I'm confident in our ability to return them to pre-recession levels. We are on the right track.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, we had another tremendous quarter, with earnings up almost 70%. Revenue continued to reflect strong growth, up 9% over last year, even with one less working day. These are impressive results, considering the slow pace of the economic recovery.</p>
          <p>UPS' operating margin expanded 410 basis points to 12.4%, continuing our rebound towards historic levels. Keep in mind, current margins do reflect reinstated merit increases and growth in incentive compensation that's due to solid business performance. For the quarter, total comp and benefits increased only 1% on volume growth of 3.3. This clearly reflects the impact of greater volume, productivity improvements, network enhancements and the U.S. restructuring announced earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Now let's start our review of the segments, beginning with U.S. Domestic. Total revenue increased 6.2% to $7.3 billion on average daily volume growth of 3.6%. Daily volume comparisons did benefit somewhat from the Fourth of July operating schedule. Ground volume increased 3.9% per day, and UPS Next Day Air was up 3.2. This is the third consecutive quarter of domestic volume growth, each quarter showing greater year-over-year improvement. Total revenue per piece grew 4%, with UPS Next Day Air up 7 and ground improving 3.2. Yields benefited from our ability to retain a greater portion of the general rate increase and rising fuel surcharges. Air products also benefited from a more favorable package-to-letter mix and weight-per-piece, which has continued to improve and is in the latter stages of recovery.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was 12.5%, an increase of 500 basis points, due to volume growth, yield gains, and significant productivity improvements across the UPS network. Expense was held in check due to effective management of direct labor hours, miles driven, block hours and non-off expense. All in all, a great job by our UPS team.</p>
          <p>In July, UPS issued our most recent sustainability report, and announced an ambitious new target for increasing the fuel efficiency of our U.S. automotive fleet by 20%. In September we purchased an additional 130 hybrid electric vehicles to help us reach that goal. This brings UPS' fleet of alternative fuel vehicles to over 2,000, one of the largest private fleets. And when it comes to our air fleet, it remains one of the most fuel-efficient in the industry, more than ten years ahead of any U.S. competitor.</p>
          <p>Now for the International segment, where operating profit climbed 34% to $419 million on 11% growth in revenue. This profit is within $9 million of our highest third quarter in UPS history, in what is typically our most challenging quarter due to the European summer holidays. Total package volume per day improved over 13%, with exports up 12.5 and non-U.S. domestic up 14. Domestic growth slowed from the previous quarter's pace as a result of lapping last year's acquisition in Turkey. However, organic growth still remained robust at 11%.</p>
          <p>Export volume growth remained strong in all regions, with Asia once again leading the way with 34% growth. In addition, European export daily volume continued to perform well, increasing 12.5%, with balanced growth to all regions of the world. Export yields improved about 1%, as the positive impact of base rate increases and higher fuel surcharges were offset by currency. On a currency-neutral basis, export rates improved over 3%. In-country operations cost per piece declined 2.5% as a result of greater scale, improved productivity and density improvements.</p>
          <p>Overall, operating margin increased to 15.7%, up 280 basis points, although the euro-to-dollar relationship was a slight drag. During the quarter, in our Growth through Global Trade seminars, UPS worked to help small and medium-sized enterprises grow their business and expand their footprint through exports.</p>
          <p>Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment, where UPS had a great quarter, hitting a new high in both operating margin and operating profit for this developing segment of our business. Revenue increased 19%, led by 23% growth in Forwarding and Logistics and continued growth in UPS Freight. Driven primarily by the Forwarding and Logistics businesses, operating profit jumped over 70% to 177 million, with margins reaching 8%, an increase of 250 basis points. The power of our broad portfolio was once again demonstrated in our Forwarding unit. The revenue management initiatives and block space agreements we put in place continue to provide benefits. We experienced strong revenue growth as we helped customers manage their supply chains, offering solutions that include both air freight and small package.</p>
          <p>Margins in the Logistics business approached double digits as a result of our global capabilities, technology, and the strength of the UPS brand. Logistics revenue benefited from high single-digit growth in healthcare and high-tech. UPS Freight continued to make progress, with more than 14% increase in revenue. Growth in revenue per hundredweight was again one of the highest in the industry. During the quarter, we also saw improvements in gross weight hauled, weight-per-shipment, and shipments-per-day. In the ocean freight area of the Forwarding business, we introduced UPS Preferred Less than Container Load service. This service provides up to 20% improvement in time in-transit for our customers. Early reaction from the marketplace has been positive.</p>
          <p>A key strength of the UPS operating model is the ability to generate significant cash. For the first nine months of 2010, our free cash flow was $3.5 billion. This after UPS invested 1 billion in capital expenditures, and made pension contributions of more than 1 billion. We also paid dividends of 1.36 billion, reflecting a 4.4% increase, and spent 589 million to repurchase 9.3 million shares.</p>
          <p>As a testament to our strong financial performance, S&amp;P recently reaffirmed our rating and revised their outlook for UPS to stable. This enables greater flexibility as we develop our capital allocation strategy. It goes without saying that our first priority is to invest in the business, followed by a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We will also consider accelerated contribution to UPS' pension plans.</p>
          <p>Regarding share repurchases, by the end of the third quarter, we had reached our original target of offsetting the dilution of stock-based compensation. We do intend to go beyond that target and will continue to purchase stock in the fourth quarter.  For 2011, our plan is to ramp up share repurchases as we increase distributions to shareowners. We will provide more details on expectations for next year during our fourth quarter earnings call. While I'm on the topic of 2011, as a result of our continued momentum, yesterday we announced to our employees that next year UPS will reinstate our 401(k) match.</p>
          <p>Next I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter guidance. Expectations for economic output have declined from where they were three months ago, but modest growth is still expected. Looking towards peak season, customer sentiment is mixed, but leaning towards cautious optimism.</p>
          <p>For the U.S. Domestic segment, we expect the revenue year-over-year growth rate to be slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter. Year-over-year volume trends, however, will be muted by one more working day between Christmas and New Year's compared to last year. As a result, we expect average daily volume growth in the fourth quarter of about 1.5% to 2%. We anticipate that the fourth quarter operating margin will remain strong, at or above the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In the International segment, we expect volume growth rates to outpace the market, although they will moderate somewhat. Last year, if you recall, peak season capacity in the air freight market was extremely tight coming out of Asia, benefiting our International segment in both profit and volume growth. Against these year-over-year comparisons, we expect high single-digit growth in top-line revenue and an operating margin approaching 18%. We do expect a slight currency headwind.</p>
          <p>In the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we anticipate the pace of revenue growth to slow, due to comparisons to the strong air freight market conditions that existed last year. But margins will remain strong, approaching 7% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Based on our continued momentum, we have raised our full year 2010 guidance from the previous range of $3.35 to $3.45 up to a new range of $3.48 to $3.54 a share. This represents more than a 50% increase over last year's results.</p>
          <p>As you can see, UPS is on our way back to the high levels of profitability that we have demonstrated in the past. The goals and long-term strategies that we have put in place will further widen the gap between UPS and the rest of the competition. Thanks for your attention, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wondering if you could maybe address what's going on in SCS?  And obviously you talked a little bit about it, but at least the way we look at it, there was a very significant up-tick in the profitability of that, especially when you look at normal seasonality. Can you walk us through what is driving that? And then maybe talk through, obviously, the advertising campaign, now it makes, the timing of it seems a little more, or it makes more sense. What's changing that is driving this and how's your outlook changing about how you might invest in that business looking forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Gary. We are certainly pleased with the progress we've made in the Supply Chain and Freight segment. I mean it's been a long time coming. We began investing deeply in this back in 2000. But what we are seeing, basically, is the work we've done to create highly aligned capabilities across all modes and across activities is really paying dividends. Year-to-date, this is the most profitable period we've had for Supply Chain and Freight. Actually, it's also that case for International. We were helped, certainly, in the Forwarding arena with strong demand and also moderating rates. So we reversed some of the margin squeeze that we saw earlier in the year, so that was a great sign.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing good momentum in our ocean freight. We mentioned the launch of this Less than Container Load service, and all of those pieces together really give us some good capabilities. Logistics really is hitting its stride, with us finding those unique services we can bring to high tech and healthcare. And then UPS Freight had a good solid quarter. Clearly it's not up to the margins we'd like, but it continues to generate strong revenue growth and great yields. So we're seeing improvement on all fronts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, I think Kurt said it well, I think we're quite pleased with the Forwarding and Logistics margins, they're at the levels we would like to see them at. Clearly the LTL piece is not there yet. And as that market improves, as we continue to make progress, you're going to see enhanced margins long-term in Supply Chain and Freight. The overall advertising campaign geared to Logistics was geared to everything we do. It's about contract logistics, it's about freight forwarding, it's about brokerage capabilities, it's about package transportation, so it's about everything we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we expect that &#x2013; the way you said Forwarding and Logistics must be at the kind of returns that you do like and you always talked about. Is the &#x2013; your outlook on capital deployment into that segment different as a result of the progress that you've made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clearly, we love Logistics. And we'll look for prudent ways to expand the business, although we've invested a tremendous amount to build a global platform. So we don't need acquisitions for growth. We've got an incredible access to customers. But there may be some areas, developing countries and others where it makes sense to do tuck-in acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. When you have conversations with your customers, how much do you think you're benefiting in the Express &#x2013; on the Express side, both domestic and international, from the fact that inventories are lean? So despite the slow economic growth, you continue to show volume growth, particularly thinking about the domestic side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jon, we've been pleased with what we've seen in the next-day package business this year. The business growth has been strong, mid to upper single digits, which is better than we thought. I think certainly some of that's driven by the lean inventories. And I still think, even though the inventories &#x2013; inventory to sales ratios were higher than they were during the recession, they're still low relative to what we've seen in the last 10 years. So I think generally there is still some room to rebuild inventories going forward. I also think that seeing the manufacturing segment starting to improve and grow over last couple of quarters helps drive that business also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Then can you just look ahead to 2011 and talk about the cost buckets that may serve as headwinds for you? You mentioned one, the 401(k). But any &#x2013; any other cost headwinds we should think about, and any sort of dollar amount on the 401(k) would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think as we look at 2011, and clearly we'll talk much more extensively about that on the next call, we've got both some great tailwinds that are going to provide benefits and we've got some headwinds. Let me start with the positives. The positives as we begin to look towards 2011 are the great balanced momentum across all our businesses. Year-to-date, we're showing 50% profit improvements across all three segments. So we like the momentum we see. We are continuing to focus on yields, and they're getting firmer and we're pleased with the environment. And the full benefit of the U.S. restructuring will kick in. So those are three of the positives.</p>
          <p>On the flip side, there are headwinds for 2011. We did re-institute the 401(k). Probably the biggest issue that we're looking at right now is the &#x2013; with the incredibly low discount rates we're seeing, really the lowest in recent history, it will create a headwind for pension expense. So that &#x2013; that number will be volatile. Clearly we won't know where it is until the end of the year. But that could provide some significant impact, at least temporarily, to the earnings statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will impact most of corporate America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah. So that's a big issue right now with historically low interest rates. And then I guess the last issue, and this is another wildcard, is where currencies are going. Clearly the U.S. dollar has been weakening lately, which won't hurt us, but depending on where the euro comes, if it begins to drop again, as it was earlier in the summer, then that could be a significant headwind.</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do we think about compensation and benefits? If I just look sequentially, third quarter over second, you're 1.5% lower in third quarter despite, I assume, a union increase in August. And your revenue is actually up sequentially. Are you at a sustainable level now at compensation and benefits? Or was there something that's going to be going up as we look out going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ed, I think we did have a real good third quarter. Clearly the increased volume growth helped substantially. You know, the volume got a bit of a boost from the way the Fourth of July fell last year was unfavorable, but in general, seeing solid growth back in the network, we have substantial operating leverage, and on a unit basis, that definitely helps us lower the cost. We're also beginning to see the emerging benefits of the restructuring. If you recall, in the second quarter, we had substantial added expenses for relocations and training. Still a little bit of that going on in the third quarter, but that's beginning to mitigate.</p>
          <p>And then I guess we've &#x2013; some of the network changes we've made, the maximization of volume flowing through Worldport, all of those things have begun help. But the growth is certainly the big one. That's also helped moderate our rate of increase in wages. So you put all of those together, and we are starting to see the synergies of both the actions we've taken and a moderate growth environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, I've got to take a moment too, just to praise our operators, because we've done a wonderful job of improving productivity over the last couple of quarters, even more so, I think, in Q3 than we saw in Q2. But the production is getting better and better both on road, in the hubs, on the theater. And a lot of that is due to the technology investments we've made. And we're still getting better and better in our routing and scheduling. So I think that productivity certainly drove an awful lot of that improvement.</p>

          <p>Hey, Ken.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kurt, can you just talk on the International a bit? I understand the seasonal, but you were talking about the weakness this quarter. We saw a 500-point basis point improvement last quarter; this quarter you noted it was 280. Before the downturn, we saw margins in that 17% to 19% range. So just, is there something else going on, on the International side? Is there pricing? Are there costs coming back online? Can you talk on the International side for a couple minutes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ken. We were pleased with our Q3 results. Clearly Q2 was an exceptional quarter for us; very strong growth out of Asia. We were over 40% growth in all of Asia last quarter. That moderated to over 30. So a little bit of tempering in the rate of growth. The currency, also, clearly if you look at what the euro has done in the last three months, was a bit of a drag. But this is &#x2013; we are within $9 million of the most profitable quarter ever for Q3 in International. So, we're still showing some substantial profit improvements. They were up 34%. We won't continue to compound at 50% growth forever in our profits.</p>
          <p>But, no, we feel pretty good. We think the yields are stable. As we said, currency was a little bit of a headwind, and Q3 is always a little dicey. But we do see &#x2013; we're looking for margin approaching 18% in the fourth quarter. We did warn you last quarter that comps get a little tougher, especially into Q4, because of some of the disruption that happened in November and December last year with international supply chains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're always, Ken, going to have the weaker margins in Q3 with so much of our business in Europe, and Europe, as you know, pretty well shuts down the month of August. So we're pleased. We're kind of right on target where we thought we'd be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ken, maybe just one other point, I guess. We've talked a little bit about this alignment of our Forwarding and Supply Chain in International. And what you saw this quarter was the Forwarding group excelling in an environment of softening rates and perhaps a little less profit to the airline, which shows up in our Package for cargo carry. So there is that give and take. As market rates go up and down, in one quarter the International Package will benefit. Perhaps in the next quarter as rates moderate, we capture that on the Forwarding side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for that. Lastly, a follow-up on yields overall. Your ground yield is up over 3%. I know pricing was a big focus for you. How far along in this process do you think you are in terms of at least that first go-around on touching those contracts where you kind of said to your sales force, price now matters, including revenue and volume? So let's go readdress some of the contracts we had looked at during the downturn. How far along in that process do you think we are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're in the middle innings. I mean clearly we talked about this as a priority, but it also takes time to work through. Every customer is different. But no, we feel very good about it. It's been a priority. Clearly Scott has reinforced that through the sales force and our operating units. We are pleased to see our ability to execute it and also customers' understanding that there is a need for improved rates after the last couple of years we've had.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; let's see &#x2013; the pricing, Ken asked you a little bit about the pricing. I wonder if you could get maybe a little bit more granular in terms of, I don't know if you want to talk in sequential what your pricing might have been, in ground, domestic ground and air, third quarter versus second. Obviously there are a lot of moving pieces in the yield numbers, in fuel and mix and weight and so forth. But I don't know if you want to talk sequentially or year-over-year, but can you give us some numbers behind the base pricing in ground and air?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in absolute terms, we are seeing good, solid growth in base pricing for both ground and air. Air has actually improved more substantially since that was lapped just a couple of quarters ago. Fuel surcharge was less of an impact this quarter, whereas in Q2, it was significant for the year anyway. So there's been a significant reduction, at least in the year-over-year change for fuel surcharge. So we see this really as a gradual story, Tom, that we are seeing, not dramatic changes quarter-over-quarter, but continuous changes in base rates. And it's great to see the air business a little firmer. And at the same time, we are seeing sustainable increases in the ground.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's see, when you look to the 2011, you mentioned a couple different items that were maybe the bigger items on the cost side, you know, pension and then 401(k). What about, I guess, inflation in the wage side and then the incentive comp? Are you close to 100% payout on the incentive comps this year, so there's not much of a further step-up? Or is that an issue that's material to consider on incentive payout in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would say, Tom, that that's one of the things that's impressive about this profit growth we've shown this year, is we have accrued certainly normal incentive pay. So you wouldn't expect a big change in incentive pay in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, we'll be announcing that internally today. But we're back to a normal burn rate. I think wages will increase, but if we get moderate growth, then the impact of a mix of employees, new employees, actually helps to mitigate those increases. So we feel pretty good that actually wages will be a tailwind for us next year, unless growth really grinds to a halt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're still in, to Ed's question earlier, running about a 3.6% average wage rate increase in the third quarter and still show, due to the productivity, that comp and benefit's up only 1%. So we're doing a good job. If we get growth, as Kurt referred to, we certainly will bring that average wage rate yield down.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask you about one of your competitors talking about adjusting their dimensional weight pricing. Are you making any similar changes? And what could be the impact for that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not announced any changes for pricing yet. Clearly we're evaluating the whole range of our rate strategies going into next year. It's likely we'll announce that either in late October or early November. Cubic space does drive capacity substantially in our aircraft. The vast majority of lanes are cubic limited, rather than weight limited. On the ground it's a little less of an issue. But we're looking at a wide array of cost drivers and trying to decide what's appropriate for rate changes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Just as a follow-up, in the past, you've helped us think through things in terms of in domestic pricing, about talking retention bids versus new business conversion bids. Have you been seeing less retention bids in Domestic Package? Or just what have the trends been there, and how should we think about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there. Just a couple of detailed questions. First, just in terms of the trend on the Domestic side, B2C, can you just kind of go through with us kind of quickly the growth rates there versus B2B?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are seeing B2C continue to outperform the B2B. Both were positive in the quarter. But the consumer is continuing to take advantage of remote distance-based purchasing. The Internet component of a lot of retailers continues to show good growth, whereas the bricks-and-mortars is a little more stagnant. But this is also in some ways also a B2B-led recovery. And so we are seeing good activity in some of the industrial sectors, the technology sector has been particularly strong. So on the commercial side, that's moving well. And the real validation of that is the strong growth in our Next Day Package, which is very strongly B2B-elated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, the growth rates in B2B were faster in the first half, right than B2C?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but they converged basically. They were very close. Now that's spread...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't release exact details on it. It's part of a comprehensive solution. But the Basic is the most attractive in the lightweight residential shipments, and that's where we inject into the Post Office. So that is an area of strong growth, but typically it's related with a much broader contract with the customer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I heard what you said about International profitability and how satisfied you are with it. But it's down from the first quarter. Exchange may have an impact on costs as well. So I'm just trying to figure out first of all in the International, what's going on. If it continues to be flat, pretty soon you're not going to be satisfied with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I wouldn't worry about that. I mean, Q3 for us, anyway, with the strong concentration in Europe, has always been the weakest quarter. You know, there's a lot of businesses that go on holiday for &#x2013; for several weeks in August. So that's a very typical historical trend. I mean, our profits were up 30% year-over-year, I think that's more the indication. Clearly, the currency is a bit of a headwind right now, especially with the euro plummeting and then gradually coming back, it has been a little disruptive. But, no, we don't see things stagnating by any means in the International arena.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>An example, David, of the currency, though. Currency in Europe &#x2013; all of the revenue would be in euros. A big piece of the costs are airplane-related &#x2013; land haul-related, which are in dollars, so it's a contribution between, you know, euro-denominated revenue and euro-denominated costs. There's a big gap there. So it does have more of an impact, plus we're very profitable in International.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question in International, how do you feel about the fourth quarter in Forwarding? Do you see a tonnage peak versus the third quarter? How does the usual seasonal peak look at this point? You're almost through October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Q3 was primarily an ocean peak issue. And we did see a decent ocean peak, although frankly it didn't last quite as long as normal. So that wrapped up a little earlier in the summer than is typical. We do expect to see a seasonal peak for the air freight, certainly, although we don't think it will reach some of the frenzy that it did in Q4 of last year, where there were pallets of freight left on the runways in some cases, because of increased demand and reduced capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What could change that, obviously, is consumer demand. If consumer demand is a little stronger than the customers are thinking right now, then that could obviously drive air freight.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. Just to follow up on international pricing. I just noticed your domestic yields were pretty weak again as at Q2. So my guess there that it doesn't look seasonality-related. Is there still a dilution impact from the Turkey acquisition? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, yeah. Turkey is still a piece of that. We did have &#x2013; the July was before the Turkey overlap. So that was a significant piece. Yields are basically stable in the domestic. We have been growing substantially, profits are good. So the market we think is stable domestic, although it's hard to draw any broad-based, because it's a wide array of countries. But we are seeing, Robin, substantial, almost surprising continued growth in Europe, both on the domestic and the export side. Canada and Mexico, both of our domestic operations there continue to show good results. So customer-by-customer, there are some challenging pricing environments. But we feel pretty good that the market is stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and just a follow-up. The weakness in your international export yield this quarter, is that just all about seasonality? Or is there something else going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if you adjust out currency, actually, export yields are up 3%. There is some seasonal cyclicality. But if you look year-over-year, we're up 3%. So I think things once again are pretty stable on the pricing across the globe. UPS' value proposition continues to get stronger with our balanced capabilities across the globe. We can really bring things to customers that others can't, and that allows us to have some pricing power.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We saw a little stronger mix of strategic accounts in the quarter, where some of the bigger multi-nationals probably shipped a higher proportion and that drives obviously a little bit of impact on yield.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions on the cost side, if I look at depreciation expense, whether I'm looking at it on a percent of revenue basis or a per package basis, or other expense on the same basis, those came a little lower than expected. I think the other expense was down almost 170 million sequentially.</p>
          <p>The questions are, are there gains on sale offsetting the depreciation, or is that more of a sustainable run rate? And on the other expense, I know you mentioned the restructuring, but how much of this is going to be a permanent change and this is the run rate of that expense level?  Or should I think of it something maybe closer to 900, 950 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeff, the schedule that we have on other expense, the other other, that shows the 170 million decline, is directly impacted by the gain o sale of real estate that we had. That was 109 million, before tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I net that out, it's more like 60 million, 70 million. Are there increased gains on sales? Because I know that the PP&amp;E sales are up this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was the most notable. We have retired quite a few vehicles, which has impacted the balance sheet a little bit. So we are in the process of taking part of our CapEx to take older vehicles out of the fleet. But in general, no. The only major blip in that segment was the sale of the real estate. But some of the benefits &#x2013; some of the cost tightening that we've done, bad debt is down substantially, that shows up there. Supply reduction, some those kinds of things. Depreciation has been at a pretty stable rate, I think. If you go back and you look at the last few quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to continue a little bit on your commentary on the Q4 air freight peak and get a sense of what you guys are seeing right now. How does the capacity situation in terms of lift out of Asia stack up versus last year? And then in the event that we did get a boost in consumer demand, I guess, is there a &#x2013; is there enough capacity right now to move that demand? Or do you think we'd find ourselves in a similar situation to last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say generally, Justin, there is more capacity than there was a year ago. I wouldn't say a lot more capacity. But there's more capacity. For example, UPS, we've added several flights, a couple of flights per day from China to the U.S. and to Europe. So we've done that, some of our competitors have done that. But I still think it's- there's not certainly excess capacity by any means, and if there is more consumer demand, we'll still see, could be a spike in &#x2013; later in the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think back to Scott's comments on inventory, I think one of the recurring themes we've seen is that at least at the retail side, inventories remain pretty tight. Customers decided not to move everything via ocean early. There were some that did. But I think there is real, there is some potential leverage there if this holiday season comes in a little better, it could end up being a pretty good blooming time for the growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in a related question, you know, given the logistics that it would take to move things in an expedited fashion, if that were to occur, do you have customers that are talking to you about how their CapEx plans or their ordering trends might change if midterm elections go the way that people are expecting them to go? Do you have any insight into the thought process of the corporates you do business with post that time period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think clearly businesses are watching the elections, they're concerned about tax strat policies and some of those things. As to whether it would have a rapid impact on capital plans or inventory levels, probably not. I think that will be more consumer demand driven.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Great quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Nate. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask kind of a similar question, but a little bit bigger picture regarding Asia. Obviously the other day there was a lot of talk regarding currency, interest rates, et cetera, and what that does in terms of growth out of that region. It still seems to me that there's &#x2013; regardless of what happens, there's going to be a lot of activity. But I was wondering kind of what you're seeing bigger picture from your perspective. And I know you're making some additional investments over there. And if you could talk a little more in detail with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see a lot of the trends we've seen in the last several years continuing. I think that although when you get towards midterm elections in the U.S., you hear a lot of talks of protectionism. I think the administration supports trade. And I think that when we get Congress back together, we'll support trade and we'll solve the issues with China. So I'm very bullish on the outlook for Asia moving forward. I think, you know, there will be blips along the way where people will talk of trade wars. But I don't see it happening. I look at, again at the U.S. &#x2013; the U.S. businesses, 96% of their consumers are outside of the United States. We need to promote trade going forward. So I &#x2013; I see &#x2013; there'll be ups and downs. There will be times when China will be challenged. But I think, in general, we see strong growth across Asia moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And clearly our strategies are to capitalize on that. We continue to expand our infrastructure, increase our capabilities in Supply Chain and Freight and look for growth opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The unknown is how fast the consumer base will grow and, in places like China and India. We know they're going to grow, but will it grow over the next five years, next 10 years, next 20 years. We'll see. But clearly there will be more consumption done in that part of the world moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But kind of just to follow up on that, how do you think about your strategy then in terms of that unknown consumer demand in that region, and as manufacturing moves from the coast to inland? How do you think strategically about your rate of investment to kind of tackle that movement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going to be aggressive there. Again, we've got a wonderful balance sheet. And we look for those opportunities to invest. And most of our business is portable anyway. And a lot of it is airplanes, and you move where the business is. So I think that that, as more and more moves to western China, we'll be there right with the customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as a good example, we're the only major competitor in our segment that has two air hubs in China. So we're very well-positioned with Shanghai and the Shenzhen hubs to distribute goods around China. We're continuing to expand our alliances and do deeper investments. We're in the process of opening a healthcare distribution facility in Singapore. So clearly we are focused on that. We'll do it in typical UPS fashion, which is with a mind towards both growth and return on capital. But it is a high priority for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Matt Brooklier of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question, pilot furloughs, where are you in that process? What was the impact on third quarter? And how should we think about cost impact from pilot furloughs into fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, where we're at right now, Matt, is we're at about 109 pilots furloughed. Right now, the announced goal is 230. But we've actually taken &#x2013; we call it time-out, a break in this. One, we want to see how &#x2013; business, as it's improving, the International business has been getting better. There's also some proposed rulemaking out there regarding pilot rest hours, pilot fatigue that we really want to understand the impact of that. It's not going to take place immediately, but we want to work with the industry and with our pilots and with the government to figure out what will those rules be, and will that change staffing requirements? So it really made an awful lot of sense at this point in time just to halt, put a stop to the furlough until we understand the implications of the rulemaking. And then probably by the first of the year, early into 2011, we'll have a better view of where we go from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, domestic ground packages, you guys saw a nice up-tick in terms of the volume growth rate. Wanted to know if there's anything strategically that you're doing different in terms of driving volume growth in that business. I also noticed that sequentially your yields were down modestly in that product. I don't know if I'm reading too deeply into that data point, but could you talk a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're continuing to work as hard as we can to add value to customers. Clearly we have a big focus on &#x2013; with the deployment of our field marketing groups to understanding unique industries and unique customer needs, and bringing them more comprehensive logistics solutions. So we think that is a great catalyst for growth.</p>
          <p>On the yield side, really the core base rate trends actually are stronger, the fuel surcharges accounts really for the totality of any revenue per piece differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a question from Art Hatfield of Morgan, Keegan &amp; Co. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just a quick question. I don't recall hearing you mention what CapEx was in the quarter. If you did, I apologize. And secondly, can you say anything about how we should think about that over the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, basically CapEx year-to-date is a little over $1 billion. We've got it for the year to be at about 1.8 billion. We're probably going to come in at a little below that. But we're continuing to invest wherever it makes sense. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our cash position continues to be strong. We're generating a substantial amount of free cash flow. It's one of the reasons we decided to extend our share repurchases. With the S&amp;P changing their outlook to stable, we're very comfortable continuing to use our cash to repurchase shares along with investing in the business. So from a cash perspective, all systems are go. We are going to continue to buy aircraft and do targeted investments in those areas we need added capacity.</p>
          <p>But we do expect CapEx to remain below its historical normals, based on the fact that we've really got a modern new air fleet. We've retired all of our older generation aircraft. We've got a Worldport hub that's complete, we've got major hubs in China, we've got good capacity in Europe. So we're in a great position to look for new growth opportunities and invest in those when they come around.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from David Ross of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question on export growth for small to medium-sized businesses. You said you're working with those customers to try to stimulate more exports from them. Wondering what kind of segments that would benefit most at UPS? Would that be their International Freight Forwarding segment? Your International Package segment? Your Domestic Package segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say all of the above. But I think clearly the International Package side would be the biggest beneficiary right now. And we're making good progress. We've identified 9,000 customers who ship to just one &#x2013; export to one country. We're trying to get those 9,000 customers to go to at least a second country. And we're making some good progress. We did show double digit U.S. export growth again in the last quarter. Trends remain strong there. It's helping to educate small and medium-sized enterprises of the value and the ease. And it's a lot about logistics campaigns, just trying to educate the SMEs on &#x2013; they can use UPS as a partner to handle some of the business differences, cultural differences, custom regulation differences of other countries. It seems to be working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then at UPS Freight, you mentioned you were still unhappy with the margins there. To get them to where you want them, is it a function of you need more volume, because you have excess capacity in the network? Is it just yield, do you need price, or is it improving the overall operation and productivity still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The majority of it is the environment. LTL is still a very tough place to be. The price environment is beginning to firm, but there were a couple of years there where it was extremely challenging. We tried to stick to the high road, because we're making deep investments in technology and in the network enhancements. So, we've been focused on pricing and targeting those markets that make sense to us. So I'd say the vast majority of the freight headwinds are market-related. We do continue to see great results, though, in bringing technology and ease of use to the middle market for the LTL segment. We think that really &#x2013; this industry has been under-invested in.</p>
          <p>We know that one of our big competitors is getting ready to go through some restructuring and realignment. We've already heard from some customers that are concerned about that. So we're going to stay focused. Our operations are working well. We've got an integrated regional and long distance network national. So we've already done the hard work of providing a single carrier that can cover any geography across the continent. So we feel pretty good where we are. It'd be nice if the overall segment was in better shape. That does, though, give us a great tailwind over the next couple years for Supply Chain and Freight. When the Freight segment really begins contributing, we've got even better results ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our last question will come from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to come back to the comment about the other expense. You said maybe some lower bad debt in there. Even after you strip out the real estate gain though, it does look like it's running at a lower rate than normal, especially as a percent of revenue. Is that something you expect to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in a modest sense, the year-over-year comparisons, you know, we did &#x2013; there's some slight expenses last year that were one time, but it's 20, 30 million. No. It's just a comprehensive reduction of expenses. Our claims expenses are down as our quality continues to improve. Negotiation through our procurement on supplies, telecom expenses, you name it, we've been, it's just, some of that's just the fruit of a lot of hard work. Certainly the one-time event of the sale of the real estate did give us a big boost. But it's an area we're going to continue to focus on. It does fluctuate a little bit, but there's nothing outsized as far as anything that distorted it other than what we've talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe one bigger-picture question. We've heard from a number of the trucking companies that the freight market broadly seemed to slow down toward the end of the third quarter and has slowed still into October. Have you sensed that in any of your businesses either domestically or internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've seen any change at all from what we saw in the third quarter. I think October is moving along at a steady pace. Again, we're in a moderate economy. We're in a probably 2, 2.5% type of economy, and I haven't detected any change over the last several months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the most notable thing just looking at our reported results is you do have some gains with the calendar. That third quarter did get a benefit from the overlap against the Fourth of July last year, and our fourth quarter volume that we will report will on an average daily basis be muted by the fact that we have one extra day between Christmas and New Year's without much added volume. So if you take those two out, then I think you've got a pretty core stable trend, and that's what we're seeing in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for some closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy. Thanks, for everybody, too, attending the conference today. I'm really pleased that we showed superior results across all segments, and we did this in a modest economy. Year-to-date operating profit in both International Package and Supply Chain and Freight were the best ever. And that says an awful lot in an economy that really is not recovering at a fast pace. And despite some of the questions on International, we've had the best nine months we've ever had in International. I'm extremely bullish going forward in that segment.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. Domestic operating profit was up 50%, 77% for the quarter, so extremely strong growth in that area. As Kurt mentioned, we generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow for the first nine months, extremely strong. We raised our full-year guidance to more than 50% growth over last year. So we're expecting a good strong fourth quarter. And I'm extremely confident we're on our way back to the high levels of profitability that we've demonstrated in the past. So we have a lot of confidence we're going in the right direction. Thanks so much for attending today.</p>
