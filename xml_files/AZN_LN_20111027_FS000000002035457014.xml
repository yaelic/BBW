        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Karl, and good afternoon to everyone. AstraZeneca delivered a third quarter revenue and core earnings performance that was in line with our expectations, against the backdrop of generic competition and government interventions in price. We continued to invest where we see opportunities to create value both in research and development and in sales and marketing, but we are also actively reshaping the cost base to improve competitiveness for the long term.</p>
          <p>This balanced approach continues to drive strong operating cash flow and has supported increased cash returns to shareholders with dividends and share repurchases up substantially over last year. On today's call I'll focus on five topics with an emphasis on the quarter rather than to the year-to-date. The first, I'll summarize the headline numbers, then I'll cover the revenue performance by brand and by region. Third, I will turn to the core operating performance with an emphasis on the key drivers of operating profit and margin, I'll briefly touch on cash performance and finally I'll close with our thoughts on guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>So on to the headlines. Total company revenue was $8.2 billion in the quarter with 2% decline in constant currency terms. Crestor, Seroquel XR, and Symbicort all posted good sales growth in the quarter. As anticipated, we continued to face revenue headwinds from government interventions on price and from generic competition. We lost more than $350 million in revenue in the quarter from generic competition. Chiefly Arimidex and Merrem globally and some Nexium in Europe. But that is a bit better than the run rate for the first-half because we are now more than 12 months past the onset of generic Arimidex in the U.S.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss the regional and brand revenue performances shortly, but let's continue with the headline numbers. Core operating profit in the quarter was down 2% in constant currency to $3.2 billion in line with the decline in revenue. Core earnings per share in the quarter were $1.71 compared with $1.50 last year. That is a 12% increase in constant currency terms with the leverage between core operating profit and core earnings resulting from a lower tax rate, lower number shared outstanding as a consequence of the repurchase program and lower net finance expense. The 140% increase in reported earnings per share reflect of course the gain on the sale of Astra Tech that was completed in August. This amounted to a $1.08 per share and was excluded from core earnings.</p>
          <p>You'll note that the profit on the Astra Tech sale was a non-taxable event and this is reflected in the delta between reported and core tax rates. Legal provisions were also higher in the third quarter last year which also benefits the growth rate in reported EPS this quarter.</p>
          <p>So, those are the headlines for the third quarter. I am not going to dwell on the nine months figures, they're in the press release but in brief, revenue was down 3% at constant currency, core operating profit was down 6%, core EPS was up 6% for the year-to-date.</p>
          <p>So, returning to the third quarter revenue performance, and when I referred to growth rates that will be on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the U.S. was unchanged compared with the third quarter last year, and that is after absorbing 3.5% of negative impact from U.S. healthcare reform. Revenue in Western Europe was down 15% in the quarter and that is an acceleration from the first half run rate but it is largely due to further volume penetration from generics, particularly for Nexium.</p>
          <p>Realized price declines remain the mid-single digit level that we saw in the first half. Cost downward pressures on price will likely continue as the economies continue to struggle. Revenue in the established rest of world was up 7% on a good performance in Japan, where launch stocking for Nexium and continued strong growth for Crestor and Symbicort led to a 10% increase in revenue. Revenue in emerging markets grew by 7% in the quarter, that is down from the 10% growth rate in the second quarter there has been some slow down across the markets. <mark type="ph" /> Funda markets. (6:36) The fundamental drivers of industry growth in these markets will be in place for many years to come. But they're not immune from the near-term impact of current economic conditions across the globe.</p>
          <p>In addition if you have a couple of company-specific factors at play in our third quarter results. In Brazil we've lost exclusivity for Crestor and Seroquel IR and so our business in Brazil is down 17% in the quarter. We've also seen a delay in some government tender orders in the Middle East, but that is a timing difference more than anything else and that volume should come through in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenue in China was up 13% in the quarter. We've seen the growth in the overall market slow somewhat and our portfolio has also seen an impact from lower prices and some delays in the rate at which the RDL approvals that we've achieved on a national level are being implemented in the regional listings. Turning now to revenue at the brand level I'll begin with Crestor. Worldwide sales of Crestor increased by 14% to $1.7 billion. In the U.S. sales were up 20% to $753 million. Total prescription were up 3% compared with 0.5% for the total statin market in the U.S. Crestor's market share of total prescriptions was up some 40 basis points since May just ahead of the FDA safety advisory for simvastatin was issued in early June.</p>
          <p>Our dynamic share is around 15%. That's a blend of a 12% share of new statin starts and a 20% share of the switch market. Crestor sales in the rest of world were up 9% to $906 million. That represents 55% of total Crestor revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we now have generics in Brazil and that impacted Crestor's growth in emerging markets where sales are up 7% overall. There is double-digit growth in Japan, Canada and Australia which are the established rest of world region. Sales in Western Europe were up 2% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>With generic Lipitor just around the corner, we're often asked how we expect Crestor to perform particularly in the U.S. Well, I'm not about to break precedent and start giving product specific forecast, but let me describe how we think the overall market will evolve. Now first on pricing. In a highly competitive statin market where generics already account for nearly 65% of total prescriptions, we've been able to consistently achieve good increases and realize selling pricing in the U.S. reflecting our strong value proposition. However, with the availability of low-priced generic atorvastatin, our ability to continue to sustain increases in net prices will come under pressure.</p>
          <p>Second, segmenting the market by source of business, currently 94% of Crestor usage is the patients on continued therapy. Despite the availability of many low cost options, these patients are on Crestor because their physicians felt it was the right treatment choice. In many cases because they failed to achieve goal on other regimens; and we do not believe that there will be significant switching just because another low cost generic is available. I think the market share pressure will be on the 6% of the volume which is dynamic, around 4% from new starts and around 2% from patient switches from other therapies. Our managed care plans designs already strongly encourage the use of generics by either differentiated co-pays or step therapy requirements for newly diagnosed patients and a lower priced atorvastatin maybe more competitive in this segment.</p>
          <p>To the degree to which Lipitor has been a source of net switching to Crestor, that is we gained more from Lipitor than they gained from us, there may be a recalibration of that net dynamic on economic grounds. We continue to believe that Crestor will still maintain a strong position in the switch segment as many patients who try other less potent statins will continue to fail to reach treatment goal. And Crestor remains the most effective statin especially for patients at elevated CV risk.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Seroquel franchise, third quarter sales were up 4% to $1.4 billion. In the U.S., franchise sales in the third quarter also up 4% to $975 million. Focusing on Seroquel XR, total prescriptions were up 12% in the third quarter compared with last year and well ahead of the 2% growth in the atypical antipsychotic market. In the U.S., Seroquel XR accounted for 17.3% of franchise prescriptions and 19% of franchise revenue in the third quarter. Seroquel IR prescriptions were down 5%, so the total franchise was off 2% in total prescriptions in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Seroquel franchise sales in the rest of world were $425 million that is a 4% increase, fueled by a 33% increase in Seroquel XR, which now for accounts for 43% of franchise sales in these markets. Symbicort sales were up 9% <mark type="audio gap" /> (12:40) the U.S. sales in the third quarter up <mark type="audio gap" /> (12:47) total prescription <mark type="audio gap" /> (12:52 -13:42)</p>

          <p>Well, operator thank you very much. I mean, we are not absolutely clear when the line dropped. So what I propose to do is start again at the revenue performance by region. I apologize to those on the call if there is some duplication, but it's probably better to duplicate rather than miss some sections of my remarks. So if we are ready to start, I'd propose to kick off again. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much and our apologies that we seemed to have lost the line momentarily. As you probably heard me say, I'll go back and start again when I entered into the discussion of our third quarter revenue performance and apologize if there is some duplication, but hopefully this way we'll get the entirety of my remarks. So, returning to the third quarter revenue performance and I'll refer here to constant currency growth rates throughout. Revenue in the U.S. was unchanged compared with the third quarter last year and that's after absorbing 3.5% of negative impact from U.S. healthcare reform. Revenue in Western Europe was down 15% in the quarter. That's an acceleration from the first half run rate, but it's largely due to further volume penetration from generics, particularly from Nexium.</p>
          <p>Realized price declines remain at the mid-single digit level that we saw in the first half. Cost downward pressures on price will likely continue as the economies continue to struggle. Revenue in established rest of world was up 7% on a good performance in Japan, where launch stocking for Nexium and continued strong growth for Crestor and Symbicort led to a 10% increase in revenue.</p>
          <p>Revenue in emerging markets grew by 7% in the quarter. That is down from the 10% growth rate in the second quarter. There has been some slowdown across the markets. The fundamental drivers of industry growth in these markets will be in place for many years to come. But they're not immune from the near-term impact of current economic conditions across the globe.</p>
          <p>In addition we have a couple of company-specific factors at play in our third quarter results.

          <p>Revenue in China was up 13% in the quarter. We've seen the growth and the overall market slow somewhat and our portfolio has also seen an impact from lower prices and some delays in the rate at which the RDL approvals that we achieved on a national level are being implemented in the regional listings. Now turning to revenue of the brand level and starting with Crestor, worldwide sales of Crestor increased by 14% to $1.7 billion. In the U.S., sales were up 20% to $753 million, total prescriptions were up 3% compared with 0.5% of the total statin market in the U.S. Crestor's market share of total prescriptions was up some 40 basis points since May, just ahead of the FDA safety advisory for simvastatin that was issued in early June.</p>
          <p>Our dynamic share is around 15% and that's a blend of a 12% share of new statin starts and a 20% share of the switch market. Crestor's sales in the rest of world were up 9% to $906 million that represents 55% of total Crestor revenue. As I said earlier, generics in Brazil and that impacted Crestor's growth in emerging markets where sales were up 7% overall. But there was strong double-digit growth in Japan, Canada and Australia, the established rest of world region and then sales in Western Europe, they were up 2% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>With generic Lipitor just around the corner, we are often asked how we expect Crestor to perform particularly in the U.S. Not about to break precedent and start giving product specific forecasts, but let me describe how we think the market will evolve. First on pricing. In a competitive statin market where generics already account for nearly 65% of total prescriptions, we've been able to consistently achieve good increases and realize selling pricing in the U.S. reflecting our strong value proposition; however, with the availability of low priced generic atorvastatin, our ability to continue to sustain increases in net prices will come under pressure.

          <p>I think the market share pressure will be almost 6% of the volume which is dynamic, around 4% from new stocks and about 2% from patient switches from other therapies. Managed care plan designs already strongly encourage the use of generics by either differentiated co-pays or step therapy requirements for newly diagnosed patients and a lower priced atorvastatin may be more competitive in this segment. So the degree to which Lipitor has been a source of net switching to Crestor, that is we gain more from Lipitor than they gain from us, there may be a recalibration of that net dynamic on economic grounds. But we continue to believe that Crestor will still maintain a strong position in the switch segment as many patients who try other less potent statins will continue to fail to reach treatment goal. And Crestor remains the most effected statin especially for patients with elevated CV risk.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Seroquel franchise, Seroquel sales were up 4% to $1.4 billion. In the U.S., franchise sales in the third quarter were also up 4% to $975 million. Focusing on Seroquel XR, total prescriptions were up 12% in the third quarter compared to the last year and well ahead of the 2% growth in a typical anti-psychotic market. In the U.S., Seroquel XR accounted for 17.3% of franchise prescriptions and 19% of franchise revenue in the third quarter. Seroquel IR prescriptions are down 5% for the total franchise was off 2% in total prescriptions in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Seroquel franchise sales in the rest of world were $425 million at say 4% increase fueled by a 33% increase in Seroquel XR, which now accounts for 43% of franchise sales in these markets.</p>
          <p>Symbicort sales were up 9% in the quarter to $755 million. In the U.S., sales in the third quarter were up 15% to $201 million, total prescriptions were up 9%, compared with a 2.5% decline in the U.S. market for fixed combination products. Symbicort share of total prescriptions reached 19.7% in September up 2.1 percentage points over September of last year despite the launch of a new entrant. The market share of patients newly starting combination therapy is 26.6%. Symbicort sales in the rest of world was 7% ahead of last year to $545 million, sales in Western Europe were up 3%, sales in established rest of world increased by 23% reflecting continued strong growth in Japan as well as double digit growth in Canada and in Australia.</p>
          <p>Sales in emerging markets were up 9%, largely on growth in emerging European markets. Large revenues for ONGLYZA were $59 million in the third quarter, of which $44 million was in the U.S. Total prescriptions for DPP-4 products in the U.S. market are up 22% in the quarter. Our franchise which includes ONGLYZA and KOMBIGLYZE XR has increased its market share of total DPP-4 prescriptions in the U.S. to 15.5% in September, including 3.7% share for KOMBIGLYZE XR since its launch at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Share of new starts for the franchise remains well above this, at around 25%. We announced last month that we have received a positive opinion from the EU CHMP for KOMBIGLYZE. Which is the twice daily fixed combination of ONGLYZA and metformin, that we look forward to finally participating in the combination market sometime next year as we get final approvals and reimbursements in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Turning to Brilinta. Sales were $13 million in the quarter, of which $11 was launched stocking in the U.S. As we said all along, ex factory sales and retail prescriptions are a lagging not a leading indicator of launch progress. Our launch plan follows a deliberate sequence of steps. Achieve regulatory approval, then negotiating and achieving reimbursement, this is then followed by achieving hospital-by-hospital access through product stocking, formulary approvals, and adoption on treatment protocols. And only then do we get the opportunity to drive trial and usage at the prescriber level as new cases of ACS present to the hospital. During the quarter we had some important achievement on the reimbursement front, including a very positive reimbursement recommendation by NICE in the U.K. which became final just yesterday. We also have received a positive decision on reimbursement in Australia.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month Brilique received a positive initial assessment in Germany, which concluded that Brilique offers an important additional benefit in relation to the comparator clopidogrel in NSTEMI and unstable angina that represents about 72% of ACS population in Germany.</p>
          <p>In France, however we're working up our response to receiving the French Transparency Commission preliminary ASMR assessment rating of 5. The designation of no medical improvement demonstrated compared with existing patient management options. We believe this preliminary assessment does not reflect the cardiovascular mortality benefit that was demonstrated in the PLATO trial and has been acknowledged in the German and new U.K. assessments.</p>
          <p>We're also very pleased with the inclusion of Brilique on the recently revised treatment guidelines on NSTEMI and &#x2013; and unstable angina patients issued by the European Society of Cardiology, where Brilique has been placed in a first line position ahead of the clopidogrel.</p>
          <p>In terms of end market performance it's very early days in many markets but we're making good progress. For example in Germany we're making steady progress at hospitals stocking and protocol option. Brilique now stocked in around 80% of our target hospitals and has been adopted on protocols in roughly a third.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. since lunch in mid-August we're also making steady progress with formulary access at our top 400 hospitals at around 20% so far.</p>
          <p>Turn to manage care reimbursement. We have unrestricted access to around 60% of covered lives, including nearly 75% in commercial plans. The Medicare part D process, of course, takes some more time to work through. So, lots of work ahead of us, but good and steady progress, on the execution of our launch rollout for Brilinta. A brief word on a couple of the mature brands in the portfolio. Worldwide Nexium sales were just over $1 billion in the quarter, down 16% with generics in Western Europe increasingly taking a toll and sales down 50% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales of Arimidex were down 44% to $176 million in the quarter. Sales have largely disappeared in the U.S. market as generics now account for 96% of prescriptions since they were launched more than 12 months ago. Sales in the rest of world were down 37% to $168 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the third quarter P&amp;L and I'll focus here on core margins and profit. The press release does of course contain the strategy numbers and the detailed reconciliation to the core measures. Now in sales, when I refer to growth rates they will be on a constant currency basis. Core gross margin in the quarter was 80.4% of sales, that is up 1.2 percentage points compared with the third quarter last year which was impacted by the intangible impairment of lesogaberan.</p>
          <p>For the full-year 2010, core gross margin was 81.2% of sales and for the full-year 2011 I still expect core gross margin will be somewhat higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expense was down 2% compared with the third quarter last year. We continue to invest to grow our emerging markets business as well as the new product launches. We also have the excise tax from U.S. healthcare reform in core SG&amp;A; however, we continue to mitigate these increase through operational efficiencies across our established markets. I also said last quarter that you'd see a different pattern of phasing of SG&amp;A compared to recent years, and that is coming through in the decline in SG&amp;A in the quarter compared to the 5% increase in the first half.</p>
          <p>For the full year of 2011, I expect core SG&amp;A to be broadly flat in constant currency terms. Core other income was 5% lower than the third quarter last year. This reflects generic competition for Entocort and the subsequent termination of the marketing and distribution arrangement with Prometheus. I still expect core other income to be around $700 million for the full year. That leads to a core pre-R&amp;D operating margin of 52.7% of revenue and that's up 120 basis points in the quartet chiefly on the gross margin improvement that I mentioned earlier. Core R&amp;D investment in the quarter was $1.15 billion, 10% increase on increased spending on late-stage clinical trials and investment in biologics, partially mitigated by the benefit from restructuring initiatives. Intangible impairments were also a bit high compared with last year. This leads to a core operating profit of just under $3.2 billion in the quarter, 2% lower than last year in line with the decline in revenues. Core operating margin was 38.7% of revenue, down 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning to our productivity program, we've taken restructuring charges of $221 million in the third quarter. Now we estimated that total cost for this phase of restructuring would be $2 billion. The charge as you recall $1.2 billion in 2010 and expect most of the remainder to be incurred this year. So the fourth quarter restructuring charge will be even higher than the third quarter run rate.</p>
          <p>And now turning to cash flow. Net cash from operating activities for the nine months was around $2.4 billion lower than last year, largely driven by higher tax payments including those related to the tax settlements announced earlier and an increase in working capital. Net cash distributions to shareholders for the nine months increase by 64% of over $7.6 billion through dividend payments of $3.76 billion and net share repurchases of nearly $3.9 billion and that's against the initial target of $4 billion in net repurchases for the full year.</p>
          <p>When we announced the sale of Astra Tech, we said we would deploy those proceeds in share repurchases and with the sale completed in August, we are well placed to achieve the revised $5 billion target for the full year with repurchases funded by any remaining balance of the Astra Tech proceeds to be completed in 2012.</p>
          <p>So, finally turning to guidance. We knew that market conditions would be difficult this year with Government interventions on price, healthcare reform in the U.S. and generic competition on some important products. So in that context, I think we've done well in executing on our plans. We continue to drive the performance of brands where we maintain exclusivity, we're investing to drive growth in emerging markets and behind new product launches, and we're creating the headroom for that investment with the relentless focus on productivity and on efficiency. Based on the performance to date and the outlook for the rest of the year revenue for the full year still looks to be in line with our original assumptions a flat-to-low single digit decline on a constant currency basis. I'm also pleased that we're in a position to increase our target for our core EPS for the full year by $0.05, which is largely due to favorable movement in actual exchange rates compared to the January 2011 rates upon which our guidance based. That benefited, that benefit amounted to $0.03 in the third quarter and I'm comfortable rounding that up to $0.05 given our solid underlying business performance. We've also narrowed the range. So the new target for Core EPS for the full year is in the range of $7.20 and $7.40 per share. I'd add the usual health warning that this guidance takes no account of the likelihood that average exchange rates for the remainder of the year may differ materially from the January 2011 average.

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Three brief ones if I may Simon, firstly in terms of Brilinta your pricing discussions in Germany and I guess <mark type="ph" /> not much (35:32) in France. What sort of timing should we expect for those to be concluded, hopefully successfully? Secondly, on MEDI-528, is that impairment the entire impairment we're likely to see? And thirdly you mentioned Seroquel IR in Brazil facing a significant generic competition, is XR available in Brazil? And if so, how did that hold up in the face of IR competition? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks Michael for those questions, so Karl, can I ask you to pick up the Brilinta timing one? In terms of the 528, that is the, that we have now impaired the total net book value associated with that asset. In terms of availability of Seroquel IR, XR in Brazil just checking that. My recollection it's not yet available, but we'll confirm that on the call. Do you just pick up on Brilinta and the sort of timing, Karl?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello Michael, in terms of Brilinta in Germany, I mean as you might know Brilinta is actually the first product going through the new system, but we now have the reimbursement assessment from the IQWiG and we're then going forward and discussing with the insurance companies in Germany. We expect that to begin during the fourth quarter this year and beginning of next year, so that will still take some time. I mean the same thing in France. We have the initial assessment from the transparency commission, but we still aim to go back and give our view of the benefit Brilinta brings and after that we will start pricing negotiations and that will also take some time. And most likely go into the beginning of next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On Crestor at this point in the year, you should have a pretty good idea of how Crestor will be shaping up in terms of formulary placement after 2012 in the U.S. Are you seeing any slippage there as you go into 2012? Also you mentioned future price slippage on Crestor in the U.S., do you expect that net pricing will actually move into negative year-on-year territory? Also is the same pricing dynamic going to happen outside the U.S. where Lipitor is also starting to go generic? Then on emerging markets and generic erosion, is it really only Brazil where a loss of exclusivity leads to substantial erosion? Or are you starting to see that in other countries as well? I look at a product like Arimidex for example, it's been in negative year-on-year growth territory in emerging markets for quite a few quarters, including this quarter and I want to recall my question of the durability of sales of off-patent medicines in these regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Tim (38:50), okay, thanks very much, very very good questions. Let me deal with the first one. In terms of Crestor, we have not seen slippage and change in our formulary placement for Crestor &#x2013; we continue to hold a strong formulary positions in that marketplace and I think it reflects the strength of Crestor as the most potent statin, particularly for patients with elevated <mark type="ph" /> CV (39:16) risk and that's recognized by our customers. In terms of Crestor pricing, what I said in my remarks so as to be absolute clear is that we've been consistently achieving good increases in net pricing over the recent past, but we recognize that with low price generic atorvastatin our ability to continue to sustain price increases will come under pressure. I'm not going to call overall sort of nature and direction of price increase at this stage.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question about the loss of exclusivity and the resulting impact on our brands in emerging markets, as you know, <mark type="ph" /> Tim (40:03), we put this into emerging markets, but you have huge differences in these markets, the &#x2013; nature of healthcare, the nature of the reimbursement system from out-of-pocket through to single-government payer varies very broad spread at different price points.</p>
          <p>If you take the case in Brazil, we had loss of exclusivity where we essentially have had generics coming in at a substantially lower price than Crestor, we have seen in a strong out-of-pocket market some movement to those but it's been a significant price difference that's required that. We don't see that same opportunity in all markets. And you see a different competitive dynamic in different markets.</p>
          <p>Similarly, there if you look in some of our Eastern European markets, where we had generic rosuvastatin, for example for some time, we have seen that loss of exclusivity drive reductions in revenue in those markets often driven by public payers. Equally, we've got some other markets where we faced loss of exclusivity and seen continued growth of our brand on the back of the value associated with our brands in those markets. It's a very varied picture and what we will try to do <mark type="ph" /> Tim (41:18) as we go forward is obviously where there are different dynamics call those out for you as we have done this quarter with Brazil. So, I think the &#x2013; probably it was one other question on &#x2013; question you made on emerging markets, remind me, Karl?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just following up on Crestor, you cited the 94% figure of being repeat users, and expectations of low amounts of switching to other statins, if that's the case, can you comment on expectations for Crestor volume losses, not on switching but from yearly attrition related to lack of compliance? And then on the overall statins' market, can you give a comment directionally on whether there will be statins' market volume expansion if and when ATP-4 guidelines finally do emerge? That's it.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I don't have a precise figure in hand Gbola, but obviously any chronic care therapy, you do see that kind of natural attrition from compliance loss but quite frankly don't have it in hand, but that's a dynamic you would see with any chronic medication and Crestor is no different than that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I had to jump on from another call so apologies, and apologies if I'm repeating an earlier question. But, the two I have relate to &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> firstly, refresh us on what's next (44:06) around the corner, could you just remind us your latest <mark type="ph" /> notes (44:10) update, thinking in terms of Crestor through 2012 in the U.S. and also an update on the formulary positioning of Crestor <mark type="ph" /> via (44:19) Medicaid, Medicare or commercial programs. And then secondly just on emerging markets, obviously you've explained, you talked about Brazil, Crestor and you've talked about the <mark type="ph" /> timely shipments across Mina (44:28) impacting the growth rate for emerging markets. I mean are we &#x2013; how should we <mark type="ph" /> quantify (44:35) that impact and should we expect emerging market growth to trend back to double digit through Q4 or are there other issues and pricing situations in some countries that will <mark type="ph" /> limit that (44:46) to shorter term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Peter, while &#x2013; we did indeed address your first questions relating to Crestor, the answer to an earlier question I explained that we have not seen changes in the formulary placement for Crestor, it remains well positioned with strong formulary access in the U.S. And secondly, in my remarks I did describe the dynamics we see it work both in terms of the pricing and segmentation of use for Crestor. And my recommendation, rather than repeating that ground, would be to refer you to our website, where there will be a transcript of my remarks that you can read in your own time.</p>
          <p>Turning to emerging markets, we've seen across the portfolio as I mentioned earlier this is a wide section of different types of markets many of them have been impacted by the challenging sort of macroeconomic conditions and I particularly point to some of our Eastern European markets in that respect. And we've also obviously had issues, turbulence in some of our <mark type="ph" /> mainer (45:45) markets as well. So we have seen a general slowdown across markets, but in addition to that as I called out in my remarks we've seen some specific factors impacting our business and we've dwelt for a moment on Brazil and the timing and it really is a timing of tender orders into our Middle East business we expect that volume to come back in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally when we look at these markets, looking ahead now we continue to see the fundamentals to be strong. These are markets with growing populations, increasing disposable income, elevated levels of chronic diseases and we continue to see that it's providing strong underpinning fundamentals for the growth in pharmaceutical demand in those markets and hence we continue in our business to be seeing the potential for double-digit growth that we've set out as our mid-term planning assumption and that remains our view on the opportunity in those markets and we'll continue to invest hard behind them.</p>
          <p>We've recognized the recent volatility in growth rates from quarter-to- quarter. I think if you look back into 2009 you will have seen that our quarterly growth rate, from memory, drop down to about 9% or even 8% in one quarter and then recover to 14% in the following. So, you do get some volatility, but what we're focused on in developing our business is to realize the potential of those very strong underpinning fundamentals over the long-term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of questions on the legal section of your press release. I noted that you recently filed Citizen's Petitions with the FDA on both Seroquel IR and XR. Just wondering if you can talk a bit as to why you've done that, what you hope this will achieve with regards to the <mark type="ph" /> often mentioned (48:10) generic competition in the U.S. market? I don't say that as a reference with regard to <mark type="ph" /> settling (48:17) on AWP litigation, and you say provision has been made in Q4, I wonder if you are able to tell us the approximate size of the provision in Q4? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. We have -- just dealing with the first of those, so we have indeed filed a Citizens' Petition for Seroquel and Seroquel XR and seeking that the FDA not approve any generic quetiapine that are mixed. Certain warning language from its label, we believe that the warning and data that the FDA required us to include in that labeling should be equally required of a generic label and therefore a generic shouldn't be approved that contains this language because it would violate our three years' data exclusivity right, so that's the basis of the Citizens' Petition. The FDA is required to issue a decision on those by I think it's early March 2012. I think seventh from memory. And so that hopefully deals with your question on the Citizens' Petition.</p>
          <p>In terms of the AWP, we're having continuing discussions with a number of states and have undertaken a number of settlements. We provided against these, I'm not going <mark type="ph" /> to mention that the company (49:48) is not sort of meaningfully material in the overall shape of our financial results and performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks very much. Some questions please, one on dapagliflozin and one on TC-5214 and one on Crestor. On dapagliflozin given the additional data that you and Bristol-Myers Squibb have submitted to the FDA, is your confidence in receiving approval higher, lower, or unchanged and why? On TC-5214, should we still expect to see or hear news of Phase III study results from first studies before the end of this year? And sorry to ask a few other questions on Crestor, I think you responded to <mark type="ph" /> Tim Anderson's (50:46) question about how Crestor was doing in markets where you have lost exclusivity. But could you please give us some color on how Crestor is doing in countries where you still have exclusivity, but Lipitor generics are available in <mark type="ph" /> reimburse please (51:00), on the understanding that this may not read across to the U.S. situation at all and I'm thinking of say Spain, Canada and some of those other markets? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Brian, thanks very much indeed and let me deal with the Crestor and the dapa question and then Karl pick up TC-5214. And actually your question on Crestor prompts me that that was the question of <mark type="ph" /> Tim's (51:23), that I didn't answer at the time. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:26) same question and to both of you where we have seen generic Lipitor in a market where Crestor is present, we do have some examples such as Canada and Spain where we've seen continued growth of Crestor, I think provides evidence in those markets of the strength of the segment that seeks and is prepared to pay the price for Crestor as the most potent statin. So those are two markets were we've got that experience of competing with generic atorvastatin and have continued to perform well. And those are probably the two most significant markets I'd call out. They've played &#x2013; I say that no market is a perfect analogy for another one and Crestor's positioning dynamics will be different in the U.S. We've yet to see how that will play out but we've given you some pointers as to how we think about it in our remarks.</p>
          <p>In terms of dapa the FDA has extended the action date as we announced today, by three months so that puts the new PDUFA date at Jan 28. And obviously that flow through effect that in response to their request for additional data, we were able to submit data from some completed trial so we're pleased we're able to do that and we and our partners BMS remain absolutely committed to dapa as a potential new therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes. We're going to continue to work closely with the FDA to support the continued review of the NDA, We think it's an important drug that could bring real value to patients with this very difficult condition. Karl, TC-5214?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Three questions please. Firstly on Faslodex, that product is no longer reported in your geographic revenue analysis. But it's now annualizing over $0.5 billion and it's growing very fast at 65% year-to-date. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics of that growth, I noticed that you have approved the double dose so is it just that all the patients have switched to the double dose and therefore ultimately that product is doubling and then goes back to the old growth trajectory or actually are you seeing better adoption based on the <mark type="ph" /> Concern (54:28) study that has shown better PFS? The second question option two is coming up next year and obviously you won't tell us what you're going to do but, would you just please give us the pros argument and the cons argument for exercising it? And the third question is what leverage do you have to reduce SG&amp;A next year when you lose Seroquel IR given that, the Seroquel marketing support is already behind the XR product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, Alexandra thanks very much indeed for those questions. <mark type="ph" /> Ed, (55:02) would you like to pick up questions on Faslodex, which is an important and strongly growing product for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And as you mentioned Alexandra, the principal driver of the very rapid growth has been the conversion of prescribing to the 500 milligram dose relative to the lower dose. So, naturally that will fuel kind of an above trend growth rate just from that conversion and upgrade on price and so once you lap the 12 month mark on that &#x2013; that en &#x2013; that separate engine for growth will obviously come out of the year-on-year comparisons. What you'll be left then with is just a couple of drivers for growth. We just recently got approval in Japan, so that will be a new geographic penetration and we're also looking to continue to see Faslodex adopted earlier in the stage of care which would probably be the growth engine over the long-term once we've lapped this accelerated growth space with the new dosage conversion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, <mark type="ph" /> Ed (56:11). I mean <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:57) called out a couple of products, which we haven't talked as much about, but together if you take Restoril and Faslodex almost $800 million for the year-to-date and an important part of our oncology franchise.</p>
          <p>To Merck, your second question, we do indeed have the first decision point on the &#x2013; sort of final exercise of the Merck arrangement. We'll look at that decision as we look at all decisions in our business on the back of -- the value to our shareholders. The process you're probably aware of which is there's an appraised value, we'll obviously to consider that value versus our own estimates and forecasts and views of the future value the PPI segment. That will be an important consideration for us. And we'll look at that as we get into early 2012, make a decision and obviously we then have a second option that comes through in 2017, but I don't think I can really add more than that at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Isn't the arbitrage of the appraised value here much much smaller than you have for option one, and then it's much much easier to value this one than option one, because you had an option one you had <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:40) therefore whether you getting a good deal by exercising early may be smaller?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I mean clearly it's not covering a narrow canvas of product in therapeutic areas, so there is relatively fewer drivers, but I won't comment on the &#x2013; I think <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:04) arbitrage this is a straightforward value decision we'll make at the time based upon our view of the value of the franchise and come back and update you on that?</p>

          <p>So then value it's just an NPV decision or do you look at value also like how much your share price will benefit from doing a buyback instead?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We compare our decisions on the basis of value, and there are multiple different lenses through which we look at that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's more than NPV?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we turn to your next question, which is SG&amp;A, if I look at the &#x2013; I think you asked that question particularly in the context of the loss of exclusivity on Seroquel IR, but how we look at this really is the same with if there is any significant loss of exclusivity. There are clearly resources directly attributable to that brand and that product right across the value chain. From sales marketing through into our supply chain and clearly the first action one takes is to remove that resourcing cost either redeployed or removed.</p>
          <p>The second value is as part of our ongoing productivity and efficiency improvement initiatives, we're always working hard to ensure that the sort of infrastructure cost and capacity within our business is rightly aligned in any one market to the prevailing business in that market and you will have seen for example an announcement earlier, probably early this month, late last month in the U.S. where we have taken actions to reduce the organization within the U.S. and that's typical of actions that we're taking around many of our established markets and some of that is being reinvested as you know in driving growth in our emerging markets, some of it goes to the bottom line and benefits the margins. So, we'll be looking at Seroquel IR in exactly that same way. Out come the directly attributable resources and we progress &#x2013; continues to focus to ensure our infrastructure is right sized. So Alexandra thanks very much indeed for the three questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you and we have a question now from the line of Seamus Fernandez of Leerink Swann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for the question. Maybe just a follow up on Alexandra's question there with regard to the AstraZeneca limited partnership, are there any restrictions, again is it truly just an NPV based decision or is the AstraZeneca limited partnership itself providing any restrictions at all work or opportunities for Merck to participate in anything particularly potential M&amp;A type decisions that, that could be made in the future. And then with regard to prospects for M&amp;A, can you just give us your thoughts as we kind of move forward, it looks to me when I look at the U.S. infrastructure that again there aren't a lot of substantial new product launches unless the pipeline really delivers. And it would seem to me like that's something where you could lose a lot of potential leverage over time, just wondering how you think about that. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks very much indeed, Seamus. Just following up therefore on your question about Merck. I mean this is sort of detailed granular level. There are lots of sort of complex issues around exit from a complex longstanding historic relationships such as Astra Merck. But fundamentally for I think the strategic position, the value of the company we <mark type="ph" /> can (1:02:04) think about it in quite simple terms and that is the value of the, price value versus how we see the value as a part of our business covered within that arrangement. Part of the value equation is the value associated with increased freedom to operate outside of the Astra Merck relationship. And see that's part of our assessment of the value to us staying in or indeed exiting that arrangement. And that will be a part of our consideration.</p>
          <p>So, that I, hopefully, sort of deals with Merck. If I can come back to your second question which is the opportunities in the U.S. to further develop our business through &#x2013; I think the suggestion was sort of in licensing and indeed acquisitions to leverage our capability and infrastructure there. You are absolutely right that we got a very strong capability, commercial capability in the U.S. We are always looking at attractive opportunities to leverage that capability to bring patients &#x2013; bring medicines to patients whether that's from our own R&amp;D and launches such as ONGLYZA, KOMBIGLYZE, Caprelsa, Brilinta, which we have on the way at the moment. Or in licensing compounds, collaborating with our peers with the compounds. We are always looking at those sorts of opportunities and that's a core part of our strategy, but equally we work hard to ensure that our infrastructure is least cost and flexible so that we don't strategically have to undertake those types of combinations because in all cases we are so focused on taking the right decisions in terms of value. So hopefully that answers your two questions. Other questions, operator.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, gentleman. Couple of things. Firstly on Crestor, I know it's sort of probably going over ground we've discussed. But the difference between prescription growth and value growth in the U.S. is widened very significantly during the course of 2011. It was about 8% in the first quarter, then rising to 15% and 17% in the last two quarters and I wonder if you get sort of speak to the dynamics of that, I know it's a combination of price and mix. But if you could give us at least some feel for how that split is because clearly if a large proportion is mix and that's something that should be an enduring benefit going forward. And secondly just on Zyprexa genericizing just wondered if you think that will play any role in the near term performance of Seroquel in the run up to patent expire on the IR and well we don't what's going to happen with XR's patent &#x2013; but certainly over the next six months whether you would expect that to have any impact on the franchise? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks for two questions. And let me just start in the question of Zyprexa in the atypicals market and then <mark type="ph" /> Ed Hudspeth (1:05:17) pick up on Crestor <mark type="ph" /> and DT, (1:05:19) maybe add to the Zyprexa issue. Our experience in the segment is that the patients with these conditions will frequently move from across a variety of treatment options and when their physician finds a treatment option that really is best for them, they tend to want to ensure that their patients remain on that option and therefore we tend to see less direct impact or sort of therapeutic substitution when we see genericization of one molecule, less of an impact on other molecules within the class than we might see in some other segments. That's certainly been our experience with recent genericization in the atypical to class in the U.S. and for example with Seroquel, we don't expect that dynamic change and I don't know if you want to add to that, but if not move on to question on Crestor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you're right. Yeah, when Risperdal went generic, you saw a small uptick in the total molecule for risperidone, but it was at the margin rather than any big drive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I don't think you can see much of a different dynamic there with Zyprexa. On the Crestor, the price volume, there is always of course a bit of noise in there and I would say in this quarter there were probably two products where you saw a little bit of stock movements. Crestor probably benefited a bit from stocking. So, I would add a bit of inventory movements compared to the year ago period to the price -- added to the price, and the larger size prescriptions and the non-retail channels to that for the quarter. Conversely, Seroquel is probably a little bit of destocking, so those are the two products, but it's all in the noise, it's all in what you would normally see in terms of the kind of product movements but if you look directionally it flattered Crestor's growth rate this quarter and probably hindered Seroquel a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think that the headline story is that the prevailing dynamic is continued, good volumetric growth for Crestor <mark type="ph" /> bundles. (1:07:30) So, as I mentioned in my remarks, we have sustained net price increases in Crestor reflecting its value proposition related to the alternatives. And then as I had mentioned from quarter-to-quarter we do get the mix and stocking benefits which can run our way or against &#x2013; this quarter happens to be in our direction.</p>

          <p>I think operator we've probably got time for just one more question. If there are final questions to come, happy to take one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we have question from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:04). Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Given that we now have learned that <mark type="ph" /> <mark type="indiscernible" /> for sure <mark type="indiscernible" /> markets (1:08:13) business as well. Are there any specific countries or products that we should be aware of coming up in the very near term. And secondly, China in particular was now down at the 13%, I think its slowest growth since Q4 '06. Was there de-stocking effects in Q3 ahead of reforms in September and now will there be stocking effects in Q4, that explains the number and we should take into account? And thirdly with your sales in Brazil down 17% if I'm not mistaken in the quarter, how do you handle the lost sales when &#x2013; think about your fixed cost base there, do you continue to invest and accept the lower margin temporarily? Or do you actively adjust to maintain and even continue to improve margins in those markets. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, good questions. So, I don't think there is any significant expiration in emerging markets that I would call out as ones to watch. So, I don't think there's any sort of insight I can provide you on that. I think the second question in terms of China &#x2013; no I mean I think we've seen something of a slowdown in the China market, you'll have seen that from others and you'll have seen it in the overall IMS data. And then as I mentioned in my remarks we have had some particular factors at work on our performance in particular we have seen some lower prices in one or two of our therapeutic areas and as I mentioned it's probably important factor for us in terms of momentum, some delays in the rate at which the national RDL approvals were then implemented regionally. Those are the two facts I call out. I wouldn't say there's a stocking dynamic that impacted Q3 and in turn that would impact Q4.</p>
          <p>So that was on the emerging market and then on China and then on your question on Brazil very similar answer really to how we address both Seroquel IR loss of exclusivity and the question about how we look at our capability and infrastructure in the U.S. We've got very strong sales and marketing capability in market positions. We built that through sustained investments and development of our capabilities over time. But we're also conscious that we need to be operating as efficiently as we possibly can and we benchmark up all of our functions just to drive the sort of top quartile efficiency and we also look to have a very flexible cost base so we can adapt to exactly these types of issues whether it's &#x2013; when we get a loss of exclusivity or indeed when we've got a launch to be able to fund, we want to be able to do that without adding resource and exactly the same factors at play in Brazil. We're looking to make sure our cost base is variable so that we reduce fixed cost directly attributable to brands and products, keep the margins at a decent rate, but if we got opportunities to invest in products coming through we will hold that resource in because it's much better to keep that resource in place, to suffer a bit of a penalty on margin for a short period in order to drive growth out into the future. So, it's very much on a market-by-market basis.</p>
          <p>So, thanks very much indeed for the question. Much appreciate it. And I think with that it brings us to the end of our call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me &#x2013; let me conclude by thanking you all for joining us on today's call. Let me also apologize for the fact that we lost you a short way in and particularly some of you had to listen to &#x2013; to my remarks, interesting though they were, twice. And then in summary, we've delivered a third quarter performance that's in line with our expectations against a backdrop of difficult market conditions. We continue to invest where we see opportunity to create value, while retaining discipline in operating costs in the allocation of capital. We continue to drive strong cash-flows and cash returns to shareholders and we're on track to deliver on a revised target core earnings per share in the range of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. And with that I bid you good day.</p>
