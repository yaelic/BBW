          <p>Good morning. We are beginning now the conference call about the results of Ita&#xFA;sa from 2007. I will speak a little bit about the results of the conglomerate. After that, my colleagues, Investor Relations Directors of Banco Ita&#xFA;, of Duratex, of Elekeiroz, and of Itautec, we will explain their companies and after that for the closing, I'll speak a little bit about the performance of Ita&#xFA;sa. So let's begin.</p>
          <p>Slide #2, the liquidity of the company and the debt index of the company, nothing changed. The company is very, very liquid and almost without any debt.</p>
          <p>Slide #3, where we can see that 94% of the liabilities are the own resources of the company, the network, and that the third-party resources, more than 95% represents the dividends to be paid to the shareholders.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide #4, you can see the evolution of the net income of the conglomerate, the recurring and the non-recurring net income with a compound annual growth rate of 25.2%.</p>
          <p>Slide #5, where we show that we are keeping the policy of paying to our shareholders more than the dividends or interest on capital received from Banco Ita&#xFA; Holding Financeira. So we are having blue that we paid and red the number that we received from Ita&#xFA; Holding Financeira.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide #6, from the total dividends, showing the capital increase that &#x2013; by cash that we had year-by-year and showing that the compound annual growth rate of the next dividend is 31.2%. The dividend yield, slide #7, considering and non-considering the capital increase without the dividend yield of Ita&#xFA;sa is higher than the dividend yield of Banco Ita&#xFA; Holding Financeira.</p>
          <p>Slide #9, some highlights of the conglomerate. The year 2007 was a very, very important year for us because it was a year where we had the highest net income of all the companies. Banco Ita&#xFA; had a record net income. The same thing happened with Itautec, with Elekeiroz and with Duratex. So, in the slide you can see, the growth of the total assets &#x2013; the growth half the quarter's equity and the growth of net income of all the main companies of the conglomerate.</p>
          <p>I will turn now to my colleague, Alfredo Setubal, to speak about Banco Ita&#xFA; in detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A few highlights of our results for last year. The first one is the record net income that we had, not only for the bank but for the whole history of the financial system in review. The final number of our almost R$8.5 billion with a growth of 96% over the previous year. These results includes all this figures of stakes that we had in the last year of companies that went to the stock market. So, the final recurrent number of our activities would be R$7.2 billion that compares to 6.2 of the year of 2006. So, our recurrent result increased by 20% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The final stockholders' equity, almost R$29 billion with a return on equity of 32.1%, a very high number and a very good number for the return. Incomes of sovereignty ratio, we consider to have very high numbers. We finished with 17.9, what gives us room to increase our credit portfolio and also consider acquisitions. This appears an opportunity for the bank. Efficiency ratio continued to decrease. We finished the year of 2007 with 46.2% lower than the previous year and a very good number considering our situation here in Brazil.</p>
          <p>We continued to increase our number of branches of the bank. We finished with 2007, a 164 branches which is an increase of more than 130 branches when we compare to the year of 2006. Continuous -- the expansion of our branch network as we did in the previous three years. We continue to -- and this year we are continue in this policy of opening new branches for the bank. And we finished with total number of clients of almost 24 million clients.</p>
          <p>The next page, slide 11, we are going to talk about the credit portfolio. The total credit portfolio increased in the last quarter of the year 11.9, and the whole year 36.2 because of the growth of the individuals especially in terms of vehicles. The individual credit increased last year 35% and vehicles increased 64.4. In terms of company loans, the growth were 23.6, especially concentrated in the last quarter when we saw the number for corporate for large companies in Brazil. The growth alone in the last quarter of 2007 was 14.4%.</p>
          <p>In the slide 12, you can see that the non-performing loan ratio decreased to 4.4. It was the fifth year in a row that this non-performing ratio decreased and also decreased for both individuals that finished with 6.9 and companies, small, medium and corporate and large companies, 1.6%. Our covered ratio continues to be very comfortable and we are very confident that this trend will continue this year.</p>
          <p>Some forecast for the year of 2008. We continue to believe that the credit and the environment for credit will continue to be good in Brazil. So, we expect the individual credit portfolio that includes consumer credits and also vehicles will increase by 30%. Mainly in vehicles, the growth will continue to be very high. In terms of credit for companies, we believe that we can increase especially middle market and small companies, 25% in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Service fees, our expectation is a growth of 8% even considering the restrictions of the Central Bank new regulations released last year that we will be in place from April. The efficiency ratio, we continue to believe that we can remain in the level of 46%, that it will be a very good level for this number. And, in terms of delinquency ratio, we believe that the environment for credit in Brazil will continue to be good and we expect the level to remain around the same level that we had last year.</p>
          <p>I'll give the world now to Plinio Pinheiro that will talk about Duratex.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. Duratex had a very good year in 2007. We achieved the record of performance and in the slide #14, I will give you the highlights about the Deca Division where we produce metal fittings and vitreous china for kitchens and bathrooms. And this division represents around the one-thirds of the total sales of Duratex. We increased the shipment volumes by 11% year-over-year; net revenue increased 17% reaching R$566 million. The gross margin increased from 38% in 2006 to 41% in 2007. The EBITDA gross, 43%, reaching R$148 million in 2007 and the EBITDA margin improved from 21% to 26%. And we received the iF design award in the Hanover Fair for our line 'Contemporary'. It's a special vitreous china line.</p>
          <p>In the wood division that represented two-thirds of the total sales, the highlights are first, the &#x2013; improving the shipment volumes by 7%; net revenues increased 10% reaching R$1.14 billion. The gross margin improved from 46% to 47%. EBITDA improved 60% to R$410 million and the EBITDA margins improved from 35% to 37%. And we received that award from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, the economic institute, a very important economic institute in Brazil, the best company in the wood area.</p>
          <p>We are in the middle of the implementation of a huge investment plan in the total amount of R$850 million. The announcement was released in March 2006. And we believe that by 2009 all the investments will be implemented. The highlights in terms of this program are, first, the MBS, the new MBS plan which capacity is 800,000 cubic meters per year, it means an increase of more than 100% over the existing capacity. This new line will be &#x2013; the structure is probably in the mid of 2009. In the mid of 2008 we will start off the new low-pressure coking line that will add value to our products; the capacity is 8.5 million square meters per year and we are buying land by 20,000 acres to support the new capacity in the wood division.</p>
          <p>The Deca division is receiving around R$200 million and basically increases the capacity by 400,000 items per month. In the matter of fittings, it represents around a 33%. In the vitreous China we are -- we will increase the capacity by 140,000 items a month; that represents 44%. And in terms of our corporative area, we are implementing a new ERP system from SAP and it will be ready by the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>In slide #17, we show some ratios and some improving performance since 2004. We can see that we improved the gross margin in 2004 towards 39% and 2007 45% and the CAGR</p>
          <p>about 12% in the growth of net revenues during this period. The EBITDA margin grows from 27% in 2004 reaching 33.4% in 2007 and the EBITDA --  the compound average growth about 20% during this period. Net income from 125 million in 2004 to R$319 million in 2007, 37% compound annual growth. And the return on equity reached around 21.5% in 2007 from 13% in 2004.</p>
          <p>Slide #18, the market capitalization of <mark type="inaudible" /> increased from R$173 million in 2002 and reached $3.172 billion by the end of 2007 and the improvement in the liquidity of the shares allow us to return to the Bovespa Index and the BR 50 index. During this period, 2002 to 2007, we took a lot of steps in terms of the improvement in the government's corporate measures such as provide 8% tag-along rights to the TN shares in 2002. We decided to guarantee a minimum of 30% payoffs since 2004. We are listed in the Bovespa Level-1 government practice since 2005 and as I explained, we are now back to the in Bovespa Index and EBR-60.</p>
          <p>Now Mr. Ricardo Setubal, he will speak about Itautec. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody. We are going to start our presentation with slide 19. 322,000 units of desktops and notebooks were sold in 2007, a volume 6% higher than that in 2006. This performance reflects an expansion in consumer credit, a decrease in average price of equipment, and depreciation of 17.1% of the real against the U.S. dollar. As to the automation area, we would particularly point out the growth of 50% in the numbers of items sold, the result of successful tender bid amount to 6.8000 units.</p>
          <p>Net revenues from sales and service in 2007 reached R$1.524 billion, equivalent to a growth of 3.9 compared with that in 2006. Gross margin was 20.3% against 19.2% in 2006. This was a reflector of better sales mix with a higher share of notebooks and revenues from the service area. Accumulated EBITDA for the year was 118.9 million. A year-on-year increase of 70% results in a EBITDA margin of 7.8% against 4.8% in 2006. This performance reflects the reduction on operation expenses at the range of more than R$19 million.</p>
          <p>Net income was a 106 million, 100% up in 2006. The sales are without tax 50 participation in  Comarco Re Works 38.7 million also contributed to this result as did the results from the sale of <mark type="inaudible" /> in the city of San Paulo.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, during the year, the Tolteca distribution company in Brazil, Argentina, and Ecuador were merged with solid companies and then placed under the same managerial structure. As a result, the common strategy has been established and the use of the reserves optimized. It has in R&amp;D results in the range of international standard compliance product to meet the requirements of environmental responsibility as well as those of people with special needs. The objective here is to further boost our exporter firms. Together with the Tolteca investments in innovation and design comes some important acknowledgements. Among these was the iF Design Award, an annual event in Hanover, Germany.</p>
          <p>As it is, 2007 <mark type="inaudible" /> the company was awarded with the Classic Keyboard Operator prize as shown in the slide, a new product line in the retail automation.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, according to the capital expenditure plan 117 million was invested in <mark type="inaudible" /> as follows. R$53 million in development of technology; 53 million in operational fixed assets notably to the construction of the new desktop and notebook ATM and lock-box plants in Chunjae  responsible for 30.8 million in capital expenditure and R$11 million for equivalent leasing to clients.</p>
          <p>In September 2007 the move of the Arizo Copine test site was concluded. The desktops, notebook, ATM and lock-box plants, laboratories and engineering areas were then all the entrants feared to the new Chunjae site. The administrative, software, commercial service operations were then moved to the installation facilities in the city of San Paolo.</p>
          <p>In 2007 the company drilled down the first tranche of a credit line signed in July 2007. <mark type="inaudible" /> they asked for 170 million, part of a total of 142 million amount approved, the financing corporate projects for the company's internationalization and the transfer of production lines to the Chunjae industrial district, and will also be used to increase the stall capacity and working capital requirements for expansion as well as investments in research and development of innovative products and continued upgrades of some products and process. Itautec was placed second in Fiat's Environmental Merit Prize.</p>
          <p>Now slide #22. The net sales EBITDA and shareholders equity to growth excludes discontinued operations, <mark type="inaudible" /> and component areas. In the net sales gross margin graphs, net revenues from sales and service for 2007 reached 1.524 billion on an annualized growth basis owned and on the compound annual growth rate of 18.9 compared with that in 2004. Gross margin was 20.3% against 19.2% in 2006. EBITDA and EBITDA margin, 2007 EBITDA was 118.9 million, 49 million higher than 2006. We foresee a GR of 14.7% compared with that in 2004. EBITDA margin reached 7.12%.</p>
          <p>Net income graph: Net income for 2007 was 100.6 million, equivalent to a fee AGR of 64.7 compared with that in 2004. The last two fiscal years has been reported and recorded results due to the sales of the Toltec property in the city of San Paolo. These amounts were recognized in the financial statements as a known operating result. Recording that income in 2007 was 161.9 million, 64.4 higher than in 2006.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity and rights: Shareholders' equity at the end of 2007 was 423.1 million which stands for a return, a return on equity of 25.2. CAGR increased 15% in this period.</p>
          <p>With this we conclude our tech results and I would like now to invite Mr. Reinaldo Rubbi to make the presentation of Elekeiroz. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ricardo. Good morning for everyone. We are going to talk about the slide 23, about the scenario where the petrochemicals business did a lot last year. There was demands for petrochemicals due to the economic growth of China remaining high and growing and allow us the good margins despite the peak of the oil price that reaches $100 per barrel at the end of this year. The Brazilian demand for chemicals followed their own performance and grew 8.7% on the other sites. The local production only grew 1.6% due to the absence of new capacities coming into the market. And so, the importers grew 67% and the great balance for this industry was negative in 13.3 billions of U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>This great debt, these specific great debts is a huge opportunity for new investments in this area and the country. The company took advantage of this comfortable scenario and the leverage of 520,000 of net mouths growing 11%. With this strong growth, despite the bottleneck measures adopted, the capacity utilization of the plants reached 89% which is a very good standard for the industry. And as a direct consequence of that, the company had an important improvement on its profitability. Continuing this practice of focusing in business of the higher growth opportunities and higher profitability, the company shut down the production of carbon disulfide and sold the remaining installations of the previous year sold at <mark type="inaudible" />. During the year, the company started some strategic studies regarding the production of green butanol deploying ethanol from sugar cane as raw material and its own technology.</p>
          <p>On the slide 24 I will make some comment about the families of products that we have. We divided our business in two families, organic chemicals and inorganic. On organic chemicals we had plus 0.8% order deliveries reaching 254,000 metric tons and these represents about 49% of the total deliveries of the company. We increased by 70% the net sales, reaching 783.3 millions which means 90% of the total net sales of the company. The increase on the export was around 15%, and we should point out that we export for more than 30 countries in the world, reaching R$163 million or 21% of the net sales.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA grew 103%, reaching R$105.3 million which means 82% of the total EBITDA of the company. Those strong results were obtained despite the increase of 20% on the naphtha prices from where we bought all our raw materials for the organic products. We should point out also the strong position of the company in Brazil and South America in special chemicals, <mark type="inaudible" /> business and the company also is &#x2013; has a very good differential -- differentiation that is very important for their business in the future. Plus it is the only integrated producers of plasticizers in South America and also the only producer of <mark type="inaudible" /> ethanol and <mark type="inaudible" /> ethanol gases in organics.</p>
          <p>The deliveries grew 14% reaching 266,000 metric tons. The net sales increased by 7% reaching R$87.3 millions. The EBITDA reached -- increased by 736% reaching R$23.6 million and the EBITDA margin reached 27%. We would like to point out, in the organic business that is the responsible by the cogeneration of electric power in the site of <mark type="inaudible" />. And the cogeneration answers for 75% of the total requirements of the site.</p>
          <p>I would like also to go through slide 25, where the graphics show some of our financial performance during the year. For the first time, the company surpassed a total of R$1 billion of gross revenues. And the gross revenues grew 21%. The yield revenues, the net sales reached R$817 million, also grew 21%. And the gross margin returned to the level of 22.9%.</p>
          <p>After two years, 2005 and '06, where it is underperformance under the level of 20% we should showed <mark type="inaudible" /> due to an unexpected problems arising from our having maintenance problem introduced in 2005. The compounded growth rate of the next <mark type="inaudible" /> strong 2002 up to 2007 was 20% bigger than that. The net profit was a record of the six years reaching R$71.5 million plus 60% per annum since 2002. And also, the <mark type="inaudible" /> was a good one, reaching 19.08% over the net equity. The EBITDA reached R$121.9 millions, showing their component growth rate of 15% per annum in the period, reaching 14.8 of the net sales.</p>
          <p>I would finish my presentation now, and call Mr. Penchas to conclude the explanation.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Reinaldo. Let's go through the final part of our presentation, slide 28, where you can see the evolution of the net income of the parent company and of the minorities and the total and net income, so the compound annual growth rate of 25.2%.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, as a parent company where you can see the evolution of the participation of the industrial area in the net income of the parent company's evolution from 5.1% to 7.5%. Those companies with a high increase, Duratex, Elekeiroz and Itautec</p>

          <p>Page 32, corporate governance, we are very proud from being selected for the first time as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. And in this new index edition, Itau obtained the highest score in the foreign financial bank quality, human capital development and province of rationale retention. The liquidity of the share in number of trades and in volume, international volume, increased very, very much over the last year, mainly in 2007 as you can see in slide 33. The discount of the share &#x2013; in the price of Itau's in comparison with the sum of the parts was at 31 December 2007, 23.9% as you can see in slide 34.</p>
          <p>Slide 35, the same thing, just showing this semester where we can see that in the first semester of 2007, June, the discount was 19.7.</p>
          <p>Slide 36, showing the annual average of appreciation dollars of the shares of Itau's in comparison with the Bovespa Index where you can see the high performance of our company in the last ten years, and five years in comparison with the Bovespa.</p>
          <p>And finally slide 37, what we believe and what's the way that we create stockholders' value by determination of our organizational culture with the prioritization of human capital, with operational economy of the company's leadership in the businesses where we are, with the brands internationalization of our company, the capital structure, and the sound investments that we have.</p>
