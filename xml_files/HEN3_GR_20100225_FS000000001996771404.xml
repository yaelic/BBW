          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Analyst and Investor Meeting for Fiscal Year 2009.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wolfgang. In the name of Henkel and the entire management team, welcome to Duesseldorf to review our 2009 numbers and also take you through our 2010 outlook.</p>
          <p>The agenda is as follows, I will speak about the macro environment and highlights for the previous fiscal year, give you an insight onto progress on strategic priorities. Lothar Steinebach will take you through the financials and an update on restructuring measures.</p>
          <p>I will close this part by going through the outlook for fiscal year 2010. Hans Van Bylen in subsequent take you through an overview of our cosmetics business and we'll close off by it with a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Looking back is always easy because sometimes when you look back, you forget how the year is. And when a year ends well, then one tends to believe that it was actually a very easy year and a good year. But I do want to set the year 2009 in context because I believe that it is essential also for the outlook.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we've experienced the greatest recession in the last 80 years. That means by the look of all us in this audience, none of us experienced the previous one. We have seen abrupt declines in all regions. We have seen world trade decline by 10% and global insolvencies increased by 35%.</p>
          <p>We have seen a record increase in unemployment. And just in the last 18 months, 34 million people have lost their jobs, 34 million consumers that are potentially buying our products. So the recession is still there and is very much alive. We've seen an enormous national deficit evolving through support and stimulus, the overall economy.</p>
          <p>It has also had significant impact on us. As you all know, our industrial business has been severely impacted by the recession because some of the industrial sectors have been even more impacted. Transportation and machinery, 16 &#x2013; 17 and 16% decline, electronics, 11. And these of course have the beauty of average.</p>
          <p>What I mean by that is that there are segments of these industries that have experienced significant greater decline than the 16 or 17%. Some of these industries have experienced a decline of 56 and 70%, and of course some of these industries have and are customers of ours.</p>
          <p>Private consumption have also gone back and retail. So overall, not only for Henkel but for everybody, 2009 and the market was extremely challenging.</p>
          <p>The achievements for 2009 would be the following. We've had an extremely strong year in our Laundry &amp; Home Care and Cosmetics and Toiletries business. We have seen continuous and strong improvement of our Adhesive business following a very "week first quarter".</p>
          <p>We made significant progress on our three strategic priorities, a) achieving our full business potential, b) focusing more on our customers, and c) strengthening our global team. We have achieved an all-time low in net working capital of 7.8%, which has allowed us or helped us to reduce our net financial debt by more than 1 billion.</p>
          <p>We have completed global excellence ahead of plan and as you'll hear today, the program has now been put to bed. That is closed. It was announced in a similar surrounding in 2008 with the assumption that the full benefits would be in 2011. We've done that more than one year ahead of plan. And for the first time in history of Henkel we have broken the 12% barrier when it comes to margin and we had a fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margin of 12.4%.</p>
          <p>Under the given circumstances, I believe that we as a company, have shown decisiveness and the entire company along with the management team have shown a strong performance in 2009 in a market that was extremely challenging. And at the same time, many of the decisions we have taken in the past one to two years will be of vital importance towards our targets in 2012.</p>
          <p>However, we also had some challenges and I have highlighted probably the biggest three here. We have seen significant volume decrease in our Adhesives division throughout the year, with a recovery steadily quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>But I do want to remind everybody that first quarter last year, we had a volume decline in our Adhesives division of 23%, the biggest decline that I think that anybody at least in our company can remember.</p>
          <p>The mature markets was, is and continues to be strongly affected by the recession. And in our consumer products goods business, we have seen very, very intensified competition and a strong increase of private label.</p>
          <p>Despite these challenges in 2009, we are seeing the first positive indicators for 2010 but I would like to describe the positive indicators in terms of stabilization rather than recovery. So what we are seeing, also as indicated on previous calls, we are seeing stabilization in our markets, we are not seeing the return of strong growth rates.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some of the highlights. For our Laundry &amp; Home Care business, we've seen strong organic sales growth. We continue to have our emerging markets drive double-digit growth rates for us. As you know, all of you, we exited our China business in the midyear. We've increased our market share in all key regions and EBIT margin reached all-times high despite significant increase in marketing spend.</p>
          <p>We have a very high innovation rate of 40% and when it comes to top brands, our top 10 brands account for more than half of our business, 54%. And many of you who were here in September, when we spoke about the cost saving concept, our top 10 brand clusters account for 80% of the total Laundry &amp; Home Care business. Overall, we saw strong profitable growth. And in summary, we had a very strong year for our Laundry &amp; Home Care business.</p>
          <p>Now let me speak about our and Cosmetics and Toiletries business. We continue to have organic or strong organic growth despite declining markets. What's important to notice here is that Cosmetics and Toiletries, as Hans Van Bylen will discuss in detail later on, we operated in many instances in declining markets. Particularly, the professional market was declining last year with high single digits.</p>
          <p>Our growth drivers, where once more our emerging regions with double-digit growth rates, we had record high market shares in Europe, we had record high EBIT and EBIT margin. We continued a very high innovation rate; around 40%. And 87% of our sales are now coming from our top 10 brands. In summary, we again had a very good and a very strong year in our Cosmetics and Toiletries business.</p>
          <p>Our Adhesive Technologies business, when the crisis came, we acted swift and successfully to adjust the business to the downturn as it relates to costs, capacities and capital. We have strong quarter-by-quarter improvement in organic sales and EBIT following a very challenging Q1. And we did see positive signs in bottoming out, I call it stabilization in our now market in the second half.</p>
          <p>Throughout the year, we've been capable of maintaining our strong market positions and the integration of National Starch is well ahead of plan as originally communicated.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, beyond working with global excellence, integrating National Starch, our Adhesive Technologies business, changed this organization to make it more customer focused, originally announced in May and well underway.</p>
          <p>In summary, significant structural improvements throughout the year and very strong ending in a market that has been very, very difficult.</p>
          <p>Without going into every detail of the financials, let me just pull out a couple of highlights. We had organic sales declining by 3.5% points. At the same time, we saw our adjusted gross margin increase by 150 basis points, which made our adjusted EBIT margin almost stable compared to previous, growing from 10.3 to 10.0, again in the biggest recession year in the last 80 years. We had enormous improvement in our free cash flow with an increase of over 1 billion and that was not mainly, but also strongly driven by our net working capital of 7.8. So, under the bottom line or the bottom line was strong performance in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>This is to give you an outlook how the year actually went because it was a year where we had continued &#x2013; significant and continued improvement of operating our performance throughout the year. When we said here last year only two months after this meeting, we had to go out and announce number why the EBIT margin just was 7.2%. And I think, nobody at that stage would have believed that we could close the year by 5 quantile EBIT margin 12.4, the highest EBIT margin that we've had in the company.</p>
          <p>The most important and probably also the most positive message here is that all business groups contributed, we saw strong contribution from all business groups throughout the year. From Laundry &amp; Homecare, a very, very significant margin improvement. Cosmetics and Toiletries had continuous strong performance and Adhesive Technologies, from a very challenging start almost back to pr-recession levels.</p>
          <p>This is a slide that we showed you at our conference last year where we set out and said this is what we'll focus on in 2009. We went out and said we will focus on implementing our strategic priorities. We've gone through those with you throughout the year and I'll give you a brief overview also where we are today. We said that among the growth drivers are our leading brands and our leading brands needs to grow twice &#x2013; with twice the speed of the organic sales growth of the company. Today, seven out of 10 do that. Innovation needs to be accretive to gross margin and we've stuck to that so that means all new products are accretive to gross margin.</p>
          <p>Our emerging markets are not only our revenue driver, but also our profit driver and Mr. Steinebach will take you through that. And our top customers, as we said, our biggest customers will grow with 50% more speed than the rest of the company and eight out of 10 did that.</p>
          <p>We also significantly decreased our cost base with more than 225 million with the speed up of the implementation of global excellence in National Starch. And furthermore, we, early on the year, implemented a number of counter &#x2013; recession counter measures that help, not only our liquidity, base but also our net debt base.</p>
          <p>In summary, we pretty much did what we said we were going to do when we met here a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now let me speak about progress and strategic priorities. Our three strategic priorities, achieve our full business potential, focus more on our customer and strengthen our global team has been in the center of most of the activities we've undertaken in 2009. On achieving our full business potential, I briefly mentioned it, by the integration of National Starch business is well ahead of plan</p>
          <p>We've gone in and worked on complexity reduction by divesting or continuing or discontinuing 46 brands. And our emerging markets continued to be our growth engine, 38% of our sales come from the emerging market, up from 37 a year ago. And if you were to currency, correct this, you'd have seen that 40% of our business would have come from the emerging markets, currency stayed consistent. We of course not done in this area we'll continue to optimize our portfolio mix.</p>
          <p>I've strengthen our leading brands today, our top brands account, top three brands account for the quarter of business, roughly 3.5 billion. Our top 10 brands account for 40%, roughly 6 billion. And our top 10 cluster brands 45% of our business. That means already today we have a strong consolidation in our business around our top brands and we will continue that consolidation by over investing in our stronger brands as it comes to engineering, to sales and marketing and overtime continue to clean up of our portfolio by divesting or closing down weaker brands.</p>
          <p>We've also made substantial improvement when it comes to our innovation. And let me give you three examples here, three that are very different but all have been a significant success in 2009. Firstly, Purex 3-in-1, our laundry sheet, a completely new form factor, that was implemented in May last year in the U.S. and has reached the market share of almost 2% in the U.S. in the first year. Syoss, our most successful introduction of a new product that won't steal the thunder from Hans Van Bylen, but an immensely successful implementation in our cosmetics business. And Technomelt Supercool 130, and it's not often you say that 130 degrees is supercool, but the point is you coming from 180 degrees. What is important here is, that this is a combination of two technologies. It's a combination of a technology that came from Henkel and it's a combination that came from a technology from National Starch. It's one of the first very large innovations we brought to market where a big part of the innovation came from our acquisition from National Starch from 2008.</p>
          <p>And what's common to all of these new innovations are that they are accretive to our gross margin.</p>
          <p>Operational excellence; in purchasing, we have set ourselves hot targets for savings for the next three years. And looking back, we achieved more than 100 million savings in our purchasing group. On our production supply chain, again on previous occasions, we have said that we have initiated 60 projects in this area, 40 have already been finalized.</p>
          <p>And our SG&amp;A, we've continued the standardization and automization of our processes. We've signed significant outsourcing agreements for IT services with three global players, Accenture, IBM and Unisys, that will drive significant savings for us. We've extended our outsourcing of admin task to Bratislava and Manila beyond finance to include purchasing and HR and we've also closed or terminated leases for 38 locations. So that means in the past 12 months we've gone at more than &#x2013; almost 80 projects, 40 in production and supply chain and 40 admin locations. That is one and half location per week throughout the year that just went by. We're ahead of plan on all cost saving initiatives.</p>
          <p>When it come to focus more on our customer that was the most of our year 2009 and as we told you, we have initiated what we call top-to-top contacts. They have been established with the senior management teams of our top 24 customers globally where business plans and targets have been defined, helping us move from a sell-to to a customer development relationship with our customers.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've also received a number of sustainability awards. In itself, the awards have no meaning for us, roughly speaking. It is of course a recognition of what we do, that we see sustainability as being a competitive advantage for Henkel because our customers tell us so. Sustainability has been part of our DNA for more than 30 years and it is the focus of what we do, strategically and tactically. Of course it's nice that we get prizes, but the best prize to get in this area is the prize from the customer.</p>
          <p>The last pillar strengthening our global team, very often in years where you &#x2013; under recession, you speak less about this, but there has been no year where the management within Henkel has been more time, on telling management focus and feedback sessions that has also meant that we have had a high number of internal promotions in the past year, not because they're internal, but because they're good. We've sharpened our pay per performance concept and we've implemented what we call a top talent programs, where we send our very best people to Harvard that was initiated the year before last and implemented last year.</p>
          <p>Our 2010 team, a global team winning together came to fruition and I think we're starting to see some of the results of what we can do in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand over to Lothar Steinebach, who will take you through the financials and update on restructuring measures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>As usual, we'll guide you with some more transparency through Q4, full fiscal year and then give an update on restructuring measures.</p>
          <p>And we start with Q4; first of all, sales growth by business sector in particular organic sales growth. Before I get into each of the division in terms of organic sales growth, let me briefly address currencies because Q4 was somewhat unusual compared to full fiscal year. We've seen continuation of the weak currencies in the emerging countries in particular Russia and Ukraine, but the U.S. dollar has contributed to the negative currency impact in Q4. That's different in full fiscal year and I'll get to that in a moment.</p>
          <p>With respect to organic sales growth in Q4, Laundry &amp; Homecare, no price impact by 2.5%, so therefore, the full organic sales growth is from volume. As you've seen during the year there has been an up and down in terms of pricing and volume, and we have always suggested that we need to look at a longer-term horizon because we are managing our business in terms of preserving volume, preserving our market position, and at the same time, trying to preserve the pricing impact that we have enabled to implement. So therefore, pricing impact in Q4 in Laundry &amp; Homecare has been zero and volume has been improving over the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>We've seen a strong performance in Germany and in Eastern Europe. That's unusual, that again because it's one of the mature countries. Germany has been heavily impacted by the recession particularly in the industrial sector, but to some extent also in the consumer sectors as it's true for most of North America and Western Europe. Now we've seen a strong performance of our Laundry &amp; Homecare division in Germany based on innovations that we've brought to the market and our strong brands. Both our segments have been contributing to this growth that is Laundry has been positive and Homecare has been contributing to positive organic sales growth as well.</p>
          <p>Personal Care; that again is very much in line with we've experienced during the other quarters in 2009. We've seen organic sales growth in the range of 3.5, 3.4%. Now Q4 was 3.3, very much in line with the previous quarters of which 1.3 is price and 2.0 is volume and that's very much again in line with previous quarters, we've seen a very healthy mix of one-third pricing and two-thirds volume growth. So we have continued on our profitable growth path with our Cosmetics and Personal Care division throughout rest of the year with a strong finish.</p>
          <p>We've seen negative market growth in some of our relevant markets and that's particularly true of the profession, the hairdresser market. We've been able to overcompensate the negative market growth in a segment of our business by our strong performance in the retail business. So we basically picked up the volume that was missing in other areas overcompensating and ending up with a very good organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>We've seen good and strong performance in Western Europe, which is again a somewhat unusual because of the negative impact the recession has had on the mature countries. Again, it's based on our strong performance in innovations and strong brands. You'll get some more perspective on that in Hans Van Bylen's presentation. And we've continued with our strong performance in emerging markets. We have entered into particularly interesting emerging markets a while ago and we've continued our strong organic sales growth there, particularly in Eastern Europe and to some extent, in China.</p>
          <p>We started with a very difficult first half year in two Adhesives Technologies divisions. The markets have been very strongly negatively affected going into the first two quarters in 2009. Now Q4 ended up with almost zero organic sales growth compared to previous quarters. That's an enormous improvement, price plus 1.1, volume minus 1.8%. Now some of our markets have recovered and it's particularly true for the Transportation, Metal and the Electronics markets, which have recovered and therefore we've been able to have good organic sales growth, good positive organic sales growth in those markets.</p>
          <p>And as you can see, if you look at the volume evolution over the four quarters in our Adhesive division, Q1, minus 23, Q2, minus 21, so a terrible first half-year, strong improvements in Q3, minus 14, and then Q4, almost even. So that's then &#x2013; if you just look at volume, volume has picked up obviously. Q4 2008 was weaker than the previous quarters; that again has been helping. But overall we've seen a strong improvement in terms of organic sales growth and volume growth over the course of the four quarters.</p>
          <p>Total Henkel then adds up to price 0.8 plus and volume minus 0.2, with an organic sales growth of 0.6 in Q4. Taking a look at the regions, we've seen organic sales growth in Q4 in all regions except for North America. Obviously Europe, Middle East/North Africa has been helped by the emerging components in that geography. We've seen yet organic sales growth positive although just small in Western Europe and continuation of a strong organic sales growth in Eastern Europe and Middle East/North Africa. North America has continued to be negative although on a lower scale than in the previous quarters and Latin America has continued to be positive as &#x2013; throughout the whole year and Asia Pacific has come back to positive organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>Looking at the emerging countries, emerging markets, which is obviously combination of Eastern Europe, Middle East/North Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific without the mature countries in those regions. In Q4 we have seen a strong recovery compared to previous quarters, 7.6% organic sales growth, which is a sequential, strong sequential improvement over the previous quarters. Cosmetics has continued with its double-digit organic sales growth as was true in the previous quarters and it is &#x2013; has returned to high single digit growth, particularly helped obviously by the recovery in Asia.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating earnings by business sector in Q4, Laundry &amp; Homecare with pretty strong improvement in Q4 over the same period of the previous year, 260 basis points. That's obviously the highest margin that we have experienced in any single quarter. The strong performance was driven by lower input cost so that has continued help us throughout the year, particularly in the second half of the year and we have implemented strict cost control, otherwise we would not have been able to realize this very high level. That's not to say that this is the run rate for the next quarters to come, but obviously this has helped us a great deal in our finish, in our strong finish in 2009.</p>
          <p>Personal Care with plus 60 basis points in Q4. We've been on high-level &#x2013; continued on a high-level of our margin and have increased our level once again. Needless to say we've been on a profitable growth path for many quarters now and we've been able to complete the full year in Q4 with our continuation of the profitable growth path.</p>
          <p>Finally, Adhesive Technologies with an improvement of 200 basis points over f the same period of the year before. We're back at the 2008 level with 10.8% margin. We have seen pretty strong performance, which again was helped by lower input costs and strict cost control. That again &#x2013; that's the level that we've been able to achieve in the second half of last year and it's a level that we think, given the recovery that we expect for continuation in 2010 should be something that we work with.</p>
          <p>Q1 key financials '09 versus Q4 in Adhesive Technologies. Just to reiterate the speed of recovery that we have been able to experience to manage in our Adhesive Technology division. This is all adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin, 3.7 Q1, 7.2 Q2 and 10.6 in Q3. That's a pretty strong level that we've been able to manage based &#x2013; adapting our capacity, adapting our structure to the lower level of demand, obviously we're seeing downturn in sales and we've been able to manage our structure as such that we get back to the level of margin that we had before.</p>
          <p>There's one explanation for Q3 adjusted EBIT figure. We have restated the adjusted EBIT for Q3 as a result of recognizing long-term supply agreement, the write-off on a long-term supply agreement, which we had taken already in Q3, but which was not completed and therefore could not be adjusted, that's the provision for an unfavorable supplier contract that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Income statement; adjusted sales to gross profit. Gross margin improvement in Q4, 390 basis points. We still benefited from the impact from the one pricing that we have implemented in particular in Laundry and Homecare and the Adhesive division and we have successfully manage down our input cost. It's obvious that there have been some price decreases in the markets, in the raw material markets, but the price decreases do not come along automatic. So therefore, we've been managing our input cost prices aggressively down in order to get the benefit of the lower level of raw material prices that were visible in the markets. So therefore, 390 basis points improvement in our gross margin in Q4.</p>
          <p>Quick look at some of the items in our income statement. One that is noticeable is our increase in the amount of marketing, selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of sales. Now we've increased our spend by 60 basis points and that is in the phase of decreasing distribution expenses. In other words, we have increased our expenditure for marketing and selling over proportionately in order to maintain our market position.</p>
          <p>Reported to adjusted EBIT. Obviously, we've seen a number of one-time effects in Q4, which then add up to the full year, which I will show you in a moment. The one-time gains, which we have experienced in Q4 is minor amount, 6 million, which have to be added back, that's the release of a restructuring provision that we had taken earlier as part of the global excellence program that was not utilized and therefore had to be dissolved.</p>
          <p>One-time charges, there is fairly sizeable amount in terms of one-time charges, which pertain an exclusively to the Adhesive Technologies division. Basically, two groups of charges that we've taken; one is in respect of assets held for sale. We've put up a number of assets for sale which we're trying to dispose of, where we have determined that they no longer will be part of our business going forward, which requires under the applicable accounting standards that the assets be written down to their actual market value, so that's about half of it.</p>
          <p>The other is -- a write down on intangible assets which we had to take in respect of two businesses which pertain in particular to the automotive industry and the metal industry because we've seen a strong downturn in those industries. So therefore, some assets which we had recognized as part of an acquisition some years back had to be written down to their actual market value. That's basically what we had taken in Q4, there has been no impact from goodwill, write-offs, impairments or anything of that nature, we've done the regular annual goodwill impairment tests which have resulted in no write-down at all. So therefore, those were specific assets, which had to be written down.</p>
          <p>Finally, restructuring charges, the additional restructuring charges that we have taken for the Adhesive Technologies division in order to adapt a structure, adapt our structure to the business model that we're operating, the changes that we've undertaken in Q3 and Q4 have resulted in a further restructuring charge of 26 million and 21 pertain to the other divisions as normal restructuring.</p>
          <p>Now summarizing our full fiscal year results, first of all, income statement to gross profit, obviously the impact on our sales almost minus 4% as reported, that's not the organic sales growth figure. Growth &#x2013; gross margin has improved by &#x2013; 150 basis points. We have maintained, as you have seen from Q4 already, we have maintained positive impact from our own pricing. We've communicated this all along during the quarters; we've taken pricing measures in particular in Laundry &amp; Homecare and in Adhesives. We've maintained, we've had a very strong, very good impact from successful input cost management, which was partly offset by lower volumes and we've communicated the volumes in particular in the Adhesives division during the year and I've shown that again to reiterate that impact in the four quarters.</p>
          <p>Now, the negative impact from the currencies in particular from &#x2013; currencies in the emerging countries, strong impact from Russia and Ukraine for the full fiscal year while the impact from the dollar was still positive. Now dollar as an average during 2009 had a stronger impact, positive impact compared to 2008 and Q4 always negative, just to keep that in mind.</p>
          <p>Sales to adjusted EBIT; two remarks, R&amp;D and admin expenses. First R&amp;D, we have basically maintained the level of R&amp;D spend in spite of the restructuring that we had undertaken and in spite of the additional cost that we had incurred. So we basically spend a little bit more as a percentage of sales, 10 basis points more in terms of R&amp;D. We've maintained our high level of R&amp;D spend as an absolute amount, it has increased as you can see over the prior year period. As many expenses have been increasing slightly, National Starch has been included in 2009 only for nine months, so therefore as a negative basis impact from the National Starch structures, which we have managed down, we have also a negative impact from currencies, particularly the U.S. currency that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Reported to adjusted EBIT, that's just reiterating the communication that we've undertaken during the year. Nothing new I've shown you the numbers for Q4, which then add up to one-time charges of 134, restructuring charges of 159. So that's just adding the Q4 numbers on top of the one through nine numbers in 2009; adjusted EBIT therefore 1.364 billion down by minus 6.6%.</p>
          <p>Cash flow. Major impact, major focus for us in 2009 has been on cash flow generation. As it became clear during the first half of the year that our operating earnings would be under pressure, that we would have to react to the pressure from the markets. We've put up enormous efforts in order to generate free cash flow to basically reduce our net debt further basically targeting an amount of between 900 million and 1 billion free cash flow in order to be able to reduce our debt.</p>
          <p>Now with the expected operating earnings that we had targeted as part of our budget, that was not possible, so therefore other means had to be taken in order to improve our cash flow situation. We've communicated during the year that we've undertaken a number of measures in order to improve our cash flow situation amongst which was strict cost control, it was also managing our investment budget to the level that was sustainable. And finally, strong impact was to be expected from managing our net working capital.</p>
          <p>And as you can see here, change in net working capital, we've generated more than 600 million cash flow from increasing our focus on net working capital, systematic net working capital reduction program delivering results into 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, all businesses have been contributing to this effort. It was a true joint effort by the whole company, managed by a small team of all businesses involved in the functions.</p>
          <p>And that's our history over the past six, seven years. If you look at where we started out in 2009 with almost 20% net working capital or cash net working capital as a percentage of sales, we had reached a level of 11.7 in 2008, and now it's 7.8. So that's what we have been able to improve our management position. That's been a great help. Had we started this program in 2007 or '08, we would not have been able to generate this amount of free cash flow. That has helped us to generate basically more than 1 billion free cash flow, compared to the year before. And that's visible in the last line. Free cash flow, more than 1 billion generated compared to the previous year. And free cash flow, which helped obviously great deal in managing down our net debt.</p>
          <p>And that's how it worked. As it became apparent in the middle of the year that we were on the wrong -- in the wrong direction, increasing our net debt, we've established strong program to reduce net debt, to increase cash flow. And the result at the end of the year has been exceeding our own expectations. We've been able to reduce our net debt compared to the end of last year by almost &#x20AC;1 billion. That's obviously a combination of many actions, combination of many people contributing, with a strong impact from the systematic net working capital reduction.</p>
          <p>Update on our restructuring measures. First of all, how did we end up with our global excellence program? We have basically finalized our program in the sense that we have announced all measures. Everybody knows now how and when he's affected and where he's affected. We ended up 2009 with 133 million of savings. That, again, has been exceeding our expectations of initially 100, then 125 million, yet again 133 million savings for the full year 2009. We expect to be able to generate the remainder of the savings pretty easily because, as I mentioned, we have basically implemented all programs, and therefore, it's just a matter of time to get the remainder of the savings of more than 150 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>National Starch, a similar picture. We have increased our efforts, we have accelerated program in order to realize savings earlier, faster and more. So therefore, we ended up 2009 with 160 million of savings, final Q4 of 55 million. Realization of savings is ahead of our plan. Initially, the plan was 150 million. 2010, therefore, will generate another around about 225. So the difference 75 million will be generated from additional measures, some of which have been implemented already, and we expect to be able to pretty much finalize our program again, in 2010, with the full amount of savings to be generated in 2011.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the outlook, I will hand over back to Kasper Rorsted.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. Looking back, we have the opinion that we have done and made substantial progress on the course we set ourselves out on. We've spoken about it today. We're well ahead when it comes to National Starch integration. We are consolidating the focus, the revenue and the profits from a few of our leading brands. Hans will speak about that in more detail from our Cosmetics division. We further optimized our cost structures and we have strictly strengthened our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We've made strong progress in our relationship to our customers and also strengthened our position when it comes to sustainability in CSR, not just to be better citizens, but also to be more competitive. And we've spend substantial amount of time on strengthening our global team that's become more diverse, more international, and also younger as we've spent effort on promoting people from within the organization. When I look to 2010, one of the things that we have our eyes fixed on, of course, long-term is where we're going to get in 2012.</p>
          <p>But in 2010, it's further strengthening our leading brands, meaning making our company more or less -- less complex. We continue to develop our growth regions, and that means over proportionally investing where growth in revenue and profit is coming from and -- quote, unquote -- "under" investing other regions and moving cost structures from West to East or South. Continue to exercise strict cost control to ensure that our cost base will become more competitive. Further improve our financial ratios that we put on the table. Intensify our relationship management and business development with our large customers. We're not just going there to have a cup of coffee; we're going there to ensure that we create a win-win scenario.</p>
          <p>And within -- as one of the elements, within our team, continue our efforts for a pay for performance system, meaning over rewarding those who are doing a good job and rewarding those who are not doing a good job less. We have put that in focus on the last two years and that will continue to be a focus for us in 2010. We see 2010 as being an important step forward towards our targets for 2012, and we believe that we've taken a number of decisions in the right direction. But doing your housework -- your homework one day doesn't mean that you don't go to school. The next day, you get new homework. So we are well ahead that we have a set of challenges ahead of us that we need to address.</p>
          <p>What are our expectations looking forward? We do see positive GDP growth for 2010. According to theory, there was a growth of 1.9 in 2008, decline of minus 2.1 in 2009 and an expectation of 2.8 in 2010. This is, of course, always a danger of averages because as you can see transportation, machinery and electronics while they're all forecasted to be positive, the numbers are all smaller than the clients in 2008. So we are still operating in a very fragile and volatile environment where we believe that consolidation or stabilization is underway, but we also believe that we are far away from having a strong growth back into the industry across-the-board.</p>
          <p>How do we articulate our guidance? When it comes to organic sales growth, we believe from our Home and Personal Care and our Adhesives division that we'll outperform our markets, meaning Henkel will also outperform the markets we conduct business in. Adjusted EBIT for Home and Personal Care, a slight improvement over what we have. And Adhesive Technologies, substantial improvement, but that is of course also taking a very challenging first quarter and somewhat challenging second quarter into account. So the comparables we are trying to get are, of course, compared to a very, very challenging first quarter. That means for Henkel a noticeable improvement of 10 points plus for the adjusted EBIT margin and subsequent for EPS.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over briefly to Lothar Steinebach who will give you additional guidance on some financial items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We've provided some most specific items and some items in the past, and we'll do that again for 2010. We expect EBIT corporate, excluding restructuring, to end up similar to what we have experienced in the past, between 60 and 80 million negative. Financial results on a similar level as 2009, minus 190. There's obviously an upside potential in interest rates or a downside potential or risk in interest rates and an upside potential in the level of debt.</p>
          <p>Restructuring charges, we expect that to be at a more normal, a higher level of 100 to 120 million. Tax rates will be down, back to the normal level, 26 to 27%. Minorities should be again at a level that we have experienced in the past of minus 30. CapEx, a similar level that we have achieved, between 350 and 380. So we'll be managing again tightly our investment budget. Net working capital as a percentage of sales in the high single-digit ratio. So the end of 2009 is not the ratio that we expect for the full year. So I expect another improvement compared to the end of 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Which brings me to the close of this session, before I hand over to Hans.</p>
          <p>We see 2010 as being a challenging year. And I would like to stress that, again, we see 2010 to be a challenging year. We believe that based on a number of decisions we've taken in 2009 and, of course, execution of those decisions, we are better prepared and better positioned going into '10, significantly better than going into '09. And as said, during every call, during the last two years we will continue to adapt our structures to changing market environments, meaning we're looking proactively into our structures to ensure that we remain competitive in our structures. To address any questions that will come on this topic, we are still committed to our financial targets for 2012.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the end of my presentation. I'd like to hand over to Hans Van Bylen, who will speak about our cosmetics business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kasper. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. I would now like to use the upcoming half hour to share with you my thoughts on the performance and strategy priorities of our Cosmetics business. Doing so, I first of all would like to share with you, how we define cosmetics, and which is the profile of our cosmetics business in Henkel. Then, following to talk about the performance of the last year and the years before, and then closing with looking at, which priorities do we follow in order to secure actual performance.</p>
          <p>Our Cosmetics business is an exciting one in a way that's now also since two years now in spite of currency, disadvantages we have now more than 3 billion sales. We have some very unique category expertise. We have leading market positions and a portfolio of very strong brands. We have since year's now significant market share wins and for those who work together with me in Hamburg now more than four years ago, I am pretty sure that all of you will follow me in saying that we went through some quite dynamic transformation in this business.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics of course is a quite a large industry and when we talk about cosmetics in Henkel, we talk about four categories. I think this is quite important as a definitional point of view. Cosmetic business in total as you know is more than 190 billion meanwhile. We are active in four markets, two single one, which are the biggest, which is hair and body. And in hair, we're active in all segments, being retail and professional and within these businesses also in all segments, colorants, styling and care.</p>
          <p>Body care in our definition is soaps, bath, shower and deodorants. In skin care, this is face creams and cleansing, and oral care for us is toothpaste. So later on when I will show market shares and I talk about active markets, it's always these markets also, which we buy, it's also this markets are our universal.</p>
          <p>Within these markets, we have very strong regional positions. We are, for example, in Europe, the number three player, later on you will see the shares. The strong number three player, getting stronger. We, meanwhile having two of the three categories the number two position, namely in coloration and in styling. And last year, we conquered the number three position in care in Europe.</p>
          <p>In professional and salon business, we are the number three player worldwide. Body care, number four in Europe, number three in North America, meanwhile. Skin, number three respective or number four in Europe.</p>
          <p>These are average market shares, which of course mean that within the shares, we have some specific highlights. Germany, for example, we are a very strong market leader, and we are very proud to say that this market leadership has been further strengthened. We reached, last year, the number one position in the businesses, which I mentioned in Eastern Europe. We're now the number one player in Eastern Europe, and on-brand level, we are the market leader with Palette on brand level in coloration in Europe. Taft is the market leader on brand level in Europe in styling and since acquisition, we managed to dial up to the number two brand in personal cleansing in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Coming to brands, we have as Kasper already showed you, the three top brands, which make nearly 75% of our business and the top 10 brands, marked up to nearly 90% of our business. This is very concentrated portfolio, on which of course, meaning also that we have huge brand equities on our power brands.</p>
          <p>The most easy way to show brands and to show innovation is not talking about them, but shortly showing them. And that's why I would like to invite you to coming 4.5 minutes to share with me the top brands innovation, which we offer in cosmetics.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement]</p>
          <p>So let's now look with this portfolio, brand innovation how we have been doing. We updated our strategies some years ago, putting much more focus into it and I think the word focus is the most important in the strategy.</p>
          <p>First of all we focused on organic growth. We did not rely on any external growth, but purely took up the challenge to say want to grow internally. With much more focus to regional expansion, I will come to it later, and focus on our core competencies. A very decisive element has been to put much more effort on our innovation offensive and also to support our brands much stronger, financing this by making our cost structures by far more competitive and continuously building on excellent people.</p>
          <p>This strategy, up to 2008, brought us to a completely new level of top-line growth. From 2006 onwards we have been growing by far more than market average. And not only the top line was quite significantly improved, also in bottom line. We turned our margin to profitable growth, consistently building further on our margin. What is important our margin although is the quality of our margin and on this one we have been paying a lot of attention. If we talk about sustainable margin, we talk about continuously improving our gross profits, bringing our SG&amp;A down and then investing far more in marketing, so that as well EBIT margin as marketing investment can be improved, and by this growing more than the market.</p>
          <p>This we have been doing. Here you see the results of 2008. We had average growth of 5%, again above market, increasing our EBIT margin, also our capital return and also look at net working capital, bring it below 10%. And within the mix of the margin, I can tell you in '05, SG&amp;A was still bigger in percentage of sales than marketing. In '08, it was significantly the inverse.</p>
          <p>But then as Kasper already has been talking about, 2009 and we saw already of course, and the second half of '08 came quite significant crisis and also cosmetic markets have been hit quite significantly. The recession in the cosmetic markets again started second half '08, but with a huge acceleration in '09. And some markets in which we operate were significantly hit. Hairdresser market already has been commented up on, but also some retail markets in which we operate, taking for example the hair, the retail markets, some segments like hairstyling had significant downward trends.</p>
          <p>We also have seen major changes in consumer behavior, not only meaning that consumers only look at price. And this for us is a quite a nice challenge to get as close as possible to consumers and to know what's going on in crisis times, and of course also hit by crisis. We of course, have to face mounting pressure from our partner retails.</p>
          <p>Markets, which are not growing anymore, of course leads to crawling out competition and the surrounding in which we operates is of course clearly indicated by aggressive prices. We see promotion intensity exploding, some offers even getting quite fierce. At the same time we see media investing -- media investment just keeping up on a high level. And in some market, and this is quite scattered, we also see further growth of private labels. An exception in this, for example, has been Germany where we saw even a slight downward trend.</p>
          <p>Within this environment we are extremely proud to show that we have been doing by far better than the market. 3.5% organic growth in the markets in which we are, if we weight them to the importance of our business, has been a negative environment, meaning we have been performing by far better than the market. We have been improving gross profit further. We brought our costs down and we invest again more in marketing budget. EBIT margin was 12.9 on an all time 40 basis points more against the market trends. Return on capital increased, and I think with the net working capital below 5%, we are in our industry getting quite on a benchmark level.</p>
          <p>Having a top-line which is better than market, of course, means we have been winning shares. What I now would like to share with you now is our market shares in the markets in which we operate, total Europe again the definitions as I indicated before. This was our market share development up to 2008. I still wait a few seconds to show you '09, because I know in some reports I read, sometimes we say Henkel has been winning in the crisis because of its value assortment. What I would like to indicate here is that also before crisis, we were on the winning hand and if you see compare to our 4B competitors, in fact in the markets in which we operate, we were the only company winning consistently market share.</p>
          <p>And within the crisis, we even accelerated our growth in market share, coming up to 11.3 share. We even see November, December the last period, meaning also that being a number four in all those markets in Europe, the gap to number two and number three is getting quite narrow.</p>
          <p>The market which is for us the more significant one, the hair market, here you see the same picture. Up to 2008, quite significant market share. You see '06, 20 basis point going to 60 going to 80 and a full point in '09. And I also invite you to look at the November, December numbers where you see that also the trend has been ongoing positively year into year. And also in this market, we are extremely proud to see that in fact we are the company which is winning the shares.</p>
          <p>We see the same in hair care. Again what you saw before was hair total which is a combination of all the three segments. In hair care, last year we improved one capital position as you can see we moved up to number three in hair care. And again you also look at November, December. So a good year ending also in shares meaning that we have the positive trend still continuing.</p>
          <p>And the last picture on market share in styling namely, we took over the number two position in category in '07 and we have since then been reinforcing this position, also here in November, December, an all-time high. When I took over a few years ago this business, we put market share quite strongly in focus and we set up a system that each time we have an all time high, we have some party on it and I can tell you it's getting quite bad for the health looking at the numerous parties which indeed we could celebrate.</p>
          <p>Summarizing this performance I would like to state again that we had strong top-line, out-growing the markets. We had several record market shares. We have also -- and that's important for our home country being able to increase our market leadership. We have been further improving our high margin against the market trend. Lothar talked about several quarters of profitable growth, and meanwhile, these are 16, hence we saw the cash net working capital performance at an all time low being lower than 5%.</p>
          <p>Of course, our challenge now is to continue this performance and that's why I would also like to share with you which strategy we will follow and which are our key points in order to be able to further continue this development.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is quite sound, that's also why we would like to pursue the strategy. We do not see any major indication whether that we need some change on this. But what we of course do see is that in a market which is getting ever more competitive, we do want to focus even more on being fast, being aggressive and even being more flexible. And the difference is also made by the team, which I represent, which is also there not only with their mind with also with their heart. We have a huge commitment of the people working in this business.</p>
          <p>Some points illustrating also what Kasper has been illustrating, and I think this presentation then can also add on what the indication of Kasper said 2010, starting with our focused portfolio. What is very important in our portfolio, both the aspects of brands and the aspects of the regions.</p>
          <p>Looking at our geographical exposure, we are committed and we also will grow further in mature markets. And we also think it is possible to grow further in mature markets. That would mean that indeed we want to further continue our growth momentum in market share in Europe and want to further leverage our strong positions in North America.</p>
          <p>Last week I shared with my teams some huge studies, which we did on combining demographics insights in how consumer behaving these days and also some in-depth interviews, and I must state, overwhelming to see, which kind of potentials we still also see in mature markets if we are able to identify the right trends.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets now also since years in a row a double-digit development, but we know we have to even get stronger there, as we -- as I indicated being market leader now in Eastern Europe, we want to continue this profitable growth path. But also we have strong good leading positions in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, North Africa on which we won't further expand.</p>
          <p>Of course, we know with the 3 billion which we have, we cannot play everywhere and also we do not want to play everywhere. But we have a concept that's that where we play we want to win and that's shows our strategy. We identify in these regions, those countries where we will be able to further win.</p>
          <p>The second aspect of portfolio is our brand portfolio, a category portfolio here we also continue to put even more emphasis on our top brands. The local brands which we have, we combine them and this is a concept which also, which star has been presenting to you with the brand clustering, that we use the equity of the local brand, but we use the synergies of the global brands.</p>
          <p>Two examples on this chart, <mark type="inaudible" /> acquired a strong brand with a lot of local touch to local consumers in Scandinavia, completing the same formula, innovation, packaging production site as far meaning we've all synergy but we use the local brand equity.</p>
          <p>Theramed, our international toothpaste brand, Licor del Polo quite strong brand in Spain, number two in number two in Oral care and also here identical package identity program, same production side we have all the synergies.</p>
          <p>As you have seen, we are active in four big categories. You have seen our positions, by definition we still have a lot of white spots, which we can conquer. Conquering white spots is of course quite challenging, and we're identify those we can conquer. We have quite some action plans to show the progress on this.</p>
          <p>And part of strong brands of course is cleaning our portfolio, and we have been doing quite a lot already, but of course we will continue cleaning up some marginal positions leveraging even more on our top brands.</p>
          <p>Innovation leadership, in my view one of the most decisive elements in making our market shares further developing. And of course, also here we have committed to further out innovate competition. We have a very clear process. I would show to you in a minute, but I think the secret, which for us, is I think quite convincing is that we managed to have both in fact the contradiction between discipline and creativity together.</p>
          <p>We call it disciplined creativity. We have fantastic people with the most crazy ideas, which you can imagine, but we have a huge discipline in being fast in the market and being committed to bring at least two big innovations will allow our top brands per year.</p>
          <p>We have innovation rates above 40% even making us quite strong on this field. R&amp;D, we do not have in absolute numbers, the biggest budget but we have an extremely focused budgets and we have a system in which we only work on projects in which we identified significant business potential.</p>
          <p>And a very distinguishing element for us is that we are extremely fast from idea to being the market, if needed meanwhile we can be from a good idea to being in a market in a period of six months only.</p>
          <p>The process which has been presented to you several -- at several occasions I suppose, what is important here is of course that idea generation has different sources, but what I would like to stress today is the end part, which is the steering.</p>
          <p>We meanwhile have installed tracking of our launches, which is extremely sharp and which is extremely independent, because in our business you know after a few weeks whether you have a hit or not. And then the secret is to continue investing to invest even more, but also to stop investing.</p>
          <p>And I think there we meanwhile have quite optimized a lot and we are quite flexible in investing in a way that if we see something working, we put more money behind, but also if and it also happens in our life, something is not working we clearly stop.</p>
          <p>Looking at trends and also trends and potential in crisis times, what is important in our profession, cosmetics, is to anticipate quite early trends. What we see for example is that in crisis it's not only price, we also see for example that people meanwhile consumers look back for easy things, what we call the new puristic. Syoss is perfectly in this trend, Igora also in professional. People also look more and more for offers, which bring really more than normal performance, high performance, tough power you've seen, 10-minute coloration.</p>
          <p>A huge trend in cosmetics, cosmetics is healthier for me and here with the sustainability background, which is really in our D&amp;A. In our company of course we have a huge pipeline, we have a huge ideas how to be extremely successful in this trend. We have the sale of pampering generation. We will now be the first one bringing the smoothness, which you all know for the drink industry, we will be in the shower gel industry.</p>
          <p>Another trend is of course that we all know the future belongs to female, men try to come back using cosmetics. Maintenance is a huge trend and also we will participate. Hence I think demographics show that there is a huge market for anti-aging, we call it much more positively the new young.</p>
          <p>Coming so to brand equity, because of course this huge innovation ideas will be nothing without the power of strong brands. We will concentrate further on our top brands. We will leverage our mega brand Schwarzkopf, will continue its sachets.</p>
          <p>We work extremely disciplined to enhance sustainable brand values. And I hope you agree with me that if you look at our assortment in our commercials today on which you saw four minutes view that in design and in communication we made a huge quantum lead forward and that meanwhile especially also in design we have more than state-of-the-art.</p>
          <p>We are quite leading in new media, when you saw the overview I showed you. Perhaps, you noticed that for got2b there was no commercial in it. And that is simply because we do not have a commercial for got2b.</p>
          <p>Got2b is a brand which meanwhile is a leading styling brand for young people, which we purely manage through digital media and this gives us of course a lot of insights and is also a lot of for us encouraging to further work on this path.</p>
          <p>And excellence also for us we strive to be in the way to go to the market together with our partner retailers. Schwarzkopf, it has been the growth engine for our business since years now and also has been growing in spite of a quite difficult professional business in '09.</p>
          <p>A brand making 1.7 billion turnover being the single biggest Henkel brands. We have 80 positions -- single positions on the country level, leading positions in hair worldwide. We just received it last week, 10 times in a row, we got the most trusted brand title for hair.</p>
          <p>Persil also got it for detergent. We won last year quite prestigious awards, the Deustche marketing prize and last year some of you know we have been celebrating also quite innovative 111 years existence of Schwarzkopf. And this also helped us to show to all our partners what we are able to do.</p>
          <p>We've put a huge program on this towards consumers, towards retailers, towards also our hair brushes, beauty brush and also to our own people, and I must say through this event we managed again to bring Schwarzkopf together with Syoss again in growth and also in professional, we have the year which was far better than market development. In professional last year, we were able to strengthen our market shares.</p>
          <p>Dial, since acquisition, a very strong brand, we have build up to number two personal cleanse in U.S. three years in a row we're now with more than double-digit growth. We expanded Dial successfully into new categories, Dial when we bought it was a soap brand to solid soap brand and meanwhile we have strong positions in shower gel.</p>
          <p>We leveraged all our competence, which we have in Europe on shower gel to this boasting market in U.S. Now we're very proud to say that as well in '08 as in '09 we had the best innovation, the number one product launch in the personal cleansing category. And then Syoss, a brand which we have been building up from nothing to a top brand from scratch within in fact less than one year.</p>
          <p>It is Europe's most successful cosmetics launch. We have in checking hair data it is the most successful launch in hair since 10 years. And if you look at official the data in Germany, retail together with drug stores, we have the best fast moving consumer goods launch of the last two years in the whole industry. Significant market share, in short time, significant market positions meanwhile we are out in 25 countries and meanwhile also we launched Style in end of the year and I already can talk on it today because we are delivering it since now. We also are now launching coloration with Syoss so that we can &#x2013; eight, second media platform on here next to Schwarzkopf.</p>
          <p>Operational excellence as I have been indicating, we invest by far more than our brands and this we financed by getting much more effective. If you now look back to the last four years what we have been doing on complexity, we have been reducing the number of variance in our businesses 36%, we have 20% less different packagings, and we have 20% less raw materials because meanwhile we worked on platforms informers and we adapt according to the concepts. But of course in complexity reduction, the most challenging part is the prevention of the building up of the new complexity and that's also why we have disciplined structures there and we meanwhile also work enormously on promotion and displaced organization.</p>
          <p>Production also this I think is common knowledge meanwhile we managed the 3 billion business with eight production locations meaning that our output per production side is quite competitive and we are extremely strict in costs and we will stay so.</p>
          <p>Customer focus last year as Kasper indicated, the customer all of us in the three divisions have been working very hard to even get close to our customers. We identified growth potential together with the top customers. And we share a lot of category expertise which we have with our customers. We look also with our customer's two trends, two consumer behavior. For example, in Hair business, we train customers, we trained people which will &#x2013; who work in point of sale of our customer and we also help in category development.</p>
          <p>And also myself, like my colleagues, we have been putting a lot of energy in going to the customer and sharing with them our business perspectives. All these would not be possible without &#x2013; there are people in board, but having the right people in board is one thing, the other responsibility which we have is to take care that we have an extremely efficient organization. And in this respect, I think our size is a huge advantage in a way that we have an organization, which is extremely fast with extreme clear decision-making procedures and with very clear responsibility and also accountability.</p>
          <p>We believe a lot in diversity, we also do a lot on diversity. We have within cosmetics by extremely high share of female managers, but diversity is not only about male-female, it's also about different cultures but also about different personalities. And we are more than convinced that difference of opinion at the end leads to much better creativity and leads to excellence.</p>
          <p>We are installing much more in-depth and we are working on this permanently performance culture like Kasper indicated with also the emotional element, the passion for winning and the single biggest time investment which I make together with my top management team is people. We invest a lot of time in developing talent, taking care of our people and also developing them to be ready for the next phase. This strategy makes us confident that especially together with the emotional commitment and the passion of the team which in fact I represent will be able &#x2013; that we will be able to pursue the success which now we have been witnessing, and that's based on this strategy. We will be able to especially to contribute to the part of Henkel's vision to make life more beautiful, not only consumers' life, but also shareholders' life.</p>
          <p>And in order to make your life a little bit more beautiful, as you know, perhaps you've seen it in the chart, we have made for the 111 years celebration. We made &#x2013; we developed quite an impressive book on which we put in our vision on hair, also the love which we have for hair and also some nice stories on hair. And all of this was based on our 111 anniversary of Schwarzkopf, and that's why I would now be like to close with sharing with you what 111 years of Schwarzkopf means in advance. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome back from <mark type="inaudible" />, we continue now with our Q&amp;A session. Before we do that, I would like to remind you and ask you that for the benefit of the whole ordinance of -- benefit of the whole audience, you should state your name and the name of your company before your raise your question. So please go ahead. Who is first? Mr. Gr&#xFC;ten.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lutz Gr&#xFC;ten, Kepler Capital Markets. Two questions from my side. In 2009, you've benefited from lower raw material cost. Could you quantify what that benefit was and what is your expectation on raw material cost for 2010? And the second question is on the financials. You've mentioned that there was no impairment of good will in 2009. Now assuming that the interest charges, interest rates will go up in 2010, what is your expectation for potential impairment in 2010 or could you give us some sensitivities on exchange interest rates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, with respect to lower input cost, obviously, we always call it raw materials, but it's not only raw materials, it's packaging, it's also traded quotes and contract manufacturing. So the whole piece of it, we've communicated that we would expect an impact of the low mid single-digits in the positive impact in '09. And similarly, we're now expecting negative impact of the low single-digits mid-teen -- mid single-digit I should say, so around 5% plus in 2010 compared to 2009. That's all average versus average for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now just to add some perspective on the positive impact from input prices, we've had severe negative from currencies, which was particularly true in the emerging countries in Eastern Europe as a matter of fact in our -- sorry, in the laundry and homecare division, the negative impact from currencies was almost equal to the positive from the input price deflation. So therefore there's some perspective needed assuming that we're not going to incur another negative from currencies in 2010. We should not have too much of a negative from the lack of lower input prices in 2010.</p>
          <p>In terms of impairment and interest rates, when you look into our annual report, you'll notice that we've lowered our cost of capital because interest rates are down or have been down. Obviously, we maintain our cost of capital basically for the full year. So we review it also in fall and we set the cost of capital then based on deviations or changes in interest rates. So therefore, looking into 2010, the cost of capital is lower. So therefore initially, there'll be a bigger buffer in terms of potential impairments than what we had in 2009.</p>
          <p>We had a sufficient buffer; it would not been just at the edge of an impairment. That is also due to the fact that goodwill is an item that is obviously from acquisitions. So therefore, only the businesses that are impacted by acquisitions have a significant amount of goodwill and therefore, pose questions in respect of impairments.</p>
          <p>The next item to be observed is that we group the acquired businesses into our existing businesses. So therefore, the so-called cash generating unit, which is the basis for the impairment test is composed of existing businesses and acquired businesses.</p>
          <p>Just as an example, in our National Starch acquisition, which is basically two different, separate businesses, one is the packaging adhesive business, the other, electronic materials. So the existing Henkel packaging adhesive business, which was of a similar magnitude as the acquired business, obviously then is grouped together as cash generating unit, and therefore provides significant buffer against impairment.</p>
          <p>Looking then at the next item, the adhesive -- the electronic materials, there again we had an existing Henkel business and the acquired business and what we have seen, I think is a significant improvement in the electronic materials business in the fourth quarter. So therefore we do expect that will be more positive in 2010, significantly more positive in 2010, than 2009.</p>
          <p>All this together with a lower interest rate basically, initially, and I should also mention that the interest rates that are pertinent in this case are long-term interest rates, not short-term interest rates. And we're right now looking at risks or changes, potential changes in short-term interest rates.</p>
          <p>So for 2010 we basically do not expect any problems from potential impairments, basically because our business should improve, that's our expectation. Interest rate will be lower basically, initially, as in 2009. And we had buffers, which then should prevent any impairment from materializing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was not aware that you've lowered the cost of capital end of 2009. If you would have not done so, would there have been an impairment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the impairment test that was performed was based on the old cost of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next is Alex Smith [Nomura] and then Susanne Seibel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, just one clarification on that input cost guidance. Are you saying there is a low mid-single-digit benefit last year, which will move into the low-single-digit headwind in 2010? Okay. Then moving on to <mark type="inaudible" /> still just trying to understand the EBIT growth guidance you provided, which is the 10% plus. Looking in the context of Q4, that performance, I mean growth in Q4 was up 12%, but you had a 5% headwind from currency.</p>
          <p>And you could argue if you adjust for the one-off cost savings Q4 '08, the underlying will exit, growth rate was actually very strong, I mean possibly up to 20%. So I'm trying to understand why you're guiding to such a slowdown? Is it just prudent guidance or other moving parts, notwithstanding the input cost movements which I can now appreciate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know whether it's prudent guidance or not, but if you look upon 2010, there is couple of indicators that are still a worry to us. One is, as Lothar spoke about, the increase in raw materials, which is significant. The second part is that we've seen a stabilization in our industrial sector in the second half. We're not seeing a strong pickup. And I think that was what I was trying to indicate in my presentation.</p>
          <p>We are now expecting a great pickup in the global economy in 2010. We are expecting a stabilization. And if you look upon how the quarters were in 2009, actually there is significant difference between first half and second half. So when you average it out, then it's different, but when you come to Q4 &#x2013; third quarter, forth quarter, you actually start getting in a very stable environment.</p>
          <p>And when we speak to our customers, the level of transparency they are providing on guidance is really low. And as also indicated, 34 million additional unemployed people will have an impact on consumer spending. So you might view it as prudent, we actually think that 2010 will continue to be a very challenging year with, as I said, headwind, with raw material cost coming against us and also a slower recovery than I think a lot of people are expecting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Susanne Seibel from Barclays Capital. My question ties in actually very much with Alex's and Luther's question and might develop this subject a little bit further. And my question refers to the pricing. The pricing that you are intending, going into 2010 and that will certainly also have an impact, A, on your growth and also on your gross margin expansion. Going back to the subject that was discussed on gross margin expansion, we've seen the 150 basis points and could you please give us an indication how much of that was driven by cost efficiencies and cost savings?</p>
          <p>And my second question regarding the financials, you've given a guidance of 190 million, which was sort of in line with 2009. However, you have reduced your net debt by 1 billion. How does that tie together? Yes, we all know that interest rates are probably going to go up, but it sounds extremely conservative. And &#x2013; but it might well be that you have projects in the pipeline that justify the debt level to go up again. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suggest we ask the heads of our different businesses just to give an overview on pricing, pricing sensitivity in the market and then go back to Lothar. So starting with you, Thomas, on the industrial side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been on the pricing pressure recently as the raw material prices have decreased in Q3 and Q4 as you would imagine. And if we talk about tailwind of pricing, we &#x2013; on raw material pricing, we talk about demand that we made out of doing a proper job on front-end pricing versus purchasing prices. And that will continue into 2010 obviously. We have not had strong price competition to date, and we have always followed the policy that we will not lead price competition in the market and that's what &#x2013; that's going to be our policy also going into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Laundry &amp; Home Care is concerned, we have been successful in mid-2008 to increase our prices on a worldwide scale. We have also been able to keep our price level in 2009. And as far as 2010 is concerned, I do believe the environment will be tough and aggressive. I do not expect significant opportunities for general price increase, but what I do believe that based on innovation and based on intelligent mix, we should at least partly be able to ease the material price increase in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Comments concerning cosmetics, I think in the cosmetic industry two elements play a big role in pricing. One is of course the innovation rate and as long as we're able to put innovation in market with additional value, this can contribute positively. On the other hand, what we see also in this cosmetics industry is a tendency to much more promotional intensity. I also indicated in my chart with carrying out of competition, up to now our strategy has been clearly innovation and more brand investments. If I now see how nervous the market is and also how nervous some of our competitors are, there could be a tendency of companies buying market share and then of course also depending on the effects we will have to react correspondingly if needed, which we did not know up to now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all in terms of gross margin expansion, the 150 basis points, as I mentioned there are a number of impact on gross margin expansion, which is pricing, cost savings and a negative from lower capacity utilization compared to the previous year. Now we had undertaken in the past an attempt to identify the various components and allocate the respective percentages. We're not particularly happy with the result so far. There are so much variations, changes in mix, so that we currently do not have that differentiation. We do obviously provide the data in terms of what is the cost savings or the low input costs, but we've not broken it down to the gross margin level.</p>
          <p>Finally, financials 2010, based on lower net debt level for the time being, we do not expect the net debt level to be much lower than what we have experienced. There is obviously an upside if we would be able to generate, again a miraculous amount of free cash flow as we've done in 2009. So therefore the level will not be significantly lower.</p>
          <p>However this doesn't mean that we are intending to invest into external growth. We currently do not anticipate any significant acquisition. The other element that needs to be taken into account is that we have fixed our U.S. dollar denominated debt in the course of last year. So we've locked in a level of interest rates, which therefore will continue to persist during the full course of 2010. And therefore interest rates are pretty much similar to what we have experienced in the second half of last year. So both together, not a significantly lower level of net debt and interest rates, which have been locked in is our expectation for financial result.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Who's next? Mr. Gulpers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Marco Gulpers from ING. Two questions on the adhesives business. First could you highlight and update on the number of factory closures that you embarked upon in 2009. And how much there is still to go?</p>
          <p>The second is could you update us on Q4 on capacity utilization levels? And then two follow-up questions. The first is basically on pension costs going forward. We saw a little bit of an increase in 2009 to 161 million, do you see that reverse in 2010?</p>
          <p>And the other question is, which of the leading brands that were not yet reaching the two times organic growth. You mentioned seven out of 10. What are the other three? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the manufacturing footprint consolidation that we announced in 2008, we have a total of 40 manufacturing sites that we have announced to close and out of these 40s, we have shut down completely before the end of last year, of 2009, 30. So there is still 10, which are announced and where we have the process to consolidating them. With respect to capacity utilization, it differs obviously through the continents. In Europe, with &#x2013; we have a technical capacity utilization in the last quarter, which is roughly just shy 50% and we aim at one between 60 and 70 to be the ideal one to look after.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add on the facilities. It is of course unrealistic to believe that one facility is comparable to another facility. So when we put a number out, it is a number, but it doesn't mean that one number is comparable to the next. What you're setting out though is that we are working and making significant progress in our overall capacity in the market. And also locations in the market and that will continue to be in the focus in order to drive fixed cost down.</p>
          <p>As it relates to leading brands seven out of 10 are meeting the criteria. Over time of course we expect all of them to contribute. You will, over a given period of time, always have fluctuation in that. And some also grows than 2X that &#x2013; so we're not trying to aggregate that, we're actually looking one by one. And depending on market conditions, we will overtime of course have fluctuation. We've not disclosing the past which one, how different brands perform and we will not disclose that item, this we believe that's internal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to pension cost, we have a detailed description in annual report to which I would refer you, we do not expect significant changes there in 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions, please. First on your personal care business relative to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you keep your hand up? Where are you sitting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your personal care business relative to some of your peers relatively under represented in Asia Pacific and Latin America in particular. Have you any bolder plans there to readdress that balance given the growth from those regions in the next five, 10, 15 years?</p>
          <p>And second question is on adhesives, your margin in Q4 practically didn't move versus Q3, not withstanding a much better volume dynamic, albeit it still negative. Is that simply raw materials and packaging costs or is there anything else that we should be thinking about there. The last question is on your overall adhesive margins. You mentioned at the end of 2009, your margins are back at 2008 levels. If I look at your peers, in fact most of your peers, they are significantly above '08 levels. In fact your closest peer in terms of product group is I think of a similar margin to you guys, notwithstanding, you are much bigger in scale and have a significant cost program ongoing, what am I missing on that one? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just on a company standpoint start on the acquisition strategy and then hand over to Hans Van Bylen. Today we have 38% of our business coming from the emerging countries, that is in line of most of our competitors. And what's important for us is not to be in every country, but to be strong in the countries where we're in.</p>
          <p>It's clear with the balance sheet that we've had in 2008 and 2009 and with the aim retaining our A rating, there has been very little room for acquisitions. And in that context, we have also kept ourselves away from acquisitions. So it does not mean that there are no acquisition targets. But overall our position is strong when it comes to emerging market. And I think it's better to our quality than just acquire for the sake of the acquiring. Hans, do you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me add on specifics, which you asked on, Asia Pacific and Latin America, as I said before we have some selective strong points on which we further want to get on, as Kasper said, it's about organic growth. And interesting in overall -- you can differentiate between our professional and our retail business.</p>
          <p>Our professional business to enter countries, the risk profile is by far less because it's a very sales driven business. And meanwhile, if you look at Asia, if you look at Latin America, we are quite well represented in those -- in both the regions. We have initiated a few years ago quite a strong start in China, we're in India. So Thailand for example, Schwarzkopf is the only company, which gives education to hairdressers, which meanwhile is officially acknowledged as an education to become an official hairdresser.</p>
          <p>So we have some strong points there. And our strategy is also there with professional to further build on that. In the retail, as you know, we stayed in China for cosmetics. And we're happy we did so. So meanwhile we have now the second year in a raw with extremely significant double digit growth. We have some niche positioning in which we see further room for expansion. Also Southeast Asia, we have some strong holds, and if you talk about Latin America, in Colombia for example and some neighbor states, Colombia meanwhile we moved up to the number two player. And that's also how we see this business to go further step-by-step. And as I indicated before, as Kasper said the intention is not to be everywhere but there where we are, we want to go and to be successful.</p>

          <p>Yeah, the volume in Q4 was not higher than in Q3, the volume was lower. I've shown was &#x2013; the volume comparison to previous year. So Q4 volume was less negative than Q4, 2008, but it was still lower than Q3 2009. If you look at the sales figure, that's obvious. So therefore there is slightly negative volume Q4 versus Q3. And therefore, it's possible to have a lower EBIT in Q4 compared to Q3. Now the adjusted EBIT for this year Q4 was lower than in Q3.</p>
          <p>With respect to margins, obviously, Thomas Geitner can comment on it as well. Now comparing ourselves to peers is difficult because there is such peers than our Henkel Adhesives business. They all have somewhat different product portfolio. So therefore we compare our particular segment to our peers. And from our perspective, without going through the detail, we are very competitive. There is one exception with a different portfolio. That's 3M, where it's difficult to determine what exactly is in the Adhesives business. They do have a pretty high margin, there is no question about it. But that's the only outlier in terms of the peers that we look at. Look at the others, for example, Fuller is on a competitive level, <mark type="inaudible" />, what have you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my point is given your scale and the significance of your cost saving programs, would you not expect a reasonably significant higher margin than Fuller for example?</p>

          <p>Before I hand over to Thomas, we are not in the end of the road, that's important to note. We have been adapting our structures, as you can observe, we have started in to 2009 with a much higher capacity, with a much higher level of sales. We bought National Starch. The combined businesses would have been able to generate sales at a far higher level. So therefore, adaptation of our structures was the name of the game. But that's just the first part of the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean why is the volume in Q3 slightly above Q4? It's a simple explanation, because Q4 traditionally in our business is lower than Q4 -- than Q3 is simply because there are less working days and the vast majority of our suppliers goes into industrial, supplying six or eight working days less in the quarter.</p>
          <p>It's something you will see in every single year. so traditionally our strongest quarter is three and therefore the fact that in 2009 falling slightly below three, there is no indication of the pace of the recovery. In fact if you compare like-for-like -- or year-or-year numbers, you can see that Q4 actually had a better performance -- relatively better performance than we had in Q3.</p>
          <p>Now there is not much to add I can -- not much I can add to Lothar's comment. You know, we don't show a segment reporting that makes us easily comparable to our competitors, but I can tell you that the ones you have referred to have suffered more on the top line than us. And in fact their margins in the respective areas are slightly below us.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one point, I do want to reiterate the point that Lothar made, which is very important. We're at the beginning of the road, we are not in the end of the road. That's why we have the targets for 2012. And when we sit in the biggest recession since the Second World War, we have the numbers, we are working very hard on getting our capacity aligned with demand and you have seen the numbers in our Adhesives division going from three point plus margin in the first quarter to almost 11 points of margin in the fourth quarter. That shows some of the upside there is in the business if you get an alignment between demand and supply.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from WestLB Mellon Asset Management. A question on your refinancing needs. Obviously, there are no bonds coming due in the near-term, but do you have plans to maybe extend your maturity profile or to benefit from the low interest environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we have fortunately secured basically long-term maturities and staggered maturities. So we don't look into anyone year where we would have major amount of debt maturing. The next loan maturing would be 2013. That's awhile away, '14 and don't actually 2104. So that's probably beyond my own tenure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably. So we have secured in terms of maturity a pretty long-term security. As a matter of fact, under normal circumstances, we do operate with a more significant amount of short term debt particularly commercial paper which was not &#x2013; one thing that we thought was appropriate over the past one and a half year so we've reduced that turn on almost in visible levels, basically at the current stage we would not need any short term financing at all. That's not a long term sound situation, so therefore we'll at any one point in time we'll increase our short term maturities in order to have more financial flexibility and that's true because this is a very cash generative company.</p>
          <p>We're reducing our debt at an amazing pace if you look at the 2009. So from that perspective, there's no refinancing need in the foreseeable future. And if so we're probably first increasing our flexible situation which is particularly commercial paper. We have communicated that some of the backup facilities, which again have been staggered over the next years will expire in 2010, and that's something where we're quite confident that we're going to be able to either extend or conclude a non-maturity for that.</p>

          <p>Christian Weiz Unicredit. First of all, you're referring several times to your targets in 2012 and the 14% EBIT margin target. Can you please help us to understand whether this is a peak margins that you want to achieve or where do we go from there, from this 14%? First. And second, I didn't quite understand what went wrong in professional hair care. I didn't quite understand why it was relatively week in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask Hans Van Bylen to answer the question regarding personal hair care. I think it's important that we've reached the first target before we started speaking about the next target. And we're very focused on getting to where we need to get. We set that cost out in 2008, and we are committed to making the decisions. And I've said that on every con call that since, to take a right and appropriate decisions on the way to 2010.</p>
          <p>At that stage of process that we'll communicate the next sets of times, but I think it's important that we keep first set of targets at hand or at sight before we move to the next set of targets. We've continued to make adoptions and changes based on the market environment. And we'll continue to do so. You've heard that today, what's in our focus. We've guided you on what we learn to invest in the business not only as a comfortable CapEx, but also restructuring moving forward and sure that we have a competitive cost base moving forward and when we get there, when we're close we will be happy to tell about the next step. But I think getting the first one behind us is more important now than speaking about the second one. Hans you want to elaborate on professional?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Professional it is as we indicated the crisis, which hit the market quite fundamentally. Concerning the professional markets &#x2013; we don't have statistics like we have Nielsen statistics, but of course there are a lot of information data which we can access.</p>
          <p>Estimations for the market development, not our development, the market development is high single-digits up to more than double-digit negative, which means the market itself has been hitched only, what does it mean? We see that frequency of visits to hair dress has been coming down, which is one thing, visit to hair dress is quite expensive issue, so which means in crisis time people save on that.</p>
          <p>And within the portfolio of hairdressers, what you also see that especially also a big part of OTC business is touched. What does it meant for us? We are quite happy with the development which we had for two reasons. So our development was on the low single-digit negative, which is by far better than market. We have been winning shares.</p>
          <p>Due to two points. Again, we put our business quite in focus with 111 years, and also we have a portfolio in professional, which is extremely strong in hair colorization which is a business on which first of all hair dressers are quite loyal. And secondly also which is less affected than the big OTC part in which we are not that a big player. So that's why looking back, what went wrong is -- there was a big crisis out there, hitting our market fundamentally. And we did do by far much better than the market.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Stephen Flundrine from Jefferies. Just want to come back to the working capital number, if you could maybe flesh out some of the drivers for the working -- the good working capital number, and also if you could maybe say if it's -- if there is a remuneration link to maybe working capital targets going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understood only half of your question, but I can talk about net working capital about an hour, so I will try to be shorter. We have not only contributed from all the businesses in terms of improvement of net working capital, but also all components. So we've reduced our inventories, we've reduced our receivables and we have increased our payables. That's obviously therefore why we had this big step ahead towards the end of last year. Now in normal circumstances, I should say in an environment where we have stronger growth. Last year was -- at least in part of our business, adaptation was needed in order to reduce our net working capital not only in terms of percentage, but also in absolute terms in order to reflect the lower volume. And that's always much more difficult, because if you have an increasing volume that you need to move then it is easier to manage. It's more difficult to manage down not only the total volume, the absolute volume, but also the relative volume.</p>
          <p>So therefore, and that's why we are making such a big deal about our results of last year. In a decreasing environment, we've been able to manage the relative amount, so that's therefore quite noticeable. Now again, we're going back to a growth level that compared to 2009, and therefore we've -- first we'll have to manage our inventories up in order to be able to supply. There is always a fine line that needs to be observed between managing inventories and receivables down, particularly inventories and not being able to supply customers. So there are instances where in a environment of recovery we need to provide a bigger buffer in terms of being able to supply. The worst that could happen in a recovery would be for us not to be capable of supplying our customers. So therefore, initially compared to 2009, plus being able to supply our customers in a growth environment, we expect a higher level than what we have at the end of last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Wolfgang, and thank you everybody for coming here today. Let me just spend a short period of time just setting the scene. Looking at 2009, pulling out a couple of points, it was the best year for cosmetics. It was best year for detergents. It was a year with a lowest net working capital in the rest of the company. It was a year with very strong market share.</p>
          <p>And it was a year with enormous transition within our industrial business, adhesives business also. Thomas spoke about it during today and a recovery from three plus percent margin to almost 12% margin in 2009. And sometimes these things go under in a year where you have an average number. But the numbers, where if you take the components very strong, and as I said, we made significant programs -- progress on the year as we set ourselves out to do.</p>
          <p>I'm by no means and neither there's nobody else in the management team trying to imply that we are where we need to be. That's why we set the targets for 12th and that's why we also are very much aware that we have a way to go. And I don't want to lead anybody to believe that the runway we had into Q4 is the runway, it would be beautiful if we had that because basically Fritz wouldn't have to have work much on it, but he still has to work a lot harder. We have a long way to go. We are very much aware of that. But we also believe that we have taken a number of decisions that has significantly improved the competitiveness of our company as it relates to structure -- cost innovation and market positions.</p>
          <p>We believe that 2010 will be a challenging year. We're not saying that here too have we proved it and we believe at this state, it will be a challenging year. We have very limited transparency into the year. But at the same time, we're committed to deliver the improvements, 10% plus in EBIT as suggested and should other numbers occur, we'll notify you about those numbers and we need to reach that every quarter. But at this stage, I really ask you to take the guidance we've given you as it is given. We believe we have a long way to go while we made improvements.</p>
          <p>We just like to thank everybody for coming here today. Thank you for your questions and I'm sure that we'll be able to answer more questions either answer some of them today or as we go moving forward. So on behalf of Henkel, thank you.</p>
