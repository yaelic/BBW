          <p>Good morning. My name is Shawn . I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Hoffman you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to Biogen-IDEC's fourth quarter and full year 2009 conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the investor section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we'll discuss today. We have also posted slides on our web site that will outline the topics discussed on today's call.</p>
          <p>As usual, we'll start with the Safe Harbor Statement. Comments made in this conference call include forward-looking statements about our expected future results, our organization, operational and financial activities and goals, the market potential of TYSABRI and other products, the potential market for our products and pipeline advancements and regulatory actions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. You should carefully review the risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and in the Risk Factor section of our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Today on the call, I am joined by Jim Mullen,  CEO of Biogen IDEC,  Dr. Al Sandrock, SVP of the Neurology R&amp;D Organization, Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer and Paul Clancy, CFO and Executive Vice-President of Finance.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Jim Mullen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Eric. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. I am pleased to report that in 2009 Biogen IDEC once again delivered strong financial and operational results. For the full year 2009, total revenue increased 7% to 4.4 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.12, and the business generated $1.1 billion of cash. The 13% non-GAAP EPS growth marked 6 consecutive years of double-digit EPS which increases that date back to the merger between Biogen and IDEC in 2003.</p>
          <p>On the operational side, I'm also pleased to announce a very successful year. With 1.1 billion of in market net sales in 2009, TYSABRI is officially a blockbuster. I'm especially proud of this accomplishment when you take a step back and consider the voluntary market withdrawal in 2005. Think about this, a product that was taken off the market is now generating over $1 billion in annual revenue and is still growing. Furthermore, we've made significant progress in our understanding of PML risk and opportunities to stratify that risk and I attribute these accomplishment to both TYSABRI's efficacy, positive risk benefit profile and a very committed team of Biogen IDEC employees who are justifiably proud of their accomplishments but at the same time are aware that there is still more work to be done.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we also took steps to extend the durability of our core interferon franchise. The therapy is now protected until 2026 by virtue of a newly issued method of use patent. In addition, we've advanced PEGylated Interferon into registrational trials. PEGylated Interferon has the potential to reinforce AVONEX's advantage and improve on convenience. With an eye on reinvigorating our efforts to restore AVONEX's market leadership, in Q4 we also announced some new additions to our commercial leadership team. Bob Hamm will talk about these new leaders later. Biogen IDEC's MS pipeline is deeper and more complete than ever before. We now have first in class or best-in-class therapies that have the potential to address a full spectrum of patient needs. Our strategy has been slow, stop and reverse MS and we have assembled a collection of products and development programs designed to do just that.</p>
          <p>During 2009, our R&amp;D organization filed for European and Canadian regulatory approval of Fampridine, well ahead of plan and we initiated two pivotal trials, three Phase II trials, two Phase I trials and four R2D transitions all while continuing to managing 90 trials for 31 compounds with over 14,000 patients in more than 45 countries. Finally, we have a strong balance sheet and nearly $100 million in free cash flow monthly. This is allowing us the flexibility to both return cash to our shareholders and continue to invest in future growth both internally and externally.</p>
          <p>Before we turn the call over to Al Sandrock for an update on R&amp;D, let me address a topic I'm sure you're interested in, the Board's search for my successor. The board has formed a CEO search committee headed by Director Brian Posner which also includes Chairman Bill Young and Directors Alex Denner and Bruce Ross. The committee is working diligently with a leading search firm, Spencer Stuart. The process is under way but as you can understand, beyond that, we're not going to comment on this call today. I'll now hand the call to Dr. Al Sandrock, our Senior Vice-President, Neurology Research and Development. Al.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. I would like to begin by welcoming some new additions to the Neurology R&amp;D and Medical Affairs teams at Biogen IDEC. You've probably already seen the announcements but let me take a moment to tell you about each person. Dr. John Richert joins us from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society where he served as Executive Vice-President for Research in Clinical Programs for the past five years. Prior to that, John was at Georgetown University where he was Professor and Chair in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Professor of Neurology and founder of the University's MS clinic.</p>
          <p>Dr. Frederick Munschauer joins us from the State University New York at Buffalo School of Medicine where he was the Irvin and Rosemary Smith Professor in the Department of Neurology and Chair of the Department of Neurology. Dr. Nancy Richert, an expert in neuro-imaging, joins us from the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke where she served as a staff clinician in the neuro-immunology branch and Dr. Doug Kerr, an expert on transverse myelitis and MS joins us from Johns Hopkins where he was Associate Professor of Neurology.</p>
          <p>We're extremely excited to add these distinguished leaders of the multiple sclerosis community to the Biogen IDEC team. I would like to begin now with an update of our pipeline with &#x2013; starting with one of my favorite programs. I'm very pleased to report that in January, we initiated a Phase I trial of our fully human anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody. This is especially exciting for us because most of the biology of LINGO-1 was elucidated in Biogen IDEC's own research laboratories. It had been known for some time that when myelin, the insulation around nerve fibers, is damaged by diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neurons often lose the ability to transmit nerve impulses. And it was also known that the ability of the human central nervous system to repair myelin was limited.</p>
          <p>As reported in such publications as Nature Medicine and Nature Neuroscience, our scientists found that treatment with anti-LINGO-1 antibody promoted the remyelination of damaged nerve fibers when tested in various animal models of demyelination. Although current MS therapies can slow disease progression, none are designed to directly affect this repair process. As such, anti-LINGO-1 antibody represents a novel therapeutic approach to multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>Another new technology that we advanced into development last quarter was our biospecific antibody targeting TNF-alpha and TWEAK. With this novel biospecific antibody design which was also pioneered by Biogen IDEC scientists, we can simultaneously bind TNF-alpha and TWEAK with high affinity while retaining many of the desired properties of traditional monoclonal antibodies including a long circulating half-life and ease of production. Simultaneous inhibition of the TNF-alpha and TWEAK pathways offers the potential to more effectively block inflammatory pathologies in autoimmune diseases.</p>
          <p>Now an update on our blood factor programs. In December with our partner Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, we announced that our Factor VIII product for hemophilia A moved into clinical trials, making ours the only long acting Factor VIII compound in clinical trials. In January, we announced that our Factor IX product for hemophilia B moved into a registrational trial, making ours the first long acting Factor IX compound to reach this milestone. The case for innovating in hemophilia is strong where the only treatment options are those with relatively short half-lives, requiring between 100 and 150 infusions per year. Our product substantially increased the half-life, which offers the hope that the hemophilia patients would need to receive 50 or fewer infusions per year.</p>
          <p>We will present the results of our Phase I-2 Factor IX study at an upcoming medical meeting.</p>
          <p>As you may already know, Biogen IDEC regularly reviews and adjusts its pipeline as scientific, market or regulatory conditions change. In accordance with this process, we reviewed the data for ADENTRI and determined that the results are not supportive of continuing either the oral or the IV program. The efficacy and safety data from our TRIDENT trial analyzed to date suggests a beneficial effect on symptoms without a positive impact on clinical morbidity or mortality outcomes. These results are consistent with recent Phase III results from Merck's rolofylline program in acute decompensated heart failure.</p>
          <p>Now let me take a moment to provide an update on TYSABRI. When we reintroduced TYSABRI in July of 2006, you will recall that we set out to answer three questions about PML in TYSABRI treated patients. Who was at risk, what is the risk, and how can we mitigate the risk?</p>
          <p>With the start of the new year, I thought it would be a good time to re-visit the progress we have made in answering these questions. I'll begin with what we know about the risk. During our Q3 earnings call, I announced that we had initiated conversations with regulators worldwide about updating the TYSABRI product label as we began to believe that the risk of PML increases with the length of time on therapy.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we updated the label to include language stating that in the patient &#x2013; that in patients treated with TYSABRI, the risk of developing PML increases with longer treatment duration and that for be patients treated for 24 to 36 months, the risk is generally similar to the rate seen in clinical trials. There is limited experience beyond three years.</p>
          <p>As recently as last Friday, February 5, the FDA reaffirmed that it believes that the clinical benefits of TYSABRI continue to outweigh the potential risks.</p>
          <p>On January 21, the European Medicines Agency announced that they had finalized a review of TYSABRI and the risk of PML. The Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concluded that the risk of developing PML increases after two years of use of TYSABRI although this risk remains low. The Committee also reaffirmed its position that TYSABRI's benefits continue to outweigh its risks for patients with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for whom there are few treatment options available. We expect that the TYSABRI label in the EU will be revised to reflect the Committee's conclusions.</p>
          <p>We continue to explore avenues for stratifying risk. One key area of focus is on the development of a serological assay to detect the presence of JC virus antibody. We are currently planning to initiate clinical study to determine whether antibody negative patients are at lower risk for PML. Our aim is make these studies widely accessible to TYSABRI patients worldwide.</p>
          <p>Risk mitigation efforts have also continued. When TYSABRI was introduced, the expectation was that PML was usually fatal. This assumption was largely based on outcomes seen in the HIV/AIDS population. It is still too early to draw firm conclusions but so far, survival rates have been approximately 75%. We believe that clinical vigilance combined with rapid action, including the ability to shut off the activity of natalizumab by timely dose dispension and plasma exchange has contributed to improved outcomes.</p>
          <p>We will continue to put considerable resources into PML research to further refine ways of identifying who is at risk for this rare event and to provide other approaches that could improve patient outcome. A final note on TYSABRI's efficacy &#x2013; based on the data coming from our clinical trials, the real world observations from various studies and registries around the world as well as the uplifting stories we hear from many patients, we believe strongly in the benefits that TYSABRI can offer many patients with multiple sclerosis. While PML seems to get all the headlines, we think TYSABRI's efficacy is a story that also needs to be reinforced. To that end, last month we announced our decision to launch a head-to-head trial of TYSABRI versus COPAXONE and REBIF, a trial we call SURPASS.</p>
          <p>SURPASS has a target enrollment of 1,800 patients at 230 sites worldwide. As such, it will be the largest well controlled comparator trial of MS treatments ever undertaken. As you know, many neurologists currently switch patients from one ABCR therapy to another and they do this without any clinical trial evidence that has evaluated the utility of this approach.</p>
          <p>The SURPASS study will be the first trial to provide class 1 data on whether patients who are not doing well on first line therapies are better off that they switched to TYSABRI versus waiting to switch or switching among the ABCR therapies. We expect the study to be completed in 2013. I will now pass the call over to Bob Hamm, our Chief Operating Officer.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Al. In the fourth quarter, AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN generated combined worldwide revenue to Biogen IDEC of 1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year with continued growth in our core MS business offsetting a modest decline in RITUXAN revenues. For the year, this product revenue totaled 4.2 billion which represents 7% growth versus 2008. As Jim mentioned, TYSABRI achieved blockbuster status in its fourth year, exceeding one billion in sales with 30% growth in both in market sales and patients. Our durable AVONEX franchise now in its 14th year in the market delivered 5% revenue growth.</p>
          <p>In January, we installed new commercial leadership. Dr. Francesco Granata joined Biogen IDEC to lead our Global Commercial Organization and our Global Medical Affairs team. Dr. Granata is a trained M.D. who previously held executive commercial executive leadership positions at Schering-Plough, Pharmacia and Pfizer. Joining Dr. Granata as Head of the U.S. Business is Tony Kingsley, an entrepreneurial leader who previously held senior operational management positions at Hologic and Cytyc.</p>
          <p>Together, Francesco and Tony's focus during 2010 will be on reenergizing our U.S. AVONEX business and continuing to drive TYSABRI adoption. I will now provide more detail on each franchise individually.</p>
          <p>TYSABRI finished 2009 with over 48,000 patients on therapy worldwide. In the U.S., the number of patients grew by 21%. Outside the U.S., the number of patients grew by 40%. The higher growth rate outside the U.S. was in part fueled by geographic expansion. During 2009, we launched TYSABRI in seven countries bringing the total number of countries where TYSABRI is sold to 45. AVONEX is currently available in over 70 countries, so we still have plenty of room to continue to expand. We anticipate making TYSABRI available in five or six additional countries in Latin America and Central Europe during 2010.</p>
          <p>No doubt much of the interest in TYSABRI is due to its efficacy. Having demonstrated 42% to 54% reduction in disability progression, a 68% reduction in relapse rate and five times as many patients free of disease activity versus placebo. Doctors and patients appear to be taking TYSABRI efficacy into account when weighing TYSABRI's benefit and risk. In Q4, we updated TYSABRI's label information to include a duration effect following two years of treatment. Response to this news so far appears to be measured.</p>
          <p>Worldwide, TYSABRI grew by an average of 867 patients net per month during Q4, which is somewhat lower than during the second and third quarters but still about 24% above the same period prior year. We have yet to see a meaningful change in discontinuation trends. As of December, we estimate that less than 10% of U.S. neurologists had ever prescribed a TYSABRI drug suspension and less than 5% of TYSABRI patients were currently on a drug suspension. For patients with few options other than TYSABRI, the risk of PML even after 24 months remains low while the risk of debilitating MS progression without TYSABRI is high.</p>
          <p>Potential competitors to TYSABRI are on the horizon and for competitive reasons I'm not going to go into detail on our commercial preparation for these nascent therapies. But I can say this &#x2013; we are quite confident in the appeal TYSABRI's benefit/risk equation has for many MS patients. In fact, advances in MS therapy such as TYSABRI are changing the way that many patients view and manage their disease.</p>
          <p>In January, we launched a customized yoga program called My MS Yoga for people with MS. This program was developed with a top MS specialist, Dr. Elliot Frohman and a world renown yoga instructor, author Baron Baptiste. The video features TYSABRI patients who are all proactively managing their disease through exercise and treatment. This program has had a significant pick-up in the national and local media including a hope &#x2013; high profile piece on Good Morning America Health.</p>
          <p>In the first three weeks since launch, over 4,600 patients have visited myMSyoga.com to learn more about the program and over 1,200 patients have taken advantage of the free My MS Yoga DVD.</p>
          <p>Now an update on AVONEX. The franchise generated 596 million in global revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2.3 billion for the year, both an increase of 5% year-over-year. With approximately 137,000 patients in therapy worldwide and 16 years of remaining patent life, AVONEX continues on as a strong and durable foundation to our market leading franchise in neurology. RITUXAN Q4 revenues for Biogen IDEC were 257 million, down 15% year-over-year. This decline was driven primarily by the continued expiration of royalties on revenues outside of the United States, off 44% versus 2008.</p>
          <p>Also in the U.S., our Q4 profit share declined by 7%. As Roche reported last week, this was due to reduction in wholesaler inventory. For the year, RITUXAN revenues to Biogen IDEC were 1.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year due to a 24% decline in royalties on sales outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now looking toward the future, let's turn to our next anticipated product launch in MS. As Jim mentioned, we filed for regulatory approval for Fampridine in December, ahead of schedule, in Europe and Canada. In the U.S., Fampridine is developed and commercialized by Acorda Therapeutics. The FDA recently approved the drug as AMPYRA extended release tablets. It is the first therapy indicated in the U.S. to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Biogen has established a focus team that has initiated launch preparations for expected approval outside the U.S. in the first half of 2011. Much of our neurology Sales and Marketing infrastructure is already in place given our market leading position in most countries outside the U.S. Fampridine will fit nicely into that infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on pharmacoeconomic research at this stage. In parallel, our supply chain team is preparing to enable appropriate compassionate use programs and name patient supply. Biogen IDEC is excited to bring this therapy to MS patients outside of the U.S. Fampridine demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS &#x2013; relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive. And it can be used alone or with existing MS therapies. In short, Fampridine's launch outside the U.S. provides us an opportunity to offer therapies to an even broader community of MS patients, a goal that fits wholly with our mission to create new standards of care in neurology through our global commercial and medical capabilities.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Bob. I'll review our 2009 fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Additionally, I'll provide our 2010 financial guidance. Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the earnings release. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. The primary differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were 56 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and seven million for employee stock options offset by $24 million tax impact on these items.</p>
          <p>Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q4 and $3.35 for the full year. Now I'll move on to the non-GAAP P&amp;L operating performance for Biogen which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business and reflects how we manage the business internally. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 for Q4 and $4.12 for full year 2009. In the fourth quarter, we benefited by $0.12 earning per share due to one-time discrete tax benefits that I'll detail later in the call.</p>
          <p>Now let's move through the fourth quarter and full year results in a bit more detail. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2009 was $1.1 billion, 5% growth over fourth quarter 2008. Revenue for the full year 2009 totaled approximately 4.4 billion which represents a 7% growth over full year 2008. Q4 2009 product revenue was $827 million, a 13% growth over Q4 2008. And full year 2009 product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, an 11% growth over full year 2008.</p>
          <p>Going through our product revenues, I'll begin with AVONEX. Q4 AVONEX worldwide product revenue was 596 million, a 5% increase over Q4 2008. Worldwide AVONEX revenue for full year 2009 totaled approximately 2.3 billion, also a 5% growth.</p>
          <p>U.S. AVONEX product revenue in the fourth quarter was $352 million, a 3% increase over Q4 2008. U.S. AVONEX revenue for the full year totaled $1.4 billion which represents a 10% growth over full year 2008. U.S. AVONEX inventory ended at just over two weeks in the fourth quarter unchanged from the third quarter. In Q4 2009, units sold in the U.S. declined approximately 7% as compared to Q4 2008, this was offset by price increases. On a sequential basis Q3 to Q4, U.S. AVONEX units declined by approximately 1%.</p>
          <p>Q4 international AVONEX product revenue was $244 million, a 9% increase over Q4 2008. On a sequential basis, AVONEX international revenues increased by 6% as compared to Q3, driven by higher volume. Foreign exchange net of hedge accounted for 2% of the increase. International AVONEX revenue for the full year 2009 totaled $917 million, a 1% year-over-year decline. The full year AVONEX, international AVONEX revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and hedging which reduced revenue by 88 million or approximately 10%. This was offset by unit increases of approximately 6% and favorable price and mix impact of 2%.</p>
          <p>Q4 TYSABRI worldwide product sales were 216 million for Biogen IDEC, a 39% increase over Q4 2008. TYSABRI worldwide revenue for full year 2009 totaled 776 million for Biogen IDEC, a 32% increase over full year 2008.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., in market TYSABRI sales totaled 137 million for the fourth quarter. Q4 U.S. TYSABRI product revenue for Biogen IDEC was $62 million. U.S. end user end market TYSABRI sales for the full year 2009 totaled $509 million, a 21% increase over 2008. Biogen IDEC booked 232 million for full year 2009.</p>
          <p>Q4 international TYSABRI product revenue was 154 million, a 49% increase over Q4 2008. And international TYSABRI revenue for full year 2009 totaled 544 million, a 39% year-over-year increase. Foreign exchange reduced international TYSABRI revenue by approximately 29 million for full year 2009 or 5%.</p>
          <p>Q4 FUMADERM revenue was $14 million. Now I'll move on to the RITUXAN collaboration revenues referred to as revenue from unconsolidated joint business. We recorded $257 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a decrease of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the full year decreased 3% to 1.1 billion as compared to full year, 2008.</p>
          <p>Our RITUXAN revenues are broken down into three components. First, our share of the net RITUXAN profits. Net U.S. RITUXAN sales were $658 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% versus prior year and as Bob noted was owing partly to the de-stocking in the channel.</p>
          <p>Our Q4 2009 profit share from that business was 192 million, down 7% versus prior year. Full year 2009 U.S. RITUXAN sales were 2.666 billion, up 3% as compared to full year 2008 and our profit share from that business was 774 million, up 5% as compared to full year 2008.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year profit share benefited from price increases and lower operating expenses in the collaboration.</p>
          <p>Second, we received revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. and in Q4, this was $46 million, down 44% versus Q4 2008 as royalties from individual countries have expired. Revenue on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. for the full year was $256 million, down 24% as compared to full year 2008. We expect for 2010 rest of world revenues from Rituximab to be approximately 120 to $130 million depending on exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Third, in the fourth quarter we were reimbursed 18 million for selling and development costs incurred related to RITUXAN. For the full year 2009, we were reimbursed $66 million. Royalty revenue were $41 million for fourth quarter of 2009 and 124 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&amp;L. Q4 COGS were $100 million or 9% of revenues. Q4 R&amp;D expense was $279 million and 24% of revenues. R&amp;D spend for the full year totaled $1.3 billion, approximately 29% of revenues and an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>This was owed largely to the $110 million payment we paid to Acorda Therapeutics in the first half of 2009. Q4 SG&amp;A expense was 236 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. This represents 21% of revenues.</p>
          <p>Drivers of the year-over-year increase included investments to support the MS franchise and the ongoing geographic expansion of our commercial operations.</p>
          <p>Continuing down the P&amp;L, our collaboration profit sharing line totaled 63 million in expense for the quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a gain of $6 million driven by net interest income and realized gains on strategic investments.</p>
          <p>Let me now share the progress we have made with respect to our share repurchase program. On our last earnings call, we announced that in October 2009, the Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to a billion dollars of common stock, intended to reduce our shares outstanding with the objective of returning cash to shareholders. This program was in addition to the previously approved 20 million share repurchase program authorized in October 2006 which has always been earmarked for share stabilization.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2009, we made solid progress on our share repurchase programs, purchasing 14.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of approximately $694 million. Repurchases have continued in the first quarter of 2010 through February 5, whereby we have repurchased an additional 5.4 million shares for a total cost of $289 million. Net-net since October 2009, through February 5, 2010, we have purchased approximately 20.2 million shares for a total cost of $983 million.</p>
          <p>Our cash and marketable securities position remains strong. We ended the year at $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% which benefited from multiple discrete events. Specifically in the fourth quarter, we effectively resolved previously outstanding tax audits across multiple years on both the federal and state level. For the full year 2009, our tax rate was approximately 27% reflecting these benefits, offset by the negative impact from the Acorda transaction being entered into by an ex U.S. affiliate. As we look into 2010, I expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 28 to 29% range. This does not include the R&amp;D tax credit which currently has not been reinstated. This brings us to our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $1.20 and our full year non-GAAP EPS $4.12, representing 13% increase over full year 2008.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide our 2010 guidance. Revenue growth in 2010 is expected to be in the mid single digits. This includes the expected decline of Rituximab rest of world revenues. Core operating expense growth is expected to be in the low single digits. R&amp;D expense is expected to be approximately 24 to 27% of revenue excluding any new business development expense.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense is expected to be approximately 20 to 22% of revenue. The high end of this range reflects investments we may be making in our brands in light of the competitive landscape. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be above $3.71. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be above $4.55, striving towards another double-digit earnings growth year. We expect capital expenditures in the range of 170 to $200 million.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, 2009 was a solid top and bottom line result. Our total revenue grew by 7% for the full year. Product revenue grew by 11%. TYSABRI surpassed $1 billion in sales and our non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 13%. Our cash flow was strong and we made solid progress against our billion dollar share repurchase plan returning cash to shareholders. Now I'll hand the call over to Jim for his closing comments.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Paul. In summary, 2009 business and pipeline performance positioned the company for continued success in 2010 and beyond. The organization delivered mid teens non-GAAP earnings growth, drove the ongoing growth of TYSABRI patients and revenues, filed a new product for regulatory approval, advanced two programs in their registrational trials and broadly drove what's an increasingly exciting pipeline.</p>
          <p>We have consistently delivered double-digit earnings growth since the merger between Biogen, Idec in 2003 and we positioned the company to remain competitive well into the future. With that, Eric, let's now open it up to Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. I am wondering if you can comment a little bit on your R&amp;D choice. Particularly on SURPASS and how we should be thinking about the $1.2 billion spend for next year, if I have the math in the right ballpark. How much of that is related to SURPASS and TYSABRI investment versus other programs in the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rachel, this is Paul. You have got the math plus or minus pretty close. SURPASS is a very meaningful investment as well as a number of the other TYSABRI investments that we have planned for 2010. That of course is shared with Elan from a collaboration standpoint.</p>
          <p>So, I think the way we think about R&amp;D broadly is that there are a number of activities that are putting upward pressure on the R&amp;D line. TYSABRI life cycle initiatives certainly moving PEG along  in the registration trial, a number of the other late stage programs and that being offset by some of the program decisions we have made over the last few months that have been noted on the third quarter call and the fourth quarter call. So I hope that kind of gives you a little bit of a kind of ballpark to work with.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Just looking for an update on Ocrelizumab in MS. I guess you recently got the Phase II data in house. Maybe you could characterize what you've seen there and what your plans are for a Phase III or potential pivotal trial?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Eric. I'll take the first crack at that and Al is here with me. This is Jim. I guess what we would do is characterize the MS results on Ocrelizumab similar to the RITUXAN results of Ocrelizumab at the same stage. Certainly, interesting results worthy to continue to progress this trial into Phase III. I think the specifics of that program are yet to be determined with our partner.

          <p>Yes. Eric our best estimate is that the business which generally has about 15 days of inventory destocked about down to in the range of 12 to 13 days of inventory. So our estimate is that on the top line for the collaboration, that had an impact of 10 or $15 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Karim De felipe dialing in for Yaron. I have a question about your guidance. Can you elaborate a little bit on what your assumptions are for competitive threats in the MS phase and how that factors into your guidance?  And what could be upside and downside scenarios to that?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So I, this is Paul. I'll tag team this a little bit with Bob. We absolutely, as we have described in the past, fully expect kind of the two oral products to be moving along and get approved. I mean, pragmatically speaking, you know, the impact of that is a little bit more potentially on the sales and marketing for the given 2010 as opposed to the revenue line.</p>
          <p>And as I noted in our guidance, we're contemplating investments in sales and marketing. Plans are underway, not a lot &#x2013; plans are a little bit of ahead of activities right now to defend our MS franchise which is extremely important over the long-haul. So I would say, it is in, imbedded in our guidance for 2010. And plans are underway both to defend the product as well as make smart investments in the sales and marketing process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add that for patients with MS, unfortunately it is not just about route of administration, it is about the course of their disease and the safety profiles of individual drugs. So much is yet to be learned about that but it is really outcomes that the patients are looking for.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking the question. On TYSABRI, just wondering with the design of the studies you are considering to analyze the various predictors of PML and in those studies, how do you plan to control for any potential drop out of patients who turn out to be, or turn out to have a high risk factor?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the &#x2013; as you point out, the denominator may change in terms of these two STRATA. But if the &#x2013; if the risk decreases, then we should see, if the risk &#x2013; if most of the people are in the lower risk category, then their overall risk of PML should go down and the number of cases should go away or diminish. So if that's the case, then we will have answered the question. I think the denominator will need to be adjusted according to the number of people who stay in the STRATA that we're studying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is the design of the study and what will you specifically be measuring or following?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; if we're talking about the serological assay study, it is basically simply a blood draw where we take the blood, store it. We will &#x2013; we actually have a couple of studies.  In one study we will verify that the findings we got from our STRATA samples is the same.</p>
          <p>We will match it up with urine, JC virus. In the other study, we will collect blood and see whether or not when patients develop PML, they were antibody positive at that prior time point or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it just the antibody or what are the JC virus specific T-cell function assays or the viral coat protein assays that you will also be monitoring and do you only check those if patients are positive or do you test everyone and then see who gets PML?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those will be separate studies done in a focused way in conjunction with some registries and other studies going on in Europe and elsewhere where we will look for additional biomarkers. They will include cellular assays such as you indicate that test immune response. They will also look for mutations in JC virus, if we get a technology that we can use to measure mutations and so forth. But there are some studies that are going to be underway, for example in Germany, and we intend to collaborate with the investigators who are doing those studies.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So PEG enrollment is on track. We expect to complete enrollment in approximately a year or so, plus or minus a few months. It is always difficult to get enrollment exactly right. But it's going very well so far. I forgot the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hemophilia programs. Mark, this is Jim. Obviously, the Factor VIII program just got started. That's a Phase I program. So those predictably in this disease area, those go relatively slowly as you go through a bunch of updosing cohorts. And you need to finish each cohort before going to the next.</p>
          <p>So think of that as kind of going on for the remainder of the year to get to sort of Phase I results. The Factor IX program, you know, we have a multicenter international trial ongoing. It is not lots and lots of patients because it will be less than 100 patients required for that registration trial.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it is a pretty competitive area for recruiting patients. You know on the optimistic side maybe we can be done sometime this year or early next year. So that's probably as good as we can peg it right now. No pun intended on the PEG Interferon. I'm sorry. On CapEx, CapEx is up because just because Paul is usually conservative on the upside.</p>

          <p>In terms of the Ocrelizumab RA trials, there is two trials that remain to be read out both in the first half of this year. One trial is called SCRIPT. It's a 800 patient trial in TNF inadequate responders. The other one is a trial called FILM in which enrollment had to be halted but the patients had been, the patients that were enrolled prior to the halt will be evaluated. That trial is called FILM. It is a methotrexate-naive trial. So both of those will be read out in the first half of this year. We --</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys thanks for taking the question. More of a strategic question. You guys are putting cash flow to work obviously with the buyback. But your pipeline could take a few years to play out. So my question is, are you guys content with single digit revenue growth or are you more willing to do market product kind of deals going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, I think the way we have described is not terribly different in the past in terms of capital deployment. We absolutely would love to capture opportunities to create value through products both pipeline products as well as ideally marketed products but we would be disciplined that it's the, really what we're trying to solve for is creating shareholder value not simply kind of moving kind of the revenue growth numbers up or, a little bit up or down.</p>
          <p>So we're in an enviable position that we ended the year with $2.5 billion of cash. 2010 looks like another robust year with respect to cash flow generation. And we will continue to be challenged with this strategic question of looking for opportunities to create value and, in doing that in a disciplined way. And if not, returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined way as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question and also appreciation for the increasing transparency of all the information you are giving us. Just to that end, a quick question on the PML cases. Can you just give a sense the last three cases I think from 28 to 31, what the duration of exposure was?</p>
          <p>And I just want to quickly throw another one on Ocrelizumab. Could you remind us of the step-down in royalty, when that actually kicks in from RITUXAN and what proportion of the RITUXAN revenue will kick in? Is it going to be across the board or is it just for the autoimmune use, we have to carve that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the duration of treatment, I actually don't know the exact numbers but my recollection is they were on the upper end &#x2013; the two to three year timeframe for these three additional cases.</p>
          <p>And the second part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Geoff, this is Jim. I think we're going to have a formal update out in the middle of the month, aren't we on that. So you will be able to get that but I think the simplest way to think about it is, there is no real change in the profile but you will have that information. On Ocrelizumab, the step-down occurs at certain in market revenue numbers. And it's all revenues. It is not cut by indication so I think the first tranche &#x2013; do you have that detailed right in front of you right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't, I apologize Jeff. It is one of the things I don't have it. But it is itemized in our Qs and Ks. Essentially it is a step down, you know, from triggers at approximately if I recall $150 million and then $350 million, stepping down first to 38% and then to 35, then down to 30% profit share. It is, Jim said, affects the whole franchise. The other thing I'd just note. You know, we can have the RA team work with everybody. Ocrelizumab right now is imbedded in our R&amp;D expense just because it is a new product. That will, upon approval we envision that could actually flip back into the unconsolidated joint business.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. It may be a little early but just wondering if you can characterize the impact of the label amendment in terms of TYSABRI new patient starts into the new year. Is it stable, declining still, starting to reverse itself?  And just as a follow-up, in terms of patients where you are seeing drug holidays, can you characterize those patients? Do they tend to be beyond three years and how long are they typically off therapy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, this is Bob, I guess, Jim, the best way to think about it is it's too early to tell on your first question. Your second question really varies by treating physicians and again it's a little too early to tell. The label information really is not new, Al, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, we announced at the last earnings call that the U.S. label was going to indicate that the risk goes up with duration of treatment. And that at the 24 to 36 month mark, that it was roughly similar to what was seen in the clinical trials. And there is nothing new. I mean, the FDA announcement last Friday reiterated the benefits outweigh the risks and there is no further label change anticipated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think a lot of physicians, as we said, are taking a measured approach because there is trepidation about taking people directly off therapy and not having other options for them. So I think increased vigilance and the drug suspensions are mostly physicians taking a very thoughtful approach towards their patients' outcomes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess what I'm trying to get at as we look at the back half of the fourth quarter and the first part of the first quarter whether TYSABRI new patient starts are stable or if we should expect a further decline based on what you are seeing right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Too early I to tell, I would say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, it's always hard to say because the back half of December is always, there is nothing much happening because people just don't start a lot of new patients in that holiday season. So I think we'll have a better read as we come to the end of Q1.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. First, a follow on the Factor IX question. Jim, you indicated that you'll be done late this year, early next year. When you say done do you mean enrollment or actually the entire study?  What kind of safety follow-up would you need for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask Al if he's got the answer on the safety follow-up. You know, presumably they are going to want, they are going to want to see people on dosing for a year like they do every other biologic. Of course it is not going to be the typical patient numbers so my guess is, we need, you know, once we finish, we'll end up with the usual file it to safety update during the review and that will wrap around the one year follow-up on the remainder of the patients.</p>
          <p>You know, exactly how quickly that accrual goes, I think it is just too early to say. You know, I can say that the very early accruals in the Factor &#x2013; in the Phase I trials were difficult but of course now you actually have real data and people get excited about it so I hope that really influences the accrual rate. Plus we're in just a lot more centers internationally for the registration trial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you just said you will be done by the later, 2010 or early '011 is that enrollment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's enrollment. That's enrollment we're talking about. And, you know, I'll ask Eric and the IR team to maybe pull together some more specific information on that so that we can get that back out to you. I'm not trying to be evasive. I just don't know what it is off the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's no problem. And then another question that's on Fampridine. Now that we know the pricing in the U.S., can we assume that it is a, basically, global pricing strategy and obviously the patient population is pretty broad. I'm not trying to ask you for forecast but kind of thinking about the patient population and knowing the pricing, could this be a product that is the size of an AVONEX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, good question. You know, we'll all be anxiously watching how the launch goes here in the U.S. The pricing in the U.S. is of course set by Acorda. The pricing outside the U.S. is our responsibility. And we're doing all the pharmacoeconomic research and preliminary discussions to figure out where is the right price point in the EU.</p>
          <p>We're not going to really talk about that in any detail because frankly there is nothing good that can happen with regulators and pricing authorities by talking about price before you are even ready. Now, having &#x2013; the other part of your question is, well what's the population?  Certainly one of the things that eventually, you know, I was &#x2013; I was probably the internal skeptic and I kept looking at this data and looking at this data but it became clear that the impact appreciated by patients goes beyond the primary end point.</p>
          <p>You know that's not what's going to be on the label but I think as Acorda and we expand out the trials and additional things, hopefully we can tease that kind of clinically relevant data and then the last point is, there is certainly I think strong technical rationales to consider this product in other disease areas where nerve conduction is also a problem and there's a fair number of those. So I think you have got a big opportunity in MS and a bigger opportunity potentially in some other similar diseases. Al, have you got any thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I agree. I mean, if you look at how neurologists are using the compounded version, people are using it for other things besides walking ability. And there's nothing about the biology of this drug that suggests it should only work on ambulation because any demylenated nerve fiber track should respond or at least has a theoretical chance of responding to Fampridine. So not just the pathways involved in ambulation but other pathways as well.</p>

          <p>Very good. Your last question comes from the line of Joel Sendek. Your line is open.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks a lot. Jim, one thing you mentioned is that since the merger of Biogen and Idec, you have grown EPS by 10% or at least 10% every year. I know you don't give long-term guidance, but can you give us some sense of your confidence of your ability to do that beyond 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, good question. And I would love to make promises for the next CEO so that he can throw me under the bus as the previous administration. But, you know, let's go back to some of the rationale for the merger at the time. And it was I think evident that Bill Rastetter on the one side and me on the other side that neither one of us had pipeline that could really deliver unless we just got lucky and we needed to broaden and build the pipeline fairly quickly.</p>
          <p>With the merger, obviously we expanded out our therapeutic area expertise as well as we became much more competitive on BD and half this pipe line that you look today came through some kind of BD whether it's a collaboration of in licensing or an all out acquisition. What happens over the next one year or so, you know, as Fampridine comes to the market as we see the oral competitors, I guess we'll all see that play out but I personally would be pretty optimistic that the pipeline that we have assembled and we have a lot of compounds in Phase II and registration trials are really going to deliver a new leg of growth here, starting in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>So exactly what the next one or two years, I think matters a lot less than watching how that pipeline progresses as well as frankly the competitive environment. And of course that's what we have always been focused on. So I don't want to commit the next guy to exactly what it should look like. But I think we have got things that can certainly drive revenue growth, continue to drive shareholder value and that will show up on the earnings line as well.</p>
