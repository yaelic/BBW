          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Good afternoon, dear, ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you at yet another teleconference, which is dedicated to the publication of an interim consolidated report of Gazprom prepared in accordance with the International Reporting Financial Standards for the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>My name is Andrey Kruglov. I'm the Deputy Chairman of the Board, the Head of the Finance and Economics Department. I would like to introduce also my colleagues, who today are attending and participating at this teleconference. This is the Member of the Board, the Head of the Department of Economic Assessment and Pricing, Elena Karpel; the Head of the Consolidated Reporting of the Department of Accounting, Mr. Mikhail Rosseev; the Deputy General Director of Gazprom Export Company, Sergei Chelpanov; the Head of the Financial Markets and the Financial and Economic Department, Mr. Peter Bakaev, as well as the representatives of the accounting, the representative of the foreign economic activity and the Department for Marketing and Processing of Gas and Liquid Hydrocarbons, Financial And Economic Department and Gazprom Export.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>We will hold this teleconference in our traditional format. We will start by having myself and my colleagues telling you about the main highlights of the ones that have been reflected in the reporting, and then with pleasure, we will be ready to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And I will ask Peter Bakaev, the Head of the Department for Financial Markets to start.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my apologies because of a slight delay in the publication of today's presentation in our website. Apparently, the swine flu is continuing to hampering not only the human beings, but also the server of our information vendor, but we are expecting within the next few minutes or possibly within this teleconference those problems will be resolved and our slides and our presentation will be posted up to it.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And I suggest, in case the slides are already visible, to start with slide number four, which shows our main financials covering Q2 of '09.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So the results of second quarter show that the revenue of the company was RR 708 billion, having gone down by 16% compared to the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The annual, first annual revenue of the company amounted to RR 1.6 trillion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The reduction of our revenue was taking place against the reduction of sales in our basic markets. The adjusted EBITDA in reporting period amounted to RR 201 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The net profit went down by 36% and was RR 193 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And it is worthwhile noting that despite the overall debt of the company during the reporting period growing, the debt burden still remains at an acceptable level.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Let us move over to the next slide where you can see that in the second quarter of the current year, the company operations have been affected by an unstable macroeconomic environment and a negative market situation.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As you can see and as you may know the gas prices, which are sold in the Russian market under the long-term contracts are connected and related to the oil prices. But at the same time, you need to take into account the six to nine months period, which is the basic one to do pricing estimations.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Consequently, the reduction of the oil price in the beginning of '09, by the end of '08, affected to the dynamics of our revenue in the current year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>We should also note the strengthening of the ruble exchange rate is yet another factor, which also led to the reduction of our export revenue in the ruble denomination.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The sales in the domestic market in many ways reflected the economic situation in Russia, which in Q2 of '09 was described by a reduction of GDP and the industrial output.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now I would like to pass the floor to Mikhail Rosseev, and later on he will continue discussion in our presentation and later on we will come back to my part of it.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>I have just been informed that the Russian version of our presentation has been successfully pasted to our website, so you may look for it in the website and continue to follow our presentation there.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Good afternoon, dear, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As was already noted by Alexander Ivanovich in our reporting periods because of a difficult situation, the net revenue of Gazprom Group has slightly gone down.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>But at the same time in the second quarter of the reporting year, the revenue has gone down compared to the previous year by 16% or by RR135 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And it is notable that the revenue reduction was taking place practically throughout all of the operational segments of the Group activities.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The only exception was the sales of power.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, the sales of power has gone up by RR 32 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And this have been brought about by the consolidation of the entities included into the Gazprom structure which is OGK-2 and OGK-6 as well as with the expansion of the operations of Gazprom Germany in terms of the sales of power in the European market.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And the reduction of gas sales primarily have been brought about by an unfavorable market environment, which is the reduction of both the sales of natural volume as well as the changes in the price.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>While the reduction of the sales of gas and oil processing went down because of the deconsolidation of the SIBUR Group.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now let us move over to the next slide, which is slide number eight.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>This slide demonstrates the revenue and profit dynamics before the deduction of the depreciation and taxes and the net profit as well.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The slide shows that in case we consider that the EBITDA in the second quarter compared to the first one went down, which was the consequence of the reduction of our revenues.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And the net profit demonstrates their reverse dynamics and shows that the second quarter ended up being bigger than the first one amounting to 193 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And the main explanation comes from the financial expenses dynamics, and specifically, the net amount of revenue derived from the currency exchange differences.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And to be more specific, in the second quarter of '09, the Group achieved about 194 billion in net revenue from the currency exchange difference.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As well, the Group acknowledged the RR 14 billion of additional revenue from an acquisition of a 20% share in Gazprom Neft.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at the operational expenses.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>You can see them on slide number nine.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And the main line items, which affected the expense side of it, were the gas that we were purchasing.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Then costs incurred for the resale in order to process the processing products.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And/or the miscellaneous items.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Whereas the gas acquisition costs that we incurred has grown and we were speaking about it in detail when we described the Q1 results.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Our own acquisition expenses slightly went down.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>It was the price environment changing that was the reason for the dynamics that we were seeing in the both line items.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>In this case, the gas acquisition prices that we had have been growing while the crude acquisition prices following the global dynamics were going in the different direction.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Our costs related to purchasing of products for resale, including the refining, went up because of the operations of Gazprom Germania, [Foreign Language] which primarily have been related to the acquisition of the gas &#x2013; sorry, because of the acquisition of power.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As far as other expenses are concerned, one should note that their dynamics have changed compared to Q1.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, these particular costs have grown by RR 24 billion or 84%.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>However, the reason behind that remains the same, which was the reflection of revaluation in terms of the hot currency reflecting the receivables, [Foreign Language] whereas in the first quarter, the dynamics of exchange rate went to &#x2013; delivered to the acknowledgment of a profit, in the second quarter, we have to acknowledge our losses.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Please allow me to finish my part of the presentation with that and pass the floor to my colleagues from the Financial and Economics Department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now, let us consider the operational results and the transit we were witnessing in our markets in the first half of '09.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>But, let's take a look at slide number 10 before we do that.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>This is the slide, which is dedicated to the debt situation in the company.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As has shown in the first half of this year, the debt burden of the company slightly went up compared to the similar indication that we had by the end of the first quarter last quarter, but still remains at an acceptable and comfortable level.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The amount of net debt went up by 12% compared to the previous reporting period and amounted to approximately RR 1.3 trillion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>This particular figure growing can be explained by primarily an increase in the long-term borrowings and the revaluation of the traditional long-term and short-term borrowings denominated in hot currency.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The share of a short-term debt went down from 32% down to 29% in the first half of '09.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The debt ratings continue to be within the comfortable target range and so the company possesses the sufficient number of cash in order to maintain the required liquidity.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now continuing our presentation, and as far as the operational results are concerned, I should say that the overall result of the gas sales by Gazprom in second quarter went down by 20% compared to the same period in '08 amounting to 100 billion cubic meters.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The unfavorable market environment brought down the gas sales both in the export markets as well as in the domestic market.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The volume of gas sales to Europe went down by 15% and similarly by 10% in domestic market.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The basic share that we would point to took place within the former Soviet countries, which was brought about by the reduction of volumes, which were taken by Ukraine.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And now a few more words about the figures describing each market specifically and please go to slide number 13 and let's look at the exports.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Compared to the similar period last year, our revenue from gas sales to Europe and other countries went down to RR 265 billion, which is approximately 18%.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>This kind of a reduction was brought out by a dramatic reduction of gas prices, because the average price went down by 27% in dollars compared to the second quarter in '08.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>While the gas sales into the former Soviet countries remained practically at the same level, in the second quarter of '09, it was slightly below RR 80 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And taking into account a considerable reduction of the physical volumes in sales, this kind of a level was brought out by an annual comparison, which is the result of a continued effort to move over to the principle of equal profitability.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Despite the reduction of the physical sales volume, the revenue from gas sales inside Russia also stayed at the level of the second quarter of '08 amounting to approximately RR 90 billion, [Foreign Language] which was the result of a compensation effect of the average price growing for 1,000 cubic meters of gas.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As a result of a pricing policy and the regulatory measures, the changes of the gas price led to an increase in the domestic market by RR 163, which is 10% growth compared to a similar period last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And now after such a review of the main operational and financial results, we would like to say a few words about the current trends and the main activities that Gazprom is pursuing right now.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Amongst them there could be three sensitive issues, which are all concerned to our shareholders and potential investors, first is the share of Gazprom in the European market and the probability of a gas conflict with Ukraine.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The slide number 16 demonstrate that the monthly volumes of sales to Europe compared to the monthly production, and you can see that the deliveries reached a minimum in April and in July, they exceeded the volumes that we delivered in the previous years.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The rebounding of demand in the European market is also confirmed by the growth of the monthly productions that we had as of the end of June, beginning of July this year. So we expect that the current dynamics shall sustain until the end of the year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And as far as the payment by Ukraine for the gas that we deliver remains to be one of the current concerns, but considering the request that we are receiving that one should note that last year we entered into a long-term contract and we made statement satisfaction that Ukraine had been diligently making payments on a monthly basis for the gas supply. Last week we received yet another payment for October and we are hopeful that this trend shall sustain.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now let's move over to the next slide, where we shall demonstrate our situation with the production and refining of oil. The company intends to continue establishing and strengthening its position by way of profitable acquisitions in the sector.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Following our strategy in the first quarter of this &#x2013; in the first half of '09, the Group has undertaken several acquisitions.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>For example in February, we bought 51% of the shares of the Serbian Oil Company NIS.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>In April, we took the option from Eni for the acquisition of the 20% of Gazprom Neft having increased our share up to 95.98%.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And in April and July, we have acquired 48.4% of SIBUR Energy Oil Company as well as the right to buy additional 6.3% of the stock. This acquisition allows to increase the share of the Group in the Moscow Refinery up to 77.2%.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now, please go to slide number 18, which is about the power industry.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As you can see, this is one of our main preferred areas of the Group activities and the slide demonstrates that we are witnessing the growth of revenue from the sales of electric power. Right now, the share of this revenue in the total revenue amounts to about 9% and according to our expectations in the future, this figure will be growing.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>We continued to consolidate the main power assets on the books of the Group while the stocks of the generating and other power entities, which we achieved through the reorganization of the US to Russia maybe applied in order to enter into strategic treaties as well as the assets for subsequent divestiture.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>On slide number 19, you can see main events, which occurred after the reporting date.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As you can see in the '09, we have entered into an agreement with E.ON Ruhrgas. As the result of which we are going to change the participation in the South Russkoye field for 2.9% of the stock of Gazprom.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>While in July of '09, we have reached an agreement to buy 55.1% of the stock in SeverEnergia owns Arcticgaz, Urengoil and Neftegaztechnologia.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And also after the reporting period, the Group has undertaken a number of successful bond issues and borrowings.</p>

          <p>We will now begin the question-and answer-session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Maria Radina from Nomura. Please ask your question.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So this question comes from Nomura. So the question is as follows, which is the exports dynamics and about the dynamics for the consumption of gas in Russia. Could you please say whether you are able to maintain your target, which is 142.5 billion cubic meters for the sales to Europe and can you see that this figure may grow?</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And the second question is about the consumption dynamics in the domestic Russian market. What would you expect to be the final decline in terms of the demand in Russia considering the year-end results? To what extent do you believe the revival may be, how strong it may be amongst the industrial consumers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for the first question as an answering, we will have Sergei Chelpanov, who is the Deputy General Director of Gazprom Export and as far as the Russian consumption of gas, we will have Gennady Sukhov answering who is the Head of the Department for the Distribution of Gas Resources.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Yes, indeed the 142.5 as the figure is quite realistic in terms of the exports volume this year, indeed the first half of the year was a difficult one. But as far as the second half of the year is concerned and particularly the fourth quarter, we expect the volumes to grow to about 45 billion, which is going to be the exports in Q4. And so overall, the 142 is exactly the figure that one can rely upon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>I would like to note and as far as the changing dynamics are related to the consumption of gas in Russia in the following terms. As it was already mentioned, yes, there is a reduction that we're witnessing, but overall considering the half year results in terms of Gazprom's gas, the reduction is about 5%. And considering this starting of the heating season, we expect that the sales of gas in Russia in '09 will amount to a figure, which will be less than a level in the similar period last year by about 7%.</p>

          <p>Regrettably, I should say that the format of our reporting doesn't envisage disclosing of the average figures in terms of the gas production. Although you may estimate them quite easily yourselves by taking the figures that may be found in the information covering various segments, specifically the gas production and separately gas transportation.</p>

          <p>Question from Otkritie. Good evening and thank you very much for your presentation. It's a short question about the sales of gas in the CIS market. We can see from the report that the average sales price for 1,000 cubic meters went down from 268 down to $244 I mean in relationship between the first and second quarter.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So in view of this &#x2013; could you please give us some sort of an indication about what we may expect by the end of this year and similarly what one could expect in terms of the average gas sales price in the CIS market in 2010 particularly taking into account that we've heard some news about a possible price increase for the transit of gas to the Ukrainian and through Ukrainian territory.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>We will have Vladimir <mark type="inaudible" /> answering who is the Deputy Head of the Department for working with the former CIS countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The possible difference that you have noted in prices may be explained by the fact that in terms of the CIS market and the immediate abroad countries, in terms of our estimations is six months, while in terms of the other markets, remote markets as we describe them, is nine months period for our gas policy pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>But also one should consider the fact that because of the prices, in the CIS markets, continue to be very strongly different and so the changes in consumption between the countries where you find gas prices higher than in the other markets affect the average one, for example, and specifically looking into the Ukrainian example and the Baltic countries, the differences do represent the estimations that we take separately in dealing with these individual markets.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>But nevertheless what should be the price that we should look for in 2010, let's say, for Ukraine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The prices for Ukraine, according to the Intergovernmental Agreement, equal the pricing ratio of 0.9. And so by January 1, 2010, this ratio shall change, and so Ukraine will start receiving gas at the European price level.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Nadia Kazakova from JP Morgan. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>This question comes from JP Morgan. So the first one is about the purchased gas and oil, which is about RR 170.6 billion, which is the biggest line item on the expense side. So the request is to split these figures into the acquired oil from Gazprom Neft, then gas from the Middle Asia and the independent gas producers, because it will be very useful to see how this 170 billion splits into different positions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Mikhail Rosseev will answer the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So the purchased oil amounted during the first six months of '09 amounted to RR 168 billion &#x2013; RR 58 billion.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Compared to RR 81 billion during the first six months of '08.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now &#x2013; and as far as the costs related to buying gas &#x2013; buy gas from Germany Group, which is the gas being bought primarily in the European market this year amounted to RR 117 billion during six months this year compared to 96 billion during the first six months of last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And so consequently, the remaining gas was either bought from the independent producers or from the Central Asian producers and unfortunately, we don't have the detailed itemization in terms of each individual producer.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>I can only add by saying that this year the Central Asian gas amounted to approximately 22 billion Bcf while being 23 last year.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language].</p>
          <p>The question was about the attitude that the Group has about Novatek where it holds a minority position where the Gazprom is a shareholder, because on November 24 it is expected that Novatek will be asking Gazprom, as a shareholder, to either confirm or endorse a contract for the sale of gas to a company called OGK-1 and so, also to INTER RAO. So is the company planning to approve this contract? And generally speaking what is the attitude of Gazprom towards Novatek selling gas to third parties in the situation where it is bound by long term relationships? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As far as the relationship between Gazprom and the contracts that INTER RAO has, our position was already announced and commented upon by the Chairman of the Board of the company. We have entered into long term contracts with INTER RAO companies, which call upon a guaranteed deliveries of the volumes of gas for the period up to 2012.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>This contract remained in force and nobody has the legal right to terminate them unilaterally.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And specifically, as far as the Gazprom's position is concerned as the forthcoming consideration of this matter by the Board of Directors, since this particular transaction is a related party, one then Gazprom shall abstain from voting on it and this is it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Now the question was as follows. Since the question is about the minimum take-or-pay contracts. What is the situation currently with the minimum take-or-pay because the amounts that Gazprom is currently intending to sell this year is below the minimum take-or-pay obligation, so is Gazprom planning to insist on the minimum take-or-pay obligations amongst its counter-parties, this year and if possible we would also be interested to hear what will be the projections for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So overall the &#x2013; it is not that we are having an intention simply, because we have signed contracts and so we're going to stand true to our commitments. Now in terms of the minimum take-or-pay volumes, the situation is not very straightforward, which is about eight to nine billion, which is the volume that we are expecting for this year and without doubt, these are contractual obligations and so we have signed contracts and we are intending to make sure that they are met. Of course, there is a lot currently being debated about it as a topic. We hear that media is also taking up a lot of attention about it, but we will expect this to be done any ways, because as I said, this is a contractual commitment issue.</p>
          <p>As far as 2010 is concerned, although the economy is expected to revive itself, although this revival is not taking place at any side pace but I do not rule out the possibility that we will be confronted by similar problems next year, although the size of these problems is not going to be the same.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. I wanted to know in relation to the take-or-pay contracts with these European players, do you think the differential in price within the spot price of this should cause some level of renegotiation, because we're talking to some of the parties discussing these at least from a long term, if not for this year, and also following the development on conventional gas in the U.S., are you looking at any development of this type of gas in say Russia or any other part of Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As far as the question about the spot prices and the outlook for what it might, the way it might affect the take-or-pay contract. It is hard to envisage any influence that it may produce because we haven't noted any relationship. But nevertheless there are certain very rigid and strict obligations that within take-or-pay environment, the buyers are taking on and so, I would expect them to take exactly the kind of position that we as supplier are planning to do.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the American market is concerned and the spot price component in terms of the overall gas environment, the problem of the production of the shale gas is definitely, is heavily related to a cost burden. And so we do not foresee that it may acquire any strong influence as a factor &#x2013; the finding of the future and our gas structure so that is what we think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And separately on the topic of non-conventional gas as you have described, in Russia, we have a program for the production and the utilization of methane from coal, which is in the Kuznetsk Coal Basin, but gas which is thus produced will first and foremost will be intended for a domestic consumption without export.</p>

          <p>Next question please.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>We have time remaining for two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Konstantin Cherepanov from OV (sic) [UBS]. Please go ahead and ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So the first question comes from Mr. Cherepanov from UBS. And it is as follows. We can see on the results of the second quarter that the volume of sales of gas in roubles was 39 billion cubic meters. How much of this was from the trading operations by Gazprom, basically the gas, which was originally bought in Europe and then resold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Please allow me to take your question as one because we would like to give an opportunity for yet another participant to ask their question. So in terms of your question, we will have Mikhail Rosseev answering it and then Mr. Chelpanov.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So the total volume of gas, which was bought and sold by Gazprom Germany in terms of the amount of the trading operations amounts to RR 31 billion during six months this year compared to 17 billion of cubic meters of last year, so 31 billion cubic meters this year compared to 17 last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So in the second quarter, the sale of gas by Gazprom into remote abroad was about 31.6 billion cubic meters, but as far as trading operations with gas are concerned one should note that GMT, which is the 100% subsidiary of Gazprom is involved in this activity, but it works not only with Russian gas because it acquires gas in the liquid markets, so to say, and resold them as well.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>The question is about the state of the current status in terms of the contractual obligations that Gazprom has to buy the Middle Asian gas in '09, what is the average price that Gazprom is buying it at and what is the current status of negotiations with Turkmenistan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>As far as the acquiring the Middle Asian gas is concerned, we are acting within the contracts and the suppliers of Turkmenistan you know that in April these deliveries have been put on hold. The negotiations are currently taking place about the restarting of this at the level of the heads of the companies and hopefully, we will see them restarting quite soon. And as far as the commercial prices are concerned, I must admit that I am not in a position to disclose them at this point in time at least.</p>
