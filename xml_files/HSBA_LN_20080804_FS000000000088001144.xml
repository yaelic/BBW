          <p>...to our guests joining us from Hong Kong. I would also like to welcome those of you who are joining us via webcast or conference call.</p>
          <p>Let me start with a few introductions. In Hong Kong, we have our Executive Directors Vincent Cheng, Chairman of the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation and Sandy Flockhart, Chief Executive. Also in Hong Kong: Edgar Ancona, the Chief Financial Officer for Asia and Russell Picot, HSBC's Group Chief Accounting Officer.</p>
          <p>Alongside me here in London, our other Executive Directors, Mike Geoghegan our Group Chief Executive, Douglas Flint, Group Finance Director and Stuart Gulliver, Chief Executive of Global Banking and Markets. And I'm delighted to announce that in the front row we have two of our non-Executive Directors, Sir Brian Williamson, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. Thank you for joining us.</p>
          <p>Before we start; the usual cautionary words on forward-looking statements are on the screen in front of you.</p>
          <p>And I move to the headlines of our reported results. Profit of $10.2 billion before tax, down 28%, or down 22% after the dilution gains that you will recall inflated last year's first half.</p>
          <p>Attributable profit $7.7 billion down 29% or down 22% on that same basis; earnings per share $0.65, down 32%, or down 24% ex the dilution gains; and return on total shareholders' equity of 12.1% as compared with 19.1% last year.</p>
          <p>Dividends per share in respect of the first half was disclosed in the 2007 annual report and accounts, up 6% at $0.36. And our Tier 1 capital 8.8%, that's against 8.7% at the end of last year and our core equity Tier 1 ratio of 7.5%, which is in fact unchanged on the end of last year.</p>
          <p>When I look at this performance, I start, by the way, by saying that we put out more information, more disclosure on our market positions in relation to the financial markets turmoil than ever before and I hope that we'll succeed in conveying to you that we're a very conservatively positioned bank in respect to the market's turmoil.</p>
          <p>Overall, my take is that this is a resilient performance in what are the most difficult markets for several decades. The balance of earnings between markets and businesses helped cushion us from some of the impact of the market turmoil. We're profitable in all of our customer groups including Global Banking and Markets, and profitable across all of our geographies with the continuing exception of the US and the business difficulties, which we are working our way through there.</p>
          <p>There is the unwavering HSBC commitment to financial strength shown in those capital ratios and we've continued our dividend policy and our commitment to make capital available for future investment.</p>
          <p>One other feature of these results, the costs are I think very well controlled and all of the above has produced the result that we are in top five or so of our competitor peer group in terms of benchmark performance.</p>
          <p>But let me turn now to Douglas, who is going to take us through the financials in more detail. Douglas.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, thank you. Stephen has given you an outline of our overall performance and of general market conditions. I would now like to highlight the key figures behind the performance in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our net operating income before loan impairment charges rose 3% to $39 billion. Operating expenses were 8% higher at just over $20 billion. And loan impairment charges at just over $10 billion, a rise of 58%. Then the profit before tax was 28% lower than in the first half of 2007, at $10.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Revenue performance was constrained by write-downs in Global Banking and Markets at $3.9 billion. And this was a major driver in the cost efficiency ratio, easing out from 48.3 to 51%. This remained, however, within our target range of between 48 and 52% in part attributable to good cost performance in the developed markets.</p>
          <p>Comparing our underlying performance against the first half of last year and the adjustments to underlying are as in previous periods: currency translation impacts, acquisitions and the dilution gains that we reported last year. And on this basis our net operating income before loan impairment charges was up by 2%.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that revenue growth was achieved after absorbing the $3.9 billion write-down in Global Banking and Markets and hence revenue generation elsewhere, indeed much of it in the rest of Global Banking and Markets was very strong.</p>
          <p>Underlying growth in operating expenses was 4%, which we believe compares well with the rate of global inflation and Mike will be illustrating how all this was achieved in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the most significant underlying change remains the 55% growth in loan impairment charges to which I'll return later. If you compare underlying performance against the second half of last year, you will note that both income and costs are down modestly. Notably the loan impairment charge was 8% lower than the second half of last year and that was driven by the US. As a consequence, pre-tax profits were broadly flat.</p>
          <p>This slide draws together, simply for ease of reference, the special factors we have highlighted affecting the last three half year performances. These items relate simply to the gains arising from dilution of our interests in our Chinese and other associates. Fair value adjustments from credit spread movements on our own debt, market turmoil write-downs taken in Global Banking and Markets.</p>
          <p>And a new item in this period, a goodwill impairment charge in respect of our North American Personal Financial Services Business. From my perspective what this reveals is the underlying progress made against both halves of 2007, and in particular the second half of last year has been good.</p>
          <p>This slide shows that the risk weighted assets have been growing in line with loans and deposits. Now, as you'll be aware under Basel II the risk-weighted asset calculation has many, many moving parts and so the risk-weighted assets movement on this slide primarily reflects growth in commercial credit generally, growth in personal lending in emerging markets, higher market risk capital requirements because of market volatility, offset in part by a reduction from higher risk lending in the United States.</p>
          <p>And these risk weighted asset movements translate through to a Tier 1 ratio of 8.8%, in line with that achieved at the end of 2007. The comparative figure for the end of 2007 has been restated from the pro forma basis we used in last year's accounts to an actual basis. And as Stephen says our core equity Tier 1 ratio remained unchanged at 7.5%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to retail credit quality. This slide shows that for personal banking outside of the US, we did better in Europe driven by the UK and we saw some deterioration in Latin America driven by Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our loan impairment charges remained low. And finally, North America the impairment charges which are clearly driven by the US were $3.2 billion higher than in the first half of 2007, but $1.2 billion lower than the second half experienced. And Mike will be taking you through the portfolio trends in the US in more detail, in his remarks.</p>
          <p>In Commercial Banking, credit experience has again been broadly stable with Asia standing out as remarkably low, which reflects the buoyant economic conditions. We expect developed markets to progressively incur higher credit charges as economic slowdown impact spending patterns.</p>
          <p>Turning to Global Banking and Markets. This slide summarizes the source of the write-downs. There are five important points I would make. Firstly, illiquid trading positions have remained materially unchanged since the end of last year and thus the write-downs reflect falling valuations of existing positions and not new risk.</p>
          <p>Secondly, as regards asset backed securities, which are the first and second lines on the slide, valuations reflect on a security-by-security basis, underlying asset quality, origination vintage and the extent of over-collateralization as well as significant discounts for market illiquidity. Where we can benchmark our valuations, we believe these lie at the conservative end of the market range.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on leveraged loan exposure, i.e. the third line, the write-downs relate to illiquidity. The principle underlying corporate exposure is meeting the performance metrics that were forecast when the underwriting commitment was made. Indeed had this loan &#x2013; or had this exposure been categorized as a loan in our books, we would not be raising an impairment provision.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, the additional write-downs in monoline exposure reflect the decline in the valuations of the underlying asset-backed securities, together with deterioration in the financial strength of certain monoline insurers.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that of the remaining $1.3 billion net mark-to-market exposure to monolines, over 90% is to insurers which are rated by Standard and Poor's at BBB or above.</p>
          <p>And finally, to note we have no material exposure to CDOs on asset-backed securities, which are backed by US subprime assets. Having dealt comprehensively with asset-backed securities held within the trading books, I now want to address the position on asset-backed securities held as available for sale and so marked-to-fair value through equity, thus subject to impairment testing. You'll see in the accounts that there is a deficit in the available for sale reserve of $7.3 billion at the 30th of June versus a surplus of $850 million at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities held within Global Banking and Markets account for the overwhelming majority of the Group's fair value adjustments for AFS [Available For Sale] assets. And the total portfolio of such assets represents just under $70 billion of book value, and that's some $10 billion lower than the position at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Over 75% of this book value exposure is to prime retail mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities to US government agencies and to student loans, all of good asset quality, of good origination vintage and well-supported by over collateralization.</p>
          <p>Roughly half of the remaining subprime and Alt-A exposure is held through conduits, which benefit from first loss protection from third parties and thus the impairments on the slide of $134 million, which has been recognized during the period falls to their account, not to ours. There is remaining after this attribution of impairment a further 1.2 billion of loss protection available from this first loss protection to protect our profit and loss account.</p>
          <p>And finally, regarding the remaining directly held exposure, while fair value movement has been significant as credit spreads have widened, actual impairment, that is projected cash flow deficiency, is actually very modest, but precipitates the reversal through the profit and loss account of the $55 million cumulative fair value deficit, which is in reserves.</p>
          <p>Lastly on market risk metrics, three points to draw to your attention. Firstly, the increase in value at risk was mainly due to two factors, positioning for the falling interest rates in both US dollar and Hong Kong dollar interest rates, as well as increased market volatility during the period.</p>
          <p>Secondly, to note that the daily distribution of global market revenues was more dispersed than our normal pattern, as a result of the market conditions, which has impacted all market participants.</p>
          <p>And finally to note that the vast majority of our trading positions are valued with reference to quoted market prices or using observable inputs to valuation models.</p>
          <p>HSBC's exposure to valuation risk from illiquid and distraught positions remain modest with only 3% of our trading assets having to be valued with reference to significant and unobservable price inputs.</p>
          <p>Let me now pass you over to Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Douglas, Stephen highlighted the challenges in our industry and obviously at HSBC we are impacted as well. However, the Group Management Board of HSBC has more global experience than most teams in banking today. In fact collectively it has over 300 years of experience and many have seen two or more past banking crises across the world in their lives, which positions them well for this current one. It is this team that has been implementing our strategy of moving our profit before tax towards the 60% contribution from emerging markets whilst reengineering our businesses in developed markets through joining up the company.</p>
          <p>Let me now outline our progress. In March 2008, we advised you of the key metrics that we are using to measure the company and ourselves over the cycle. In this, the first half of 2008 we have impressively met our measures except in the area of return on shareholders equity, which although not meeting the range was a credible 12.1% in particularly difficult times.</p>
          <p>Turning to our geographical spread of business and taking out last year's dilution gains, we've seen very pleasing growth in Asia including the Middle-East, Latin America and surprisingly strong results in Europe, particularly in the UK. The weakness has been in the United States, both in regard to Personal Financial Services and Global Banking and Markets. However, despite the USA we were profitable in all our business segments.</p>
          <p>Now let me drill down and take the regions first. In Asia, we had profits of $6.7 billion, which are certainly impressive, but at first glance the business looks flat. But there is a reason for that. In the first half of 2007 you'll remember we benefited from our one-off dilution gains and we highlighted this at the time. When this is excluded, profits are up 20% year-on-year. Year-on-year in Hong Kong, profits are down 8% and down 23% <mark type="inaudible" /> comparing it with the first half of &#x2013; the second half of 2007. This is partly due to us having to write-down some of our strategic investments in Vietnam and India as their stock markets have fallen. Without these write-downs, the results would have been flat. However, these investments are long-term financial stakes in two very important emerging markets. And we're very happy to have them.</p>
          <p>Commercial Banking in Hong Kong had a record performance and deposit growth was up overall 11%. What is clear is how exceptional 2007 results were. Results are still strong, but with a falling stock market, there is less revenue opportunity in our wealth management and private banking businesses. And low US interest rates are constraining deposit spreads. Hong Kong remains an extraordinarily robust business, but it is contrary to some people's views, not totally decoupled from what is going on in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>The other side of the coin is the rest of Asia, excluding the Middle East where the profits are up 58% year-on-year and 34% against the second half, Global Banking and Markets had an exceptional performance with profits up 75% to $1.5 billion. That is clearly demonstrating that our emerging markets-led and financed focus strategy is working.</p>
          <p>Looking at Asia by country, double-digit profit before tax can be seen almost everywhere. You can see we have better than 40% growth in Australia, China, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan.</p>
          <p>China, excluding dilution gains in the first half of last year, was up 92%, which means progress just isn't being made through our Chinese associates. We grew our own China business by 85%. Because of our strong brand recognition in China and our ability to service Chinese corporates investing in trading out of China and international companies coming into China.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East, where we made nearly $1 billion, we were strong across all our customer groups, both on a year-on-year basis and on a trailing basis. To put this into perspective, it was only two years ago that I stood here and I was saying we made a billion dollars in one year. This business is now a major contributor to the Group.</p>
          <p>Profit grew in Latin America by 27% to $1.3 billion and was spread across all our businesses there, particularly in Brazil. Global Banking and Markets had strong gain in revenue and profit before tax from expanded product capabilities in the region, another example of joining up the company.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we continue to reengineer our businesses. In the UK, since calling the top of the market in late 2006, we have been strengthening our credit standards in our unsecured personal loans and card portfolios. Consequently, we haven't yet experienced any real deterioration in credit quality in these portfolios.</p>
          <p>On the mortgage side, we purposely scaled back in 2007 when we felt pricing was unrealistic. We did stand into the market in April of this year when others couldn't, lending a total of $11 billion in the first half. This was a good example of us using our capital for organic growth as well as benefiting our customers who were switching their deposits to HSBC.</p>
          <p>We are monitoring the mortgage market carefully, focusing on quality house centers who are being let down by others. These new customers are not just moving their mortgages, but they are bringing their entire banking relationships to HSBC.</p>
          <p>In France, we've completed the sale of our six regional subsidiaries at an exit multiple of 21 times earnings and the resultant profit will be reflected in our second half results. We're now focusing on rolling out premier and commercial banking centers in Paris and other major cities.</p>
          <p>Turning now to North America. The region continues to disappoint, but we remain resolute in fixing our business there. We cautioned in late 2006 that we saw weakening consumer markets and regrettably, we haven't been proved wrong.</p>
          <p>The deteriorating US economy continues to affect our Personal Financial Services business. However, outstandings are down and two plus delinquencies appear to be stabilizing. I'll expand on that in a moment. The fallout from the market turmoil also impacted our Global Banking and Markets business in the United States and I'll come back to that as well.</p>
          <p>Turning to Personal Financial Services, it's a tale of two businesses. Profit before tax fell 51% to $2.3 billion, as US loan impairment charges rose, but like Asia, there is a story underneath the headline, excluding the US Personal Financial Services business. Profit before tax was up 33% to $4.5 billion with progress in both developed and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, we are expanding our Asian branch network by over 60 branches in the first half of this year. We grew a strong balance sheet in the Middle East and we increased our share of credit cards in Mexico and raised our deposits in Brazil.</p>
          <p>HSBC, our direct banking system is ahead of expectations. We increased the customer base by 15% and grew total deposits to over $16 billion, despite very stiff competition in the United States.</p>
          <p>In the USA, our Personal Financial Services business made a loss of $2.2 billion. Although delinquencies increased, they were broadly in line with expectations. Loan impairment charges were up 85% compared to the first half of 2007, but down by 15% compared to the second half.</p>
          <p>Our exposure continues to fall and our performance continuous to improve. Costs overall were down 14% from the first half of 2007 and second &#x2013; and two plus delinquencies appeared to have leveled-out for the last three quarters.</p>
          <p>Looking at our mortgage business, if we take the mortgage services first on the left hand side of the screen, where you'll remember, we said in March 2007 this was a portfolio we intended to run off over three years. You can see that we reduced the portfolio by close to $5 billion 13%, around 60% of this was from repayments.</p>
          <p>Our outstandings on this portfolio have fallen around $5 billion per half year for the last three sets of results. The rate of deterioration the two plus delinquencies has declined and importantly the US dollar level of two plus delinquencies has stabilized over the last three quarters.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, we show consumer mortgage lending originated through our branches and the level of deterioration there has not yet stabilized. We continue to tighten credit standards and the portfolio size has leveled-off. For both portfolios, we are not calling the bottom of the market. We believe that we are benefiting however from our early recognition of the subprime problem.</p>
          <p>As volumes of new mortgage and personal unsecured loans have slowed further, we have trimmed back our branch network to 900 branches and we continue to work to address customer problems. We've expanded the modification and foreclosure programs. We continue to work with our customers in the most constructive way possible.</p>
          <p>The mortgage business is personal to me, because we're talking about people's homes. We will always go the extra mile and I am proud of the way our colleagues have been truly caring for our customers.</p>
          <p>In both our credit cards and private label businesses, our dollar delinquencies have slowed which compares well against industry trends and we have managed down our balances. The business is core to us and we certainly hope that the current trends continue, but obviously the risk of unemployment is a concern. We increased collections in the unsecured personal credit market and lowered our balance sheet by about $1.7 billion from the comparable period last year.</p>
          <p>In vehicle finance, the credit quality of the portfolio actually improved over the period. But it's not group-to-group strategy &#x2013; core to group strategy and does not have a critical mass. And so we have announced today that we will not originate further vehicle loans. We envisage running off the majority of the portfolio in the coming three years. From now on, our consumer-based finance business will focus mainly on cards and consumer lending through our branch network.</p>
          <p>Turning to Commercial Banking, Commercial Banking continues to be resilient across the world with a profit before tax of $4.6 billion up by 35%. This number, however, includes a one-off gain of $425 million from the sale of the UK card acquiring business to a joint venture with Global Payments. Excluding this underlying growth in the period, profits were up 22% and 70% of that growth came from emerging markets, which now accounts for 50% &#x2013; 54% of the total commercial banking profits, another example of our strategy working.</p>
          <p>Growth was strong in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia Pacific, particularly in China and India. We had a great half in Brazil with increased transactions, increased lending and increased foreign exchange, and loan impairment charges fell.</p>
          <p>The UK had a strong performance in a difficult market. Our signature finance strength here is attracting customer deposits and we grew average lending balances by 13%. However, we've been watching lending standards as we expect continued turbulence and other less capitalized banks become unable to support their customers. We will be selective in this market.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we grew our small business customer base by 8% to 2.9 million customers. We were especially strong in Turkey, Taiwan, China and India.</p>
          <p>We expanded our Business Direct online banking proposition in the UK and Brazil and now have 150,000 businesses singed up to this product. We will launch in India and Northern Ireland in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Global Banking and Markets, like Personal Financial Services there are two parts. On the one hand there were write-downs, on the other our emerging markets led finance focused strategy paid off.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets profit before tax was up 51%. Global Banking and Markets now represent 26% on the Group's total profits. Foreign exchange reported record revenues of the back off greater market volatility and higher customer volume across all regions.</p>
          <p>Customer activity and deal growth helped strong results in rates. And the Security Services Business continued to grow despite lower interest rates and lower equity markets, as the flight to quality continues with more institutional customers choosing HSBC.</p>
          <p>Our international reach works as well. We helped clients across 29 sectors and 60 countries with cross-border transactions with a notional value of more than $1 trillion. Some landmark cross-border deals includes Vale's $12.2 billion global equity offering, the Ford sale of Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors and being sole book runner of PetroRabigh's $1.2 billion IPO, the first ever by a Saudi Aramco affiliate. True testaments that the markets are working between the developing teams and the developed market teams and our progress in Global Banking and Markets was recognized by Euromoney's Best Global Emerging Markets Bank award.</p>
          <p>The key takeaway here is that we generated a profit of $2.7 billion in the half, bucking the trend with a 37% increase on the second half of 2007. Even more impressive, that 37% comes with a headwind of write-downs of 3.9 billion in the first half versus 2.1 billion in the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Private Banking. Private Banking had a good half year; pre-tax profits were up 5% to $822 million mostly down to strong performances in Switzerland and Monaco. Total client assets were stable at nearly $500 billion. Our emerging markets reach is growing here as well, 59% of our Private Banking business came from emerging markets and we opened three new offices in China. Net new money from inter-group referrals increased 70% to $3.4 billion; more proof that joining up the company works.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Insurance. Pre-tax profits were $1.6 billion, 16% of the total group profit before tax. Premium growth was up 30% mainly driven by Latin America, the US and the UK. And this came in the main from joining up the company initiatives with a tight cost base. We also started operations in India and a joint venture in Korea. We now have strategic partners in 23 countries with 82 product launches agreed in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Throughout this presentation, you have seen revenue examples of joining up the company taking hold and here are some more, our top paying international Personal Financial Services proposition, Premier, attracted more than 200,000 new customers in the six months, as 80% of them were new to bank, much more in the 50% that we were expecting.</p>
          <p>Global Links, our international referral service for commercial customers, saw a 126% increase in cross border referrals, resulting in $5.6 billion of new facilities being granted. The concept of joining up the company is now truly embedded in this company. But we have always maintained that the real value is when the re-engineering of the cost base takes place.</p>
          <p>From the list of One HSBC systems and services that you can see on the screen, the re-engineering is now at the full global implementation stage and whilst the slowing of the cost growth in the first half is impressive, there is a lot more productivity and savings to be made yet but we are definitely on the journey of radically reengineering this company.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, a typical workman-like performance from HSBC, the Managing Board takes nothing for granted and continues to tell it as it is, in a conservative and transparent manner. We are confident in demonstrating that our strategy is working. We are offsetting weakness in some markets with growing strength in others. We remain focused and resolute on working out the USA businesses whilst using our ongoing capital strength, our global distribution and our ever strengthening brand to reach out and attract new customers in all markets.</p>
          <p>We know that the biggest prize is to reengineer the cost base through joining up the company. We also know our biggest asset is our 335,000 staff in 85 countries and territories, who I personally would like to thank at this stage.</p>
          <p>The financial world is an uncertain place, but I'm confident in the management's ability to stick to HSBC's driving principles of being capital strong, being self funded and being with its customers in the good times and the bad.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand you back to Stephen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mike, thank you. And I'd like just to end with a few words on the outlook and the way in which we positioned HSBC. I don't think you will be surprised to hear me say that the near term outlook remains negative with a significant degree of uncertainty. The US is weak, the UK has been weakening. There is pressure from inflation on growth in several fast-growing economies around the world. We see a risk of declining credit availability as financial markets de-leverage, which increases the risk of delinquency and default in a number of sectors.</p>
          <p>So far as emerging markets growth is concerned, we do see that holding up reasonably well albeit with less momentum than last year. There is a lot of uncertainty around, what else can one say? So far as HSBC is concerned, we continue to pursue the implementation of our strategy. And our strategy is based on three major world trends, which we don't believe are impacted by the current short-term market difficulties.</p>
          <p>The fact that emerging markets are going to grow faster than mature ones; we believe that is going to continue for the foreseeable future, the fact that world trade and investment will tend to grow faster than the world economy, the fact that the aging of the human race is creating new demands of financial services as demographic profiles change in virtually every country. These are mega trends, if you will on which we based our strategy and we've spoken a great deal about that over the last 18 months to two years and we do not believe that the current financial market turmoil has in any way called into question those major trends.</p>
          <p>We built our strategy on the basis of some key and we believe compelling advantages we have: an extremely strong financial services brand as Mike was saying, we have that unwavering commitment to capital and liquidity strength. And we have a broad based business with international connectivity which we believe plays very well to the circumstances of the modern age. And to repeat these are not changed by current short-term financial economic financial difficulties.</p>
          <p>And then therefore, we are the world's leading international bank in emerging markets. So we think, we have a great deal to build on, but these are difficult times and in that context, we are pleased that we presented as Mike said, a workman-like and robust set of results.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the floor over to you, questions. What I would like to do is just to make sure that we orchestrate the process between London and Hong Kong. If you could raise your hand then we will get a microphone to you. In Hong Kong Vincent will invite the next questioner and I will do the same from London. We'd be grateful, if you could tell us your name and your organization before you ask the question. And I would be grateful if you could try and limit yourself to one question per turn.</p>
          <p>To avoid any confusion between London and Hong Kong, I'll choose the person to answer the question and on any follow-ups. Vincent, would you like to take the first question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you; it's Alistair Scarff from Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. Firstly, congratulations on the solid set of numbers. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on your balance sheet management revenues? They jumped quite strongly. At the first, I guess, when your results provide &#x2013; when you presented your full year results, you guided that you'd increase your duration or take position to protect from falling US rates. Obviously this is a big jump. Is that going to decline in the second half or is your position a short-term one and could run off in terms of the contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. For the question I'm going to ask Stuart to take that if I may. Stuart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Yes, we positioned for falling US and Hong Kong interest rates because &#x2013; and actually falling sterling rates, because we suspected that central banks would need to ease rates given the state of the markets. As concern about inflation has arisen, we've reduced the size of those positions. And you can actually see the positions in the VaR graph, so you can actually see when we took the positions VaR jumped: a) because we'd increased the size of the positions; b) because volatility had increased. Then as volatility continued to increase and we reduced the size of the position, the VaR stayed more or less where it was and then dropped off into the 30th of June. So you should not look to the same number for balance sheet management in the second half as the first. But the second half should be higher than either of the halves one or two of 2007.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Question from here, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. It's Tom Rayner from Citigroup. Could I ask one question with two parts please: the first on your delinquency trends in the US, the second on your write-down and your OpEx financial exposures? Just on the delinquency trends we're seeing come through in the US consumer finance business, they seem to be leveling off in the second quarter in every asset class, except maybe the branch generated mortgages. I just wondered, if you could update us on your thoughts going forward and also what you are seeing in terms of loss severity whether house price movements are making you reassess loss severity as well as where delinquencies are going? And I have a second follow-up part of the question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, right. Well, if I can preface it by saying you wouldn't expect me to make a forecast for the second half, would you? And not merely would I not do that in general, but these are particularly uncertain times and I think it would be folly for us to go projecting out what has been a &#x2013; as you refer to it in most categories a leveling off or a slight improvement in the second quarter except in consumer lending.</p>
          <p>Douglas, do you want to talk to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean. I think the drivers of the delinquency rates are a number of factors. Clearly a slowing US economy is adversely hitting real estate, secured and unsecured, probably unsecured more. But the fact that book is coming down is elevating two plus delinquencies as a percentage but keeping the dollar amount of delinquency particularly in real estate lending relatively flat.</p>
          <p>In terms of severity, we have seen a tick up in real estate severity in the first half of this year, but not a dramatic one. And I think encouragingly all through the first half of this year, we've seen a very stable position in relation to those homes that we end up having to own. We have been able to move those homes on with around about the same loss and disposal within 180 days. It's been 180 days for the last 2-and-a-bit years, which I think is encouraging, saying that there is a kind of market at the bottom end for standard homes.</p>
          <p>The other place we are seeing a little bit higher severity, which is one of the reasons we've taken the actions we have in terms of stopping origination is in auto because of the lack of interest or declining interest in SUVs and trucks, because of fuel costs. So the severities on repossessed vehicles is rising there, but I think &#x2013; I think the thing I would say broad picture particularly in the real estate secures is that the &#x2013; since we stopped underwriting in mortgage services in the middle of '06, the portfolio is now at least two years old and therefore the underwriting issues are through the system, and what we're now exposed to is economic factors. And that's now what's driving the book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Tom, if you want to get in your second part, quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. I'm just trying to get a sense for why the AFS reserve hits &#x2013; the magnitude was so much bigger in Q2. We weren't seeing these sorts of trends coming through in the first quarter, I was just try to get a sense for what has deteriorated to make those sort of amounts that much more significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Credits spread widening, I mean we saw credit spread widening and that was a major thing. As you aware, the accounting is also quite curious, in the sense that the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You need a Finance Director to say that kind of thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Very curious, in the sense that mark-to-market obviously reflects issues on credit issues on sort of asset preference and liquidity preference, all of which goes into the AFS reserve. We then do a security by security analysis as to whether we think the cash flows are impaired to see whether in fact any of that fair value movement that's gone through reserves needs to be recycled. And very little did, which shows that the vast majority of what we're recognizing is today about liquidity and asset preference, but the accounting is such that to the extent that you get any impairment in cash flows, you take the whole of the deficit that's gone to reserves back through the P&amp;L account. Now for us that was only $55 million in the quarter &#x2013; sorry in the half. But the movement is simply more illiquid markets and wider credit spreads as a result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stuart, do you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also the reason that increased in the second quarter, because second quarter is when a number of banks raised equity capital and the underwriters for the equity capital raising would have gone through and done a due diligence on their assets and forced them to mark-down to the most conservative position, because they obviously have legal underwriting and capital at risk in underwriting the deals and the second quarter is basically when a lot of bank capital was raised. So, therefore, we're going to be impacted by a general markdown on equivalent assets that's taking place across the market.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I've got two questions but one of them is a simple factual question. I might have missed that. But has the gain on the head office sale been booked or is there a sense on timing on that? And the second question is the goodwill impairment charge taken at HFC at the subsidiary level and at the head office level still seems to be a different. Could you give us a sense whether you would be taking a charge on goodwill at the Group level? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the first question the answer is no. It has not been taken in these results. On the goodwill; Douglas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The goodwill impairment is just over $500 million. It's different from what was taken in the US and that's simply because the cash generating units that are assessed in each of the analyses are different. In the finance company, the cash generating units were each of: auto, mortgage services, consumer lending and cards and all of the goodwill was written-off with the exception of cards. We look at the cash generating units as North American PFS in aggregate. And, therefore, we have three &#x2013; four very positive units: cards, Retail Banking in the US, Retail Banking in Canada and Retail Banking in Bermuda and then we have the more problem portfolios in real estate secured and consumer lending. The aggregate at the end of last year was a surplus. When we redid the calculation at the end of June this year, there was a deficit and that deficit has been reflected through the profit and loss account. It's a non-cash item but that's the way the numbers came out.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Arturo De Frias from Dresdner Kleinwort. Also a question on capital with derivation into dividend. You were discussing before your AFS reserve, which is obviously not impacting your quarter one, but is impacting your tangible equity or your tangible NAV. And because the AFS reserve has increased substantially, if I'm correct &#x2013; and your shareholders equity is pretty much stable, if I'm correct, your tangible NAV has fallen more than 10% versus December, around 10 billion, which is of course, a substantial decrease. You said that it's mainly because of the spreads widening and mainly because of some investment banks taking higher marks, but we just saw Merrill Lynch taking much higher marks than anybody else. So we could see the trend continuing and we could see the spreads widening. And if that's the case, we could see additional AFS reserve increases, which in turn could increase &#x2013; sorry could decrease even more the capital. Is &#x2013; there is a point where you start to be kind of concerned not with your core Tier 1, because again the AFS reserve doesn't impact it, but with your tangible NAV with your shareholders equity.</p>
          <p>And then the deviation into dividends, I was also looking in your information that in this first half the payout ratio, the divided payout ratio has been very high, has been 88%, because of the obviously much smaller EPS. If we were to continue to see additional write-downs in the US and we were to continue to see flattish EPS going forward. There is a point when you reconsider your dividend because obviously you can not keep nearly 90% dividend payout ratio for long? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just on the very last point, we review our dividends as we go so that we've announced the first, second and third dividends. We did so at the time when we produced our annual results and that's where we're at. Douglas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean the &#x2013; let me deal with the payout ratio first. The payout ratio is &#x2013; I would argue isn't 88%, I mean the way IFRS works, you take not the two dividends we've declared in this period i.e. 18, plus 18, but you take the last dividend for the &#x2013; the closing dividend for last year, so you get a disproportionately high dividend in the first half. We still look at it in an old-fashioned basis of attribute allocation or profit. So it's $0.36 out of 65.</p>
          <p>I'll need to look at your numbers on tangible book because shareholders' funds are basically flat and that's after the AFS write-downs that you talked about, which as you alluded to, do not have an impact for capital, but shareholders' funds are flat.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the original face value of the first loss was 1.8 billion, correct? And it was 1.3 billion at the beginning of 2008. So these losses essentially wipes that out, these write-downs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In respect of the positions where, there is first loss protection. There is a market value write-down that's gone through reserves that then is assessed to what extent is that market value write-down represented by deficiency of cash flow and therefore impairment and that measure's at 134 million. We don't have to recognize that 134 million because we've got 1.3 billion of protection from first loss protection, essentially the note holders in the conduits. To the extent that further of the fair value adjustment or mark comes to impairment, then once it exhausts the 1.2 billion of residual protection that we have then we would be exposed. But we think we are a very, very long way from that. And indeed again, the impairment of 134 is a reversal of the deficit that had gone to the AFS reserve, the actual impairment measured is less than that. So we think we have a considerable amount of protection on those assets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank Stephen. It's Tim Sykes from Execution. Just a quick question on the US. When we last met, you talked about 1,000 branches in the US and that being the right size. Since then, obviously, there is 100 branches gone and also you decided to run-off the auto portfolio. Is there a fundamental shift in what you see as the residual business in HFC? I think we thought before that with the portfolios that are in run-off you'd be looking at something like $100 billion in residual assets and 1000 branches and then a business that you can grow. How do you re-assess that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly you're right. We're looking for 100 billion worth of assets. We trimmed the branch network &#x2013; a few here and there &#x2013; I wouldn't take anything in between 900 and 1000 as just geographical spread. On the Auto finance side, basically, we're driving the business through the discipline of what is the long-term return on equity we can make from various different businesses. If you're going to run the business on a 15 to 19% ROE, we looked at this business and said, have we got critical mass? Have we got pricing power? What's the credit outlook for this sect? I mean, all of those things, we've said actually credit quality is actually quite strong. This is the time to unwind this business, because there is just not a return on equity, and put that equity to work somewhere else in the business. There is a lot of equity tied up in that &#x2013; on that business. So we are just adjusting and on the journey to get down to the 100 billon.</p>

          <p>Thank you. If &#x2013; I am sorry, it's just &#x2013; very, very quickly if I can. Stuart, could you comment on the factors, which have driven the strong performance in rates and FX and their durability into the second half please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, rates and FX have both benefited from very high levels of volatility in G3 markets but &#x2013; and that's obviously central banks a) cutting rates and then b) the uncertain outlook in terms of inflation has created volatility, which we have been able to trade correctly. But also in emerging markets, because throughout some of the Middle Eastern countries, you have speculation about revaluations, which have caused an enormous increase in client interest in hedging. And in the emerging markets of Asia Pacific, again there has been reasonable levels of volatility, so therefore reasonable levels of client activity. Most of my FX business is actually client based, it's not profits it's by &#x2013; far the way &#x2013; the majority of it is client facing and there were big levels of volatility increasing levels therefore of hedging requirements in FX and the same really applies in rates. Very uncertain markets, which we're all dealing with, actually in the area of rates and FX, create big hedging opportunities and trading opportunities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello? Yeah, okay. Thank you. It's John Wadle from UBS. Can you explain on page 220 on the derivative exposures, you've increased the credit derivatives in the past half year? And just wanted to understand what your feeling is about counterparty risk in the derivatives market? And how you manage the risk, given that you have increased credit derivatives over the past year quite a lot? And report about 2 trillion of gross credit derivative exposures. So just wanted to understand how much of your revenues are you generating from this area of business activity and what do you assess as the risks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John Thank you for the question. I would like to &#x2013; Douglas maybe comment on the numbers and then Stuart on the business indications.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean you see in the balance sheet both the fair value of assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities has moved out markedly and that's primarily to do with spread widening in the period rather than increase in business volume. There's some element of that, but the big impact has just been the fair market value on both sides of the balance sheet. And again to make the boring accounting point, if you look at European banks against the US banks, we have much bigger figures because we are not allowed to net for accounting purposes, for our credit support agreements and credit mitigation in effect, because we don't intend to settle them out whereas the Americans net down to a net market risk exposure, we gross up. But &#x2013; I mean that's really it.</p>
          <p>Stuart, from the business perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the business point of view, yes, the counterparty risk is a significant issue, I think, for the entire industry. Transacting and hedging with counterparties who then themselves aren't solvent at the point you wish to cull on the hedge is obviously something we're all facing as a challenge. And indeed, I think it's something that a report that Douglas has been involved in with Corrigan, which gets published later this week, is looking to make some recommendations. I think, ultimately, the credit derivative market will move to some sort of exchange based mutual collateralization type of market to take out the counterparty risk. And we will be huge supporters of that, because it is a residual risk that's effectively &#x2013; in a way creates concentration, because you end up with a few counterparties. Because obviously, you're trying to avoid same way around risk. That creates a new risk which is you end up with the majority of the credit derivative book with four or five counterparties. Ultimately, this will get solved by exchange type of mutual collateralization process which as I say, Douglas and others who have been involved in this Corrigan report are recommending.</p>

          <p>Thanks, morning. It's Simon Samuels, Citigroup. I kind of partly want to speak up on that last point actually, as well, it's &#x2013; if I look at your loans deposit ratio as a group, you are running about 9, early 90s percent, which is a kind of very lower number compared to other banks of the world. But obviously, is a lot higher than you used to be, sort of, ten years ago. I also look at things like your borrowings from other banks just exceeding $150 billion at the moment. And I guess the kind of two parts question to that really is first of all, do you see any signs that you're coming up against counterparty limits on the other side? So essentially my point is, are you becoming too big to fund yourself in wholesale markets? Any signs of that, because you are a single name.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, linked to that, I mean if you roll the Group's balance sheet forward several years from here, would you expect that loan to deposit ratio to kind of start unwinding back down again, meaningfully, maybe to a level it had been say, ten years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, this is really one for you. Of course to the first question, the answer is very clearly, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean funding issues, no. A lot of the liabilities to banks reflect their deposits with us and indeed simple trading accounts and therefore not essentially funding. I think we are very comfortable with an advance deposit ratio in the kind of space where it is just now so, I wouldn't see it moving dramatically differently from where it was.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can I just follow-up on that, I'm just thinking about the implications for your acquisition policy then. I mean, does it sort of follow from that that any meaningful acquisitions would have to be essentially self funded from a loans deposit relationship perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think largely speaking it does follow from that, I mean, a number of other points I would make about acquisitions, one, is they've got to fit into the Group's strategy. You don't buy something because it's cheap. And I think you would look at the way in which the business you were acquiring is funded. Absolutely yeah, I think it's one of the key criteria.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. It's Nick Lord from Macquarie. Going back actually on to your Global Banking and Markets revenues in the first half, I seem to remember when you did the interim management statement, one of the comments you made was that you'd had a very good first quarter because of that hedging but that the activity had dropped off after the first quarter. I wonder if you could comment on sort of the split first quarter second half ex- the losses and whether or not that statement still holds true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second quarter was slightly slower than the first quarter. So we were probably slightly gloomier than the actual outturn, because volatility spiked higher in sort of May and June it spiked higher again. But it was definitely the case that the second quarter was slower than the first.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Robert Law of Lehman. My question concerns Hong Kong and the erosion particularly in the cost income ratio there. Certainly, the Hong Kong contribution overall was lower than I had and you've grown the cost base by about 20%. Could you comment on some of the reasons for that? And whether you would view that as the kind of level of ratio that you would be running at in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a very good question. Mike would you like to turn to that and maybe Sandy after you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly. Clearly growing the business in Hong Kong, you know Hong Kong takes &#x2013; there is a lot of pieces &#x2013; that cost base is spread out across the region. The fact of the matter is that we have been investing in the business and we continue to see the growth in that business long-term. And you wouldn't expect us to stand back, because our organic strategy is what we're implementing. And it's in the region that we want to do. But I'm happy to let Sandy to drill down to the particular elements. Sandy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously in Hong Kong with the drop in markets and some of our investments as well, these came through to the bottom line through P&amp;L. So if you take in fact the core businesses of Global Banking and Markets, PFS and Commercial Banking they were up. But there was a drag caused by impairment charges that were taken through the books in the first half. Inflation is an issue going forward, we're cognizant of that fact and we've been very careful in terms of recruitment going forward in terms of the Hong Kong business as a whole. So I think you'll see that our investments in terms of numbers of employees et cetera will reduce as we move into the second half of the year. But the underlying business is sound and still growing, but there have been issues caused particularly by equity markets and that's come through, as I said in impairments on the investments and equally as well on our insurance and reserves. So these are the main factors that have caused that drag down in terms of overall work comparisons with the second half of '07 which is a very strong half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandy, thank you. Next question is from &#x2013; yeah, please.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Ian Smillie from ABN. Can I invite you to add some color to your deposit performance which look to have slowed down fairly sharply after a strong second half last year? And in particular, it looks like deposits in Hong Kong and North America both went backwards. So if you could just color in for us what's happening there and perhaps give us some sense as to what we should expect in the deposit performance going forward, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take it firstly. I mean you got to look at overnight deposits in Hong Kong, I mean, 0.01% is the rate we are paying for them. The reality is we've just got to be careful of the liquidity that we attract because we have to place it in the market. And basically what many people are doing in your institutions as well, are pushing their risk to us. In other words, we're being asked take deposits on your behalf and then we are taking the risk of placing then back into the financial &#x2013; into financial institutions. So we have been curtailing back on that but you shouldn't read anything into that.</p>
          <p>On the USA, as we said in the commentary, the &#x2013; our direct business there experienced stiff competition from others trying to attract deposits as well. And as we are self-funding ourselves at the bank level there, we didn't go out overly actively due to build the deposit base there. But we are staying in the market and taking some P&amp;L impact on it. No, there is no change in the strategy, but we've just got to be realistic that we just take funding to meet our customer requirements and go build out our funding to meet your desires to move the risk to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should expect the second half to be more of the same of the first half rather than more like last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot depends on interest rates as particularly in emerging markets with inflation. There if interest rates begin to rise it may well be that we will take funding. It depends on a lot of market conditions.</p>

            <mark type="Inaudible" />. My question is about the credit card portfolio in the United States which has performed exceptionally well relative to the peers in this quarter. I wonder if you could elaborate on the reasons why you think that portfolio has performed well, especially given the comments that you made earlier that you felt you were ahead of the curve in dealing with mortgage issues and the outlook comments you made, without making forward looking statements, about vehicle finance where you said, you expected the credit risk to deteriorate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly we go back to 2006 end of 2006, early 2007 when we saw the credit quality in the mortgage book deteriorate. We obviously looked at the business there and then and looked very carefully at the scoring, etcetera for it. Do bear in mind that's a 50% prime business and 50% subprime business. And it's very broadly spread, the average credit limit for the subprime business is about $300. It's driven much more off what unemployment is doing and as I said in the presentation, the &#x2013; so far we don't see a deterioration, clearly if unemployment was to increase, we could expect that to happen. But it's a very conservative approach that we've taken to it. But we are not totally covered, but we went back to 200- and late 2006 and changed our models before others had and that's the result.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Stephen. It's Alastair Ryan at UBS. Question about assets and risk assets in North America. On page 202 where Household's got whacked under Basel II. I mean probably the most striking figure, which hasn't changed that much but is still over 10% of Group risk weighted assets is the bank and a lot of that presumably is tied up in Global Banking and Markets, with its 243 billion of gross assets. I mean do you need that balance sheet in the States now? Household presumably. As you are working through Basel II, you've kicked out the Auto, but there must be other parts of Household that look less favorable in the Basel II and speaking from a house that's been consistently disappointed with the United States over the last few years. And I mean the US Global Banking and Markets business was always the underperformer before the credit crisis. I mean do you need that much sort of gross and risk-weighted assets tied up there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alistair, if I may say, I think those are well taken questions both of them, and we are hard at work on this. And I &#x2013; well, what can one say &#x2013; I think that you know what we're doing about our Consumer Finance business. The outcome will be a smaller balance sheet than it now is. We do believe that you've got to work your way through the difficult times to stabilize the business. And that there is real value in the consumer lending business and there's certainly real value in the credit card business. I don't think anybody would question that.</p>
          <p>Where we are now at with the announced termination of new business in Auto Finance is, in effect, two businesses under the Consumer Finance heading in the US. The Credit Card business, which by any standards is strategically significant to a Group like us that is in Personal Financial Services around the world, and the Consumer Lending business. But the Consumer Lending business has value in a &#x2013; as the US market normalizes, and it will of course normalize. I think it's beyond question. But we've got a short-term management through challenge.</p>
          <p>On the bank, we have shrunk our Global Banking and Markets business. And Stuart, you might want to take up the story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean Global Banking Markets in the States; we've cut the head count actually from about 1800 to 1000. We closed mortgage-backed trading in the fourth quarter of last year. And in the first half of this year, we've reorganized to have an Americas organization structure. So the business now is organized Latin America and North America, with New York repositioned in essence to cover cross-border flows, so Middle East investing into the US, US investors going into Asia, going into India, to pick up effectively the Latin American emerging market piece because the center, the hub for Latin American DCM and derivatives is New York. And to be &#x2013; the New York leg of a very successfully foreign exchange business.</p>
          <p>So what you see is a bunch of effectively legacy portfolios that are in kind of management or run-off. So the actual size and scale of the balance sheet will be defined more by what PFS raises in terms of deposits, what asset pools we move across from Household than it will be by Global Banking and Markets business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just make one other point of clarification, Alistair. As you see in that page, the December and the June '07 figures were actually Basel I, because that was the capital framework we were under. You are absolutely right, to use your terminology, HFC did get whacked by Basel II. But in the first half of this year, the risk weighted assets declined meaningfully. So it went up and that figure of 180 whatever it is, at the end of June it's less than it was at the beginning of the year.</p>

You have a &#x2013; unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities of 9 billion is increase of 6.6 billion from the year end and can you comment on that? And under the footnote you say, under FSA rules, this should be excluded from your capital resources. So if I excluded this your core Tier 1 ratio is 7%. Can you also comment on that? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the capital framework available for sale losses, the available for sale losses and indeed available for sale don't count for capital. So that's why they are an add-back from getting from shareholders' funds from which they've been deducted to Tier 1 capital in which they are included. So they don't have an impact on capital.</p>

          <p>Thanks I've got some &#x2013; it's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. I've just got two related questions on your Group targets. Firstly is on the ROE. First half result comes in at 12%. That's clearly less than the overall 15%.

        <plist>
          <p>We're not forecasting whether or not we'll meet the target. We didn't in the first half. What we've always said &#x2013; well, always &#x2013; we announced this target at the &#x2013; when we presented our full year results. This was a target that we would seek to aim for broadly through the cycle. We've never expected that we would hit it every single year. And if there was ever an occasion when you're going to struggle to achieve an ROE target, it's these kinds of circumstances. But to be clear, yes, profits that would come from the sale &#x2013; the disposal of assets would be included, yes.</p>

          <p>Thanks. That's good. And just on the capital ratios. If I &#x2013; I noticed in your calculation of core Tier 1, you include the minority and the pref, but taking that out, it's 7.2%. I was just wondering if you would give us a feel for &#x2013; or if you would have a target &#x2013; you've given us a Tier 1 target &#x2013; if you would have a target or were you &#x2013; do you feel the core Tier 1 level where you would be comfortable at?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are comfortable where it is. I mean you have it where it is. And you have to add in the minority interest, because you've added in their share of the assets. So without adding that in you'd get a rather punishment on your &#x2013; on the capital ratios.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Sandy Chen from Panmure Gordon. I'm just trying to tie together the AFS comments that you made as well as the counterparty default risk comments that Stuart had made. I mean, my concern is or the question is really what would trigger the movement from the AFS onto the P&amp;L, I mean drilling down into your comment about the impairment of the cash flows? And specifically I'm looking at, I think page 120, and 126 on the $17.5 billion of Alt-A exposure, it looks like you've recognized about 3.2 billion of AFS charges against that. The '06 and '07 vintages look like they total about $15 billion. And also tying that together with the roughly $14.6 billion of notional contract exposures on monolines. Now if there were, for example, counterparty &#x2013; significant counterparty default risks that increase particularly on the credit derivatives exposure, could that &#x2013; do you see potentially a sort of jump risk if a couple of those significant counterparties went into &#x2013; were to default or be significantly downgraded that would then trigger a recognition of impairment on those cash flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me suggest that Douglas answers &#x2013; takes the question from the accounting point of view and Stuart, you may want to add something too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean elsewhere in this market turmoil section, which I think has added 40 pages there is a very, very granular description of how we test for impairment, which is on a security-by-security basis. First of all identifying those that have had a market value loss, then going into the underlying securities within the structure and our position within them, then estimating the default rates and the flow through the default rates to delinquencies so that one can see where there was a fall of cash flow arises and where get its attributed to, and looking where we are in capital structure, and to what extent there is likely to be a cash flow deficiency for the paper that we have in the capital structure. So, it's incredibly difficult to make a comparison against anybody else. Only if we end up with deficiency in the cash flow do we end up with an impairment <mark type="inaudible" />.  I said we recycled the whole of the deficit that's sitting in the available for sale reserve through the profit and loss account. The fact that we don't have very much impairment indicates that we have positions that are high up the capital structure, or the particular vintages where we hold the paper are better than others. And that is done on a very granular basis. We are where we are. Clearly if default rates rise then there is more risk of impairment, and we would measure that and report that and explain that at the time. For the moment, I believe we've done this incredibly conservatively.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I have little to add, other than to say this. If your question is, if there was failure of a top five bank in the world, would we lose money, the answers is yes, but you won't &#x2013; that's nothing to do with my AFS positions or <mark type="inaudible" /> monolines. I agree with Douglas, we have been very conservative and where we've got transparency from other counterparties where they've marked, we are comfortable that we're very conservative.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Actually just a question on payment trends within Europe. It seems as if there is a flatting out on the commercial side, some small tick up on the PFS side. I wonder if you might give us some indication, where you see those charges going. It's to your credit that you've been very cautious in expanding on the asset side, but nonetheless how do you see the trends moving there?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. That's a well taken question, because UK economy is weakening. Mike?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean the results out of the UK are impressive by anybody's measure. And the reality is that back in end of 2006 when we saw the problems in the USA, we didn't believe the world was decoupled, so we went and looked at our book here in the UK and said what if these things happened and we changed the credit score and the profile. So, we reduced our exposure to personal unsecured loans and we looked at our credit card portfolios, we lost market share, we gave up market share in mortgages. And all those things are now holding us in good stead.</p>
          <p>Now on the commercial book, my concern is as balance sheets contract at other banks, who either can't fund or haven't got capital, will that impact their relationship with their customer, where we may also have facilities. And that's my sort of lookout to the future. We've got to be careful of that and the team are looking very carefully at that. The great thing about HSBC because we are in the long-term business, we look at our clients over the long-term. So, we generally build those relationships for the long-term. We very much encourage our relationship managers not to build balance sheets, but build relationships and that's what they've been doing. And I think that will help us to the best we possibly can. But it goes to Stuart's position, if a top five bank goes down then there is obviously a reality that there's going to be an impact for us in all our business segments.</p>

          <p>We probably ought to call it a day at that. To our friends in Hong Kong, thank you very much for joining us. Vincent, thank you. And thank you for joining us here too. Thank you very much.</p>
