      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, this is Gilberto. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our fourth quarter results conference call. In 2010, we recorded the best result ever. How come we made it? Well, while we are preparing 2010 budget, we had in mind some assumptions, such as the growth of our economy which might in 2010 grow 7% to 8%.</p>
          <p>Despite one's opinion about Banco do Brasil might have its market share jeopardized by fiercer competition, we managed to grow and maintain our size in the market. The growth driver remained loan portfolio along with our commitment in the 202-year history of our supporting the Brazil economy.</p>
          <p>It has been always clear to us that credit-risk would have improvement trends in the context of improved economic environment. And it was pretty much clear that we've got the diverse price, the source  of income of our bank working in other business segments.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the strategy put in place by the management was succeeded. We kept our leadership in Brazilian bank industry and delivered consistent results. Moving to slide number 4, we can observe that we kept our leadership in main segments of Brazilian bank industry. We lay our leaderships on assets and credit in our capacity to affect funding as can be seen in the cost and assets under management.</p>
          <p>On slide number 5, we can see that 2010, Banco do Brasil recorded its biggest results ever. More than this, we kept our return on equity around 25%, even after the offering in June. The net income reached R$11.7 billion and the recurring net income increased more than 25% amounting R$10.7 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide number 6, we show that revenue from credit operations remain as one of our key growth drivers. Banco do Brasil expertise on bringing credits allowed an increase of 30% of those revenues.</p>
          <p>As we can see in slide number 7, in 2010, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we had a spread contraction. This movement is mainly due from shift in portfolio mix to <mark type="inaudible" /> preparation. Although there was a reduction in the global spread, the same mix shift has been allowing a consistent recovery in spread offset by risk in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now in slide number 8, we see the expansion in our deposit base. The distribution network of Banco do Brasil nationwide has supported the demands of our leadership in the process and the growth in low cost funding, highlight the savings which increased almost 18% in one year. We also had access to more of our overseas funds even after the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>On slide number 9, we can observe that the amount obtained by Banco do Brasil abroad increased in the quarter in the year. The solidity of Banco do Brasil and the recognition of the international market is evidenced by the bond market issues which grew 65% and borrowing beneath their bank market which decides for them to go in the balance <mark type="inaudible" /> with a great number of banks, lenders.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10, not only the funding has been expanding. On slide number 10, we can see that the leadership, the historical leadership in asset kind of management, with a market share close to 22%. This is the best segment which will grow fast in the next years, mainly because of measures taken by government to encourage the issuance of private risk.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we can see that Banco do Brasil kept its leadership in the credit market with a stake close to 20% in December. The loan portfolio reached R$358 billion. Add in private bonds and guarantees granted, this portfolio amounted to R$388 billion.</p>
          <p>Our focus is still on the consumer finance segment and individual portfolio representing 31.6% of the total portfolio at the end 2010. Also, regarding the various portfolio on slide 12, we can see the increase in operation with better risk provided backed by collateral such as those related to payroll, auto loans, and mortgage, which in December were responsible for 78% of the total individual scope.</p>
          <p>Regarding mortgage on slide 13, we have the monthly disbursements and contracts during 2010. Obviously, this isn't as growing fast as Banco do Brasil. In December, the origination was tripled over January.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14, we show the evolution on balance of corporate loans which in LTM grew 19.5%. Please observe that the strongest growth was in operations with medium and large companies which explains the spread reduction of those operations but brings a great risk improvement.</p>
          <p>On SME segment, we are focusing on operations with collateral as we can see on slide 15 with the FGO use. In December 2010, there was more than 353,000 operations that reached at the end of R$7 billion or 14% of the total loans seen after each segment.</p>
          <p>As can be seen on slide 16, we have the breakdown of our business portfolio by line of credit with highlight to investment operations, which represent 22.1% of the total portfolio to corporate. And which grew 31.3% in a year. We will present a disbursement of the main investment line in the next three slides. However here, what is worth to mention is that investment financing will bring many opportunity to Brazilian banks in the following year as an important <mark type="inaudible" /> driver.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows the amount we disbursed in our investment credit operation, which surpassed R$23 billion in a year. Slide 18, we see that Banco do Brasil has remained as the leading bank in global lending of BNDES system, with the disbursement of R$18.2 billion year-to-date. With this performance, Banco do Brasil has 19.4% market share.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we present BNDES card, a product in which Banco do Brasil is a wide ranging leader in terms of amount of work, number of cards and transactions. That performance is mainly due to the operational flexibility of the product.</p>
          <p>Following this idea, slide 20 shows that the disbursement is funding from FGO surpassing R$3 billion. It is the best performance ever. Slides 21 and 22 bring us some important information in agribusiness. Banco do Brasil has a market share close to 61%, being the largest portion to the Brazilian agribusiness. The portfolio is increasing consistently and is worth to mention that 2010 and 2011 crop, Banco do Brasil financed 17% of the grains production such as soybeans, corn and wheat.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 23, we have the evolution in level of risk from Banco do Brasil. And as we can see, the percentage of operation that is the better risk that we are going to see increased in the past 12 months and in December 2010 at 93.7%. This share of operations with better risk is above the bank industry.</p>
          <p>Also regarding the quality of the portfolio, slide 24 shows us the delinquency ratio that confirms that the strategy adopted by Banco do Brasil on focusing its operation to lower mid line is being successful. The delinquency ratio for NPL over 90 days are in lower levels.</p>
          <p>The graph in slide 25 confirms that this improvement is seen in individuals and corporate portfolios where Banco do Brasil has presented better shape compared to the bank industry. On slide 26, we see that even with the asset quality improvements, we kept precaution in respect to the coverage ratio of provisions over NPL that to loans over 90 days. The ratio surpassed 190%, quite above the market.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 27, we can observe that Banco do Brasil was able to grab market share in credit and debit card segment. We also highlight the growth in cards turnover which grew in the year more than 25%. The expansion in those business was important to guarantee the fee income growth.</p>
          <p>On the following slide, we show that income from capital market had an impressive growth, increasing 33% compared to 2009. Banco do Brasil believes in this market, and in 2010, we are involved in 98 deals. The expansion of the business has been caused by a strict control on admin expenses and it is reflected on the operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>On slide 29, we show that more than <mark type="inaudible" /> the ratio in 2010, we grow in fourth quarter 2010 with 40% <mark type="inaudible" /> On the slide 30, we have the BIS ratio which, at the end of December, reaches 14.1% and would allow an expansion of up to R$111 billion in credit assets. There was reinforcement in Tier 1 capital, mainly due to the offerings in June 2010.</p>
          <p>Here in slide 31, we have a comparison between the performance of Banco do Brasil share, Ita&#xFA; and Ibovespa. Since the offering in June, with 31 appreciations Banco do Brasil's performance is feared in the market.</p>
          <p>We turn to what has been presented so far. 2010 was a great year to Banco do Brasil. The slide 32 shows us that the business performance allowed us to reach or surpass most parts of our guidance. The business expansion allowed us to surpass our estimates to fee and we had a great performance in the loan portfolio even with increasingly lower band estimates through the individual's portfolio.</p>
          <p>The focus on operations with lower risk brought some pressures over spread but on the other hand allowed them a strong reduction in allowance for loan losses. The admin expenses were also under control as can be seen in the slide.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, analyzing what is going to happen in 2011, on slide 33, we have the management and operation efficiency pillars which are modernization and focus on customer service, priority in lending for investments, growth in the card segment, expansion, insurance business, and internationalization. The following slide will bring some important information on those initiatives.</p>
          <p>On Slide 34, we see the new setting of the base (15.27) Banco do Brasil branches, which will bring more convenience and modernity to our customers. It is a good example that we are working to improve our retail operations.</p>
          <p>The investment in a new business platform, as can be seen in Slide 35, will enable great agility and service quality adding also <mark type="inaudible" />. I would like to draw your attention to Slide 36. The service modernization also includes new technology such as mobile bank, besides the traditional ATM, Internet or telephone.</p>
          <p>Banco do Brasil is a pioneer in some new technology in Brazil, such as we present QR-Code, Quick Response Code, a bi-dimensional bar code which will be available in billing forms issued by Banco do Brasil. QR-Code readers are available in smartphones like iPhones where you pay deals without the need of another information.</p>
          <p>On Slide 37, we have some initiative on investment side, financing. Banco do Brasil will keep prioritizing the investment lending and supporting the productive sector in Brazil such as naval industry, urban mobility, energy generation, oil and gas, and agribusiness.</p>
          <p>On Slide 38, we present Elo, one of the main initiatives of Banco do Brasil in partnership with Bradesco and Caixa Econ&#xF4;mica Federal. To go forward, in the card market, the focus will be the lower income customers, which still represent a low share in card market. Elo will also benefit from middle-class increase and supports a bank inclusion.</p>
          <p>On Slide 39, I would like to bring some information on insurance. We recently restructured our insurance area, including the reorganization in all of our affiliate companies aiming to increase our market share through a lot of setting up insurance company's products, in alternative channels, with <mark type="inaudible" /> solution and launching product <mark type="inaudible" />. The reorganization increased Banco Brasil share in insurance companies, which standalone already had results for Banco do Brasil in 2010.</p>
          <p>In Slides 40 and 41, we can observe the bank's strategy surpassed over this positioning would then have for both selling and retail activities in favor of Brazilian communities, in funding Brazilian companies with businesses involving foreign trades and acting in capital markets.</p>
          <p>Simultaneously with these strategic guidelines, the bank has focused on a fork in continuing to be Brazil's overseas partners with capillarity to a seat to be partner everywhere. With the purpose of being the first bank for Brazilians at home and overseas.</p>
          <p>To sum up our presentation, Slide 42 brings our estimate to 2011. We understand that the Brazil economy will have a very good year 2011 and Banco Brasil will be very well-positioned to benefit from it and to support our economy. As can be seen in the slide, return on the equity's expectations to have a range between 21% to 42% &#x2013; sorry, 21% to 24%. NII, a growth 16% to 20%; total deposits, 14% to 18%; loan portfolio growth, 17% to 20%; loan loss provision, 3.3% to 3.7%; fee income growth, 12% to 17%; admin expenses, pretty much close what we have last year, 10% to 13%; and tax rate, 31% to 34%. So that was the information that I would like to share with you and we are open to the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Before beginning the Q&amp;A session, I'd like to tell that I have with me today, Mr. Abbason from our Credit Department, Mr. Sidney from our M&amp;A Department, Mr. Gueitiro from the Consumer Finance Department, Mr. Clenio from our SME Department, Mr. Paulo Roberto and Ms. Paola from our Risk Department, Mr. Orival from our Logistics Department, along with Mr. Eduardo Pasa, our Accountant; Mr. Marcelloarti Banco do Brasil Chief Corporate Governance; Mr. Fixcero, Credit and Debit Cards Department; Mr. Renato Donatello, our Controlling Director; Mr. Leonardo Mattedi, Insurance Department.

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ivan and Gilberto. I'm intrigued by your guidance on loan notes. You mentioned that you expect your domestic portfolio to expand 17% to 20% in 2011 and individuals, 19% to 23%. But it's actually not that different from what we are hearing from some of your competitors. Bradesco guided only a touch below that. But I'm intrigued because you are a government-controlled bank, and usually people tend to think that because you're a government-controlled bank, you tend to be more aligned than others with the main thrust of policies that the government is trying to impose for the year.</p>
          <p>We are hearing very intensely over the last few weeks and months that the Central Bank in Brazil, in particular, is very concerned with inflation and they are taking measures <mark type="inaudible" /> and norms and the like to try to slow down the pace of credit growth because they are uncomfortable with something in the order of the 17%, 20% that you and others have guided, and that doesn't contribute to the fight to control inflation expectation. How do you reconcile that? That you are seeing the world where you should be able to grow, particularly individuals, 19% to 23% which seems to be the segment &#x2013; consumer &#x2013; that worries them the most with the Central Bank, that would like to see something probably more in the 10% to 15% range, given that you are a government-controlled bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. So, first of all, bear in mind that in consumer finance business, we are brand new players in two important segments. First of all, through our partnership with Banco <mark type="inaudible" /> we are brand new players, since the end of 2009, and this segment <mark type="inaudible" /> gradually gaining market share because now we have the right <mark type="inaudible" /> (23.46) to compete with the main players in the market in terms of car financing.</p>
          <p>And another important segment is mortgage. As you can see in our figures, 2010 figures, we managed to double our credit portfolio in mortgage. We ended 2010 with R$3 billion outstanding and we intend to double again in 2011 the portfolio in the mortgage business. So the strength of the bank in consumer finance business tends to be quite the same. The focus will be &#x2013; as we presented in this presentation, we have 78% of our consumer finance business concentrated in, first, those operation related to payrolls. That's the case of payrolling and also those consumer clients that buy direct deposit.</p>
          <p>Then <mark type="inaudible" />, as I mentioned, the Banco <mark type="inaudible" /> business and it recently after 2008, following the authorization we got Central Bank, the mortgage market. So the idea of the bank, it should be &#x2013; it should follow business strategy the same that we had last year.</p>
          <p>So as I stated on bank, as we stated on bank, we're very pleased with domestic &#x2013; with this role that we had in agribusiness. And the agribusiness is a more major, as you may know, more major business when talking about bank finance. And Banco do Brasil has maintained its market share in agribusiness at 6%, even growing in a lower pace compared to other portfolios that it has in the bank.</p>
          <p>So, we're going to be in the mark &#x2013; compete &#x2013; competing &#x2013; firstly competing with our competitors with this consumer finance segment and the fact that we <mark type="inaudible" />, will be lower than we had last year, of course, according &#x2013; as a result of the macroprudential measure. But we intend to be quite a little bit ahead of the mark in consumer funding because our understanding is that we have room to gain some market share in mortgage market and in car financing also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> strategy, you've been delivering on that. You've been growing in line more than &#x2013; particularly individuals where you have since correctly said has more room to expand than them and you have the distribution power. So all of that is fine and I see no problem <mark type="inaudible" /> on that. It was more a question of what we're hearing from policy makers in Brazil. Are you concerned that if the Central Bank continues to see that all banks are gearing themselves to grow their loan books somewhere along these lines, that you are guiding, that they may take more macroprudential in order to try to slow that down one way or the other and what would that be to the effect on your overall earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You are right. Of course, as a result of the macroprudential measures, we have seen some reduction in reaching our origination. But another important point is the possibility of penetration that we already have in our customer base.</p>
          <p>We have a universe of 19 million customers. Out of that, only 5 million customers are taking money to our &#x2013; the business that we have in quest portfolio for individuals. So where &#x2013; from where they are taking money, for our competitors. So we have room in our customer base to increase cross-selling in credit products portfolio in these customers. That's our idea &#x2013; to maintain our approach in gaining market share from other banks because we already have these customers and the strategy will be in those more collateralized operations. That's our point.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. This is Regina Sanchez speaking. Good morning, everybody. I have a question related to Previ surplus. We saw that after the agreement you reached with Previ, you classify this R$7.5 billion of the already recognized surplus gain in the other receivables line. I would like to know what will be the yield on this amount. I mean will it continue to be the same of the rest of the return on assets or it will change? And going forward, are you going to report the income from this yield on R$7.5 billion in that interest income line? Or together with Previ result in the other operating income. I believe it would make sense to see it in the net interest income line and do you think this can corroborate to consider that this recurring results, which is how we treat it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Regina I have with me the accountant. So, if I am not mistaken, it tends to be accounted as the revenues of a gain up of  R$7.5 billion. We'll be following the benchmark of the <mark type="inaudible" /> assets. So, the interest rate plus inflation, INPC. The interest rates tend to be 5%, isn't it? Yeah, but that will be the interest rate plus inflation and that will be accounted in other operating income, not in NII, not in net interest income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Together with the other &#x2013; with the results or in a separate way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that will be accounted in net operating income, okay, not in net interest income. Together with other items that we have in this slide, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Carlos Macedo from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I have a couple of questions. The first one also relates to your guidance. You were talking about growing your loans individuals at a very high level, as Daniel mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Obviously, a lot of that growth, if we take the fourth quarter to be a proxy, will come from mortgages, which are pretty low, but auto and payroll, which are long-term loans. I think the average duration or average maturity in your auto loan book is 50 months. And we know that those loans that have more than 36 months and long-term loans can take more of your capital from you; they require more capital for you to make.</p>
          <p>So my question is how do you feel about your capital situation going into the end of 2011 if you do deliver the growth that you have right now, or that you have in your forecast right now? Do you feel comfortable that you will have enough capital to continue to grow in 2012 and 2013, or should we expect another capital raise in the next couple of years?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to your asset quality. Obviously, the level of provisions in the fourth quarter was low compared to the third quarter. If we look at your statements, there were reversals or at least, reversals on the SME book and the corporate book. The guidance you have for next year implies a much higher level of provisions. What should we expect in the next couple of quarters? Should we expect this to migrate slowly to that level or should we expect the first quarter already to be at the same level for the guidance for the remainder of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Beginning by the end, we expect to be in the guidance,  3.3% and 3.7%, probably lower end of the guidance related to loan loss provision and shall be trying to see this improvement that we have, not so sharp that we had in 2010 because we are &#x2013; 2010 was a year that we had improvements that comes from the financial crisis, but the trend is to see over time improving the quality. According to the strategy that we have adopted in our credit portfolio, and individuals portfolio, and also in corporate side, for instance, in the SME side using other views, gives the overall collateral, okay? So that's the expectation, 3.3% to 3.7%.</p>
          <p>So in capital, if we are not comfortable with the level of capital, I don't know if Ivan wants to share his thoughts on that.</p>

          <p>We feel comfortable about that and that's &#x2013; when we built the budget for 2011, we're taking &#x2013; we took in consideration this level of capital and the competitors are back to the market now. That's why we slowed down the level for the growth, talking about the credit portfolio, but we feel comfortable that we can manage the bank. We can add more than R$111 billion, if we could, if the market is there. But we feel very comfortable with this level. That's why we issued new shares in July, last July.</p>

We will keep this level. If there is some reason we are getting close to this level, we're going to discuss any measures that we need to put in place to be sure that we will keep this 13% minimal level for it.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of George Friedman  with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. First of all, I'd like to follow up on a question made by Daniel Abut on how comfortable you feel about the pace of growth in the retail portfolio. Not only how comfortable you are, but maybe how comfortable you feel government is, because my concern here, and I'll put the question this way, would be in case the season keeps growing more aggressively in the first half of this year, if you could expect no additional reserve requirements to try to curb this pace of growth.</p>
          <p>So, your guidance foresees on a gradual acceleration in retail credit, maybe, with the second half of the year being a little bit stronger as inflation slows down but during the beginning of the year or you will pursue a strong credit growth in this segment since the beginning of the year. This is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question would be related to the reversal of provisions for legal risk contingencies that we saw during the quarter. I understand, reading your release, that we should expect some volatility in these lines, as you already observed during the year 2010. But do you believe that we can expect now in the upcoming few quarters additional reversals, or you're going to come back to the prior levels in which you will expend about R$200 million to R$300 million per quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to address the last question, probably Ivan can help us with the first one. So, provision, if you analyze since ever, we got volatility with legal risk provision. And why, because for instance we have a case in court, we have &#x2013; that's a seasonal effect. So, I would rather be at an average, a total average of $250 million, $300 million per quarter. That has been the average over time, okay? Of course, you can assume an increase following inflation in this kind of average that we are talking about, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I believe that we need to hear from, what they thought about this behavior for the current portfolio, talking about individuals for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Machido tell me that the expectations would be more growth in the second part of the year for consumer. In the mortgage market, the expectation is to see the growth an entire year. So growing as long as we are gaining more productivity in our branch network the ability to originate this business in mortgage market. In other consumer funds lines, in the second part of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Thank you for the clarifications. So on the back of &#x2013; I know what you're saying and taking also into consideration that mortgage grows from a very low basis, we should expect the bulk of the growth, I know you expect, to be concentrated in the second half of the year, is that correct?</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Marcelo Telles from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Ivan. Good morning, Gilberto. Thanks for the opportunity. I have two questions. I mean, going back to your guidance, sorry to keep coming back there. The &#x2013;   when you look in terms of the provisioning expenses assumption, if you look at like provisions to average loans, you're expecting 3.3% to 3.7%. But your performance in the fourth quarter was actually far better than your guidance, even like below 3% if you compare like to the average loan portfolio for the period. Given that you've seen, you're still pretty constructive on delinquency in 2011, and that you're going to be growing in or more like your secured lending in 2011, why do you have such a high ratio of provisions to average loans in 2011? Can &#x2013; do you think this might be too conservative, it might be &#x2013; this just might actually be lower than even the low end of your guidance? So if you could give us some color on that, I'd really appreciate it.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on your BIS ratio. I saw a big decline in your risk-weighted assets from the third to the fourth quarter, which goes against the increase in the loan portfolio that you had in the same period. So can you clarify and what is the reason behind that reduction in your risk-weighted assets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, talking about the provisions, it's a conservative approach. Move over to Ivan about the BIS ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a change in the way we consolidate for the BIS purpose, okay. For the BIS purpose we tried to account the equity approach method, <mark type="inaudible" /> instead of using the consolidation approach. Okay. So, we got a reduction in our asset because of it, because we are considered only the investment that we have in equity in Banco <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you think that that change will last? I mean, will you be able to do the same thing under Basel III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the same approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. And just to go back to the provisioning side, so you mention, this seems pretty conservative, but what was the rationale to put such, let's say a less &#x2013; such a high conservative guidance? I mean, is there any particular part of the portfolio that you guys are worried about or is that something else that worries you in terms of your asset quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, nothing. It is not clear for us and even less for the market what is going to happen with the consumer portfolio because of these measures that the central bank put in place in December. That's the only reason why, I believe, we took the decision in a committee and the majority of the members chose their point of view that it is better to be conservative and waiting for the behavior of the consumer and waiting for the behavior of the credit portfolio, that is important portfolio for us now. But talking about the other parts of the portfolio, it's pretty well, it's going very well, it's doing very well, as we show in the numbers of the NPL.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Let me ask you two questions. On the ROE guidance you're giving for 2011 of 21% to 24%, I assume that you are including <mark type="inaudible" /> gains in there. So, can you give us an idea of the amount <mark type="inaudible" /> that you are estimating for the year. I know that in 2010 it was about R$4 billion.</p>
          <p>And then on my second question is: we saw a significant improvement in your efficiency ratios. I was just trying to get an idea, if you could help us quantify any synergies you have realized, especially from the Nossa Caixa transaction?</p>
          <p>Also, on your expense growth guidance that you're giving for 2011, what are you assuming in terms of branch expansion? How many branches do you expect to open? And also when you talked about the modernization of your branches, are you talking about &#x2013; is this taking place throughout the country? Is this already assumed in your forecasts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Ivan. I can take the first question relating to return on assets. We are &#x2013; of course, we are considering it will be revenues in this 21% to 24%. As you may know, we have &#x2013; we're going to have the monthly revenues that we had last year, the updated revenues. This year the updated revenues in the first half of 2011, January to June, will be roughly speaking R$200 million per month.</p>
          <p>And in June and also in December, we're going to have the re-evaluation, the reassessment that we have in assets and liabilities. So I don't know what we're going to have, the revenue, the size of revenue that we can have in quarter until we have this reassessment, so what we &#x2013; I can tell you that we're going to have R$200 million per month in the first half 2011, okay?</p>
          <p>The assumption of branch growth for 2011, we have 600 branches. Out of that, 280 branches, complementary branches, small &#x2013; pretty much small branches.</p>

        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So really, I'm talking about the Nossa Caixa. We believe that we introduced a lot of new technology for the customers of Nossa Caixa. We are really happy, because the cross-selling improves a lot. Remember that Nossa Caixa was not so good talking about the alternatives of products and service. That's why when we joined, when the customers joined to Banco do Brasil, we are able to generate new <mark type="inaudible" /> are able to generate new products and service.</p>
          <p>But in general we have a huge umbrella program that we call BB 2.0. That is one of the most important programs inside the bank. We are trying to build it to improve the products business  <mark type="inaudible" /> in the fourth quarter. We are able to deliver a very good efficiency ratio. The best in our history for one quarter.</p>
          <p>And I hope that we will continue doing the efforts to improve the productivity inside the bank. Because for us it's clear that in the future the spread in Brazil will go down. And we need to build the efficiency inside the bank to work with this new environment for the Brazilian economy.</p>
          <p>If we are able to deliver &#x2013; to improve the assets quality, if you are able to improve the size of the assets, we are able to improve and to gain market share &#x2013; sorry, to gain productivity and to improve the efficiency ratio inside Banco do Brasil. With technology, working with a branch that we don't need to invest &#x2013; we need to invest only 10% in comparison with the normal branch in these 250 new branch that we call <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We are pretty optimist that we can put this in place. It will be difficult for us because, for the first time in our history, we are planning to open 600 branches in a single year, but we think also that all of the investments that we are doing inside the bank will provide us comfortable to do this and to show that we are able to do this during 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I can just ask another question related to this branch expansion, should we assume that you're going to be building about 150 branches per quarter? And can you also give us like an idea in terms of geographic expansion, what areas are you focusing on? What regions of the country are you going to be focusing on? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, actually geographically, I have here we're going to have the bulk of the southeast more than 200 branches in southeast and that whole region will be the second &#x2013; we will give the second branch or branches, more than 150 branches in northeast.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Look, I have a couple of questions as well. First, on your capital position as well. Obviously we've had the news of the chronogram for Basel III being implemented. And obviously your 14.2% Basel is based on existing guidelines. Can you give us an initial view of the new Basel III guidelines specifically how things like deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangibles, which are I think are just going to be treated for future past 2012 acquisitions. And potentially the Previ assets, how that will be treated under Basel III? Is there anything to worry about? What's your initial view on how that may impact your capital position?</p>
          <p>And secondly a follow-up on expense guidance, I mean 350 branches, 600 and 250 smaller branches, that's higher than a lot of your competitors. Can you put that into the context of your 10% to 13% administrative expense growth? It seems &#x2013; is there a risk that you're going to have &#x2013; that it will be challenging to even &#x2013; to have  expense growth within that range, especially considering that you're going to have to hire quite a few people to man these branches. So those two questions are capital and your expense growth guidance in light of your expansion plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ivan, would you like to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When talking about the branches, so we &#x2013; we think possible, but the majority of &#x2013; one-third you visit are small branches. We think that's not between R$1,000 and R$1,050 is not so high and we feel positive that we are able and that we are able to add all these branches and we're put these in the budget for 2011 and in some &#x2013; the guidance considered these numbers.</p>
          <p>We believe that it is difficult to do this, but we discuss a lot and we feel comfortable. We are changing the process to open a branch in Banco do Brasil that would &#x2013; in our opinion, we can improve a lot in this process and we will put in place, especially in March, we believe, that these new &#x2013; the capital markets to build these new branches especially in the northeast of the country. But we believe that we can deliver this.</p>
          <p>Talking about the capital, Gilberto, I don't know if you can add &#x2013; I believe that the main concern in the past like the Previ, and as we can see in the &#x2013; and the rules &#x2013; not the rules, the &#x2013; I believe that the formats that the Central Bank released yesterday, I hope and I believe that we feel possible now that these assets that was the main concern &#x2013; that we were talking about two or three years ago, now we are at the level 100% that we can &#x2013; we can feel comfortable. Especially, because we provide these agreements with Previ with the participants in Previ, that we can share the half of the surplus. And I believe &#x2013; so that we feel possible, that it will be &#x2013; we will follow the markets. It will be difficult 2011 to be a year that's &#x2013; and we need to work a lot just to keep our market share but as a result of what happened in 2010, this is what is that we can deliver everything that we put on the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What about deferred tax assets is that &#x2013; because obviously that's a big number as well in terms of &#x2013; for you and for all the banks, frankly, is that a concern that the deduction there will have a meaningful impact on your capital based?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Giovanni, how is it Giovanni? Ivan, sorry. <mark type="inaudible" /> something that affect everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course we are guessing with other banks the situation because in Brazil we go for business funds and we are more protecting at the level of provision that we have in Brazil as I've mentioned in our presentation roughly taking 200% of the NPL. And this means that we are more protecting to prevent our high volatility rates and provisions with capital gain.</p>
          <p>We have the tax credit, the deferred tax credit because we have these provisions in our balance. So that's something that we are discussing because we have to guess between the accounting practice and the physical practice in Brazil and we're going to have to deal with this, to discuss and to study, to have alternatives in Brazil, to place this situation. It's a special situation when talking about Brazil, okay?</p>
          <p>So the tax debt in Brazil bank more protect in the provisions side and now we had to manage the situation in reducing our capital gains with those tax credits related to provisions. That's something that we are discussing and we are in the very beginning because what we had yesterday from the Central Bank was a notice, only a notice, a preliminary notice indicating what time should be the timeline for the implementation of Basel III so that's all for us, for all banks in Brazil, room to continue discussing, to adapt on Brazil's Basel III implementation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up on an earlier question. I want to make sure I understand the 21% to 24% ROE includes monthly Previ gains of 200 million for the first six months and you don't have that figure for the second half so it's I guess at minimum 1.2 billion of gains? And probably more, I'm not really sure I understood the answers there to be honest.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The same that we have last year. As you may know, last year we have during the first half 2010 and also in the second half 2010, we have monthly revenues accounted because of updating of the assets. So we're going to have, again, the  R$200 million and we are considering these revenues in the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you're not &#x2013; you're just including the monthly figures in that guidance, not any potential gain from revaluation of assets and actuarial...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

The first one has to do with a little bit more clarification regarding the change in the calculation of risk-weighted assets. As you mentioned that you did that <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; changed the matter for consolidation for the Banco Votorantim. Does it mean that the full investment from Votorantim, you are deducting also from your core capital in order to calculate that one, or is it just affecting the denominator and whether this criteria will be applied for your acquisition of Catalunya or whatever future acquisitions you would be doing in the region?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding these acquisitions and there were some statements yesterday regarding potential acquisitions in several countries in Latin America. I wanted to know if there has been any changes in the criteria and in terms of size or objective of these acquisitions, what number could we expect on that front? And finally in regarding your cost guidance, I would like to know if you could provide some clarification of <mark type="inaudible" /> for other operating expenses?</p>
          <p>And last year, even excluding the intangible asset amortization, your other operating expenses grew in excess of 50%, and I think the main driver of your cost increases? And if  you include this in your total cost basis you were running around high 20% to almost 30% last year? Leading to what I believe <mark type="inaudible" /> efficiency in the bank, so what could we expect from this line going forward? Where we expect the current fourth quarter levels to remain going forward, because this is an increase in important line on your income statement then. We don't seem to be getting a clear picture of what's going to happen on this one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So regarding the changes that we have in the BIS ratio because of Banco Votorantim was only &#x2013; we are not considering the total assets of Banco Votorantim, only the investment that we have in equity, only for the BIS purpose. Okay.</p>
          <p>The consolidation of the bank, the accounts, the numbers that we have in our asset is the same. There's no change at all relating to what we have made in the past consolidated Banco Votorantim and Banco do Brasil figures. So we are not considering the assets of Banco Votorantim but also we are not considering also the hybrid instrument in the Tier 2 capital of Banco do Brasil for BIS purpose. Okay. The last part of your question was related to &#x2013; Boris, could you repeat your last part of the question?  Was it related to cost?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That has been a big driver of total cost growth in the bank and if you &#x2013; do you have any guidance of what could we expect on this front ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So bear in mind that it's not comparable with 2009 the growth that we have last year in this item, because in this item we have expenses in Banco Votorantim, accounting Banco Votorantim related to the paying in that Banco Votorantim makes to originate this portfolio. Okay. And Banco Votorantim with that will account only the fourth quarter of 2009 and we have the entire 2010 with Banco Votorantim, so it's not comparable.</p>
          <p>So in 2011 this trend is to have a growth of volume inflation plus some things, so pretty much close that is going to have in admin expenses as well so, probably close to 13%. I think like that could be a quite good assumption in this item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding your acquisitions in Latin America, has there been any change in criteria? Have you increased your budget for potential targets? I know you made a statement that you were no longer interested in Info Banca, so have the criteria that you were applying for your eventual transaction Info Banca regarding a minority stake and partnership, is this the same criteria that you will be using in your other acquisitions? Or you will think through actually buying a full bank like you're doing in the U.S. apparently.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Sorry, Gilberto. Similar to the U.S. bank that we are thinking about, that we are working on this, is to acquire the whole bank. The best example is Pata One. It will be in this situation and we didn't say anything related to this.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Victor Galliano from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a couple of follow ups really from me. First on something we haven't really talked about but on the asset quality side, looking at the NPL formation in Q4 in Agribusiness which remains an important part of your business although obviously it's going to be growing more slowly than the rest of the business.</p>
          <p>Do you think here you're kind of hitting the floor in terms of where the credit quality is? Or should I say where the floor in terms of the NPL, so it's harder for you to improve on the NPLs here. And can you give us some kind of color on how the credit quality outlook is given the strength of the real, given soft commodity prices, what you're seeing in the industry generally, so do you have any concerns about credit quality in Agribusiness going forward?</p>
          <p>And then coming back to the Basel III question, I think clearly what we are concerned about here is given the implementation timeline and the fact that the Central Bank wants to put this in place earlier than in the rest of the world, do you feel here that it's all you would know by &#x2013; when do you feel that there would be some clarity in terms of your needs should you need to raise more capital? Or would you be considering a dividend cut in order to conserve capital and increase capital accumulation from retained earnings? But if you can give us any more clarity on kind of timing here, then that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Okay, Ivan. Related to delinquency, the expectation is to see &#x2013; we guide the market, we're talking about loan loss expenses, okay. So the expectation is to be 3.3% to 3.7%, that's the range we expect to see in 2011. Of course, the strategy that we have put in place in banking, in being those more collateralized operations, in consumer finance business, and also in corporate loans. Each had went down to Brazil, a very good profile in terms of risk, okay. That has caused the gap that we have when comparing Banco do Brasil with the industry. So it's quite a low income decently decreasing the delinquency level today.</p>
          <p>So, we're going to wait as Ivan mentioned earlier, we're going wait to see if by any chance this macro prevention measure of the Central Bank could hurt or not the expectations of risk profiles. But to my mind, to our minds, the spreading that we have in consumer funds in using our payroll, using car financing, mortgage, we are more defensive, if I can say that, or to prevent from having volatility in delinquency levels.</p>
          <p>In the Agribusiness side, the fact that we have less reduction in delinquency level of the business is because we do have a portfolio related to postponed operations. We have roughly R$59 billion accounted. And that has worse risk, if I can say that. The provisional level we have in this portfolio, postponed is up 23%. We've got the lead of the ratio of 10%. So, we are quite well provisioned. And the trend is to see according to the environment, the good environment that we have for the sector. We do see improvements for the Agribusiness portfolio, because the prospect is quite good for the sector.</p>
          <p>I don't know if Ivan could share with us your thoughts in terms of capitalization. How comfortable you are in that regard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Comfortable now with this level &#x2013; we couldn't &#x2013; when we forecasted &#x2013; when we built the budget for 2011, we took into consideration all these possible measures related to Basel III. But it is impossible for us now to tell you exactly what will be the level of the capital and what is going to happen in the future. But we are working on this and I'm sure that maybe in two or three weeks we can disclose some numbers about special &#x2013; about the Central Bank's thoughts disclosed yesterday. But I believe that the budget that we put in place, the markets that we are targeting for 2011 and the capital that we issued, that we increased in July are enough to do what we plan to do for 2011 and 2012.</p>

          <p>Your final question comes from the line of Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow up, gentlemen. When I'm looking at your guidance, I can see that you're guiding the interest income growth somewhere in line with your loan growth guidance. And actually it's a very good figure because in other Brazilian banks it's a little tricky to look at their interest income because they have a lot of treasury gains there. And then for Basel I see that's much less significant.</p>
          <p>And I was curious because we saw in 2010 where your net interest margin was below your guidance and it seems to me given the guidance that you expect their interest income to grow more in line, more or less in line with the loan portfolio guidance, is that you're not seeing much net interest margin pressure for 2011?</p>
          <p>When some people are concerned at the impact of the increase in the service quadrant, and we could see more of that throughout the year because of this macroprudential loan approach, then that could put some pressure on the interest margin on top of the competitive pressures on spread. So what's your thinking behind margins for 2011 and why are you feeling so comfortable that margins should be fairly stable throughout the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that all the banks, not only Banco do Brasil, but all the banks put on the price the increase in the reserve requirements. And we believe that during 2010 that the competitors were back to the market, they put a lot of pressure on the spread. We are not forgetting this for 2000 -- sorry, for 2010, we are not forgetting this for 2011. That's why we feel comfortable that we can manage the cost of the funding of the bank that was very good during 2010 and tends to be the same for 2011. And we don't believe that the pressure that we saw in the margins during 2010 would be the same in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I understood your answer correctly, Ivan, it's two things. You are expecting all banks, including you, to transfer the price in the increase in reserve requirement costs and second, you expect much, much less pressure on spread compared to what we saw in 2010.</p>
