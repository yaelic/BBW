          <p>Welcome and thank you for holding for the Kinder Morgan quarterly earnings conference call. I'd like to inform you that your lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This conference is being recorded, if you have any objections, you may disconnect.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Ed. As usual, welcome to the call. We'll be making comments within the parameters of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I'll give an overview of the performance for the quarter. Park Shaper, our president, will take you through the numbers in usual detail, and then we'll take whatever questions you may have.</p>
          <p>I think the biggest news is probably that we increased the quarterly distribution again, this time to $1.11, which is a $4.44 annualized rate. That's 6% above our distribution in the third of quarter 2009. We still expect full year 2010 total distributions of $4.40, that's up about 5%, 4.8 to be specific, compared to full year 2009. Recognition that all of our segments look like they will be in a positive position compared to 2009 on a full year basis of earnings before DD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>On a year-to-date basis, on distributable cash flow per unit, which is what we think is the most important single indicator for our business. Before certain items, we're up 6% year-to-date. We generated $3.26 per unit of distributable cash flow versus 3.07 a year ago, but the third quarter was actually down year to year, $1.02 versus $1.12 a year ago. And that $1.02 is very close to our budget for the third quarter but we had a number of in and outs for the quarter, which Park will take you through in detail. But pretty close to the budget for the quarter and on track for the $4.40 distribution for the year.</p>
          <p>As usual, I'll just take a look at each individual segment, because I think that's probably the best way of explaining the performance in any given quarter or year. Starting with the products pipeline, probably the most important single factor there is that our refined products volumes were up for the quarter compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>If you look at it on an unadjusted basis, it was up by a little less than 1%. If you look at it on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the increase in the ethanol mandate in California from 5.7% to 10%, they were up 2%. I think that's definitely the right way to look at it. That's the second quarter in a row that the adjusted volumes have been up on a year-to-year basis. This is the first quarter since 2007 that the unadjusted was up quarter to quarter.</p>
          <p>So we're beginning to see, I think, some modest recovery in the throughput volumes on our Products Pipeline system and the fourth quarter up is off to a pretty good start through the first half of October in terms of year to year comparison. That said, I'd remind you that obviously we're coming off some weak comp periods, comparable periods for 2009.</p>
          <p>Other important indicators in our Products Pipeline group, ethanol volumes were up 25% versus the third quarter of 2009, and are actually up 34% year-to-date. NGL volumes in that segment are up 7%. The other significant news since we last talked to you in the Products Pipeline segment is that we did complete the transaction with Chevron, purchasing four of their products terminals around the country for a little less than $40 million, including inclusion CapEx. And obviously, as most of these acquisitions are, it will be immediately accretive to cash flow at the KMP level.</p>
          <p>Turning to our natural gas pipeline segment. On the positive side, we got a good contribution from our treating business and from our KinderHawk joint venture and from Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline. On the negative side, we had lower results at Rockies Express and lower results at the Texas Intrastate.</p>
          <p>On Rockies Express, the lower results came from the negative impact of higher Ohio property tax assessment &#x2013; Park will take you through that in more detail &#x2013; and increased interest compared to 2009 because we termed up some of our loans. On the Texas Intrastate, we had lower prices and less volatility in the Texas market, which in turn led to some reduced sales margins and lower storage spreads. Overall, as Park will tell you, we're still pretty close to our plan for the full year in that segment.</p>
          <p>Segment volumes for natural gas pipelines were up 3% for the quarter. That's primarily the impact of our Midcontinent Express Pipeline. There were a number of other significant developments during the quarter and after the quarter end in our natural gas pipelines segment, virtually all of them very positive for the long run. First of all, our Fayetteville Express Pipeline is nearing completion. In fact, the pipeline is finished and in service. We are completing our compressor station and a couple of meter interconnects. We will be fully operational by December 1, 2010. That's a month ahead of our original target.</p>
          <p>The construction costs look to come in at about $1 billion. That's against an original budget of about $1.3 billion. So the project has come in substantially under budget and a little bit ahead of time. As you recall, that's a 50/50 joint venture with Energy Transfer. It has capacity of 2 Bcf per day, 1.85 of that 2 Bcf is fully contracted for a 10-year period.</p>
          <p>So other major developments in the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas that I wanted to take you through. Our joint venture with Copano is progressing nicely. Construction has begun on the first portion of that line. As you will recall, that line has a capacity of 375 million cubic feet a day. We previously announced that we signed SM Energy for a big quantity of that capacity, up to 200 million a day.</p>
          <p>We expect to announce very shortly binding commitments for the remaining 175 million a day, and we've also made significant progress on other Eagle Ford volumes and projects which we expect to be announcing in the coming months. So I think that's a very exciting shale play. I think we have a lot of exposure there, and I think we're going to increase our ability to move product, natural gas out of that area.</p>
          <p>Another project, we completed our North Dayton storage facility. That's $100 million facility, and it adds about 7.25 Bcf of working gas capacity for us. In the Haynesville Shale play, KinderHawk signed a significant long-term agreement with a major third-party producer for gathering and treating services on a long-term basis. The reason that's important is I think it vindicates our belief that we'll be able to attract additional third-party volumes to that system, and as a matter of fact, thus far, the third-party volumes are running above our acquisition plans. So I think that's an encouraging development for our KinderHawk joint venture.</p>
          <p>Turning to our CO2 segment. CO2 was up nicely for the third quarter and year-to-date, both on a DCF and earnings before DD&amp;A basis, but somewhat below plan, as Park will talk about. Several moving parts in the quarter in this segment. Just going down the list, our Sacroc oil production at 29,000 barrels per day for the quarter was pretty close to the third quarter of 2009 and pretty close to plan for 2010. Our Sacroc NGL volumes were actually up 5% over the third quarter of 2009, making this the second best quarter ever for NGL production there. And the improvement in NGL volumes basically erased any shortfall on the SACROC total production picture.</p>
          <p>Yates was a different picture. The Yates oil volumes ended the quarter, or averaged during the quarter about 23,200 barrels per day. That was down 8% from a year ago. And that's certainly the main negative in the CO2 segment. In fact, probably the major negative in the whole company during the quarter and year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Now, there is some good news here. Our current analysis shows that the thinning of the oil column that we talked about last time has stabilized. That's a good sign, although I would caution you that clearly the more time that expires without any further thinning, the more comfortable we will be.</p>
          <p>That's a very positive sign because as long as the oil column doesn't thin, that means that this level of 23,000-plus barrels a day should be sort of a bottom indicator or a bottom number that we can work off at Yates. And we're continuing to work on efforts to increase our overall Yates production.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at the other things impacting our CO2 financial performance for the quarter, the price of oil was a few dollars short of our budget target number of $84. But actually, one way to look at the overall performance of the CO2 segment is that through a combination of cost reduction and good management, they've made up all of the non-price shortfall, virtually all of it, leaving just the price shortfall as the shortfall in the overall segment earnings before DD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In other news in that segment, the Eastern Shelf Pipeline project is nearing completion. That project will have an initial throughput capacity of 65 million a day with the ability to go up to 200 million cubic feet a day of CO2. We'll be moving CO2 through that line and starting to flood our Katz Field in December of this year, that's a little ahead of the time we expected it to happen. And we expect to get about 25 million barrels of oil out of the Katz Field over the next 15 to 20 years. In addition, I think that this project, the pipeline and the flooding effort will be a platform for additional floods in that part of the Permian Basin.</p>
          <p>Another significant development in our CO2 segment is that during the quarter, we've signed over 800 Bcf of new CO2 sales and delivery contracts with eight different producers. These contracts have an average life of 8.5 years and are staggered in as far as their beginning dates. They're generally on more favorable terms than the older contracts that they're replacing. That's a good sign and we expect to nail more contracts by year-end. We're finding very positive demand for CO2 among producers in the Permian Basin.</p>
          <p>Going to our terminals business segment, they had a substantial increase in earnings before DD&amp;A versus the third quarter of 2009. And that really came from both organic growth and acquisitions. Liquids throughput for the quarter was up a little over 6%. Bulk volumes were up about 7%. We also benefited from having additional liquids capacity and tanks available.</p>
          <p>During the quarter compared to a year ago, we had added 1 million barrels on the Gulf Coast alone. And on the bulk side, we got stronger volumes in steel and ore. And I always like to look at the steel volumes a little bit, same as we do at the throughput volumes in our products pipeline group because it's, in my view, a leading indicator of the economy in general.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we moved 6.7 million tons of steel through our terminals, and that's versus 5 million tons in the third quarter of 2009. Now, sequentially, it's not quite as good. It was actually 7.2 million tons that we handled in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>These trends are pretty consistent with the national operating rates for the steel industry, which we show as 57% in the third quarter of 2009, going up to almost 73% in the second quarter of 2010 and averaging in the third quarter of 2010 just a shade over 70%. So very consistent national numbers with our throughput numbers. To give you an idea of how important those steel volumes are in terms of revenue, year-to-date in our terminals group, the additional steel volumes have added about $40 million to our revenue versus year-to-date 2009.</p>
          <p>To put all these volumes in context, you may recall that in early 2009 during the worst of the recession, the steel volumes on a national basis were in the low to mid 40s range and that was down from a peak before the recession hit of a low to mid 80s. So certainly we've had large recovery but not all the way back to where it was before the economic problem surfaced.</p>
          <p>On the acquisition front in our terminals group, we benefited from the U.S. Development and Slay acquisitions made earlier this year. Ethanol volumes were up substantially in the terminals group to over 14 million barrels. Overall, the Terminals and Products Pipelines together have handled about 66.5 million barrels through the first three quarters of this year and that's about 30% of all the ethanol used in the United States.</p>
          <p>We continue to acquire terminals in our terminals group and expand our facilities. Our most recent acquisition was one that we've just closed a few days ago, which was the acquisition of a third terminal in the Norfolk-Newport News, Virginia area.</p>
          <p>Turning to Kinder Morgan Canada for the third quarter. That operation is a little below 2009 solely because of change in foreign exchange rates. We expect that entity to exceed both 2009 and its plan for the full year. Year-to-date volumes are up about 6% compared to the comparable period of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now before turning over to Park, I'll just say one more thing. I would again emphasize that if there's been a disappointment this quarter, the KMR to KMP discount still looks abnormally large to us. And because of the difference in price, the KMR yield of course is substantially better than the KMP yield and of course it also offers arguably better tax consequences. And if you combine all of that with the fact that our belief is that that difference between the two will go away and you'll get that pick up in value. We think KMR has a great deal of growth in front of it. And that's why if you look at management purchases over the last several quarters, they've been overwhelmingly in the KMR arena.</p>
          <p>And with I'll turn it over Park for the numbers. Park.</p>

          <p>Great thanks, Rich. So I'll go through the numbers that are part of the earnings release, so if you go back through the text, you'll get to the first numbered slide, which is basically the income statement. And just a quick summary, Rich touched on all these points but there are really kind of four factors that hurt us in the third quarter and let me just run through those four.</p>
          <p>First is oil prices. Our budget with oil prices to be about $84 a barrel. We actually realized about $76 a barrel. Yates volumes, as Rich mentioned, were down versus budget. We came in at about 23.2 thousand barrels a day. Our budget was 26.2 thousand barrels a day. Now one thing to remember on Yates is we own about half of that field and we operate it. But the volumes that I gave you there are gross. And so it's really only a little bit less than half of that when you take out royalties that impact us.</p>
          <p>The third piece that hurt us in the quarter is the REX Ohio tax issue. And Rich mentioned this, we did get during the quarter an assessment from the State of Ohio on property tax that was significantly higher than what we had in our budget and we believe way out of the realm of reality.</p>
          <p>We are certainly going to challenge that and appeal it. We're confident that we'll be successful on appeal. What we are recognizing here is an increase from our budget, although it's not all the way to the assessment. Really, what we're recognizing now, and we expect to going forward until this is resolved is essentially a number that is reflective of the high end of the various reasonable ways that we can come up with to calculate that property tax.</p>
          <p>So there are a number of different ways it can be calculated. We ran through those calculations and essentially, we took the high end of that, and that's what we're recognizing here. We would hope that we'll be able to do better than that throughout this process. But what it does mean is that we have a catch-up in the third quarter for that higher property tax throughout the first three quarters of the year. And that impacted us by about $6 million, a little less than $6 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And then the fourth item that hurt us in the quarter is the Texas Intrastate. And again, Rich had mentioned this. With lower gas prices and lower gas price volatility, that does have an impact on our sales and transportation and storage margins in the Texas Intrastate. And so we felt some of that in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, as we look forward, oil prices are back closer to our budget in the fourth quarter, so that will be a little bit better than it has been throughout this year. Yates volumes, as Rich mentioned, while they're not back to where they were at budget time, they seem to have stabilized in September and what we've seen so far in October, essentially around the level that we averaged for the third quarter that we are encouraged by that. Clearly, we factored in the higher Ohio property tax on Rockies Express going forward.</p>
          <p>And in the intrastate market, we will still see weakness there in terms of margins. Now, we do have the Eagle Ford projects that are in progress. And certainly, as production grows down at the Eagle Ford, although that will take a little bit of time, that should be a positive for our intrastate system.</p>
          <p>So that being said, looking at the numbers, and so again, the first page of the income statement, I think the only thing that's relevant there is the declared distribution per unit of $1.11. You'll see that takes us to $3.27 for the three quarters. We're on track to hit our annual budget of $4.40.</p>
          <p>But to really understand what's going on, let's go to the second page, the page right behind that. Now I'll start just above the notes. You'll see the Bcf per unit of $1.03. Rich mentioned that that is down from $1.12 for the third quarter of 2009, but it is in line with our budget. So that's right on top of where we expected to be.</p>
          <p>Now clearly the $1.02 is not covering the $1.11 distribution. Although again, clearly, that's what we budgeted for and so a large part of this is seasonality. We expected and we mentioned it in prior quarters. We expected not to have coverage in the third quarter. We are essentially just a hair behind, we're basically at $3.26 of Bcf per unit for the nine months compared to the $3.27 that will have been distributed, and so short on coverage just a little bit right now.</p>
          <p>Now, I will point out that through three quarters of 2009, we were short about $21 million and ended up fully covering our distribution for the year. Now, as we look forward right now, we do think we'll come in right about our expected distribution of 4.40 in terms of Bcf per unit. So we expect, again, to be right about one-to-one coverage for the year.</p>
          <p>Stepping up from that, you'll see the net income per unit. I don't believe that that is overly relevant. Again, I think the Bcf per unit is a much more meaningful measure. And then the Bcf before certain items above that. But one thing let me point out, really with respect to the DCF per unit of $1.02, I did say that was consistent with budget.</p>
          <p>Now the four items that I went through that I said were handicaps that we faced during the quarter really all show up in segment earnings before DD&amp;A. So really segment earnings before DD&amp;A in total ended up below our budget for the quarter. We made up for that because, again, we ended up right about our budget for the quarter. We made up for that in sustaining CapEx and lower cash taxes. And so those things essentially offset the lower segment earnings.</p>
          <p>DCF before certain items, about $318 million compared to 320 a year ago. About $994 million compared to $854 million a year ago. For the nine months, up about 16%. Sustaining CapEx was right above that, you'll see is about $41 million, pretty flat with $41 million a year ago. $121 million through nine months, up a little bit from the $112 million for 2009.</p>
          <p>We currently expect sustaining capital expenditures to come in at about $182 million, just a little bit under $182 million, which is lower than our annual budget of about $207 million.</p>
          <p>The two lines above that, Express and Endeavor contribution and then the book cash tax net, you do see some movement there across the years and then we get a little bit of movement relative to budget. But I think the important thing is what ends up in DCF are the cash distributions from Express and Endeavor and those are on budget. We expect they'll be on budget for the year. And then the cash taxes is what ends up down in DCF, and there for the year we actually expect we'll end up about $4 million favorable to budget, so slightly lower cash taxes than the budget.</p>
          <p>Above that is DD&amp;A. You'll see it's up about $38 million for the quarter, about $119 million year-to-date. A part of that is CO2, so higher DD&amp;A at CO2. And part of it is also the natural gas pipelines, but remember some of it is even on the natural gas pipelines that don't, where the DD&amp;A does not show up on the segment.</p>
          <p>For our joint venture pipe like Rockies Express and MEP and then also for the KinderHawk joint venture, which shows up in the segment earnings before DD&amp;A, is the equity earnings. And then on this line down here we add back their DD&amp;A. And their distributions do reflect their earnings before DD&amp;A, less their sustaining CapEx. So effectively, what we're doing here is matching the Bcf with the actual cash that we get out of these assets.</p>
          <p>But part of what that means is we're adding their DD&amp;A, we're including their DD&amp;A on this line, and that's lot of the change year to year, because you have higher depreciation on REX and on MEP because they came on during the year 2009. And you also did not have KinderHawk during 2009. So those are part of what's driving this increase. And then above that, you have the limited partners' net income.</p>
          <p>Why don't we jump up to the segments at the top of the page. Starting with product, you'll see it's up about $5 million for the third quarter from a year ago. It's up about $46 million for the nine months. The quarter was a little bit under budget. And truthfully, we would have been a little bit higher versus 2009, but there's a little bit of timing in our Transmix business, which really was timing between the second quarter and the third quarter.</p>
          <p>When we look at products for the full year, we do expect to be under the budget by about 1.5% for the entire year. Cochin is weaker than budget. Pacific is down from budget because we adjusted some tariffs in September. But very nice growth in 2010 over 2009.</p>
          <p>On the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we're actually down about $6 million in the third quarter relative to where we were a year ago. We're up about $32 million year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Now, the reason why we're down year-over-year are the intrastates and Rockies Express for the most part. KMI is down a little bit as well. The intrastates, again, is what we talked about in the lower margins. Rockies Express has the impact of the Ohio property tax that we mentioned. It's also the impact of higher interest expense.</p>
          <p>Now this was budgeted. We expected it. The reason that interest expense is higher year-over-year is because we've termed up the debt at Rockies Express. And so, you take short-term debt to long-term debt, we pay a little bit more on the long-term debt, and so that has reduced the equity earnings that we recognized here.</p>
          <p>And the other impact on Rockies Express is part of what I was just discussing. The DD&amp;A has gone up on Rockies Express. What you're seeing here, again, for those joint ventures, what shows up in the segments is after DD&amp;A and we add that DD&amp;A back down below. So that particular piece does not affect DCF at all, but it does impact the segment.</p>
          <p>Now, in Natural Gas Pipelines, when we look at the full year we expect them to end up just a little bit above their budget for the year. CO2, you'll see up about $31 million for the quarter, up $150 million year-to-date. So great growth versus 2009. But it is still below our budget. CO2 was about $21 million below budget in the third quarter, and we expect it will end up below budget for the full year. And that amount is a little less than 5%.</p>
          <p>And it's a function of the items that Rich mentioned and I talked about briefly. Lower prices impacting us. Again, our budget at $84 a barrel in the budget average for the year. Lower Yates volumes, offset by cost savings. And so that's basically what's getting us to, again, a little bit below budget at CO2 for the year.</p>
          <p>Terminals, you'll see nice growth in the quarter, up about $20 million, year-to-date up about $53 million. Came in just a little bit under its budget for the quarter. Again, as Rich mentioned, steel volumes a little bit stronger than where they were a year ago. Overall, we expect that the terminal segment will come in just a little bit under its budget. It's about 1.5% as well under its budget is what we're expecting for the full year 2010.</p>
          <p>Kinder Morgan Canada actually down a little bit from where it was in the third quarter of 2009. It's up about $8 million year-to-date, really performing exactly as expected. Almost all of this variance versus 2009 and versus budget, and it's a little bit ahead of its budget for the quarter and we expect it to be above its budget for the year. But almost all of that is really just changes in foreign exchange. But again, because of that, we do expect that the Canada segment will be above its budget for the year.</p>
          <p>Where you get in segment earnings before DD&amp;A, up about $46 million for the quarter from a year ago, up $288 million year-to-date from a year ago. Our budget was about $3.36 billion and segment earnings before DD&amp;A we do think will come in a little bit below that. Again, CO2 will be a little bit below, products and terminals will be a little bit below, natural gas a little bit above and Canada a little bit above.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll drop down and talk about G&amp;A and interest, so you need to go down a couple of sections and you'll see general and administrative down there. $96 million expense in the quarter up from about $85 million in the third quarter of 2009. Similarly for the year, we're up about $45 million versus 2009. Most of that was expected. If you look at our variance to budget year-to-date, it's about $16 million. And where we expect to end the year is about $16 million above our budget.</p>
          <p>And for the reason why we're $16 million above our budget, a chunk of it are legal costs actually related to an ongoing dispute with UPRR over some rent on the west coast and then a few other cases that are out there and are driving significant legal expense. A little bit of it is book taxes. Now book taxes get backed out down below so they don't actually impact distributable cash flow. A big chunk of it are the onetime items related to insurance that we discussed in the first quarter. Then we have slightly higher benefits. And then just like the FX helped us on the segment for Canada, for our Canadian G&amp;A, that increases the G&amp;A and so we have a little bit of an increase on our Canadian G&amp;A again just due to the foreign exchange changes.</p>
          <p>On interest, you'll see it's up from a year ago by about $26 million for the quarter, up about $61 million year-to-date. Actually favorable to budget for the quarter and we expect it to come in favorable for budget for the year. Our balance is higher both versus 2009 and versus the budget. Our rate is lower than budget. It's essentially flat with a year ago. But that explains why we're up from last year, it's essentially all balanced and why we're down versus budget, it's essentially all rate.</p>
          <p>There's certain items, let me point out a couple of things here in the quarter. The first few items, again, are standard things, they always show up. The acquisition costs are again are just costs that previously were capitalized. They are completely a function of doing acquisitions.</p>
          <p>And then the first big item, maybe the biggest item in the quarter is the mark-to-market and ineffectiveness of certain hedges. It's about $9.5 million, a big chunk of this is actually associated with our crude oil hedges. But the important thing to remember here is the net impact of what we actually receive, always has and always will show up in the segment when those transactions occur.</p>
          <p>So for accounting purposes, we do have to run some amounts through down here in certain items, but what you see in the segment is the net impact of where we're actually selling the crude oil, incorporating in the hedges. And so again, what you see down here is just noise. It moves in and out. You will see, well, it's negative $9.5 million in the third quarter. It's actually positive $4.6 million for the nine months. So again, that stuff will just move around.</p>
          <p>The line right below that is labeled insurance deductible. This relates to a failure that we had on a ship loader at our IMT facility. And this is the self-insurance piece of that. But we do expect that we will be getting insurance proceeds and replace that ship loader.</p>
          <p>Environmental reserves. There's a small adjustment there for the quarter. And then asset disposition expenses, we've talked about this last quarter. This is related to a specific facility on the west coast that we are cleaning up and already have a contract to sell. And in truth, we will receive more cash from the sale than we are spending on the cleanup. And some of the amount that shows up in here, the year-to-date amount is $17.4 million, is actually a book non-cash write-off. So net, this is going to be a cash positive for us once the transaction occurs.</p>
          <p>Those are really the certain items. There isn't really much to discuss back on the first page of the income statement. I just want you to remember that there are the certain items flow through that face of the income statement, as does when you look at the nine-month period, the interim capital transaction that occurred in the second quarter. What we've done, when you look at our nine months on the second page, is we've essentially treated that like it didn't happen.</p>
          <p>And the reason why that's relevant is we want our limited partners to understand what we're generating on a recurring basis. If we were to reflect it, including the impact of the interim capital transaction, it would look like our DCF per unit was higher than what it actually is. And we don't want to reflect it that way, so we're reflecting it as if that interim capital transaction didn't happen. And you see that, it's on the line labeled General Partner ICT impact. And it's about $167 million for the nine months. Now again, that all occurred in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So with that, there's also a page that goes through the volumes. Rich touched on most of those. And I will turn to the last numbers page, which is the balance sheet, walk through that briefly. Cash and cash equivalents is up a little bit to $192 million. Other current assets is down. That's a function of reduction in accounts receivable. PP&amp;E is up a little less than $300 million. That's acquisitions plus CapEx less accumulated DD&amp;A. Investments is up about $977 million. That's largely KinderHawk, a little bit of contributions to REX.</p>
          <p>Deferred charges and other assets is up $600 million. That's largely to mark-to-market of our hedges, a little bit of goodwill and intangibles associated with acquisitions. Total assets about $22 billion, up $1.8 billion from where we were at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt $1.4 billion. We have a $250 million maturity next month and a $750 million maturity in March of 2011. And then we had a commercial paper outstanding of about $415 million at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Other current liabilities is down about $150 million from the beginning of the year. AP is a little part of that, accrued interest is the biggest part. And again, that happens at the end of the first quarter and the third quarters because our interest payments are concentrated in the first quarters and the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Long-term debt, I'm going to talk about in just a minute. The value of the interest rate swaps up about $600 million and then other is down about $370 million, most of which is the mark-to-market on the hedges.</p>
          <p>Partners' capital you'll see is down. Again, that's the mark-to-market of the hedges. Other partners' capital is up almost $350 million, that's a function of equity issuance and I'll talk in a minute about how much of that we've done year-to-date. And then non-controlling interests essentially unchanged.</p>
          <p>And so looking at the debt-to-EBITDA, you'll see it shows up about 3.8 times, which looks to be flat with where we were at the beginning of the year. We're actually down a little bit if you take it out another significant digit, it's 3.77 times compared to about 3.80 times.</p>
          <p>And so, we're consistent with where we expect to be at this point in the year given our budget plus the impact of the KinderHawk transaction. Now, we are actually down on that metric from where we were at the end of the second quarter and we talked about at the end of the second quarter how a couple of items in particular were distorting that number. We were at about 3.9 times at that point. And the items that were distorting it were, one, the SFPP settlement had been paid, but the interim capital transaction had not yet occurred. And now, we are past that because the interim capital transaction has occurred.</p>
          <p>And then the second item was KinderHawk. And this is still an impact, because all of the cash flow is out for KinderHawk, but we still only have a four or five month performance in our EBITDA number. And so again that distorts this number.</p>
          <p>With that being said, let's talk about the change in debt. You can see here that the change in debt from the beginning of the year is an increase of about 1.05 billion. And then for the third quarter, debt edged down by about $211 million. So again, I'll reconcile it for both the quarter and year-to-date. Again, a reduction in debt for the quarter of $211 million, an increase in debt year-to-date of a little over $1 billion.</p>
          <p>And so the uses of cash are really, so these are the investments that we're making and so it's in CapEx, acquisitions, contribution to joint ventures. And so in the third quarter, about $230 million of CapEx, about $25 million for acquisitions and about $30 million contribution to joint ventures. That totals investment of about $286 million for the quarter. For the year, we've had about $600 million of capital expenditures, acquisitions of around $1.25 billion, contributions to joint ventures of about $210 million. And then we need to count in here, although it's not actually investing, the FERC settlement payment of a little over $200 million. And so year to date, we've invested including the settlement, a little over $2.25 billion.</p>
          <p>So those again are the investments. And so what are the sources of cash, how we've raised capital to finance that? In the quarter, we retained cash related to the interim capital transaction, so it did not go out to the general partner, of $170 million.</p>
          <p>We issued equity of $206 million. We retained cash related to the KMR distributions of $97 million and then working capital and other items were a source of cash of about $24 million. So again all of those things added together are right around $500 million source of cash. We invested about $286 million in the quarter. You end up with a reduction in debt for the quarter of about $211 million.</p>
          <p>And then year-to-date, again, the sources of cash, interim capital transaction, 170. Equity issuance, including equity that was issued to fund acquisitions, about $729 million. KMR distributions resulted in cash retained of about $280 million. And then the working capital and other items were a source of cash of about $43 million. That totals up to a little bit over $1.2 billion. Again, you compare that to about $2.25 billion of investment, including the settlement and you end up with about 1.05 increase in debt from the beginning of the year to the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>On the working capital and other items, again, it's a source of cash for both the quarter and year-to-date, largely driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable. And so those two have generated cash quarter and year-to-date and that's largely driving that source of cash.</p>
          <p>And then real quick I talked about $230 million of expansion CapEx in the quarter and about $600 million year-to-date. Just to give you a sense of where that's coming from, the products pipelines were about $20 million in the quarter, up $73 million year-to-date. Continue to add tanks at our west coast terminal facilities and then a number of other smaller projects in that business unit.</p>
          <p>On the natural gas side, we spent a little over $50 million in the quarter, about $85 million year-to-date. The Dayton Storage expansion was a big piece of that, finishing up the Kinder Morgan Louisiana line and then a variety of smaller projects. On the CO2 side, we invested a little over $85 million in the quarter, a little less than $270 million year-to-date. And the projects that are going on there, clearly the Sacroc expansion continues, but also the Katz CO2 project and the Eastern Shelf Pipeline to bring CO2 over to the Katz Field.</p>
          <p>On the terminal side, spent about $66 million in the quarter, about 160 year-to-date. Carteret, we continue to add tankage there at that facility in the Port of New York. And then there are a whole variety of smaller projects there. And then in Canada, we spent about $3 million in the quarter and about $7 million year-to-date. And with that, I will hand it back to Rich.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from James Allred from Raymond James. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just focusing on the new contract at KinderHawk, I know you had been projecting throughput to be roughly 800 million cubic feet by year's end. Are there any changes to this target at this point? And maybe can you provide some insight into the expected volume ramp-up at the JV heading into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're absolutely right on your numbers. And we still expect to be at roughly 800 by the end of the year. I think the composition of that mix will be a little higher third party, a little lower Petrohawk. But we still think that the same number looks to be good.</p>
          <p>As we head into 2011, we've gotten preliminary estimates from a production profile standpoint. And we look like our acquisition plan looks good in terms of volumes for 2011, too. I will say that overall in the Haynesville, in this area of low cost gas in particular, in the long run, I think you may see some squeezing back of rig utilization up there.</p>
          <p>There are some positives offsetting that, particularly the drilling that needs to be done to hold the leases. But we're very encouraged by the fact that we're able to basically expand the users of this system by adding significant third-party players. Now, I think that's a result of what we hoped to achieve when we went into this partnership was that by creating a true joint venture and having the Kinder name on it, that we felt we could be more palatable, if that's the right word, to third-party producers. Not that there was anything wrong with how Petrohawk was running it. But it's just that we're not a producer, so the prevailing assumption is that we have no reason to prefer one producer over another.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just kind of switching gears, if maybe the opportunity were to arise to purchase an additional ownership interest in the JV, is that something that you guys would consider or have a comment on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly would always consider opportunities to purchase any pipeline or gathering assets and it would just depend on what the price were if that came for sale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Next question will come from Stephen Maresca of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Steve. How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm doing well. Thanks, Rich. Good afternoon everybody. My first question is on the Eagle Ford. Can you talk a little about what your expectations are going forward in terms of project announcements and what I guess, in terms of magnitude, what could be needed on top of what you have there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me, it's a good question, Steve. Let me start with at least our overview of the situation. The Eagle Ford, of course, is a very hot play right now, primarily, as most of you all know, driven by the fact that at least in large portions of that acreage, it's very wet gas. So you have a lot of liquids and given the discrepancy between NGL or oil prices versus natural gas prices, it makes for a much more pleasant experience for those producers. And you've all seen the announcements, particularly the big Chinese investment with Chesapeake, just a huge investment going in down there. And the ability to survive a lot better even in low gas environment, I think.</p>
          <p>So we are very enthusiastic about it. But again, we'll only do projects when we have customers who want to support those projects. So we started with this JV project. And as you recall, the capacity is 375 million cubic feet a day. Our sort of anchor shipper was SM. They took the first 200. We now we'll be announcing very shortly who took the rest of that capacity. So that 375 is now, will be now fully committed.</p>
          <p>We have the ability to expand that system. By adding compression, we can get it up to around 600 million cubic feet a day. We also will be able to, we think, do some lean gas gathering in that area also, and connect that to our mainline system. An advantage we have, and we're not the only pipeline company that has advantages, but we have an awful lot of capacity on our Texas Intrastates, both the old Kinder Morgan Texas and the old Tejas system coming out of south Texas.</p>
          <p>So we have the ability to fill up this additional capacity and get it to places where the wet gas can be processed and where the dry gas can get to the markets. We'll probably be doing some additional building to get it over to interconnect some of our other lines and some other processing arrangements that we're making now. And then I think we'll have the opportunity to have some other major header systems on both the rich and the lean gas side of it coming into our main lines there. So I think there's going to be enormous production.</p>
          <p>I'll be very open about it. These big producers down there that are spending hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even north of a billion dollars in some cases, are interested in having more than one outlet. So Kinder Morgan is not going to be the only player down there. There are clearly a couple other good size players in there. But I think we will get certainly our share of it. And the advantage we bring is we have the ultimate take-away capacity to get this up to Katy, into the ship channel, or wherever people need us to take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question is, and you brought it up, Rich, in terms of the KMR and KMP discount, what would you guys consider doing from a corporate standpoint to eliminate that or alleviate that discount?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Steve, that's a very good question. We keep thinking it will eliminate itself. The shares of KMR are pari passu economically with the units of KMP and in fact, from a tax standpoint, you could argue, particularly if you're just a buy and hold person, that it's a little better, because you don't pay any taxes at all until you sell, and then you pay capital gains rates. So I think it's a very good tax vehicle, too.</p>
          <p>There are some things we could do in terms of doing some exchanges of KMP for KMR. We like the KMR currency. It's very good for the company, I think, because it allows people to buy who would not necessarily be able to buy units of an MLP. So we like it. We are continuing to look at what we might do. Have not made any definite decisions on it yet. As you can tell, again, as I said earlier, the insider buying has been specific to KMR. So I think that's a good trend line. Park, do you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the only thing that I would add is anybody who wants to take advantage of what we could do or might do would want to do that before we do it. So buy now and that's how you take advantage of that opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks a lot for the color.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just want to first quickly follow up on KinderHawk volumes. Can you elaborate at all on the new agreement? How long the terms are? And are there any minimum volume commitments associated with the third-party volumes? Or is it just the Petrohawk volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these are not Petrohawk volumes. It's the third party. I'm going to ask Tom Martin who runs our natural gas segment to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there's a minimum volume profile, but certainly upside beyond the minimums over 10 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it's not Petrohawk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's not Petrohawk, I want to make that clear. It is a third party, a major producer in the Haynesville.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So but I was referring, Petrohawk there are minimum volume commitments as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are they, you're saying that you said the mix is kind of shifting more to third parties. Is Petrohawk hitting up against its minimum volumes or are they still above?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they're still way above their minimum volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the statement was just that relative to what we expected when we put the volume forecast together, there is a little bit more third party volume and a little bit less Petrohawk volume. I think we don't want somebody to think that it's actually more third-party volume than it is Petrohawk volume. It's just again relative to our expectation. There's a little bit more third party than there is Petrohawk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, got it. And then in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Little bit more third party than and a little bit less Petrohawk than our expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And in terms of your expectations for volumes out of the Haynesville over the longer term, has, is it kind of the same story where you may expect to see the third party volumes offsetting maybe some of the lower volumes at Petrohawk in the out years as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's too early to judge. As I said earlier, based on the preliminary indications we have for 2011, Petrohawk is projecting that they will have roughly the same level of throughput that we have in our acquisition plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the point I was trying to make and the encouraging point is that obviously to the extent that you could bring more third-party volumes in, if Petrohawk's volumes turn out to be exactly in the acquisition plan, then we'll have upside to the acquisition plan. And also, if Petrohawk's turns out in the long run to be a little less, we'll have some offset to that. And all I would say is that so far, the gratifying thing is that our third party volumes are running a bit better than we had in the acquisition plan even previous to getting this new major third-party shipper on. And most of those volumes won't even begin to come on until December and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, thanks. And then, shifting over to the Marcellus potential project. Are you hoping to lock in anything before year-end? And does the higher property tax assessment in Ohio for REX have any implications for this project which would be running through Ohio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well, I think we will eventually get our property taxes in a reasonable level in Ohio. So I wouldn't try to meld the two. The real issue on Marcellus, and we put this in the release, I did not mention it in my oral remarks, but the real issue on Marcellus is we've said all along, we have started doing some preliminary right-of-way and engineering work, but we're not going to build this project unless we have long-term commitments from customers. And we have a lot of interest, and if and when we get those signed up, we'll do the project.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then switching gears to Fayetteville Express, are you still pursuing third parties for the remainder of the open capacity there?  Or does it look like it's kind of just going to be 1.85?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think we believe we will be able to fill the rest of that 2 Bcf. In our own budgets on this, we have it budgeted as coming in over a period of several quarters to fill it out. But, yeah, we think we will eventually get to the 2 Bcf. But it's a nice project, even at 1.85, and even before we reduced the cost estimate. So it will be a very nice project, and particularly as you get north of 1.85.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then last one for me. If you could just elaborate a little bit on what's driving the lower sustaining CapEx, lower to budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a lot of it, and I'll let Park jump in on this too, but a lot of it is simply that, let's put it in perspective. Last year, as Park said, this year we think we're going to come out around $182 million. That's up from about $172 million last year. So it's higher than last year. But in our budget, we had projected spending a little over $200 million. And it just looks like now that we're almost 10 months of the year behind us that some of this stuff is not going to physically be able to be done by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Certainly not postponing anything intentionally or doing anything that would negatively impact our maintenance keeping the assets in good shape. Just when you have a $200 million plus budget, some things just are not going to get done. And every month, we true up the estimate from all five segments for the year and it just looks like now that this number is going to come in closer to the low 180's versus low 200's. Park, do you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only other thing I'd say is that everybody should keep in mind that there's a significant portion of our maintenance and integrity costs that don't show up as sustaining capital, but rather show up in O&amp;M. And so when you're thinking about the total amount that we're spending to maintain our pipes, to test our pipes, to operate them safely, it's significantly bigger than what shows up in that sustaining CapEx line.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. My first question is related to the Canadian currency. Do you guys typically hedge that or try to hedge that? Just didn't know if that was something we can expect going forward, with the changes in Canadian dollar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's so insignificant in the overall mix of things of the company that we don't bother hedging. I'll tell you what we do is every year at the beginning of the year, we set whatever the forward curve, same thing we do for crude oil, same thing we do for interest rates, is we set whatever the forward curve is and then that's what we use. And for example, for 2010, we used 95. So any time it's above 95, in general, that's a bit of a positive for us. If it's below 95, that's a bit of a negative. That's Canadian to the U.S. And so that's the way we do it. And you know, we'll look at it. We're just starting through the budget process now. The other day it was almost one to one. It backed off a little bit, but I expect we'll end up going into next year at, who knows, 97 to 98, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's the way we do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, Rich, can you talk a little bit about coal exports and what you're seeing there and just kind of your volumes across your coal terminals? And secondarily, on the oil side, how hedged you guys are going into '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll start with the coal exports. This is a very dynamic situation right now, and in a positive sense, particularly for met coal, and I'm sure you all read the same things. But met coal needs in China and to a lesser extent India have taken a tremendous step up and we're handling a lot of that. The two major places where we handle export coal are Newport News, Virginia, what we call Pier IX, and there we move around 12 million tons a year. That's fully subscribed by a number of coal producers. And all that capacity is subscribed and being utilized. We are now working on expanding operations in the Gulf Coast. And that's probably also an announcement our board has approved, major expenditure project there on a Gulf Coast terminal that will allow us to export an additional 4 to 6 million tons a year there. And we have an LOI with a major coal producer for the great bulk of that tonnage.</p>
          <p>And now that's something that won't come online until probably early 2012. But it is something we just approved and we're going forward with, and this is a 15-year contract with a major coal producer. So there's going to be a lot of upside in coal exports. And I think people are going to be looking to find outlets to be able to get that coal on to the oceans. So we're very bullish on that. But again, the real bullishness is coming from the coal producers who are very interested in entering into long-term contracts on these, and that's a lot better than spot contracts in general.</p>
          <p>With regard to the production profile, as we always say, of course, it depends on whether you are including the NGLs or not, because we don't hedge the NGLs. But looking forward, if you do not include the NGL, so you're just looking at crude production at Sacroc and Yates, we're 72% hedged going into for calendar year 2011. If you include the NGLs, we're 66% hedged. We're in the process of hedging a little more. And I would expect that by the time we go into 2011, we will have about the same sensitivity per dollar change in crude prices, WTI prices, that we have this year, which is just a little less than $6 million per dollar of sensitivity.</p>
          <p>Now the nice thing, we said this before and you all have these numbers in previous slides that we've shared with you, the nice thing is that, of course, because each year our hedges, the hedged portion is going up significantly versus a year ago in terms of price per barrel of oil, we've got a nice uptick built in as we come into the 2011 budget. For example, our hedges for this quarter are at, these are WTI again, are a little less than $58. The hedged price on what we have hedged in 2011 is almost $67.</p>
          <p>So you add that kind of difference to the number of barrels that we're talking about, and that's a significant difference. Which leads, if you just looked at the forward curve today, would lead us to have close to an $11 barrel increase in our total price per barrel on our crude production next year. Now, that's based on a combination of the hedge price and the forward curve. And, of course, that forward curve could vary, but the hedge price won't. And that happens over the next several years. It goes up again in 2012, simply because as we laid the hedges on later, they were at higher prices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very nice. And two other quick questions. Rich, if you can elaborate a little bit on what might have been going on operationally at Yates. Is that a water flood or CO2 flood, or what might have been causing some of the instability to volumes? And then lastly, was there a dollar level that the Ohio property tax was over budget? What roughly was that? Thanks. That's it for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead, Tim. Tim Bradley, our CO2 President, will take the Yates question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Yates, the production of Yates started to decline a little steeper than we had forecasted in the second quarter. Our budget for the year was 26,150, and we've averaged in the low 23's during the third quarter, which is a bit of a disappointment. But quite frankly, the design and the operation of the Yates Field is producing oil out of an oil rim while oil that's above it in the gas cap slowly drains down. And I liken this to a process of sipping water out of the bottom of a cup filled with crushed ice. You can only pull it out as fast as it drains down. And we think that we've kind of hit that equilibrium point here earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Crude production at Yates essentially stopped its decline in the third quarter and has been fairly flat. So we're encouraged by that. The rate of drainage that we've calculated in our reservoir models and other techniques indicate this rate of drainage appears to be <mark type="inaudible" /> barrels a day. We've been producing just above that, so things look like they're beginning to equilibrate.</p>
          <p>And specifically to answer your question, it is a CO2 flood, it's not a water flood. We're injecting CO2 into the gas cap to make the oil, if you will, a little bit more slippery so it drains a little bit more efficiently than it would without CO2. But we're disappointed with the production compared to budget.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with Yates as an asset overall. And looking back on our original acquisition economics that we put together in late 2003, even though production is falling behind budget this year, we're still 4,000 barrels a day above that acquisition economic run that we put together in 2003. So it's performed much better than we expected, and perhaps it's coming into equilibrium of the longer term expectation going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Good, guys. Good afternoon. As you look out over the next 12 months, where do you see I guess the most opportunities for KMP to invest capital? Is it on the acquisition side, or do you think that you see more opportunities to build or expand on your assets? And how does CO2 really figure into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me say that we are always looking for acquisitions, but we're only going to do it if the price is right. And if you get into a bidding war, we may or may not win that bidding war. So, we're always looking at a number of acquisitions, but we don't buy many of those that we look at, because we just are not willing to pay the same price that perhaps other players are. So I think we'll still continue to have acquisitions, but I think we seem to have a pretty full plate right now. I think both from an acquisition and internal expansion standpoint in the shale plays, particularly encouraged about the Eagle Ford and think that we will deploy pretty significant capital down there.</p>
          <p>I think some people tend to say, well, Kinder Morgan is a big company, and Eagle Ford, they're not spending that much. But what you're seeing in the Copano joint venture that we've previously given you I think is kind of the tip of the iceberg. I think you're going to see us deploy a few hundred million dollars to our own account down there over the next coming quarters, next couple of years. I think we've got additional opportunities in the Haynesville, perhaps, this Marcellus pipeline, if we can get the backing for it.</p>
          <p>We don't talk about it much, but on our products pipeline side, we have additional tanks under construction out at our Carson facility in LA. That's about a $70 million project. We have this Travis Air Force Base project. All of these are fully underwritten by long-term contracts. So we have a lot of opportunities. And on the terminal side, I think we're going to be able to add more tankage. We're already doing that at Carteret. So I think we have a lot of growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>CO2 is certainly one of those growth opportunities. On the Katz, if you combine the pipeline and the flood facilities at the Katz Field, we are spending over $200 million there. That's going to pay nice dividends. You'll see very nice increase in our Katz volumes, I think, when we share the 2011 budget with you. But beyond that, I think you will see that as a springboard in two additional ways for our CO2 operation in the Permian Basin. I think it will lead us to probably acquire some other tuck-in opportunities. And then secondly, it will lead us to sell and move more CO2 to other third-party operators in that part of the Permian Basin.</p>
          <p>And then still on the CO2, I may be stepping out a little bit, but I would say that given all this demand we're seeing for additional CO2 in the Permian Basin, we just finished an expansion of the Cortez Pipeline. That's the main line that connects southwest Colorado CO2 production with the Permian Basin. We just finished an expansion of that a couple years ago. I think that it's very likely that we'll be looking at a further expansion of that in the next couple of years if this CO2 demand continues to increase. So I think we have a lot of opportunities in-house, but we'll certainly continue to look for acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess on your last point, how does the renewed interest in the Permian and the demand for CO2 change your view of CO2 CapEx, I guess, for the rest of 2010 and looking into 2011 when you think about service costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we think about -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The service cost, the costs in the field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, we've been able to do pretty well on holding the line on the costs. As Park said, in fact, if you really strip through everything, we were able to make up a big part of the Yates downturn in the production with savings across the board. So while there may be some uptick, I think we feel pretty good about our ability to hold the line on the costs. And I think what you're just seeing is that having oil production in the continental United States is a pretty good thing to have.</p>
          <p>And I think we're seeing a lot of players who recognize that fact. And if there's a negative to that, it's that it might make the acquisition of additional fields more difficult or more expensive. But I think we've got a lot of opportunities in the CO2 area. As far as CapEx is concerned, we're actually spending considerably less this year than our budget. How much less, Tim, about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>25 million. Yeah, expect it to amount below budget for the year. We expect it to be about $27 million, and year-to-date we're about $35 million below our budget, our change in capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're able to do what we set out to do. Obviously, you make some changes as you go forward over the year, but for considerably less than we thought.</p>

          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then, changing gears, last question, a little bit back to the hot topic at hand, the KinderHawk JV. Are your gathering fees for third-party volumes the same that you would realize if they were with Petrohawk? And then how do you allocate future capacity and production volumes between third party and Petrohawk?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't know that we want to get into specifics on rates, but I think they're comparable to the deals done in the area. And clearly, Petrohawk has firm capacity on the line, deals that we do with these other producers are also firm or interruptible depending on how we negotiate the transaction. So we do look at the total capacity on the system and allocate it appropriately between all parties.</p>

          <p>To beat the M&amp;A horse here, we're seeing super majors continue to sell stakes in pipelines. I know you've looked at a lot of transactions. Are you seeing a greater opportunity set for to acquire stakes in pipes or increase your stakes in pipes than you have in previous years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're seeing some of that, but not so much in pipes, at least we haven't seen as in terminals. And if you look at what we've done this year, we bought these four terminals from Chevron. We also bought a Shell terminal in San Diego. We're looking at a number of other terminals with some majors. And we've bought some in the southeast in the past couple of years, too. So I think we'll continue to see that. With regard to the pipelines, we'll just to have see what develops there.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the Koreans made a major purchase of a portion of Colonial, which we couldn't have made anyway, given antitrust concerns with our ownership of Plantation. But we'll continue to look at things. But again there is a, I think in general, Brian, there's always a lot of talk about what the majors are going to do. And sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't. So I think you need to be, we need to be a little bit cautious with what the opportunities are there, but certainly we'll be looking to the extent they bring things up for play.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it depends on the asset. Certainly, if there's an asset that you have a producer, for example, who wants to maintain control of an asset, and kind of free opportunity to expand it, private equity may be a good solution. If they don't want to, if they're not as anxious to maintain control, more interested in taking more money off the table, then I think somebody who can bring capital and operations to the table, like us, is a better fit. So I think it just depends on the type of asset. But certainly private equity has a lot of money and they're looking for things, but I think again it depends on what the seller really wants.</p>

And I don't know exactly where that will come out, but I think we'll just have to wait and see on that. With regard to our own sustaining CapEx, we're in, I believe we're in full compliance, as you know, both federal government and many of the state governments, Texas being one, have their own requirements on how often you have to inspect these pipelines with one level of inspection frequency in the high consequence areas, lesser out in the rural areas, but a set timetable.</p>
          <p>Texas is particularly onerous on that. We're in compliance with all of these. We'll continue to be. And in fact, in many instances, we're actually inspecting more frequently, patrolling more frequently than required. So I think our level of sustaining CapEx is a good level. It's fully doing what we need to do. That said, to the extent that there is additional government regulation that requires additional expenditures, obviously, we'll have to make those expenditures. I think it will probably take some period of time for some of this regulation and/or legislation to actually take effect. Steve, you want to add anything?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just say that kind of regardless of what the regulatory requirements end up being, we spend a lot of time and pay a lot of attention to this just from a pure risk standpoint. And as Rich kind of alluded there, we ask ourselves all the time, what more should we be doing or what more does it make sense for us to do? And we've accelerated certain integrity work. We've accelerated retesting in some instances, like where we had new tools or new techniques that we could bring to bear.</p>
          <p>We've developed some new tools and techniques ourselves. And then we go out and survey our field people and say, putting IMP regs aside or taking the management program rights aside, what more do you think we should be looking at? So we try to ask ourselves the question, what risks can we mitigate, what risks can we get rid of? There are no guarantees in these things. There's always residual risk. But I think we're getting better at this every year, getting better at it all the time.</p>
          <p>And certainly, have good programs and doing our best to improve them. The other thing is that I hope that policy makers in this whole process don't forget the risk of third-party damage, because really that's a big deal to us. We can't make everybody follow the one-call rules. And as they're looking at things to do to try to fix issues out there and reduce risk further, I think enforcing those rules and closing the gaps in them would be one of the most effective things they could do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For example in some states, correct me if I'm wrong, Steve, the one-call statute doesn't apply to local governments, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How idiotic is that? Do you think that the local county platform that's out putting in a little line over to its facility is better equipped to understand the right-of-way protection than a utility? Well, the utility has to follow it, but in many cases, the political subdivision does not. That's something that just ought to be changed <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Appreciate the color. And I guess, was one more on that topic. If there are significant cost increases due to higher regulation, do you think you can pass most of those along?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you would certainly think so. In fact, probably one of you on this call, I forgot who wrote it, but something just within the last week, someone was speculating that an outgrowth, if governments really want more maintenance activities paid for, that ought to lead the FERC to increase the PPI adjustment next year. As you know, it's at historically has been at PPI plus 1.3%. AOPL for one, trade associations come in and ask for a PPI plus, I think, 3.65 or something like that. And so far, the FERC has not ruled. It will be ruling, I would think, probably in the first quarter of next year because it takes effect. The new five-year period starts July 1st of next year. So that's a suggestion.</p>
          <p>I don't know if that will happen or not, but that's one way to get at it. Another way to get at it would be just allowing a pass-through on jurisdictional lines. And I think you will certainly see some of that. If you don't, you can certainly see pipelines filing rate cases to recover those costs. So I don't believe this will be a major infliction of pain without the ability to collect over a period of time the capital expenditures that you make. But we'll just have to see how it comes out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the passthrough will probably, passthrough opportunities will vary by asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from John Edwards from Morgan Keegan. Your line is open, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm doing pretty well. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple things, Rich. What are you seeing right now in terms of re-contracting on your pipeline? Particularly, I guess, on the gas side, how are you seeing rates come out there? What's an average now, how much is coming up each year for re-contracting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have, I'll start with the latter part of the question. We don't have very much coming up in 2010. We do have some rollovers in 2011 but it just varies pipeline to pipeline. And it may sound kind of like a cop-out, but so does the re-contracting. For example, you know, on our interstates, the jurisdictional storage is pretty low rates, and as soon as something comes up, we just had somebody, you know, the longer term you offer, you get a priority. We just had somebody who bid, what was it, 33 years, is that right? We had some storage come up, one of the customers to make sure it got priority, it bid the max rate. In other words, the max we could charge on a tariff for 33 years. That's true on storage, which I think is generally easier to sell.</p>
          <p>With regard to pipeline capacity, FT, I think it really varies with the area you're going into or coming out of. So, for example, I think if you are coming out of an area that has a growing production profile, and your producers are your customers and they want to make certain they have that capacity, they're going to pay up whatever it takes to get it. If it's a declining basin, you're not going to do as well. And the same thing on the demand side, if you're going into areas where it gets them to points of liquidity, people on both the supply side and the demand side are going to be willing to pay more than if it's not a liquid point.</p>
          <p>And one of the things we're doing with REX, we've been, I think done pretty well with is we're serving more and more customers. We're connecting to more and more plants, more and more generating facilities and the more of that you do, the more you're building up use for your system. And REX, of course, is running at completely full now, 1.8 Bcf a day across the system. Almost all of it going to the east end of the system. So I think it really depends on the pipeline. But in general, we're able to re-contract and get good margins on it, but it does vary with the exact location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with respect to the Marcellus Shale, the NGL line, I know you've answered a couple questions there. Can you give us any kind of insight on progress on securing contracting commitments or can you not comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I can just say in general that there's an awful lot of interest in it. But I think people are looking at a lot of different alternatives, and I think we'll just, it's just going to depend on whether people are willing to sign up on the dotted line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And on the KinderHawks, so now what is the volume ramp-up rate you're expecting now at this point? You're up to you stated a little bit above plan. You're at, I guess, 800 by the end of the year. And then, what are you looking at beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think in general, John, it will continue to ramp up from both third-party as well as from Petrohawk in that regard. We haven't given any public guidance in that regard. I don't think we can. But it will continue to ramp up, including the minimum commitments from Petrohawk, which are five-year minimum commitments. So those minimums ramp up over the five-year term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we'll probably be able to share more of that with you at the analyst conference when by that time we have the full production profile from Petrohawk and from some of our other customers for the 2011 year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just housekeeping, what's your calculation? And you have a lot of adjustments. What's your calculation for EBITDA for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's on the page where the balance sheet is, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's the trailing 12 months, I believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The easiest thing &#x2013; I have it &#x2013; you can look at that page from last quarter and that will give it to you. But it is, well, I guess take off the prior quarter. Yeah, we tend to focus more on DCF and you'll see that's $318 million. I actually haven't done it on an EBITDA basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we can call you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
