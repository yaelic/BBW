          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Analyst Conference here in London. This conference is being webcast, so hello to everyone watching us through the webcast. We have with us Siemens' President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher, and our CFO, Joe K&#xE4;ser. We have a number of things that we want to tell you. We will guide you through the announcements we did this morning. Every document should be found on our Internet website, Investor Relations. Also, the presentation that we'll walk you through now is being put on that website.</p>
          <p>So we will talk to you about the Q4 numbers, but also the guidance for last fiscal year. Of course, we will talk also about the guidance we have set for this coming fiscal year. And we will speak about the program we had mentioned already in the Q3 conference call, and we'll outline to you how we set the priorities for the next two years to reach and to come closer to the One Siemens framework we have set.</p>
          <p>I would ask you to please put your BlackBerrys and phones on mute so that we make sure that we don't have any issues during the conference. We will have after the presentation a Q&amp;A, give you the opportunity to ask questions, and I'll ask you if you could please clearly mention your name and the company you're from so that everyone watching us through the webcast can follow this correctly.</p>
          <p>And I think, with that, I would hand over to you, Peter.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mariel. Good afternoon to everybody. Let's go straight into our afternoon program. Let me start with the new company program 2014. The new company program 2014 has a clear goal to refocus the company towards strong margin performance against competition like we have been in fiscal 2011 and support our One Siemens framework for sustainable capital-efficient growth and shareholder return.</p>
          <p>One major item of Siemens 2014 is a fitness program for our portfolio, both through targeted acquisition on the one side, but also through divestments for our businesses where we feel that other owners can generate more value than we can. I will touch upon the recent portfolio moves in a minute. Finally, we will talk about our assumptions and expectations for 2013.</p>
          <p>However, let me start with a couple of key takeaways and financials of the fourth quarter of 2012. Orders were moderately down by 4% year-over-year due to continued softness of the global economy impacting many of our businesses, while Energy boasted organic growth due to a large number of orders, mainly in Fossil and Wind Power. Revenue growth eased to 1% year-over-year, driven by strong backlog conversion in Energy and strength in Healthcare.</p>
          <p>Book-to-bill was just shy of 1, and reached 0.99. Our backlog stood at &#x20AC;98 billion, of which around &#x20AC;41 billion will convert into sales in 2013. For most part, we saw a strong underlying performance for Total Sectors profit; however, Total Sectors profit is below the prior year, mainly due to substantial burdens of &#x20AC;566 million in the Energy sector originating from project charges and from a special situation of our remaining activities in Iran, which I will touch upon later.</p>
          <p>Since profitability below sectors improved notably, with a positive contribution from equity investments, we achieved a net income from continued operations of almost &#x20AC;1.5 billion, just 2% below the fourth quarter of 2011. Also, free cash flow showed impressive strength, at more than &#x20AC;4.3 billion, and Joe will talk about this in more detail later. During the quarter, the preparations for the OSRAM spin-off progressed as planned.</p>
          <p>Mostly due to the strong operational finish in the fourth quarter and positive impacts from below the fixed items, we reached the lower end of our guidance for the full year. Revenue growth for the fiscal 2012 reached 3%, while the book-to-bill ratio was at 0.98. Income from continuing operations came in at &#x20AC;5.2 billion, including significant adverse effects from legal and regulatory on the lower right-hand side of the charts, and benefiting from discontinuing the Solar business.</p>
          <p>If we look at a regional perspective, we clearly can see that the macro indicators such as PMI in Europe and U.S. or the industrial value-added in China, are pointing to a slow growth in a global economy, or I should say to a slowing growth in the global economy. This was also evident in our business figures, with moderately declining orders in all three geographies. While Germany had tough comps with a series of large orders in the previous year, this was balanced in other European countries, such as Northwest Europe, where we saw the bulk of our large Wind orders. Base orders overall were flat on a nominal basis in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>The Middle East grew by 80%, compensated partially for a weaker development in China and India. China is still in a transition period towards the new administration, and as indicated, we have not seen an uptick in the amount in infrastructure projects or in the manufacturing industry yet in China. Overall, emerging markets accounted for 32% of orders in the current quarter. Growth distribution is different when we are looking at revenues. The Americas delivered clear revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with a very strong Energy business in U.S. Emerging markets showed a mixed picture, with 30% growth in Russia but weakness in China and India. Emerging countries accounted for 34% of Siemens' revenue for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's go through the Sector picture for the quarter and major items that drove profitability. Energy recorded a very good book-to-bill of 1.14 in the quarter, with particular strength in Asia and Australia. As mentioned, Sector profit was sharply down due to several one-offs. The largest impact came from &#x20AC;327 million charge and there of &#x20AC;275 million in the Oil &amp; Gas division with regard to our business in Iran. This charge affected projects conducted under Siemens' previously disclosed policies regarding Iran addressing sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and European Union or other countries or organizations.</p>
          <p>The underlying business in Fossil and Oil &amp; Gas was again healthy, with a strong product and service business. I'm sure you saw our announcement with regard to the planned divestment of the Solar business, and therefore we are reporting only Wind numbers instead of renewable, and moved our Solar activities to discontinued operations as of Q4. Our Hydro activities, mainly the equity share in Voith Siemens Hydro, are now held at the Sector Energy level.</p>
          <p>Wind Power delivered industry-leading profitability of 9% based on volume during the earnings conversion in a challenging competitive environment. So the next quarter might be weaker again due to the seasonal effects, mostly in offshore. Transmission is well on track with its transformation program and recorded &#x20AC;66 million charges to improve competitiveness in the Transformer business. Additional charges of &#x20AC;67 million for the offshore grid connection projects are related to detailed planning of the approaching offshore installation activities.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Healthcare. Sector Healthcare delivered another excellent quarter, proving that the stringent execution of the agenda 2013 is paying off. As in previous quarters, growth was driven by a broad-based double-digit revenue increase in China and an improved Diagnostics growth performance, and this compensated for ongoing softness what we see in Europe as well as in U.S. The jump in profitability was led by an excellent contribution from the Imaging &amp; Therapy Systems business, in part due to portfolio improvements.</p>
          <p>Diagnostics is on schedule with its competitiveness program, while profitability was temporarily slightly lower. In its short-cycle businesses, Industry delivered a solid performance in an increasingly volatile market. We are cautious for the next quarter since we currently see a cooling down in important end markets such as automotive and machine tool builders. Profitability was weaker due to the renewable offerings of the sector, such as wind gearboxes and solar inverters. The sector took action to adjust capacities and optimize the portfolio in this area.</p>
          <p>Industry is also rigorously executing on further focusing its portfolio with the acquisition of the Belgium software company, LMS International, and the subsequent divestment of the Water business, which I will touch upon in a few minutes in more detail.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Infrastructure &amp; Cities. Orders were down on a lower volume of large rolling stock orders, while revenues were supported by strength in Americas. Profit margins saw in particular in the Power Grid Solutions &amp; Products business a nice upswing supported by strong earnings conversion from higher volume in low and medium voltage. Building Technologies delivered again a seasonal strong profitability, driven by good demand for its energy-saving solution and positive impact from cost reduction actions.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me now turn over to you, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. Hello, everyone, to our conference here in Landon. Let me now continue with our free cash flow performance for the quarter. Obviously, the good news is that free cash flow was outstanding. The other news is it should have happened earlier than the last month of the fiscal year, so we've got to be focused more on a steady performance on free cash flow. And that's got to do obviously with the fact that our turns on average also need to be in the neighborhood between 9 or 8.9 in order to achieve for the month, and that is something which we also take a serious look at so that the steadiness grows.</p>
          <p>The other topic which is worth mentioning despite a, as I said, impressive number, is that obviously some of the orders which had been expected in October/November timeframe had already been materializing in September. With that, of course, was an associated prepayment, so there might be some weaker free cash flow as expected in our fiscal Q1 2013.</p>
          <p>The other topic I want to mention here, in the connection of the yearly bridge, which is in the right-hand side of the slide, obviously shows basically two matters I want to mention. First is you can see that our depreciation and amortization, which amounts to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, is not fully covered and spent by incremental CapEx. So we've been putting tightness on that matter, so that means that the CapEx will be slower than depreciation, and that's also good for 2013.</p>
          <p>The other topic I'd like to mention is, we see that here in the box, is that this topic that we get less prepayments associated with our bookings has been materializing in fiscal 2012 in the neighborhood of &#x20AC;1.2 billion. And obviously some of that is related to the fact that orders have been declining for several quarters in a row if we compare that year-over-year, but there is also a structural impact that more and more customers are less willing to put prepayments on top of the order intake, and that obviously also leads to the fact that we need to look into the pricing policies once we do the bid.</p>
          <p>That's important as we go forward, and there are many reasons to that. Obviously, our business has changed a little bit, so there is more mix towards product-related topics, to a lesser extent to turnkey projects, so that also will basically make sure that, on the one hand side, we do not get as much free cash flow for prepayments; on the other hand, as you can imagine, the risk associated with taking turnkey is going down.</p>
          <p>If we move on to the so-called below-the-line items for the quarter as well as, then, for the year, I also will be mentioning what to expect in 2013, if we go through the year numbers. But why don't we do the quarter first. You can see that on top of the strong performance of our Sectors, coming in at &#x20AC;2.1 billion, which actually included some &#x20AC;500-plus million on adverse one-offs, making the underlying strengths even higher, you could see that for the first time in its existence, NSN was positively contributing to a favorable income in the equity investments.</p>
          <p>That could go on for a while. I would also expect a decent quarter on NSN for the current quarter, and if &#x2013; been gaining some tailwinds here due to the fact that NSN, after all, was early in <mark type="ph" /> decent (14:42) restructuring, so that could actually help drive profitability and productivity at NSN. But the fact of the matter remains that this obviously is an industry which you'd rather avoid if you can help it. We'll be dealing with it, and we will continue to drive as much as we can in our limited impact to the business.</p>
          <p>SFS, obviously be coming in at &#x20AC;100 million-plus, which was well above what we had been hoping for, reason being that this has also been positively impacted by a few favorable one-offs. But what you also see in Q4, and we expect that to be continuing, is that some credit hits are showing off along the lines, most of them coming from the renewable environment. This is not a default, but we could clearly see that there is some stress in the system, which we carefully watch. We don't expect major adverse impacts in 2013, but this is something which we see coming. It could also be serving as an early indicator that matters are cooling in terms of economic impact.</p>
          <p>SRE obviously is always supposed to be about zero on its operational performance supporting the businesses. So if you see positives like this &#x20AC;88 million in Q4, it has been related to the disposal of assets which we do not believe we need over a period of time.</p>
          <p>Corporate items are usually a bit higher in Q4 than they are on average, coming in at &#x20AC;283 million, and so the pension and the treasury which is pretty much in line on what we have expected, and taxes, as you can see, 27%, slightly below what the market should expect in 2013. So if the market goes to 30% for 2013, that could be a decent number to be on the safe side with.</p>
          <p>If we go to 2012 for the year, obviously the numbers are self-explaining, so I'm not trying to explain the numbers, which you know already, but more what to expect in 2013. As I mentioned earlier, equity investments ought to be significantly more helpful to the total bottom line as they used to be in 2012. NSN got some leeway due to early restructuring. On the other hand, the business itself in nature could be highly volatile in terms of the impact.</p>
          <p>SFS, as I said earlier, the &#x20AC;479 million were positively impacted by about a &#x20AC;50-plus million equity dividend, so if that was to be considered as a one-off, that could also be the ballpark to expect going forward. CMPA should not play a major role in the development in 2013, while SRE will always be, obviously, volatile depending on asset disposal. We continue our policy making long-term fixed cost also variable over time. That means selling assets and leasing back for a while in order to be flexible over time, depending on market conditions.</p>
          <p>As far as corporate items/pensions are concerned, there have been a few favorable one-offs during the course of 2012. We've been reporting them in the earnings releases or in the conferences. So if someone wants to take a view on 2013 and what to expect for a quarter, I would probably feel safe with a &#x20AC;250 million per quarter on average, on average, including the impact of IAS 19R. So that obviously, when I said seasonal; usually Q4 is a bit heavier; Q1 and Q2 is somewhat lighter as we go along over 2013. But that just could be about the pullback, &#x20AC;250 million, for corporate items, pensions, including the new version of the pension return.</p>
          <p>Corporate treasury and other, obviously, highly volatile due to the fact that hedging which does not qualify for hedge accounting could have turned either way. The good news is that wherever it goes, the counterpart sits on the operational business. So if you take a &#x20AC;50 million round-about to fill that line item on the chart, that could be a number to deal with. So that much to treasury, and as I already said, tax bracket, 30%, is always helpful to be on the slightly conservative side.</p>
          <p>Let me now move really quickly, because there's much has been said already, to the development of our equity to debt swap, which is widely known as a share buyback program, which in essence it was, but it has much more to it. By buying back shares and issuing debt to finance it, we actually had a &#x20AC;120 million round-about annual savings, which obviously also helps the cash position. We've been completing our buyback. As of yesterday, we were just a bit shy of the &#x20AC;3 billion, slightly shy, not a really big deal. And we completed the whole exercise at an average buyback price of &#x20AC;77.</p>
          <p>So that also is helpful. You might have seen the conditions which we got in the bond market. The two-year-plus was 20 bps below mid-swap. The long eight-years was 1.5%. That's something which we believe could be helpful over those periods of time. Now, that obviously also translates into incremental return to our shareholders. You can see on the right-hand side what it did to the shareholder benefit. This is what we do. This is what we said. And in this particular case, we did not only say; we also executed on the matter.</p>
          <p>In general, you might have seen that &#x2013; and I'll come to that later &#x2013; that also due to the experience which we have been making on the latest exercise, we have been lifting our payout ratio on the One Siemens financial framework by including not just the cash dividend, but obviously also by including some shareholder return elements associated with incremental share buybacks. So the commitment stands 40% to 60% payout either as a dividend or as some sort of buying back shares or a combination of both over a period of time. And obviously, one would also consider that as the view of management whether the shares are cheap or not, and that's what we believe is important going forward.</p>
          <p>If we have a quick look on the cockpit of the One Siemens financial framework for 2012, obviously revenue growth on the upper left-hand side, it's been above or just about slightly above our competitors' basket, and you should know what the basket is, and it's available if someone wants to really see it, who is in there and who isn't. Obviously, the fact is that we've been highly benefiting from a very favorable currency impact, but last year, the impact was different, and we didn't use it either. So that's not here. That could change again, as I said, during the course of changing in the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>If you look what this growth did to our margins, one can clearly see that Energy, at face value, has just been bailing out of the margin band. That's got to do, first and foremost, with the fact that we have been applying a highly conservative view on the impact of incremental sanctions associated with the Iranian customers by changing the accounting method from POC accounting down to cash-based accounting, so that's been the effect. So the business is not gone. The business is still there, but we have been applying cash accounting, cash-based accounting, so whenever the money comes, we will realize revenues as well as profitability. The impact gross before taxes has been around about &#x20AC;350 million, either way, in revenues as well as in margins. And if one wants to take that into consideration here, the real number, without the Iranian accounting measure, would have been 10.3%.</p>
          <p>Everywhere else, as you can see, it's been doing pretty well; Healthcare obviously now harvesting the benefits of an <mark type="ph" /> early-on agenda 2013 (24:08); Industry, decently in the middle. And Infrastructure &amp; Cities, as we have always said, this is going to be something which we are in for in the longer term. This is nothing for the short term because, obviously, the fact of the matter that some divisions need some incremental boost remains in place.</p>
          <p>Obviously, where we cannot be that satisfied with is the capital efficiency. As you know, it's the centerpiece of our One Siemens operating framework, and it continues to be the centerpiece. It's been down about 500 basis points like-for-like, obviously, from the &#x20AC;21.9 million to &#x20AC;17 million. The fact of the matter is that we had a double-whammy. Profit went down and assets went up, and if you have numerator in the denominator, then this is what we get. The good news is we've realized the fact that we need to focus on that matter significantly, and you can rest assured that obviously this is in the centerpiece of the program also.</p>
          <p>So we need to sharpen our senses here. We've done that with our Siemens 2014, and that's now what Peter is going to explain in more detail, where we want to be, how to get there, and what it all gets us in our books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. As you can see here, first of all, we have set a clear-cut target at the total Sector profit margin level, from 9.5% today to 12% or greater by 2014. In addition, we also expect that all sectors stay within the EBITDA target margin range, as well as that each one of them is at the better performance level compared to 2012. As part of it, we also expect, of course, transformational charges such as restructuring, write-downs, and the likes, up to &#x20AC;1.5 billion. The majority, around &#x20AC;1 billion, will occur in fiscal 2013.</p>
          <p>If we look into the different levers and how we split the program, we have split it basically in five levers; the first one really focusing on margin improvement, on the gross margin improvement and cost reduction, and the second big lever is actually strengthening our core activities in terms of a fitness program for our overall portfolio; and both, together, we expect from these two levers having the biggest impact.</p>
          <p>First, with Siemens 2014, we are stepping up our efforts in improving our cost position, and in this area we will also see the vast majority of our activities. The single-largest lever for optimizing the cost base is our supply chain management, where we see further potential to generate productivity gains of, in total, at least &#x20AC;3 billion in the next two years, and Joe will elaborate this in a minute. A second major lever will be continuously to optimize our global capacity and footprint with a business-by-business approach. For example, we have announced in recent weeks several measures, such as the market-driven capacity adjustments of 600 people in U.S. Wind factories.</p>
          <p>As a third topic, we see significant potential to further improve process efficiency and quality, such as improving the projects' execution excellence in the Projects businesses, in our large Infrastructure businesses, and particularly in the Sectors Energy and Infrastructure &amp; Cities. And as I said, this second lever, strengthening our core activities, is of significant essence, and you can see further proof in today's announcements. We'll work with rigor to improve our portfolio and strengthen the strongholds, but also fix underperforming businesses or find sustainable solutions elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Third key enabler is the go-to-market approach, where we currently work on a concept to optimize the way how we can best address our respective customer groups and through which sales channels. For example, the Healthcare Products division strives to increase indirect sales above 50% in 2014, after 47% in fiscal 2012. In addition, we look into our local sales and service organizations, how to match best to set up with the existing market potential, and based on this, we will align regional structures and resources in a more flexible way.</p>
          <p>The fourth lever is optimized infrastructure. Through the SG&amp;A program, we've made significant progress also in Infrastructure costs, but we see further potential to optimize the setup of our support function through shared services such as the bundling of finance functions, which you are well aware of. And finally, we will also look at selective governance functions, like IT, HR, legal and compliance, to take out complexity and strengthen the entrepreneur responsibility of our businesses and go further to a risk-focused governance approach.</p>
          <p>In terms of, as you can see from a series of examples, we are already well underway to execute on Siemens 2014, particularly in the cost reduction portfolio area, and we will give you continuous updates on the various topics over the coming quarters and also deep dives and proof points during Capital Market Days and investor conferences. The first one coming up will be Energy, and then Infrastructure &amp; Cities in March next year.</p>
          <p>The leadership team of Siemens is fully committed to deliver on the One Siemens framework, supported by the targets of Siemens 2014, achieving our total Sector profit margin of at least 12% by 2014.</p>
          <p>Before Joe talks about further financial details of the program, I want to touch upon the recent moves to strengthen our portfolio, which is a top priority of this program. You will see more examples on bolt-on acquisitions and subsequent divestments of less profitable businesses in the quarters to come. Key criteria are whether Siemens is, from a strategic perspective and operationally, the best owner to achieve sustainable improvements for the different businesses.</p>
          <p>A few weeks ago, we announced the divestment of our solar activities, where the framework conditions have obviously significantly deteriorated, and as you all know, the solar market faces substantial overcapacities, strong price pressures in the photovoltaic area, whereas CSP, the concentrated solar power, has remained more of a niche technology. Solar was moved to discontinued operations, and delivered around &#x20AC;200 million in sales and even bigger losses, including an impairment charge of &#x20AC;150 million in Q4 2012. We are in discussions with potential buyers, and we will update you accordingly.</p>
          <p>Going forward, our renewable offering is focused on Wind and Hydro. Today, Sector Industry announced also the acquisition of the Belgium software company, LMS International, a well-established provider of CAE software for simulating and testing mechatronic systems, mainly in the automotive and in the aerospace industry.</p>
          <p>LMS is the next building block in a series of acquisitions for our Industry Automation business, where we so far spent &#x20AC;4 billion for exogenous growth, and the clear goal is to create a leading suite of software products and solutions for product lifecycle management and totally integrated lifecycle automation in our focus industries, and LMS will become part of our PLM business. With this acquisition, Siemens becomes the global number three in the market segment for simulation and testing software, and opens up a strong cross-selling potential for both Siemens hardware and software as well as for LMS products in Siemens' large installed base.</p>
          <p>LMS recorded sales of &#x20AC;140 million in the first nine months of 2012 and has an excellent growth track record, with 25% CAGR over the last three years, combined with strong operational performance. The transaction is based on a purchased price of around &#x20AC;680 million, and the closing is expected in early calendar year 2013.</p>
          <p>However, Sector Industry is further focusing their portfolio and allocating resources to the most promising businesses. The water treatment actives which have been part of the Industry Automation division will therefore be divested. We thoroughly assessed the options and came to the conclusion that there are too limited synergies of the water treatment activities with our core automation drives and industrial software businesses. After a successful restructuring over the last 18 months, we have put this mainly U.S.-based business, with more than &#x20AC;1 billion revenue, up for sale.</p>
          <p>And Joe will go now into the details of the other Siemens 2014 levers, so over to you, Joe.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you, Peter. Let's now move on from the structural side of the actions to more the operational topic. And there's quite a number of bottom-up planned and agreed-upon examples. And before I lead you through a very few of those examples, and there are a lot more like those, I would like to mention that if we talk about the second lever of the program, which is focusing the core portfolio, the assumption in the program is that there is not going to be any accretiveness by that point during the duration of the program, okay, not any accretiveness coming from item number two during the course of the two-year program.</p>
          <p>However, obviously, this will be highly accretive in the midterm for our spectrum, and I'm sure everyone understands what that means in terms of the combination between buying and selling. It's very important that you understand the assumption. It may turn out to be differently, but that's the assumption on the program.</p>
          <p>As far as the operational topics are concerned, you'll see one each from the four sectors. And it's not really helpful for everyone to go through the technical details of it, but if you only look at them on what they get us in terms of savings, you can see the design-to-cost matter in Fossil frames get to the &#x20AC;250 million to 2014. The consolidation of mechanical drives in the Sector Industry, which is a somewhat sensitive matter because you talk about manufacturing footprint here, and manufacturing footprint and consolidation always means that there is some sort of value-add to a consolidation, but that also will provide us a meaningful three-digit number on savings, and you will see a series of those topics especially related to Industry and Infrastructure where there is a majority of manufacturing plants around the world.</p>
          <p>If you look at radiation oncology on the Healthcare sector, which obviously is being already a part of the agenda 2013, which by the way is also material enabler to get done with our 2013 program for the company, you'll see a &#x20AC;100 million profit impact here. And last but not least, billing technology, streamlining the regional setup in Europe, which obviously is important to look at because Europe is considered to be a structural change as related to the degree of growing assumptions going forward. And if we understand a matter to be structural in nature, this will be a restructure. If we believe there is some weakness which is temporary in nature, we obviously are using different tools on keeping our ability to deliver once it goes up again.</p>
          <p>One typical example, by the way, would be the automotive industry, so if there is some temporary weakness in Germany, which cannot be ruled out at this point in time, you'll obviously go look to keep the know-how and train people, make sure that the cost of labor will be adequately adjusted.</p>
          <p>So if you take all that together there, all those four examples, what you'll see here already accounts for about &#x20AC;600 million out of cost reductions or productivity. That's only a few examples, and you will see more of those in a deep dive when we do have the Sector Capital Market Days, the first one, as Peter mentioned, starting with Energy in December 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, the single-biggest impact on the two-year program &#x2013; and you are talking about the enabler, that's very important to talk about the enabler and how to get there. The goal is clear. The goal is greater/equal 12% Sector profit. That's the goal. And now we talk about how to get there &#x2013; is obviously the matter of purchasing design-to-cost elements, and I come to that what I mean by that.</p>
          <p>You may remember that a couple of years ago, three years ago, in the meantime, we sat here together with Barbara, and she was explaining to us on how to streamline the purchasing function and how to make a global powerhouse out of the purchasing functions by doing a lot of things, such as managing volume from the corporate point, to do e-auctions, global value-sourcing, reduction of a supply base in the first step, and then qualifying it in the second. And here are the numbers; here's the track record. This is what we have been achieving in those four elements. And you can basically see that all four have been going north, mostly as expected. In some parts, we actually &#x2013; we were a bit ahead of the goal. You can see where the goals were and where we finally ended up.</p>
          <p>And so that's good. That's decent. And some of you might remember that in 2011, actually a year ago, I was showing a slide with a bridge on how gross margin was developing. And you may remember there was a purchasing item in there with &#x20AC;1.3 billion, purchasing only. So not that we only took the suppliers down, not that we only increased the global value-sourcing; we got something out of it, and as 2011, as related to the gross margin, was &#x20AC;1.3 billion, purchasing only. All right? &#x20AC;1.3 billion, just keep that in mind for a while, because I'll come back to that later.</p>
          <p>Now, that's been the phase of consolidation, clean the house, make a powerful purchasing organization out of what we had. That first step, this consolidation, now comes to an end, and we move into the next layer, and the next layer is now combining the different elements of making good products and competitive products out of it. And that's about purchasing, that's about manufacturing, that's about supply chain and logistics, and that's about engineering &#x2013; not research, but the engineering which is close to the product.</p>
          <p>And we put that together, we put that together, and out of that action and series of savings also in purchasing we expect a &#x20AC;3 billion, around about a &#x20AC;3 billion of productivity and cost-saving potential over the period of two years. So, if nothing else, divide it by two, so we have an average number per year which is &#x20AC;1.5 billion, and as I said, 2011 was &#x20AC;1.3 billion, so it's not that much of a number with one might believe is coming out of the sky. We've done that before, and we'll do it again.</p>
          <p>And obviously it's not just about purchasing being the biggest, the best lever; it is also about the area where you best put it. It's sustainable, because it involves everything, it gives a sustainable value, also to the suppliers that are negotiating, and then one's a dollar short, the other one is a dollar long, and the moment the power changes, it goes the other way. So there is very little restructuring involved. It goes quick. The savings are quicker. About 40% &#x2013; four-zero &#x2013; 40% of the total cost of the company is about purchasing of services and bill of materials. So you can clearly see how huge the impact is, and this is what we're going to go about. Now, obviously the design-to-cost element is nothing which is for the short term; this is more related in its impact to 2014.</p>
          <p>Now, if we go to how to get there, and again, it's very important to understand the goal is we are going to be at 12-or-larger percent of profitability for the sector, pre-tax, including some charges, which we expect to be about &#x20AC;500 million by the time, and that's what we want to. That's the goal.</p>
          <p>Now the question is how do we get there and what are the assumptions, how to get there along the way, and there are a series of assumptions. Obviously, the first one, as you can see, is the topic of volume/digressions, and that's associated with the question how do we expect revenues to develop over the course of two years. And as you can see, the bar is not that helpful and that very long. That basically means that we actually expect a more modest growth for the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>If you look at the guidance which we have been putting out for 2013, that actually called for approaching the levels of 2012. So then if you talk about modest growth, you can expect that we also would assume some growth resuming in 2014, to put it, modest on average. So that's the first assumption. If they change, they've got upsides. And if they've got downsides, we need to go look how we can incrementally make sure that the 12% stands at the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>Second topic to give you some flavor on &#x2013; again, might be right, might be wrong at the end, but you should know the assumptions, and that's about pricing. If you look at 2013/2014, we expect an average price decline for the whole spectrum of the company of 2.5% to 3%. That's about the ballpark we expect. It's a bit more on Healthcare, and Energy should be significantly less and Industry, and just around the ballpark in Cities &amp; Infrastructure. And that 2.5% to 3% pretty much compares with what we got in 2012. Here we had a number of &#x2013; effective number of 2.5% price decline over the company's spectrum.</p>
          <p>So that's the assumption here, which obviously has an adverse impact on margin. Cost inflation of course includes merit increases all over the world, which are different in percentages. And I've got some other topics included. For example, and theoretically, if OpEx increased for some reason, that would be part of this item here that cost will be increased. So that's the assumptions on how to get there. And if some assumptions change, then we need to see how that impacts the goal, but the goal stands for 2014.</p>
          <p>And the whole program, ladies and gentlemen, the whole program has been designed to support the financial principles of One Siemens. It puts a tighter framework to it than One Siemens was. One Siemens was more a framework for the operating businesses to be in the centerpiece of 15% to 20%. No matter what they do, they've got to arrive there. The program now makes sure that we have a somewhat tighter grip on that we really get there.</p>
          <p>Now, if someone designs a program on making sure to get there, this is also the time to look at the framework itself, where there is some opportunity to tune it up a little bit and to look what can be improved and what can be changed, and we actually have been coming up with two topics, and you can see that on either side. We have been changing the hurdle rates for M&amp;A slightly. Instead of being EVA-accretive two years post-closing, we now say the hurdle rate moves three years post-integration.</p>
          <p>And the second topic was the topic of when do we want to achieve the company's target of ROCE 15% over time. We looked at it that we can clearly see it is more meaningful to put a cash return on it rather than being tied up for many, many years on PPA and what have you, which come along the M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So why have we been changing it? Well, first of all, it's meaningless to have hurdles which cannot be achieved, given the nature of our focus. And the nature of our focus, ladies and gentlemen, is about software, it is about stickiness in the business, and it is about embedded software and controls, be it in Smart Grid, be it in Energy, be it in Industry, or be it obviously also in Infrastructure &amp; Cities. To a lesser extent, obviously, this is for Healthcare because we've been pretty well equipped on Healthcare as far as M&amp;A activities are concerned, especially on the buy side, definitely on the buy side.</p>
          <p>Now, that's been the reason for that, and obviously, to make sure that the market understands this is more about meaningful focus rather than spending more money now, we obviously have put ourselves into the right basket here and said that we want to increase the payout of our profitability, mostly also cash support the profitability. Rather to have 30% to 50%, we go for 40% to 60%, in a combined way, so it could be dividend, it could be share buyback, or a combination of both. That's important for the market to understand.</p>
          <p>And with that, I put it back to Peter to do the guidance and the outlook for 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. Let me briefly summarize our outlook for 2013. The first year of our program, we expect a moderate order growth, revenue approaching the level of fiscal 2012, both on a like-for-like basis. We expect income from continuing operations in a range between &#x20AC;4.5 billion and &#x20AC;5 billion, including the effect of retroactive adoption of the IAS 19R. And this also includes charges totaling approximately &#x20AC;1 billion for program-related productivity measures in the sectors, and with the productivity gains realized in our results for fiscal 2014.</p>
          <p>Let me bring this to close. This is a program which is nothing else than the clear commitment of the management team of Siemens to focus on the key element of our One Siemens approach, and the key element is how do we do relative to our competitors, and therefore we have given you a clear, transparent target of 12%. We are committed to achieve this, and we will follow through this with precise actions, and you can expect from us proof points along the way as we start to get this program being implemented, and this show has highlighted several of the actions have already started.</p>
          <p>And with this, I want to close, and we're happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>A lot of hands are being raised, so why don't we start with the left of this room. We'll start with Michael Hagmann, and then we'll continue with Olivier Esnou on this side.</p>

          <p>Michael Hagmann, HSBC. If you look at the portfolio optimization, we have now seen some smaller steps with Solar and with Water. Obviously, within the portfolio, there are quite a number of businesses which have sub-average margins and relatively high execution risk. So the question is, if we look forward, do we see higher or larger disposals, or do you think we'd be rather looking at portfolio optimization in the range of businesses with &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;1 billion of revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I don't want to speculate here. What the reality is that we have actually a clear focus on it where we have actually at &#x2013; where we thoroughly look at the tail end of our businesses, and it does not always mean that you have to dispose. We give these business units higher transparency. They have to come forward to the main board. They have to prove to us that there is a clear-cut strategic plan in place how they can actually, long and sustainable, have a strategic plan in place to outperform competition and where we have a lasting competitive edge. And if, along the way, we are not convinced about it, we will take the decisive actions like you have seen it also with Water. But there's no speculation on our part at this point in time, will it large be, will it be small and the size of it. But what you should expect is, as we have also an active program how to strengthen the core of our portfolio, at the same time, you will also and should also expect from us clear-cut disposals bringing them forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it could also be a larger business rather than just the &#x20AC;1 billion or so?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Olivier Esnou, Exane BNP. So a few questions, first, how have you changed the incentive program of management to align it with your objective of 12%? Secondly, regarding the productivity measure, so the &#x20AC;3 billion over the next two years, I think I understood you said you made &#x20AC;1.3 billion last year of productivity. Is that correct? I'm not sure I got it right. But what I would like to know is what you've done over the last two years in these specific measures that you're highlighting going forward, to get a sense of the track record really. And lastly, if it's possible, this 12% margin for 2014, it's on a portfolio of assets. I would like to know what is the performance in 2012 for the same portfolio, because you're moving assets out, so I just want to make sure, is the 9.5% that you're reporting in 2012 totally comparable in terms of portfolio to the 2014 base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start off with the incentive programs. The incentive programs are actually already pretty much aligned in terms of shareholder value creation. If you remember, the key element what we put in place is relative to competition, so whatever you achieved the year before, and continuous improvement. So whatever you have done in the past becomes the starting point in terms of for the next year, and if you perform at the same level, you get less in your pocket. And the three elements what we are focusing on, with the team's cash performance, as Joe has highlighted, EVA performance, and growth. And so &#x2013; and the alignment is clearly around how we're actually targeting the continuous improvement towards the level of 12%, and this is the kind of &#x2013; and this will also clearly be reflected in our overall incentive programs. There's very specific targets to be hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Olivier, to the other two questions, what is this &#x20AC;1.3 billion all about, which I mentioned earlier, the &#x20AC;1.3 billion was the effective cost savings as part of the gross margin for purchasing in 2011 over 2010, &#x20AC;1.3 billion effective savings in the cost of goods sold in 2011 out of purchasing as compared to 2010. That was the number. Okay? So it's been already achieved, and I was just giving that example, and you might have the slide still that puts it into perspective what we expect for the around-about &#x20AC;3 billion over two years, was &#x2013; only half is &#x20AC;1.5 billion, and if we had achieved &#x20AC;1.3 billion in 2011, that's pretty close.</p>
          <p>So as far as your other question, and obviously the question is a very good question, but remember, I just said that the impact of the portfolio focus in the next two years associated with the program is considered to be neutral, because if I go to the acquisitions with PPA and the like, and since don't report it, we consider the impact of item number two to be neutral during the course of the program, but be highly accretive as we move along in the midterm. So that actually should answer the question in terms of the impact of it. And what the spectrum will look like in 2014, that's a good discussion to have in 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just as a follow-up, so should I assume that, over the last two years, there has not been any specific improvement in terms of optimizing global capacity and footprint and increasing process efficiency, so this is net new for Siemens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, no, no, no. It's not a net new number which goes on top of everything. Sometimes you have mix effects and what have you. But I also want to come back to the slide I was showing in 2011, just about a year ago, on the gross margin development. There was a &#x20AC;1.3 billion of purchasing, and there was a huge number, about &#x20AC;3 billion, around about that ballpark, on other productivity, including mix. Now, obviously, at that time, the mix was significantly favorable because that was just the time where the short-cycle businesses have been recovering, remember? So there was a meaningful portion out of the mix. But if you choose that as a ballpark, take half of that for the mix, and the other half is productivity, then you have already that half, which is &#x20AC;1.5 billion, plus the &#x20AC;1.3 billion, which is a &#x20AC;2.5 billion, &#x20AC;2.8 billion number, so this company has achieved that before, what it is now going to commit to 2014. So this is not a rocket science number which never been there ever before.</p>

          <p>Okay, we'll continue with Andreas Willi in the third row, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Andreas Willi from JPMorgan, two questions, please. The first one on divisional margin volatility, we've had, to the upside in Q4, some very good numbers from some of the divisions that contrasted strongly with what we have seen over a couple of quarter before. We had similar kind of quarterly margin volatility kind of pre-2007, and then for a while it became much more steady. What's your internal analysis why some of these businesses, which are large the size of other listed companies, can go from 4% margin to 9% to 5% to 7%, which we don't really see in similar-size companies if they are independent? And the second question; in terms of hiring and head count, obviously a lot of questions this morning in the press call, but in terms of just natural attrition and hiring, is there any specific hiring freeze at Siemens now, or how do you use the lever of natural attrition to improve productivity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas, let me start with the head count first because it's important. As you know that this is certainly one of the key levers what we are able to pull, and we have it clearly on a business-by-business, where you have to look at this issue. So the overall number, certainly, there's a very clear and tight focus on this number to pull, of course, as part of this lever. And other one is we have to have targeted programs on the issue &#x2013; where do we see structural issues, and with structural issues we have to adjust also employment. A good example is the 600 people what we have taken action on, on the Wind business in U.S., as the PPC basically ran out, out of the 1,600. Joe has also highlighted an example in terms of how we actually adjust on the gearboxes for the wind industry. So, but it has to be really around the issue where do we have issues basically where we can manage through the cycle, and then we have to use the flexibility aspects what we have created together with the employee representatives already in the last downturn. And where we have structural issues, and this would be focused, targeted initiatives, they will be discussed, they will be agreed with the employee representatives, and they will be executed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andreas, maybe on the other topic of volatility, I would assume that you have already been considering these so-called one-offs, the underlying matters which we usually are very transparent about in the earnings release. But leave that aside for a while. On the other side, we get a lot of volatility &#x2013; for example, I'll just pick one, Industrial Automation. As you have seen in Q3, we were at 11.7% profit margin. Now in Q4, we are at 15.2%. There's two areas which are usually highly sensitive in nature. One is volume, and the other one is mix. In the Industrial Automation business, the 11.7% margin was on the back of &#x20AC;2.3 billion profitability, and the 15.2% are on the back of almost &#x20AC;2.7 billion. So volume impact matters massively in areas that we have a series of high automation in our manufacturing plays, because obviously the more revenues you get out of it, the higher utilization is. So that's an example on how much volume matters in such an environment.</p>
          <p>Another topic, for example, has been low/medium voltage. There are companies which have medium and high voltage together. Others have medium on their own. Others have low and medium together. Obviously &#x2013; and maybe to a degree, unfortunately, and we will be looking at it &#x2013; our low-voltage and our medium-voltage business is a different world each if it comes to marginal capabilities, and the more mid-voltage you have in the mix, the better the profit is. The more low-voltage we have at this point in time &#x2013; especially the commodity part of low voltage, not the MCC piece &#x2013; the bigger impact, of course, the mix is. So we will be seeing that over time that we have this type of volatility based on volume and mix, and we will be reporting about it what the impact has been &#x2013; very favorable, by the way, in LMV, because there was a lot of mid-voltage in Q4; to a lesser extent, low voltage. That may normalize again in Q1, for example.</p>
          <p>The other topic, Industrial Automation, the volume has been very strong in Q4. Typically, Q1 is not that strong in volume, and you'll be likely seeing the impact on a quarterly basis. So it is very transparent. It is hardly matters of operational performance which catch us by surprise in the product business. Obviously, if we go to the project business, that is sort of how we execute on the project. There has been some volatility, admittedly, in 2012 from project execution on the large matters. But then even there, there is the turnkey business as related to the product business, and that will obviously cause a significant change in profitability. We'll be transparent. We'll talk about it. But we understand the underlying profitability of each of the <mark type="ph" /> Industry (1:02:50) segments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, why don't we continue here on the second row, Peter Reilly, and then we'll move over to Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank, two questions, please. Firstly, it seems to me there's a bit of a mismatch between the &#x20AC;1.5 billion charges you're talking about and the sort of actions that are in the presentation. A lot of the actions are fairly low-cost in terms of a procurement design to cost, so where's all the money going to go, how much of it's cash, and is there a lot more announcements still to come in terms of things like factory relocations and heavy-duty restructuring? And then, secondly, you've announced lower hurdle rates for your acquisitions. Can you just tell us whether LMS is going to achieve these new lower hurdle rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd be happy to. Let me start with the &#x20AC;1.5 billion, which obviously go &#x2013; &#x20AC;1 billion goes into 2013 as the planning assumption, and about &#x20AC;500 million go to 2014, okay? Now, obviously, I agree with you that purchasing doesn't really cause a lot of restructuring and one-offs. However, if you look into the just about &#x20AC;1 billion, which we mentioned in the program also, which is about cost efficiency and the like, the productivity increase, that goes definitely straight against charges we would be taking. The other topic of consolidating, for example, manufacturing plants, consolidating sites; that will go into charges related to the use of that site going forward, where there might be some value-driving matters, and if you put that &#x20AC;1 billion in savings, which we have been mentioning in the cost savings environment, against the &#x20AC;1.5 billion, you see a payback period of two-and-a-half years to three years, which is not all that bad after all.</p>
          <p>So there is definite actions behind it. Now, of course, based on certain assumptions the management knows about, there is a highly detailed bottom-up plan for everything which happens in 2013, and there's quite a decent amount of understanding what's got to happen in 2014. And above everything and above all of that, there is still management which is accountable for reaching the 12%, no matter what the assumptions turn out to be. Because if the assumptions are less favorable in terms of pricing and volume, and one wants to achieve 12%, there's got to be something more to be done. That's the way we look at it, assuming there's no earth-shattering type of macroeconomic geopolitical topic happing in 2014. But it's early, and once we are there, and it happens, we know what that means.</p>
          <p>So that's important to understand, so this is about understanding what do we spend. So as I said, &#x20AC;1.5 billion versus &#x20AC;3 billion savings <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:58) material design-to-cost, which is rather not much associated with the transformation charges, but the rest of the &#x20AC;3 billion, we get and spend &#x20AC;1.5 billion, that's quite a decent return over time.</p>
          <p>LMS, obviously there are two topics one looks into when we go after acquisitions. One is an acquisition which stricktly needs to achieve the hurdle rate, which are products, factory which are close to what we have. And there are, in cases &#x2013; in exceptional cases, there are investments we are going to take because we believe they are transformatory in nature for a certain business. And we do believe that LMS is transformatory in nature for Industrial Automation because that embedded software engineering in CAE and PLM will basically drive the change from a more hardware manufacturing automation to a software-driven and software-supported design. This is important to us, and if you look at Industrial Automation, profits of about &#x20AC;1.3 billion a year, over 5 to 10 years, it's important to understand if there is a paradigm change, and that's how we look at it.</p>
          <p>But if this is so important to Industrial Automation that we spend that much money, which hardly makes the hurdle rate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:34) in terms of cash return, it's pretty close, then there is no room for management to look into something else. And that's why we said, if it's this important, you'd better make sure that you're not dealing with other assets which are also important to be managed, like, for example in this case, Water. And that's the philosophy. If something is that important, that is transformatory, that you just can't afford to lose because you have &#x20AC;1.3 billion at stake every year, then you'd better be focused on what you need to do. Right? That's the philosophy on strengthening the core, if something is important to get.</p>
          <p>But then again, if you look at the new hurdle rates in terms of cash return, that LMS is pretty close. It's in the ballpark of what we have. And I'll give you one example which is obviously also important for rating considerations and the like. The cash drain, if we dispose of Water, will be pretty compensated by the free cash flow already of the acquisition. So you can see, if you look at cash rather than some PPA-related return on capital employed, you just can see that this is something good for us.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Martin Prozesky from Bernstein, two questions, please. The first, on the revenue guidance for next year, I think it was phrased as it will approach the organic revenue of this year, which was, I think, 4%. Can you give us a bit more context on the macro assumptions there? It seems quite optimistic, given the order trends. Are there big shipments of trains, for example, in next year, or what is your macro assumptions into the second half of next year, maybe? And the second question, on Siemens 2014, are you going to manage this as a kind of a project office, or is this being ingrained in the operating businesses? So just can you give us a sense for are people on point, just how do you manage this? Because it's complex. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, I think this is a &#x2013; the second question is a very important one. The answer is very clear. This is not a centrally managed project organization, where we have hundreds of people sitting in the headquarters of Siemens trying to manage and tell the operating units how to do things. It is, first element, absolute transparency at the board level, fully aligned with budgets and operating responsibilities by division, to be discussed every month in our so-called monthly operating reviews, what Joe and myself have with all the operating heads. So that's the kind of operating philosophy what we put in place.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenue guidance, macro assumptions; if you look into in terms of what we have already in-house, so you see &#x20AC;41 billion is already basically in our order backlog, as we speak, going into 2013, what we have assumed is a slowing global economy. That's the overall macroeconomic assumption. What is not part of our plan is of course what Joe was highlighting, if there's any type of scenario where we have a falling off the cliff. And of course for us it's very important that the short-cycle businesses, we have anticipated a slowing environment, but it's not a macroeconomic assumption of any type of falling off the cliff. Then we would have &#x2013; for whatever reason &#x2013; then we would have a different scenario to be discussed. That's the kind of macroeconomic assumption what we put as a part of the plan.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Fredric Stahl here from UBS. Just maybe you could help us with the allocation of the &#x20AC;1.5 billion of costs that you're taking out, if you can give us an idea how they pan out across the sectors.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matters &#x2013; obviously, look, since those charges, that &#x2013; basically that &#x20AC;1 billion, is also related to several different items such as personnel, sites and the likes, we'd rather discuss that first with the associated workers' representatives and people who are affected by it and regions who are affected by it, and then we'll be happy to disclose. It's just a matter of courtesy. It's obviously important to let the market know what the number is, but it would be bit too early now to break it down to the sectors as well as to sites. So please bear with us at this point in time. This is a bit too early. It may be different in January. We'll see. As Peter mentioned, we'll report about the progress on the program and the most important items basically every quarter, and the more support-oriented environments once a year, that's the number three to five, and then we'll also be happy to share what it is, where it is, what is does, and what the savings associated to that will be in the end.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben Uglow, Morgan Stanley. The first question, with the pricing assumption, Joe, 2.5% to 3%, basically continuing the current trend line, feels reasonably conservative. Is there any part of the portfolio or any part of the business where you feel that we might be reaching a sort of positive pricing point? Are there any underlying trends in Energy or anywhere in the portfolio where you feel that pricing is close to bottoming out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that was question number one. Question number two was &#x2013; I guess a slightly a delicate question, but it was to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm slightly nervous asking it. But you mentioned a risk-focused governance approach in the slide deck, and it seems to me that a lot of the issues we've had this year within Siemens have not been to do with productivity or the core portfolio operation; we have the repeat of the one-offs. And I think when we talked about this in May/June at EPG, there was a view that the sign-off, for example, on big, big projects, like Transmission or whatever it might be, effectively is done by the division head, is done by the guy who knows the most about the underlying business. And the point that I think I made at that time was surely, though, that there does need to be somebody at group level who says, hang on, this represents a risk to the Siemens P&amp;L and the Siemens balance sheet. And I just wondered, in terms of your thought process during this year, have you developed sort of an idea that in terms of signing off on these big projects, things maybe need to change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, thank you very much for allowing us to qualify this very important point. When we talked about risk focus, we were not &#x2013; or I was not talking about in terms of project risks. This we have clearly centralized. It is clearly discussed at the sector CEO level who is reviewing himself the major projects. So there is absolutely a clear-cut global, centralized approach to ensure that the risk aspect is well documented. But this is one aspect. The second one is we have to ensure that we have the right participants as part of the risk assessment. So, in these big projects, in these four projects, the North Sea famous project, we didn't have enough technical expertise in-house to really fully assess this adequately. So there's one element that's ensuring that we have all the adequate resources behind this process and that it is well centralized and well in focus.</p>
          <p>I was not talking about this one. I was more referring to the aspects &#x2013; give you another example. Siemens is very used to the assumption that we have a global setup and then which has cascade functional governance responsibility in the same way. So we cascaded this down the way through the business lines, then we go into the cluster organization, regions, then we go into the cluster, and what we try to ensure going forward is that we don't duplicate structural elements simply in the same way around the world, irrespective if, at the end of the day you're talking about a big country, you're talking about a small country, you're talking about a normal business, so we will much more simplify the overall governance processes in terms of importance of impact, size, and not just replicate functional globalization aspects in there, therefore also simplify in this respect the EHS organization.</p>
          <p>If you have one EHS officer sitting somewhere in a smaller country, of course you need it project-related, you need it around manufacturing sites, but you don't have to cascade this in all three matrix dimensions all the way up; rather, focus in one and cascade it in one. This is what I was referring to, not on the other one. This is very important that we have absolutely a clear-cut focus on this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, can I just follow up on that one before we talk on pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that. And I guess I'm looking at this in an extremely simplistic way, but what I think would be interesting would be to have one person on the board, managing board level or however you organize it, who says that every single large project in terms of its balance sheet impact &#x2013; and I'm talking about a big, big project, several hundreds of millions &#x2013; that has an absolute mandate to approve that at Siemens group level. My understanding is that is not the case today, and isn't &#x2013; I mean, is that fair? Or isn't this something that needs to happen, because otherwise you have a continual risk, where you have enthusiastic divisional managers promoting very, very big projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is already the case today, Ben, here. This is one of the reasons why Joe and myself and that we have decided to have an operational board. So we have all the sector CEOs sitting around the table, and they sign off themselves on these projects. They put it &#x2013; so this is what we have already cascaded upwards. So it's no longer the divisional CEO signing off for the big projects. We escalated this step up that this responsible sector CEO has absolutely a review process around it that he is fully aware that he's signing off that it is ensured that it's actually his personal responsibility of ensuring that the process is right. So this is we have done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Ben, on the pricing, look, if that turns out to be conservative, it's great because then we've got upside already on the right-hand side, if nothing else, or a buffer for some which may go south. So that's &#x2013; the answer is we don't know at this time. We've been looking into the backlog, which has been scheduled already for 2013. We pretty much know what this will look like in terms of pricing. That's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:19:44) longer-term related aspects on project businesses, but we pretty much know that, like Wind, like Fossil, or even some Transmission topics which we've got in there. We pretty much know what the pricing will be. So therefore that is transparent, and that's why, in terms of potential upside, that leaves us with the short-cycle environment, and that's mostly Industry, that's in part IC, and to a less probable part in Healthcare. Now, within Healthcare, it's very little that pricing will ease because it isn't just a matter of competitive pressure, but also about how much the customers are willing or allowed to pay, based on their budgets and their public environment.</p>
          <p>On IC, this is all about low/mid voltage, and on Industry, this is about ITT. In order to ease pricing, there's got to be some sort of scarcities of supply. That's a natural thing. And I don't see that scarcity of supply anytime soon. Actually, it's the other way around. So that's why I would be very careful about jumping to opportunities on this one too quickly. But those would be the areas where, if something positive happens in 2014, there could be some ease of those 2.5% to 3%. For 2013, I do see very limited upside on pricing, very limited.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll move over to Ga&#xEB;l De Bray, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ga&#xEB;l De Bray from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. The first question is back on the &#x20AC;3 billion productivity gains per annum you're targeting for the next two years. So, actually, you've already done it. This is what you said back in 2011. At this time, you apparently require a much higher level of restructuring to get to the same level of savings. So what has changed compared to a couple of years ago? And don't you think that to remain on the same margin trajectory, you actually will need more restructuring in the coming years compared to what we've seen in the past? That's basically the new nature of your operations. The second question is on the comments you made about the cooling down of some of your automotive and animation tools customer's demands. Can you elaborate a bit more on that and what does that mean exactly for Industrial Automation at the beginning of fiscal 2013? And maybe the last question would be on the portfolio changes. You've reclassified the Solar business to discontinued operations, but not the Water business yet, so just to clarify what's the difference between the two and why the accounting is different this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, let me start with the last one &#x2013; look, the last one, we just decided as early as yesterday, so that's why it was literally impossible to have that already qualified for discontinued. Whether or not that, in the end, will qualify for discontinued during &#x2013; based on its size, based on its standalone asset, this will be something we will be determining the rules and regulations to that, and then we'll report what happened to that after the first quarter, and then we'll take it from there. It was important that we applied a focus. How we do it later in accounting, that's the easy part. Not always as easy as it looks, but it's easier. On the topic of cooling down, what does that do to the business, first of all, and based on our assumption, what it does is that we plan revenues to be down in Industry sector, as we plan revenues to be down in Energy. We expect Healthcare to grow and IC also to have some upside. So that's the plan.</p>
          <p>Obviously, now, the sensitivity, the sensitivity of anything material happening to the short-cycle environment, basically its profitability is so high that we felt compelled to mention that as a important need-to-know factor for the guidance. Because you can expect every &#x20AC;1 billion Industrial Automation or motion control, which is that technology, every &#x20AC;1 billion this business is short of is about &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;600 million to the bottom line, like this. Don't even think about changing your costs because it goes quicker than a wink. That's a fact. So that's why we are highly sensitive on that one. And that's why we are so close, as close as we can be to early indicators on the automotive discrete spectrum, as well as the toolmaker's environment is also highly related to automotive, in the end, like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:25:18) or what have you, all those suppliers providing tools to automotive in Germany. And if you look at the carmakers, especially in Germany, the premium carmakers, they have been very successful. There are on a very high level. They seem to be the last one to be affected by a general weakness in the global environment.</p>
          <p>However, if you look at the recent Daimler announcement about expanding the Christmas holidays by, I think, a week or even two, this already is something you could clearly smell that this doesn't go any up, right? And there's been some rebates. If you look at the rebates, they've been increasing, China and the likes. If you look at cars, pretty cheap as related to a year ago in terms of rebate. If you look at these so-called bells and whistles, adding these so-called special models, where you get some stuff that usually costs you a ton of money, for free, that also has been picking up. And there's all signs that it doesn't work that smoothly again as it used to be last year. And that's what you're looking at, and everything else is &#x2013; going to try to smell something which is not there yet, but could be coming, that's the story on this one, and that's why we are so closely looking at those early indicators to understand what is that.</p>
          <p>Now, the good news is &#x2013; the good news is, if you look into the chain of distribution, if you look at the stocking elements, we can clearly see that the distribution channel is highly alert. Sometimes you sell in; the moment they see that they don't sell out, they immediately cancel the next week's or next month's shipments. So I would not expect the distribution channel to be full or overstocked. They're very, very sensitive to it. It is a positive because the backlash on the OEMs suppliers is rather low, as compared to like eight or nine.</p>
          <p>And the other topic is that we seem that we've seen the bottom in China. And, unfortunately, we did not get any upswing, which we consider to be in the second half of calendar year 2013, but it seems that we are kind of muddling the bottom now, which is a positive because, obviously, another downside seems to be limited at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Of the &#x20AC;3 billion numbers through &#x2013; I mentioned the 2011 example, in terms of that is what's possible. Has it gotten any worse? Definitely not, because we are moving now to a very short-term, I-take-it-and-you-give-it approach, to a more sustainable long-term-oriented cooperation between several elements of the value chain, being the supplier, manufacturer, and engineering and logistics, and that seems to be more reliable in terms of defendable outcome. So I would not expect that this has gotten any worse.</p>
          <p>The sensitivity to the whole macro in the short term, and obviously also to 2014, the sensitivity is that we have a pretty well-staffed fixed-cost structure. Okay? That's the downside. And we know that. And that's something we are highly focused on, on what it means if there will be some volume type of disappointments. Because, remember, the goal stands, and the enablers are variable to achieve the goal. That's the mission, and that's why we have a very, very sensitive look into this fixed-cost structure, what the company has and has been building, obviously, over the course of the past year or two.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we still have a lot of people wanting to ask questions, and we're running a little bit out of time, but we'll continue on the right-hand side first with Nick Webster, and then with Daniel just behind him.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Nick Webster from Barclays. Two things; firstly, on the revenue side, you had a target previously of &#x20AC;100 billion. Is that now sort of unrealistic because we're sort of doing better in cost-cutting mode? Is there a drive for Siemens to be a smaller, more compact, more profitable business, or is there still going to be a push, I guess, around larger acquisitions to get to that sort of target? And secondly, just could we get an update on where we are on the Transmission projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, actually, there was a good reason why we have said in terms of the portfolio strength and the underlying businesses should allow us to drive for a growth strategy, but always and only in the context of the One Siemens framework, okay? And this is what we have always highlighted, and there was a good reason why we never put actually a target date against it. So what you should expect from us is that we continue to drive high-quality core Siemens businesses which are able to drive profitable growth, and we will continue to strengthen these type of businesses. And on the other side, we will be absolutely clear-cut focused to ensuring that businesses like Water and others will have &#x2013; who are not living up to the level of performance what we have set in the One Siemens framework, that we will prune them, or that we will take corrective actions in these businesses. And when we talk about acquisitions, also no change; what we always said, we are focusing organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. Now, the size of an almost &#x20AC;80 billion company, bolt-on means a couple of billions, could also mean a couple of millions. But we are not going now in a hyper mode in terms of big acquisition mode to chase a target which we have never actually specified in terms of working towards a given year, and there was a good reason for this.</p>
          <p>And the second question what you have asked was?</p>

          <p>Transmission, yeah, the four projects. The four projects, currently there are no news like we have given it before, so in this quarter, there are no specific news in terms of timing, in terms of how far along are these projects in terms of completion. The two first ones, the big ones, are in the range of 60%, 70%. And the two later ones, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:32:06) and the first one, I don't remember how it's called; they are actually significantly below it, so on an average, we are somewhere between 40%, 45%, but no other delays or any news in this respect in this quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Daniel Cunliffe from Nomura, just two questions. The first one, just picking up on the cash flow point, you talked about a structural mixed shift in cash flow towards products and away from turnkey. If you could just run through why that is, and also the change in the split of the mix, it would be helpful. That was the first question. The second question relates to, I guess, Iran, whether we could expect any potential further charges in the case of a full exit from that country and whether the size of such charge would be factored into your assumptions on the &#x20AC;4.5 billion to &#x20AC;5 billion. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very happy to. Look, on the free cash flow, what we said was that we could see &#x2013; in 2012, we could see basically pretty much a deterioration on the amount of prepayments and the billings in excess, and there is three reasons for that. First, there is a volume reason, which basically just reflects on the negative growth of the bookings, and if they are less than a year ago, you'll see that, if nothing else changes, also on the back of the prepayments. That is the first one. The second one, you could also see that they're taking less turnkey projects and more product shipments to those turnkey projects, so that means that the prepayments usually go to the turnkey consultant and not so much to the product provider, which is usually not that bad of a deal because profitability is usually much better.</p>
          <p>And the third one is, indeed, that some customers are holding liquidity together rather than accept &#x2013; or bidding in terms to accept higher cost of capital in the bid. That's a decision from the customers, right, that they will have it in the bid. I think what I was explaining to was that we need to expect to some further deterioration of the contribution of prepayments to free cash flow development. That was the message. We've discussed that for several years. Some of you certainly know and have been on that for at least more than three years, and now it's been coming, it's been materializing, and it played a significant role in the free cash flow development in fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>On the matter of Iran, I explained already that we've been assuming the fallout of continued sanctions and the associated impact on the country. We expect that the payment capabilities might be significantly less and there is less probability to get paid. That's why we changed from POC accounting to cash-based accounting. Projects are still there. If they pay, we'll book it. And that was an impact on revenues of about &#x20AC;350 million and similar impact, obviously, on profit before tax, and it was about &#x20AC;250 after tax. So that's the story at this time. Could there be anything else going forward? Well, look, if we had known it now, it would highly probable we would have considered it. That's obviously the standard answer to this one. Secondly, if there's any geopolitical development which makes matters worse, there could be some more coming because we still are holding assets in order to support the customers.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, one thing you just need to have in mind, we need to balance now and understand what exactly do we do with our team which supports those projects which are running in the country in a time that there is an embargo, because chances are that at some point in time &#x2013; hopefully, sooner than later, but this is not up to us &#x2013; there will be a change, like it was in Libya, like it was in Iraq, like what have you, and the question is how long are we going to take &#x2013; or keep the capabilities to ship once the circumstances change. And that will obviously be the balance between incurring some cost or let it go, and then if the markets open up for some reason, we are unable to deliver, which is also something to consider. So that's been the disclaimer which we put into the earnings release, that there could be some charges, depending what the development is. We don't know of any at this time. If there were any, it would not basically change the &#x20AC;4.5 billion to &#x20AC;5 billion because, if you look at the footnotes of the guidance, it does exclude legal and regulatory matters.</p>

          <p>And a quick follow-up, would you have an idea of the potential size of those assets in Iran, just approximate?</p>

          <p>So we're seriously running out of time, so we'll take one more question here, Will Mackie. And then we'll have an opportunity, I think, over the next couple of days and then weeks when we are on the road show to take the other questions. Will?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Will Mackie, Berenberg Bank. I'd like to come back to the subject of capital allocation. You've changed a number of the key targets within Siemens One, particularly on capital allocation, and then also on the payout ratio. So how should we think about how you're prioritizing between returning capital to shareholders by dividend or buyback, and specifically with relation to how you're prioritizing M&amp;A and inorganic growth? And then just on that point, when we come to raising &#x2013; or lowering hurdle rates, what actually drove that decision? Was it that you had been missing many opportunities in the M&amp;A space, and therefore, is there a larger pipeline of inorganic growth, or was it rather, dare I say, to justify some of the prior deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. Obviously, there have been a few deals which actually have been meeting the hurdle rates but didn't turn out to be very highly successful, if you think about Solar and others. So it is not about hurdle rates. This is about &#x2013; or making acquisitions is not about adhering to the hurdle rates in the first place. This was a disciplinary framework for our organization in order to understand when they need to go to the board, and if we did also acquisitions which didn't meet the hurdle rates, but then it's got to be escalated up to the managing board to decide whether, despite of being all red traffic lights, we still believe this is a meaningful way. So this must be more a framework for the organization that they better think about twice, if the traffic lights are red, to go to the board, So we didn't miss on any acquisitions just because it didn't go anywhere, and if the organization didn't believe it was necessary, then it was fine. So there was definitely not now a pile-up on acquisitions, and we looked at it, what does it take for the hurdle rates to get them done. This is not the case. All right?</p>
          <p>What did drive the change of it? Well, obviously, as any strategically-oriented company, we have a deal book of certain assets which we believe fit well into the spectrum or are important in terms of transforming the company to a different level, such as software. So if you assume for a while that Industrial Automation, parts of that technology, smart grids, for example, that software more and more determines the combination of hardware and software to a meaningful business, you obviously need to realize that this is not going to make the hurdle rates, because if you do the acquisition on high multiples and put a rosy number to it, then this is going to complicate it. And so we looked at them and tried to understand what is the right thing, and so we changed it from asset-based return to cash return. That's in essence what it was. So there's no pile-up, and there's not going to be any &#x2013; how should I say that &#x2013; any encouragement now to put deals forward if they didn't fly in the first place.</p>

          <p>Okay. Well, thank you very much. As I said, we will be road-showing in the course of November in a number of locations. You'll find this in the financial calendar on the slide deck, page number 28, and then we're very much looking forward to seeing you in our Charlotte location in the U.S. December 10 and 11 for the Energy Capital Market Day.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good-bye.</p>
