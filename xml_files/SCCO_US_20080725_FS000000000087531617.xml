          <p>Thank you very much Jennifer and thank you everyone again for joining us for the second quarter 2008 Southern Copper earnings conference call.  Participating in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, the company's CEO and Genaro Guerrero, Southern Copper's CFO.  Mr. Guerrero will now lead the conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and thanks again for participating in our conference.  Today I will comment about prices, production, financial results, labor situation, our stock split, expansion projects and also I will comment about dividends for this quarter.  After that we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>Let's just start now with the copper prices.  We continue having a positive trend on copper prices, the Lumber Metal Exchange second quarter of 2008 average copper price was $3.83 per pound, higher 10% than the $3.47 per pound average for the same quarter of 2007, and 8% higher than the first quarter of 2008.  Our view regarding copper market is still being very strong.</p>
          <p>Even though there are some signs of demand softness coming from the major development economies and a temporary Chinese de-stocking, we think that this will not mean a downward in copper prices for the remaining of 2008 or significant correction in 2009.  On the contrary, we concluded with a concept of a high probability of higher copper prices in 2009 due to the rebound in Chinese demand and moderate response from the supply side.</p>
          <p>I would like to open my comments about production mentioning that even though second quarter '08 is showing a decrease in copper production, mainly due to the operating stoppages in some of our Mexican mine operations, the rest of our mining activities are working in a regular basis.  The total material move at the mines is above the mining plans for 2008.  And this situation would permit the mining operations to get more exposed reserves and continue rational production.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper's second quarter '08 copper production was 117,000 metric tons, lower 26% at the second quarter of 2007 and 8% lower than the first quarter '08.  The reduction of 14,900 copper tons in production quarter-to-quarter was mainly the result of the following.</p>
          <p>First, the Cananea's stoppage that has decreased the production by around 35,100 tons, comparing second quarter '08 with second quarter '07.  The Toquepala production in Peru decreased by 13% or 5,500 tons due to lower mine ore grade of 0.6% in 2008 versus 0.75% in second quarter '07.  These are great reductions result from the change in mining plants derived from the new reserves of Toquepala announced in 2006.  This production decrease was partially offset by higher recovery and higher SX/EW production at this operation.</p>
          <p>In respect to Caridad production was 3,100 tons lower or 10% less than last year.  Also due to lower grade at this operation, the second quarter '08 copper grade was 0.38% per mine ton.  This figure compares with a 0.42% per mine ton for the second quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>Industrial Minera Mexico copper production declined by 1,600 tons due to the strike at San Martin and Taxco operations. The lower production from diminishing operation has been partially offset by an increase in Cuajone's production of 10% or 4,400 tons, which have improved ore grade and recovery in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Regarding our smelting, our copper smelting production, I'm pleased to report that Peruvian Ilo smelter operation is running at a smelting rate of 36% higher than last year's second quarter.  Now, excluding the possible positive effect of Cananea production in the second half of 2008, we expect copper production to be approximately 245,000 for such half of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about molybdenum.  Molybdenum prices were $32.76 per pound for the second quarter '08, 8% higher than the second quarter '07.  Molybdenum maintains its level of production quarter-to-quarter at 3,900 tons.  For the first quarter '08, molybdenum production increased by 3.5% as a result of higher recovery in La Caridad mine and better ore grade of Toquepala mine.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper will produce a little bit more than 60,000 tons &#x2013; 16,000 tons of molybdenum in 2008.</p>
          <p>About zinc, it is the only metal that is not showing a positive price trend in 2008.  Zinc price in the second quarter of '08 averaged $0.96 per pound, 42% lower than the second quarter '07.  Mine zinc production changed from 33,400 tons in the second quarter '07 to 27,600 tons in the second quarter '08.  This 17% decrease in production is the result of the stoppages in San Martin and Taxco mines.</p>
          <p>Refined zinc production shows 28% improved quarter-to-quarter consequence of one-month delay on our <mark type="inaudible" /> program maintenance that is moved from July to August of this year.  In terms of sulfuric acid production, our company is an integrated producer.  Southern Copper manufactures sulfuric acid as a by-product out of its smelting operations.  The company consumes internally about 18% of its sulfuric acid production from the existing <mark type="inaudible" /> copper production.  The remaining production is sold in either long-term contracts or at store market conditions.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter '08, the company produced 434,000 tons of sulfuric acid and for the first half of 2008, the production was 871,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Now let's look &#x2013; let's go into the financial results.  Net sales for the second quarter were $1,462 million, this figures compares with $1,826 million in the second quarter '08 and $1,499 million, in the first quarter 2008.  Net sales have been affected by lower volume sales, partially offset by higher prices for certain of our products.</p>
          <p>As of June 30th, 2008, we held copper derivative contracts to protect around 88,000 tons of copper production for the period July-December 2008.  These contracts are mainly zero cost collars, with average floor prices of $3.40 per pound of copper and average ceiling prices of $4.23 per pound of copper.  In the first six months of 2008, we had gains of 8.6 million of this copper &#x2013; from this copper derivatives transactions, which were included in net sales.</p>
          <p>In respect of our operating cost, the total for two for the second quarter '08 was 669 million, this figure compares with a cost of 681 million in second quarter 2007 or 634 million in the first quarter of 2008.  Cost of sales in the second quarter '08 was 550 million, 12 million lower compared with the same period of 2007, there was 562 million.  This change basically is due to the following variances. Fuel, power and cost increased by $31 million in Southern Copper.  These variances results from higher fuel and power cost by approximately 36 million in the Peruvian operations, $8 million in La Caridad and $3 million in the rest of the Mexican operations in MMI.  These cost increases were partially offset by 60 million reduction in fuel and power cost at Cananea.  Workers' profit sharing decreased by 27 million mainly as a consequence of the Cananea strike.</p>
          <p>Sales expenses decreased by 10 million due to lower freight expenses and this is because in 2007, we sold greater quantity of copper concentrates from which increased our shipping cost during that period.  We had favorable exchange rate bearings of 2 million mainly from the Peruvian currency depreciation.  Royalty payments decreased by $1 million in Mexico due to the strikes.  And other Cananea related cost decreased by 13 million. However, these costs were partially offset by strike related expenses such as 11 million on severance payments and 16 million in Cananea fixed costs.</p>
          <p>As you know, our industry is under significant cost pressures.  Cost has not decreased as expected due to these factors and this is a major concern for us.  As reported in our press release, the company is taking several actions to reduce or contain operating costs.  Among them we are looking at different options to reduce our long-term electricity costs in both Mexico and Peru.</p>
          <p>In Mexico the company is evaluating a power purchase agreement with an independent power producer who would build and operate a coal fire 600 megawatts power generation plant in Mexico to supply our facilities and accommodate future demand from our Mexican projects.</p>
          <p>In Peru, there is a good opportunity to obtain power generated from gas at a very affordable cost through the development of the Camisea gas deposit.  The company is currently evaluating different options to secure additional power required by the expansion programs conducted in this country.  The company cash costs for ton of copper produced in the second quarter '08 before by-products revenues was $1.85 per pound, $0.53 higher than the $1.32 per pound for the same period of 2007 and $0.34 higher than the $1.51 per pound in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Including the benefit of the by-products revenues the company cash cost was $3.01 per pound in the second quarter of 2008.  This figure compares with a negative cash cost of $0.29 per pound for the same period of 2007.  As I mentioned, our company is experiencing significant cost pressures in fuel, power, the steel and its spare parts cost.</p>
          <p>We believe that our cost control approach to operations and the quality of our assets will maintain our company as one of the most competitive copper producers during this inflationary process.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for the second quarter of 2008 was $877 million equivalent to 60% of the sales.  This figure compares with an EBITDA of $1,179 million or 65% of net sales for the same period of  2007.</p>
          <p>The net income for the second quarter '08 was $549 million, 24% lower than the 726 million achieved in the same period of 2007.  Earnings per share after the three-to-one split amounted $0.62 per pound -- $0.62 per fully diluted share compared to $0.82 per fully diluted share for the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>About the labor situation, I have to say that the strike in Cananea continued during the second quarter of 2008.  The Federal and State government together with the company are making all efforts to resume operations with a &#x2013; in order to get a positive labor relation with the workers as it is the case in our Peruvian operations and other units of Minera Mexico.</p>
          <p>Just confirming the stock split, on June 19, 2008 we declared a three-for-one split of company common stock.  On July 10, 2008 common shareholders of record at the close of business on June 30th 2008 received two additional shares of common stock for every share owned.</p>
          <p>Also I will like to review our expansion in capital project.  As indicated in our press release during the second quarter '08, we continue our efforts on the 2.1 billion investment plan at our Peruvian operations.  Capital expenditures including exploration totaled 139.9 million for the second quarter '08 and we planned to expend approximately $480 million on capital projects and our exploration projects in 2008.</p>
          <p>Investment in Tia Maria project is underway.  As of June 2008, we have committed $540 million in purchase orders and contracts for the acquisition of major equipment including $389 million committed at a fixed price.</p>
          <p>The Toquepala and Cuajone expansion projects are also underway.  For the Toquepala project we have committed $56.1 million to purchase equipment and we have signed a contract for the feasibility study, basic detailed engineering and procurement support.  The environmental impact assessment is also underway.</p>
          <p>In the case of Cuajone project, we have committed $31.6 million to purchase equipment.  We have signed the contract for feasibility study, the engineering and procurement process and the environmental impact assessment is also underway.</p>
          <p>We plan to invest approximately 1.2 billion in Los Chancas project, a copper-molybdenum property in the southern part of Peru.  This is in addition to the 2.1 billion previously announced for our Peruvian projects.  This project would increase our annual copper production by 18,000 tons by the year 2013.</p>
          <p>With respect to El Arco, our copper deposit located in Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, our feasibility study has been initiated and we expect to receive its results by the end of this year.  We are currently estimating an investment of 1.8 billion to produce approximately 190,000 metric tons of copper by the year.</p>
          <p>And the Angangueo project, a polymetallic deposit with precious metals in Mexican state of Michoacan is also progressing.  Our pre-feasibility study is in process to determine the optimal size of the underground mine and concentrated operations.</p>
          <p>And finally, in relation with payment of dividends, I would like to remind that it is the company's policy to review at each Board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend.  Accordingly, the company will evaluate the payment of our quarterly dividend at the Board meeting that's scheduled for July 31.</p>
          <p>At this point, we cannot provide guidance until the Board meeting happens.  Well, thank you very much for your attention and now we would like to open up the floor for questions.  Thank you for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Genaro, good morning, I have a couple of questions.  The first one is if you can give us some more clear view or perspective of what can we expect with the Cananea strike?  Is there a date that we should be looking for, is there a timeline, is there something that we can start thinking about a possible solution here?  And then second one if you kindly go over again, the cash cost without including by-products for copper for the second quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About Cananea it's &#x2013; I would say that it is very, very difficult to determine a date where we are going to find a resolution for this issue.  We have very good expectations and in terms that this problem can be resolved before the end of the year.  But it is very difficult to determine a date.  As I said what we are doing is to put all the efforts necessary with the government and with the union in order to try to -- well -- to define a solution and resume operations as soon as possible.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Victoria.  On the cash cost what was informed a few minutes ago was that before by-product cash cost for the company has been $1.85 for the second quarter.  That number compares with $1.32 during the second quarter of 2007, and with $1.51 for the first quarter of 2008.  I'd like to remind you and our audience that in the second quarter of 2007, we had a full capacity, the production of the Cananea mine and this is something that has certainly -- besides the cost inflation that has been discussed influence our cash cost for the second quarter of 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen, I have two questions.  First one will be &#x2013; just following up on the Cananea issue, I mean what are the alternatives that you could have to solve the issue, it has been a new path, that operation, it has become a political --</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering, what are the alternatives that you have to solve Cananea, if you could comment on those, beside the date, what are the alternatives -- I think that will be very important for the audience to see, what are the choices or the avenues that you may have to solve the situation, that will be my question number one?  And question number two is given all the cost ratios that the industry is stating, where would you put the top &#x2013; the highest cost <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of dollars per pound, I mean what would be the marginal cost as you see it?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Carlos.  Well, in terms of the alternatives of that we have in the Cananea strike, I will say that the company's idea and the basic alternative that the company is taking in consideration is to terminate all the workers, as we've made in the past with -- in front of these kind of issues, and we hire all the workers again with a newer labor agreement.  That would be a -- well the alternative that the company is looking for.  Now in relation with your second question, I will pass the question to Ra&#xFA;l.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, I think that fuel and power, but power specifically, it's the one the cost that is increasing at a very high rate in the last few months.  We are -- as you've seen in our press release, we are taking some actions in order to reduce power cost long-term.  We are also focusing on some other actions to reduce other cost and let me give you an example on that.</p>
          <p>In Peru, we have an internal production of scrap of about 10,000 tons per year, and we have made some arrangements with some of our grinding media suppliers to use that tonnage steel that comes from scrap from our own operations, due to replacement equipment or truck that are replaced. And that material is being basically sold back to us at a much lower cost as you may imagine.  These kind of ideas plus the fact of increasing the number of hours at our tires are lasting now, we almost doubled them from say two years ago, are the kind of actions that we're taking to contain or to control costs.  And, do you have some other concern that I like you to explain a little bit, please?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen.  We -- I just have two other questions.  The first one is regarding the strikes in Peru, we're hearing all the time on the headlines use of potential strikes in Peru, so if you could just tell us what is the situation there, and what are the risks of a significant strike in the country.  And also, continuing the issue of the cost, if you could give us a breakdown between energy, labor or few other spare parts or other materials in your cost.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Felipe.  I will pass this question to Mr. Gonzalez Rocha, who is going to give you some information about the Peruvian operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Felipe, this is Mr. Gonz&#xE1;lez Rocha.  About the possibility of a strike again, I will mention that we already sent a letter to the Minister of Labor in Peru mentioning that we already lost from November 2007 to July 5 of this year, 11,000 man days because the people of the Federation, National Federation of Mining in Peru, make this week or two weeks strike since November. And for that reason, in the last strike that they made, because national strike for mining, we started sending about 300 letters of investigation to that number of workers and at the end, we sent 17 termination letters, 10 for Cuajone and 7 for Ilo trying to stop these kind of illegal strikes or illegal paralyzation of work.  We are going to have a meeting with the Minister and the unions again, the 5th of August, trying to mention to them that we are not going to replace to put to work again any of the 17 that we already laid off.</p>
          <p>And of course it's going to be a difficult position and maybe they will try the unions to make a paralyzation again.  We think that the workers in both areas, Ilo and Cuajone and including Toquepala that they didn't paralyze the last time that the federation made the strike, a national strike.  Then we think that they are not going to support the unions, but let's wait until the meeting of the case and we don't think that we will have any problem like we didn't have in the past because of the lack of production, because we've had contractors and different workers that we have in our list during that time, plus the work of our supervisors, then you will see in all these 11,000 man days that we lose -- we don't lose any pound or any ton of production.  And we don't think that will be a problem at least in Peru because of this reason.</p>

The question has to do with your sulfuric acid, yeah, sulfuric acid prices in this market have gone up substantially and from what you indicated earlier on, you're long sulfuric acid, if I got that correctly, your requirements are met with about 20% of your production. When you speak about the type of contracts you have, are you long sulfuric acid both in Mexico and in Peru and I have a follow up to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Oscar.  Well, first of all, yes, we are long in sulfuric acid production in both in Peru and Mexico.  And as I mentioned, we have a long-term contract in where we have some fixed prices, but we have another production that is going to the market in the spot prices. You're right the prices of sulfuric acid have been increased substantially, now we are seeing prices around $400 a ton.  And in addition to that, all I can say about that, sulfuric acid as a by-product has become a very important income component in the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, could you just give us an indication at least of what is the nature of the long-term contract, like how much of your production is contracted long-term and we can figure out the spot market.  Then also I'll just finish up with a second question and pass it on.  You've talked about your cost and cost pressures you are seeing, which is fair enough on a per pound basis.  Can you comment on the cost per ton of all mines, because I got to believe that you are producing less copper, but if you get to hear what are you guys seeing on the per ton basis just to establish the cost inflation in the systems?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on a per ton basis Oscar we are not having such a high inflation cost as to one that you are seeing on a per pound basis, per ton of material move I mean rather than per pound of copper.  On per pound, what we are seeing is obviously higher, this is number two cost of the mines and obviously higher stainless steel or steel costs at all of our operations in your terms.  But we don't have the same kind of inflation that on a per pound basis because of the effects of the strike, one and second the fact that our operations are  producing on the first half of the year a little bit less than last year, the operations are not on strike obviously. On the acid &#x2013; sulfuric acid question --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the sulfuric acid question I will say that 70% is long-term contracts and 30% is going in the spot basis, but these long-term contracts are going to be expire soon.  And then, we will be in a position in order to -- well -- to go to -- to put this amount of -- or this tonnage of sulfuric acid contract with the new prices.  We think that the market is still -- is going to continue being short in the supply of sulfuric acid, and we are going to continue seeing a very high level of sulfuric acid prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, yeah sorry, and then just on the -- in terms of the dollar or cost per ton basis, so the increase that you're seeing is what 5%, 10%?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jorge Beristain actually with Deutsche Bank.  I understand that the dividend question was addressed earlier, but I was also wondering, if conceptually you could kind of talk about your dividend policy going forward in the face of larger growing CapEx, the fact that currently the Cananea mine is offline.  Would you be willing to increase Southern Copper's leverage in order to maintain dividend at the rate you've been posting for the last few quarters, or would you make adjustments in the dividend, that's my question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jorge.  Yeah, well, of course, as I mentioned the policy is going to be -- or the decision is going to be in the Board of Directors.  But we think that with cash generation that we continue having -- as a matter of fact at this point of time, we are ceded in around $1.4 billion of cash as of today. And our debt is around $1.3 billion total debt, then we're still having a negative debt or a positive balance between debt and cash.  And we think that for short-term capital investments, that can be financed with our own cash generations, and in the long-term, we have all the balance sheet in the company in order to go to the market, and drive some credit.  We don't think that the dividend policy would be affected, but again we cannot speculate in that matter, and we need to wait until the Board of Directors decide in that respect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but you feel comfortable given that the business has strong fundamentals that credit -- raising credit would not be an issue if you chose to increase leverage.</p>

          <p>Hi good afternoon.  My question is related to the Cananea strike and I was just wondering what measures are you taking to optimize smelting and refined gas?  Are you buying third-party concentrates and <mark type="inaudible" />?  Could you give us any color on that?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Rodolfo.  In order to maintain the Caridad smelting capacity and efficiency, we are buying some concentrates, basically we are bringing those concentrates from United States operations, and with that we are -- well trying to maintain as I said efficiency on the Caridad smelter that well -- that as you know is processing all the Caridad concentrates and all the Cananea concentrates when the regular operations are in place.</p>

          <p>I don't have the tonnage or the volume of concentrate that we have purchased, because as a matter we have been purchasing during this year and we have plans to get a little bit more for the second half.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon.  Let me -- I am trying to model this sulfuric acid, which is a very lucrative market, as you described yourself.  Now 70% long-term, 30% short-term, I guess the first question as you're going to keep that ratio after the year-end and typically -- correct me if I am wrong, that towards the new year, the contracts get renewed each year, typically there are three-year contracts, but every year the price is negotiated, so it's going to be 30:70 continuing, are you going to spot more?  And what's the long-term market now that you envisage you'll be able to get for this very lucrative market.  And, I have a question later on the copper price.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well for sulfuric acid, I will say that what we are going to try to do is to enjoy the cooling copper prices, and we are trying to jump from long-term to a spot market.  And as I mentioned, our view is that the copper price -- that the sulfuric acid price is going to continue being in high levels and that is the rationale of our -- and that would be the rationale of our decision.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the long-term market or the contract market now is what -- about $50, $60 I assume, as you are getting it now from the previous contract.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The long-term market next year, I've seen numbers in almost like 100 to $120, is that what you were talking about in terms of guidance here, because that's a very different number, it's a very good number for you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Wow, that's great.  So, can you make the assumption then to model for us to understand that next year's entire volume will be 70% in this contract market and 30% to spot market with the new prices?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I don't think so.  As I mentioned that relation is going to change as a result of the current situation in the sulfuric acid price.  I don't have an accurate idea how would be the percentages, but I'm convinced that that is going to change for next year.</p>

          <p>Okay, all right.  The other question I have, thank you.  The other question I have is that obviously with the capital expenditure program that you have and it's a struggle that  every company goes through in -- as analysts will go through as well, trying to use a leading copper price for us to figure out the reserves, their economics and everything else.  Now the <mark type="inaudible" />  as I understand, we appreciate that.  For this 2.1 billion and going forward, what adjustments you make into the price assumptions as you go on?  And I guess some other companies, the feedback I'd like to see what your assumptions are?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you may understand, we don't disclose our long-term view on copper prices with that detail.  For our reserves, we have been using $1.20 for computing our reserve base with that.  This company has the highest reserve base of the industry that is traded publicly.  So, I am sorry, but in this case you have to use your own judgment to see on a long-term copper price.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks again for taking the call -- the question sorry.  And this is just a follow-up on my prior question.  The first one is, Genaro, if the current plan of offering early retirement packages to the workers of Cananea don't seem to work, what other alternatives do you have or if there is none?  And then on the cost front, there is a question also that I had was, what do you see the marginal cost of production <mark type="inaudible" /> the petrol and diesel prices are affecting the operating mines tremendously, but then the acid -- sulfuric acid and power costs are affecting the SX/EW production worldwide.  So, where do you see, if you have that number, marginal cost of production develop?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos, let me -- this is Ra&#xFA;l Jacob.  I'm going to answer the second question, because it was the question that we couldn't answer before.  Obviously fuel prices are hitting significantly mining operations.  We don't know yet about the total effect on the marginal cost for the industry, but if you take our case, where we operate in a country where we have some kind of subsidies to oil and our cash cost has gone almost $0.30 from one quarter to the second -- from the first quarter to second one.</p>
          <p>So, if that's what happens when you have certain control on fuel prices, you may imagine what is happening in some other operations as well. On the sulfuric acid, that basically affects the most SX/EW production, because that's the one that is intensive of sulfuric acid.  While we're talking about the material that used to be paid at about 50 or less than that dollars per ton a year or so ago, and now on the spot it's at about $400 per ton. So, the effect of that on marginal cost has actually doubled the operations, it's going to be very important if you are not long in sulfuric acid as Southern is.  Obviously this will also affect -- the sulfuric acid price will also affect all the projects that are being developed or think about developing that has significant consumption of sulfuric acid as an input for copper production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Carlos in respect of the Cananea model, well I would say that we have some legal alternatives.  But those legal alternatives are not in our hands to -- in order to be or in order to use them to find a resolution of the problem.  And we cannot speculate that one of these alternatives or legal alternatives is going to work.</p>
          <p>Then I would insist that the company &#x2013; the alternative that the company is taking as you know is first of all offering to the workers the severance package, and we have a very good expectation in terms that this package is going to be taken by them.  And then I would return to my first comment about that, that would be the solution that the company expects to have is to work, and to find a positive and better labor agreement in which the company can work with a benefit for all the parties, the company and the workers.</p>

Well, it's clearly that the power, we have been facing huge increases in energy cost.  In some cases or in the case of Peru, we are facing increases of more than 50% in a per kilowatt hour as well as fuel, and the cost of the steel.

          <p>I'll make it quick, thank you very much for taking all this time for answering questions.  You mentioned you bought about 100,000 tons of concentrated to fit into the Caridad smelter.  Was that over the first half, and are you expecting to have something similar, is that included in the outlook for the second half?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is for the whole year, Oscar, that's our estimation.  I don't have exactly the number that we are planning to buy in concentrate for this year, that is a roughly number, but that is for the whole year as I said.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer on this Oscar, it's also conditioned to the commercial terms that we get on the concentrate that we want to buy and as you know concentrate market is very strong right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now that's fair enough Ra&#xFA;l and Genaro.  Thank you very much.  And just of the outlook that you provided for the second half, does that include concentrate bought from third parties?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.  Earlier in the conference you talked about the restocking of China and you said something like you are expecting this for 2009.  Can you give us more color on that of if you see the possibility that this happened in this year or maybe in which quarter of the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what is clear is that Chinese copper consuming industries are still growing at a very strong pace.  And they are not demanding the copper that they should.  That's why we drive as a copper producer that there is a de-stocking of copper inventories in China.  When will they come back to the market is something that we don't know at this point.  But as long as they are growing at 10% on GDP and that transforms in a higher demand for copper than 10% coming from China.  We understand that they are coming back to the market at certain point in time, which we don't know.  We, I like to mention that we don't have direct sales to China.  So in this case we can't put more color on that.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Anthony Young, Dahlman Rose. Your line is now open.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys thanks for taking the question.  Just real quick on the guidance that you guys have provided, that is 245,000 tons.  Is there any contribution from Cananea associated with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no we are not including Cananea in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just on your capital cost, the 2.1 billion, I realized that you guys have locked in part of that, you talked about locking in some of the equipment you've purchased for one of the projects, about 498 million I believe.  How often you guys review like the capital costs -- I mean as far as like the rest that you guys are going to have to spend -- I mean given all the cost pressures in the industry.  I mean is there a chance about 2.1 billion hedged higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it depends on the maturity on the projects.  In the case of Tia Maria, which has a budget of $934 million, we already committed over $500 million in purchase orders, that fixed about $300 million of the total budget.  And then we have some contracts that may be affected by cost increases.  At the same time, you have to keep in mind that these kinds of projects always consider a contingency effect that &#x2013; another thing -- among other things want to accommodate for some cost inflation in capital goods. On the other projects, the Toquepala and Cuajone expansion, and the metallurgical facilities in Peru expansions, we currently developed a feasibility study, and at the end of this feasibility study, we will know with more &#x2013; clearly the kind of capital costs that these expansions will have.  Our numbers for those expansions are as of 2007, and as you have seen, we're taking a defensive action to buy in advance equipment so that the lowest to fix the cost of major capital equipment required for these projects.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the 2.1 billion does include the contingency then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does, it does include contingency.</p>
