        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  My name is Ben Spencer, Director of Investor Relations. On behalf of Telstra, I'd like to welcome you to this first half results for fiscal 2008. In a moment, I will pass over to Sol Trujillo and John Stanhope to run you through the results.</p>
          <p>After that, we will have time to take some Q&amp;A, <mark type="inaudible" /> here in Sydney and another one at the parallel briefing that we have in Melbourne, and we'll be taking questions in turn there.  Again, a rather forlorn request but please I ask you to restrict yourself to just one question at a time so that we have the opportunity to get through questions from as many people as possible.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, I'll hand over to our Chief Executive, Mr. Sol Trujillo. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Ben, and I'd like to welcome everybody here to our first results briefing in our new Telstra Experience Center. The Center is helping our business and enterprise customers realize their potential. We have customers coming in here literally every day, every week. This is a chance for us to collaborate and I think you're getting a chance now to see, through our results, what some of the impacts are.</p>
          <p>Now this is the third half-year that we are essentially announcing our results and basically it's the third half-year that we're delivering on our promises that we made back in November of 2005. The punch line is that we remain on or ahead of plan across the business and I always have to include the fact that we have achieved all of this without compromising on the core strategy, the core principles, the core beliefs that we've had and that we've articulated consistently since we announced our strategy.</p>
          <p>Our customers and our shareholders are the ones that we're centered on in terms of how we think about running this business. Our approach does not change and we will continue to drive our business with all of that in mind, whether it be our customers, our suppliers, public policy, conversations, et cetera, et cetera, it won't change.  You can see the impacts of what we're doing.</p>
          <p>So today it basically is a continuation of that story and today I have the pleasure of beginning to talk to you about some more of what's been happening with our transformation. So in terms of the punch line in our business, we are reporting today 6.2% EBIT growth. We have comfortably exceeded what we have seen as the consensus view in the market. And given the momentum and strength across the business, despite the turbulent economic conditions, we're now raising our reported FY '08 guidance. We now expect to achieve 3 to 4% revenue growth this year, EBITDA growth of 4 to 5 and EBIT growth of 6 to 8%. We have reported a strong set of financial results.  Domestic revenues are up 5.9% in the half, versus 5% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Again, as we focus on delivering results in all of our Australian core businesses, we're now starting to drive acceleration on the bottom line as the benefits of transformation start taking hold. For the half, we've achieved reported EBIT growth of 6.2%. This includes the $100 million FOXTEL distribution. Underlying EBIT, which John will discuss in more detail, is even stronger, with growth of around 8.5%.</p>
          <p>These results are all the more impressive when compared against, not just our domestic competitors, and I think you've seen all of them report and clearly we have outperformed anybody domestically, but the question is, "So how does our performance rank against the rest of our peers around the world?"</p>
          <p>And, again, I think you've seen now that we have world-leading results. It's a continuation of the strong trends that we've been building across our entire product set that have emerged over the last 12, 18 months. And, you know, I have to candidly say, which many in this room believe were not achievable way back when, and are now being up in terms of we're taking the game up another notch in the market place, in spite of what I would call tough price competition. Well, in that environment we've not only held our own but we've been able to accelerate growth by executing on our integrated value-based strategy. I'll say that again, by executing on our integrated value-based strategy. And again, contrary to many of the predictions of analyst pundits, other observers, the good news is our customers are actually voting with their wallets. And they're choosing the best value in the market.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to touch also on one other item that we have not talked a lot about but is also important to highlight, and David Thodey and Deena Shiff would be able to talk about this in a lot of detail, but the point is is that we have another interesting phenomenon that's breaking the trends around the world and that is relative to our IP and data services, our access results. They are up 8.3% and this has been achieved again during a migration phase to IP and we have changed the paradigm by adding value and driving incremental revenues through this migration, compared to the global model that you see around the world, which is just reflecting a reduction in revenues.</p>
          <p>The strength across the business is perhaps best captured where we compare each of the retail units' growth. And one of the things that I committed back about six months ago when we announced our full-year results for last fiscal year, I said we were going to provide even more disclosures in terms of how our business is running so that everybody could see, not only by product, but really how we run the business organized around customers. So we're going to provide today and we have provided additional detail around the retail units' growth.</p>
          <p>And what you can see from the data is that the units are now growing at rates that many in the industry again did not imagine we could achieve just 24 months ago. Differentiation has been the key to adding value; we have more coverage, we have faster speeds, we have one quick usability, we have more content, more services and a superior infrastructure. The networks, the integration of the networks, the systems, et cetera, it's part of that. So this has enabled us to drive new wave revenue to cover over 20% of our total revenue and help us deliver our key strategic imperatives. Market-based management and value-based pricing has been a central part of our transformation strategy since I arrived and underpins our engagement with our customers.</p>
          <p>Growth in multi-product holdings delivers dual benefits of higher ARPU and lower churn. And consumer multi-product customers have a higher per product spend and we see churn halve as customer moves from one- to two-product bundles and as we continue to evolve that relationship.</p>
          <p>We're also reinvigorating the channels with the launch of the Experience Center that you have seen here, our T[life], for our business, enterprise, and all customers that may happen to walk into, for example, the first T[life] store that we launched here in Sydney. Our customer conversion rates of those customers who actually go into the store and interact are three times those of our standard store. Again we're changing the game, not only in terms of networks and systems and products, but actually how we go to retail, how we go in front of the customer in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Integration of our products is also delivering differentiation our competitors simply cannot match.  One great example is our recent launch of the 3 Tab Portal. With the combination of free and non-free content, it demonstrates how we can leverage an advertising-driven model between our Mobile, BigPond, and Sensis businesses, and is already resulting in a significant increase in usage over the first 30 days since its launch. Mobile content daily page impressions have increased by more than 60%. Value, value, value.</p>
          <p>So what is the conclusion here? Given where regulated prices have moved to, it has been important to shore up that whole retail business. I've explained some of the things that we're doing to achieve this and this chart shows just how successful we have been. With the growth in our retail performance far outstripping the decline in wholesale, these trends will be the envy of all PTTs the world over.</p>
          <p>As you have seen, retail growth is now outstripping wholesale growth but with one of the lowest ULL and LSS price combinations in the world, our results are clearly showing an increased take-up of these wholesale products in preference to our wholesale DSL services. But I don't want you to be misled by this shift from wholesale DSL to ULL and LSS. The real story here again is the retail one.  We have wholesale prices below cost, some of the lowest retail prices in the world in market from our competitors but at the end of the day it's the customers who determine who they want to do business with and as you see we are taking and winning broadband market share. So again some people are confused because they only think the price is the only variable in the market.</p>
          <p>Well, you have to ask the question, so how are we doing this? Customers in Australia are more discerning than some competitors would have you believe and price isn't the only variable. We are able to offer the highest speeds, the best services, the best content and with our Next G wireless broadband, unmatched depth, breath, speed and capacity. On top of the broadband story we are also seeing continued customer growth in the retail PSTN business and we actually achieved positive retail PSTN revenue growth in the half, again something that none of our peers have achieved. Retail broadband has continued its outstanding performance and is driving success elsewhere in the business.</p>
          <p>We believe we now have 48% share of the market and just short of 2.6 million broadband customers. Again the strength of our integrated value-based approach is evident. Australia has some of the world's cheapest broadband offers fuelled by below cost ULL and LSS prices but we continue to take market share while having the highest ARPUs in the market of all the major players. If you benchmark this against our global peers, it is clear to see we are leading the world in this space. Market share gains and ARPU growth is a rare double for incumbents, many of which are facing declines in one or both of these measures.</p>
          <p>Again how are we doing this?  We've been very focused on achieving this strong broadband result because it is one of the cornerstones of our transformation to a MediaComs business. All of you heard me say it two years ago, this would be central to much of what we do. So two years ago our PSTN revenue decline was substantially greater than the revenue increase from fixed retail broadband.</p>
          <p>However, the additional revenue from fixed broadband now dwarfs the revenue loss from the PSTN decline. This is an inflection point that many incumbents around the world are yet to reach. I say that broadband is a cornerstone because it's a contribution to the Telstra strategy on virtually all fronts. BigPond customers continue to migrate to higher value liberty plans. Churn is much lower for a bundled customer with broadband leading many of our bundled broadband offers. More than 90% of BigPond customers have Telstra PSTN service. BigPond is at the forefront of innovation and content strategy. We continue to develop and leverage our content assets, including BigPond games, office, movies, music and exclusive sport, such as NRL, AFL, VA, etc.</p>
          <p>Today I'm pleased to announce that commencing Saturday, the 23rd of February, BigPond Sports Weekend will redefine the way Australians watch their favorite sports, exclusive to Telstra Next G mobiles and online at BigPond TV. BigPond Sports Weekend is a fast-paced continuous nine-hour sports news and information show from 9 am, every Saturday and Sunday, delivering up-to-the-minute results, statistics and highlights. BigPond Sports Weekend leverages BigPond Sports full suite of exclusive and non-exclusive sports rights for the Internet and mobile phones and then combines them with some sophisticated technology to deliver the best mobile and online sports coverage in the world.</p>
          <p>The BigPond home networking gateway is enjoying also some great success with 20% take-up since launch by new customers. Today, more than 3.5 million 3G customers have access to the BigPond portal on their mobile again, all part of our MediaComs strategy. We've had another great performance in mobiles with mobile services revenue growth of 12.5% in the half. Mobile services revenue growth for post-paid was even stronger at 16.7% while pre-paid grew at 3.8%. These results show that we further gained revenue market share, which we believe is the most important metric for this category. Again, when benchmarked versus our global peers, this performance is world class. But just don't take my word for it, have a look on the screen at what one of our most bearish brokers said recently about the Next G network success.</p>
          <p>We continue to push the barriers of mobile technology. Last week in Barcelona, I announced an intention to be the first operator in the world to upgrade to 21 megabits per second later this year and to 42 megabits per second in 2009, which we have been saying for a period of time now.  We have Ericsson lined up; we have Qualcomm lined up; we have all the players lined up to enable our ability to take the game to the next level and remember that. It's always about adding value as we think about growing our business. Next G's competitive advantage is helping us win the Next G value game.</p>
          <p>Here are the facts that demonstrate how successful we've been in 3G and why we are the envy of the telco world in the 3G space. At the end of January, we had more than 3.5 million 3G SIOs, up from just 1 million at the start of 2007. More than 38% of our subscriber base now, 40% of 3G connections, are new Telstra customers. In the second quarter of '08, our 3G revenues exceeded our 2G revenues and in the consumer space now, we have about 60% of our base on 3G. Our 3G   post-paid ARPU increased by 4.3% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>When we reported such a high 3G ARPU 12 months ago, there was a common view this was driven by early adopters and wouldn't be sustainable and many people pointed to Japan with what NTT DoCoMo did. Well, we are breaking all trends and all patterns that people have seen around the world. We are well beyond the early adopters' stage. Next G is really delivering a sustainable ARPU increase. There's now only a small amount of revenue being generated on a CDMA network, now well less than 3% of our revenues for mobiles. In the month of December, this had just fallen even further and each month we take it down to where now it's getting to be almost minuscule. While mobile data continues to be the major growth driver, we are very pleased with the growth in voice revenues. Total voice, which is inclusive of message bank and roaming, it grew at 5%.</p>
          <p>So in particular I'm pleased that, in addition to spending more on data, a customer that is migrating from 2G to Next G, makes significantly more calls and sends more texts. Our cohort analysis indicates that a year after migrating, customers make 9% more calls and send 11% more texts.  There is value in H 50 where you can complete more calls, there is more value in bigger footprints where you have greater reach. There is value in the quality of the networks where your bandwidth, your backhaul, everything is part of the story, it does translate into growth.</p>
          <p>Now, it is true that over the last 18 months we have seen a steady decline in mobile voice yield, as every operator has, but what is important is that we've controlled this yield decline, avoided entering price wars and seen a commensurate increase in usage. This positive elasticity of around 0.8 in post-paid voice, both matches the current trends in Europe and is a prime reason why we've been able to grow mobile voice revenues. Data constituted 29.7% of our mobile service revenues in the first half and SMS revenues grew at 21%. Telstra is one of the first companies in the world where non-SMS data revenue is greater than SMS data revenue and it is a growing category.  Non-SMS data revenue growth of 83% is driven by our expanding suite of 3G content and services plus wireless broadband.</p>
          <p>Despite some reports in the media about a slowdown, we have maintained our momentum in wireless broadband. We continue to add new SIOs at the rate of over 20,000 a month. At the end of first-half '08, we had 464,000 wireless broadband SIOs. We're still outselling our competitors when you combine them all.  And the good news is that 99% of Australians have access to wireless broadband via the Next G network. And despite concerns around customers' price consciousness, we are pleased to report wireless broadband revenue grew by more than 200% to $230 million and we have maintained a high ARPU of around $100. So far our only global benchmark to compare it to is Teletu in Sweden reporting wireless broadband ARPU of less than $30. Of course, we can't compare these numbers to some competitors; we continue to report results, not rhetoric.</p>
          <p>We have continued to slow the PSTN revenue decline and it is now down to just -2.1%. Basic access ARPU was up 2.1% due to increased penetration of higher-value HomeLine plans.  Our strategy to slow the decline in PSTN revenues is centered on our market-based management driven processes in our channels and in our business and, as we talked more than a year ago, associated with our subscription-based pricing. Our PSTN retail performance stands out when compared again with our global peers. Retail lines continue to grow. We added over 46,000 this half after the 38,000 we added in the second half of '07.</p>
          <p>Two years ago, our retail SIOs were declining by around 4% per year. Telstra's growth of retail lines and a 3% decline in total lines is a continuation of the outstanding performance versus our U.S. and European peers, which have suffered total PSTN line declines of somewhere between 5 and 8% over recent years. Our revenue trends are also well ahead of our European and U.S. peer group.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Sensis, Sensis has enjoyed a strong first half top-line result as well. And investor Dave Bruce said that we're going to turn around the Yellow Print results this year. And we have delivered on this in the first half with positive Yellow Print growth. We have achieved this with Sensis' largest-ever sales force training program, new circulation initiatives, and by selling and demonstrating the value of Yellow to our customers. Be in no doubt that Sensis' growth is world-class, our 2.5% total print growth in H1 compares to Yell who operates in the UK, and U.S. and South America at -4.9%.  But specifically that 4.9% relates to the UK. And IDR took -3.2%, and there are other companies that have recently reported and they are all reporting in the negative zone.</p>
          <p>While Yellow and White Print achieved growth, the emerging businesses in Sensis are also delivering strong results. These diversified businesses which include Whereis and MediaSmart are providing new streams of revenue opportunities and continue to constitute a larger proportion of Sensis' revenue growth.</p>
          <p>While revenue growth was strong, the slowing earnings profile was driven by the Sensis transformation. While directory margins are still at world-class levels, Sensis has been making investments in updating its systems and its processes. We can see that the investments are already beginning to pay dividends by the performance of our Yellow business.</p>
          <p>Moving to China, SouFun. SouFun posted unaudited revenue growth of 68% and EBITDA growth of 97% based on its performance in U.S. dollars and on a pro forma basis in H1. Beyond that I can't comment, so I won't say anything more about SouFun.</p>
          <p>As reported yesterday, FOXTEL delivered another very strong financial performance in the half.  While revenues were up 17%, strong operating leverages kicked in to deliver 62% EBITDA growth to 165.5 million. FOXTEL continues to produce impressive KPIs across the board with now more than 1.5 million total subscribers and same story as all of Telstra, increasing ARPU.</p>
          <p>As we announced at our Investor Day, FOXTEL will begin high-definition broadcasting by the middle of the year.  FOXTEL will also offer on-demand high-def movies on a pay-per-view basis.  And Telstra's sat mobile FOXTEL continues to be an attractive proposition for our Next G users with subscribers generating on average around $11 of ARPU.</p>
          <p>In terms of the transformation program, we've talked about it a lot, obviously on November 1. That was the highlight, that was <mark type="inaudible" /> kind of the centerpiece of our conversation then, so I'm going to be brief today; suffice it to say that it remains on track. TR1, we went into production in October and we started the migration of customer data records to the new customer care CRM billing platform. We remain on target to complete customer migration in the timeframes that we discussed.</p>
          <p>TR2, the second release of the IT transformation, remains on track to go into production before the end of calendar '08. In case of Next G, our Next G build-out continues. The Next G network now covers 99% of our Australian population, and we have a plan for HSPA+ upgrades to 21 megabits per second this year and 42 megabits per second in '09.</p>
          <p>As you've heard me say before, we work for our shareholders, we work for our customers, and that is our end focus. The transformation of our networks, the channels, the culture in our company is changing Telstra into a world-class company. And again, it's not my opinion; it's measured by the results on a comparative basis.</p>
          <p>Outstanding revenue growth, in spite of headwinds in all products and segments, operating leverage, driving improved bottom-line performance; we continue to exceed expectations and have today again been able to raise our guidance. As we move towards our long-term objectives, we are confident that our operational execution will result in superior earning to growth profile in our global peer group.</p>
          <p>As I said at the start, the company's beginning to fire on all cylinders. We will also provide you with another layer of insights today that John will take you through, with more detail of the performance of the individual business units. So with that, I'm going to stop and turn it over to John to take you through some of that detail. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sol, and good morning to everybody here in Sydney, and good morning to our people in Auckland on the hook-up. I assume you're fully aware of the normal disclaimer that take these sort of events.</p>
          <p>Once again, we've reported results ahead of the market consensus. Sales revenue was up 5.3%, highlighting strong growth across the entire business, both in products and in our segments.  We not only grew our top line, but continued to grow our earnings with EBIT up 6.2%.  And this does include the $100 million FOXTEL distribution and $37 million gain from the sale of our e-business Excluding FOXTEL and the sale of a business, we grew by 1.5% and you might recall our guidance was that it would be a slight decline so we've exceeded that guidance. You would have seen yesterday FOXTEL confirmed that they will make a further distribution to partners this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Our share of that distribution in March will be $30 million. I would like you to note that we are now planning to receive ongoing distributions from FOXTEL in accordance with their earning policy of three times EBITDA, however the level of those distributions will be a matter for the FOXTEL board.</p>
          <p>Profit after tax was up 13%. But you need to understand this was assisted by a number of one-off benefits at the tax line. Our accrued CapEx was $2.3 billion for the half and we remain confident of hitting our full-year guidance of 4.6 billion to 4.9 billion, and our interim dividend remains at $0.14 per share, fully franked.</p>
          <p>After a strong first half, and it's part of the prevailing economic conditions, our momentum has continued in the second half and we are therefore increasing our guidance. The impact is up on the screen here, total revenue growth was 2.3% and guidance now at 3 to 4%. EBITDA growth was 3 to 4% and now 4% to 5%, and EBIT growth was 5 to 7% and is now 6 to 8%. So essentially we have lifted the range on all of these P&amp;L measures by 1%, and our accrued CapEx guidance remains the same.</p>
          <p>What I've tried to do here is to make some adjustments to take a bit of the volatility out of various things that occur when you're doing transformations. Given the one-off adjustments and provisions we've taken over the last few years, this is sort of better representative of the true underlying trends in our business. Our underlying EBIT grew 8.5%. This is calculated, and I want to be clear to make sure you don't think we are playing around with numbers here, it is calculated by backing out all of the pure one-off transactions such as the profit on sale of assets, you will recall the Trading Post</p>
          <p>writedown last year and, while we're expecting future distributions from FOXTEL, we've taken the conservative approach here and we've excluded the first $100 million distribution in this analysis.</p>
          <p>And we've reprofiled the Yellow Book, you'll recall going back a little while we had a Melbourne Yellow Book in a different half then we've had before.  And we smoothed out the transformation costs leaving the provisions we've made for it and the accelerated depreciation and amortization that's happened.  And so over the course, of course, of the transformation period, the cumulative effect of this will be obviously the numbers or the reported numbers. It's a zero sum gain but I thought it was worth showing to avoid the wild movements that destroyed our underlying performance so you can see good steady rise there in our earnings when you do that smoothing.  Of course we are obliged to report our reported numbers and that's why you see those on the slide as well.  So hopefully that gives you a better picture on the underlying business performance.</p>
          <p>I want to briefly look at where the strong top-line growth is coming from. As you can see from this slide it is coming from growth right across the board. Total mobile revenue grew 14.5% and as Sol said earlier this is world-class. Retail broadband growth was strong at 65%, driven by the continuing wireless broadband growth at more than 200% or $154 million. However, growth on the fixed side was still impressive, 37%, by the growth in broadband if you take out wireless. Sensis also diluted strong growth at 7.8% and we have further slowed PSTN decline to 2.1% and that also as Sol said is really world-class. Finally, IP access revenue growth now exceeds the decline in Specialized data.  That's also a very important pivot point and it's a very important change in our revenue mix.</p>
          <p>While the growth across our products is impressive as you know we run our business on a segmented basis and therefore, to give the market a better understanding of how we look at our performance or the performance of our business, we believe it's appropriate to increase the level of reporting and we did say we would do that last time we met. So let me begin. Before I get into the real details, I just want to highlight this because this is an outstanding overall retail result. Retail sales revenue growth was 7.6%, so that's out of our three retail businesses, Enterprise and Government, Business, and Consumer. And the operating contribution from those three units grew 8.5%.</p>
          <p>Now I'll go into a little more detail. These strong performances come across all three of our retail businesses.  Remember, this is the half that some doomsayers said that our retail performance would be destroyed by a range of competitive products, such as Fusion, and bargain-priced wireless broadband. The reality, you can see, is very different. We've grown market share in our major units.</p>
          <p>Now I want you to understand this slide. The operating contribution shown in the title is effectively a gross contribution. That's how we run the business internally every day, that is, it's revenue, less the business unit's directly incurred costs.  And that definition, year-on-year, obviously is consistent, so that the change is put up on a like-to-like basis.</p>
          <p>The operating contribution margin reduction in Telstra business is a result of higher expenses across the board there, in particular, in labor. As the Telstra Business unit continues to establish itself as a more fully formed operational unit. Remember, it's not a very old unit in our mix and it's been establishing itself as you will see a fantastic performance from that unit on the top line.</p>
          <p>I'll just have a brief look at each unit individually. So let's start with Consumer; in terms of the Consumer business unit, sales revenue grew 8.5% for the half. Our momentum continues to be driven by market-based management, the enhancement of our sales channels, and the breadth and range of our service offerings. Mobiles grew over 11% in this segment, and the proportion of post-paid customers on 3G is already 60% in the Consumer segment.</p>
          <p>Consumer now has over 2 million 3G customers, almost triple the amount at this time last year.  Importantly though, 3G post-paid ARPU has been maintained at over $70 in this segment, resulting in blended ARPU growth of 6.2%, so it pays to prepay. Internet growth of 45.6% in this segment has been driven by strong performance in ADSL and wireless broadband. With regards to PSTN revenue growth, it was 1.2% in the Consumer segment and this is the eighth consecutive or has been eight consecutive months of positive PSTN revenue growth in the Consumer segment.</p>
          <p>In Half 1 our subscriber acquisition recontracting costs have fallen by 20%. This is despite growing ARPU, market share and outperforming our competitors in revenue growth. The range of handsets has also grown, all major brands are now in the range and still the subscriber acquisition and recontracting costs are coming down. This is truly a great result in the Consumer segment.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Business, Telstra Business as we call it, revenue grew 9.3% driven by growth in fixed, mobile, and broadband. This is a major turnaround since Telstra Business' inception in the second half of '06. As I said our business unit <mark type="inaudible" /> and revenues back then were declining by 1.5%, so growth of 9.3 versus not long ago a decline of 1.5. Mobile SIOs were up 15.9% with over half of Telstra Business' mobile customers on 3G. This has really driven the dramatic growth in mobile revenue. Mobile daily revenue in this segment is up 73%, now representing 23% of total mobile services revenue. Telstra Business is gaining market share while managing the variable cost price.</p>
          <p>Mobile subscriber and acquisition recontracting costs are actually coming down in this segment as well.  Average post-paid SARCs as we call them have fallen by 5% from $238 in Half 2 '07 to $226 in the half just gone, current half. Broadband revenue growth was also strong.  We estimate that Telstra Business' broadband market share is in the low 30s, but importantly it is growing. Telstra Business has fought a tough battle to get the market share gains in a highly freight mannered market. And given we have recently expanded the ADSL 2 plus footprint there is a real opportunity here for that market share to continue to grow.</p>
          <p>So moving on to the last of our retail segments, the Enterprise and Government segment. Through a lot of hard work and focus on the introduction of Next G and Next IP, Enterprise and Government has seen revenue growth of 4.5%. This is a great result following a number of periods of very low growth. The result has been driven by an exceptionally strong performance in Enterprise and Government's core carriage business so Voice, Mobile, and Fixed.  And this is the first time since competition began in Australia where core carriage in this segment has grown and it is one of the clearest proofs that the transformation really is improving business performance, not only our business performance but the performance of these Enterprise and Government customers.</p>
          <p>Mobile's growth was strong in the half with mobile customers up 20% and service revenues up 19% in this segment. Furthermore, non-SMS data, mobile data revenues grew 74% and now represents almost 30% of mobile services revenues in this segment.  Next IP is also driving customer take-up of data services. IP and data grew by over 6% driven by strong demand for access services, which grew by over 28% against the prior corresponding period and more than compensated for the revenue reduction in traditional data and again Sol mentioned that and that is a very important inflection point. Importantly, Enterprise and Government has delivered outstanding customer satisfaction as demonstrated in survey results which are at an all-time high, and higher than our nearest competitor.</p>
          <p>Let me talk a little bit about Sensis. Sol touched on it, a little more detail I'll give here. So I've talked about the three retail units, which doesn't include Sensis in that 7.6% growth but Sensis has had a very strong six months. Overall, Yellow grew 3.2% or $70 million and as Bruce predicted it at Investor Day, Yellow Print returned to positive growth in the half.  Revenues were up 0.2% for Yellow Print, and you saw overall White and Yellow Print up much higher than that. It was driven by &#x2013; the Yellow Print was driven by strong canvasses or sales and higher yields while our Yellow Online delivered another strong half growing by 21.5%.  White also continued to deliver strong results with revenue growth of 10.3%. That's both print and online.</p>
          <p>The business is strengthened through diversification in the other revenue category, what we call emerging business growth was strong at 27%. Those businesses are now delivering more than 45% of the total revenue growth in Sensis. <mark type="inaudible" /> one, two, three, four.  Services, for example, was up 18% with call volumes to one, two, three, four almost doubling in the half. In addition, SouFun, their unaudited revenue also grew at 68% in euro dollars terms in the six months on a like-for-like basis. Again, as Bruce indicated, at the Investor Day, Sensis is going through its own transformation and this has resulted in a minor decline in the EBIT and we said that would occur in the first half of this year as this transformation takes place. We're really confirmed today the guidance for Sensis to achieve a middle single digit organic growth in this full financial year.</p>
          <p>Now I'll talk about expenses because we haven't touched too much on expenses yet. In terms of operating expenses, those grew by 6.2% for the half and total expenses, which includes G&amp;A, appreciation, amortization, were up 5.6%. This shouldn't surprise anyone because as I said on Investor Day, our operating expenses are still expected to increase in this fiscal year as we continue our transformation and especially the IT component of that transformation.</p>
          <p>I also said on Investor Day expenses will start to fall from fiscal 2009 and reduce further in fiscal 2010 as we do complete the custom migrations and start to turn off the legacy IT systems and network platforms. We are continuing to reduce the redundancy and restructuring provision raised back in 2006 and the balance of that provision, in December 31, is $131 million. Of the remaining restructuring provision around 50 million of that 171 is available for CDMA customer migration until the revised plan closure date of the 28th of April.</p>
          <p>Let me have a look at some of these expense categories in some more details, starting with labor.  In the first half, labor costs were up 4.8%. Redundancy was up in the half because many of the redundancies that we planned across the year we've taken in the first half. Excluding those redundancy costs, the labor costs were down 1% and you need to remember, and I say this every time, we also in that number have absorbed a range wise of some near 3.5%. We are tracking at the upper end of a 6,000 to 8,000 head count reduction target. Remember after three years in our strategy, with a total head count reduction since the first of July 2005, now at 7,875. That's a 1,768 decrease in the half. As you can see, the high redundancy cost associated with some of that reduction.  It is important to remember this head count reduction number does exclude the impacts of the acquisition of SouFun and any divestments that we've had. So we keep a like-for-like comparison from our statements back in November '05. So what does this mean for head count targets?  It means no change.</p>
          <p>We are still confident of course with our 6 to 8,000 target this fiscal and our longer-term 2010 target of 12,000 reduction. As we continue the transformation, the old systems in process of being replaced with the latest technology which will require and does require now quite different skills. So we will need to employ some people with those skills in the coming years to meet the demands and the needs of our customers. There is a skills refresh taking place as the business transforms.</p>
          <p>Let me just look at the directly variable costs here, on goods and services purchased on I guess we call it The growth here is 4.3%. Over the last few years, directly variable costs have grown at more than two times sales revenue growth. Through managing directly variable costs predominately through better management of subscriber acquisition recontracting costs, the DVC's growth in the first half was just 0.8 times that of sales revenue. That ratio will fluctuate a little bit in the short term but we are confident of meeting our DVC to sales ratio objective of no more than sales one times growth. In terms of the trend in subscriber acquisition recontracting costs <mark type="inaudible" /> customs are growing and our blended SARCs are coming down.  The average blended SARC of $150 has decreased significantly down from $175 in the first half of '07 fiscal and $193 in the second half of the '07 fiscal. It's been driven by a lot of subsidies, but in terms of volume of subsidies and also the rate of subsidies.</p>
          <p>The volume average cost for a Next G handset has also fallen by 70% over the past 18 months.  And this has been driven off the back of increased volumes. You all might recall that I said, you know, handset costs will come down as we get higher volumes, this is occurring.  And, the Next G license the volumes are going up 77% year-on-year, and we've got improved vendor support now of the 850 devices. And I told you the number keeps growing in term of the major brands.</p>
          <p>Have a look at the other expense category, there's quite a number of items in this category. You can see there promotion and advertising, something that we call impairment or we have to call impairment, general admin and so on. Those expenses grew to 9.5% in the half but I want to concentrate on some of the larger areas. The biggest component in this category in absolute terms is Service Contracts and Other Agreements. It has grown 4.6% in the half to $1.1 billion. But consistent with what I told you on Investor Day, the key driver of the service contracts growth relates to IT costs linked to the IT transformation, as the activity increases to migrate Consumer customers across to the new CRM billing system. Importantly, if the IT transformation-related costs were excluded, service contracts growth is relatively flat.</p>
          <p>Impairment and diminution costs were up 65% or $66 million half on half. Firstly, inside that component and it's blown out on the slide here for you to see.  Bad and doubtful debts increased 48% or by $38 million driven by a combination of increased mobile and broadband volumes. So associated with the high increase in revenue and a review of credit terms for Sensis customers, where new customers can now pay support and that's driving higher revenues. Plus there was an associated bad debt with that.</p>
          <p>Inventory is the other element here, and inventory write-downs increased $28 million mainly due to stock write-offs in addition to providing for some slower-moving stock.  So as handsets get returned and so on they have a lower realizable value. And the CDMA migration has had some impact on stock write-downs.</p>
          <p>The final expense category in this group, if you like, I want to cover is G&amp;A, or general and administration expenses, increased 12% or 54 million. And again, some of this has been driven by the IT transformation. The IT cost growth was 31 million inside that 54, and was driven by software licenses and hardware support and maintenance. But you have to understand, for a little while, as we go through this transformation, we will run duplicate hardware and systems, and they need support and maintenance.</p>
          <p>Travel costs are up 5 million and that's been associated with our staff traveling a lot around the country, caused by the inclement weather. And we've got to meet our customer repair requirements and we've been moving our staff around more than ever before.</p>
          <p>Legal costs have increased 14 million as we focused on the class action. I think you read about the results of that.  And training expenses rose 5 million, related to the transformation training, but also the Learning Academy that you know about.</p>
          <p>Let me move to CapEx. Accrued capital expenditure is up 17.5%; however, on a sequential basis, it's fallen 40%, as you would expect, given what was spent last year. And given our accrued CapEx guidance for the full year of 4.6 billion to 4.9 billion, this implies a second half largely consistent with the first half, and we believe that is so. Just be aware that we will be incurring additional CapEx of approximately 40 million, driven by the added <mark type="inaudible" /> plus weather. But that's accommodated in our current guidance.</p>
          <p>IT was a big driver of the increase in accrued CapEx, and last fiscal year was primarily in an IT sense, focused on feasibility in the initial stages of delivery. However, this half major projects including customer care and billing transformation for the Consumer segment, is driving the CapEx up.</p>
          <p>Transmission is the other area of growth. It rose 57%, with the majority relating to the Sydney to Hawaii cable initiative; that added 75 million. There's also been contributions to the Asia /America gateway cable, and additional capacity purchased from Southern Cross contributing to the increase. This is being driven by broadband, being driven by Internet use, not surprisingly.</p>
          <p>Fixed access, the network core, CapEx has fallen 6.4%, with the large rollout of the wireline transformation program having taken place in the last fiscal, and wireless CapEx also fell 4.9%, which is to be expected with the delivery of Next G also occurring in last fiscal year. But we do continue to add new base spaces to extend our competitive advantage and we now have 6,400 3 G base stations with 300 added in the past six months.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about cash flow for a minute and our financial parameters. With our largest transformation spend year behind us, that's total cash spend behind us and the benefits already flowing through with our strong earnings performance, free cash flow has increased 53.6% to $1.3 billion. You might recall that always cash flow is lower in the first half than the second half. In terms of our financial parameters, we see counts that we're still on all measures and you see those also on the slide.</p>
          <p>Just before I finish for questions, let me give you some more color on our financing position.  Given the global credit issues that are around right now, I do get asked a lot if Telstra is exposed to the current issues in the debt market. Our answer is not substantially and you can see our debt maturity profile here on this slide. The average maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is around five years and we have moderate maturities to refinance in the next few years. We have approximately 1 billion dollars of long-term debt maturity in the remainder of this year and we will finance this with borrowings in the short- and long-term markets according to the conditions that prevail when we go to market. While our cost of debt has risen this fiscal year, in line with the market developments, this will be accommodated without any material impact given our strong credit rating, diverse access to funds, and a strong balance sheet. Borrowing costs will increase this year as they have for everybody, but this will be driven more from the increasing debt rather than the rising rate.</p>
          <p>And lastly, our long-term objectives remain unchanged from the November Investor Day but I do want to tell you that we will be doing a review of these objectives as we now move into our planning period and any change to these long-term objectives we will advise you at our full-year results announcement in August. So thank you and I'll now ask Sol if he will join me back up on the stage and we'll take some questions.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sol and John, I'm <mark type="inaudible" />. Just first of all, to &#x2013; on the financing structure of the business and the balance sheet. A number of pundits have had various views in terms of needing to increase gearing or share buybacks. How do you see that the strengths in the cash flows and the balance sheet flexibility can provide greater upside in terms of shareholder returns over the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all we have got a set of financial parameters that we are still sticking to. You should also remember that we are still borrowing to pay dividends and we are not at a point yet of huge cash flows to return to shareholders. Now having said that, we re-confirmed today our $0.14 ordinary dividend. We have said our free cash flow will be somewhere between 6 to $7 billion in the year 2010 and the Board will then have to decide when it has got that sort of cash flow, whether, what they do with it, return it to shareholders or whether it's invested in other things and whether or not it's at that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, <mark type="inaudible" /> We'll make the right decisions at the right time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Sol. Just a quick question on the operating forms, I mean you've highlighted again the leverage, obviously the business is achieving, particularly given the competitive environment at the moment, and your competitors obviously focus on the right pace safe from a fixed fine perspective of rolled over in the December quarter. Looking at the numbers again kind of appears that you have been again conservative in your top-line outlook on the business. 5.3% top-line growth, 6.2% in the second half 2007, is there something that you see coming through in the second half of this year which will see a slow down potentially in that run rate?  And then secondly just on the operating side in the costs, and maybe more for John, is there any major benefits we can see coming through in the second half which will see the potential for further large cost out management coming through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me go ahead and start and then I'll let John add to whatever he feels appropriate. In terms of the top-line we're going to be cycling second half on second half where last year we had a very strong second half revenue delta, that's with the launch of Next G and partly through the half, the Next IP business. So we're cycling strong half on strong half. Number 1, Number 2 is that we are always prudent in terms of how we think about our guidance cause we're more focused not on what we say on paper but what we do in reality in the market and so we will stay true to those principles as we talk about guidance and as we deliver, we will communicate in the market what our current views are.</p>
          <p>In terms of the costs and the underlying benefits and run rate, most of what we're still doing is just tightening up what I would call operating excellence in the business. We still haven't finished all the IT transformation, we still haven't finished the migration and removal of all the network piece parts that we said way back at the beginning that we're going to have to reduce in effect the amount of SKUs we have in our business, and that's all coming in the latter part of '09 calendar year and '10 clearly fiscal year.  So that's where we're going to be looking again as we've said back in November and as we said in November of '05 when the big opportunities for cost reduction will come. In the meantime, managing our customer acquisition costs, managing the retention costs, managing the productivity in terms of our operations, which in this half we're up 20% in terms of productivity improvements. It's just that day-to-day management stuff that we're working on right now and our team's getting pretty good at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me rephrase the first part of my question, how has the momentum been post-December, i.e., the first two months of the year now. Has that continued along a similar trend that you were seeing obviously in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not disclosing anything beyond what we've reported and so what you see in our guidance being raised that we are confident in terms of what we've said so far and we'll continue to operate as well as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" /> I had three questions. One, you previously disclosed how your CapEx breaks down between maintenance CapEx and transformation CapEx and I was wondering if you can provide us with a flavor for that today?  The second one was your net debt was up about a billion dollars but the finance costs were down about $20 million. I was wondering if you could explain what's going on over there? And the third question is just with such a strong operating performance, I was wondering how you're tracking on your REN report?  If you could provide an update on the kind of incentives that are probably still in place for the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the third one. I don't know, I don't spend my time thinking about it in terms of our day-to-day operations. When the Board made their decisions about what it should look like, it's in place, we'll count and do all the calculations at that point in time. Maybe John has some idea but that isn't the driving element for us. The element is about winning in a market place where you see us on broadband growing 65%, outdoing our performers, our competitors three to one on mobiles on post- paid, outgrowing them again 2 to 3x and the growth rates which are best in the world for developed markets. I mean you just stay focused on delivering the operating results and all the rest comes with it at the right time.  And if we don't deliver the operating results then the rest doesn't come. So we're not spending our time on your third question.  John, first two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay maintenance CapEx, maintenance CapEx remains about 1.8 to 2 in full year right? So I'm giving you the full year context so it remains around $2 billion.  The answer to your second question is a derivative one. The way we have to mark our derivatives to <mark type="inaudible" /> accounting means there is a positive outcome in the financing costs so what you need to look at and I'll tell you now is the real growth in interest cost so interest paid is an increase of 88 million half on half.  So the interest cost has gone up 88 million and that's a combination of low borrowing and <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we're going to take a question now from Melbourne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much this is <mark type="inaudible" />. Just say a couple of questions. Firstly if you look at the retail PSTN numbers you've had a 48,000 increase in the last six months and if you compare that to Optus what they reported is about 100,000 decline. So just wondering of this 48,000 how much is a result of Optus going down versus the result of your plan?  And second question, Sol, I think in the past you mentioned that retail &#x2013; are you still comfortable with 2 to 3% declines?  I was just wondering if you could update that? Are you still comfortable with the longer-term 2 to 3% decline in PSTN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me address the first part of your question. Let me be clear. Telstra leads the market and Telstra sets the tone in the market. What Optus does is kind of you know it's interesting to us but they don't drive the market. Our retail PSTN improvement began much before Optus &#x2013; Optus, or whoever else started doing whatever they do and we drive our strategies, our win back rates increased and accelerated about a year and half, two years ago and that's continued. How much is tied to their resale customers deciding they don't want to move to their on net strategy. There is some of that, I won't say that there's not some of that, but it's not the material element of what we're doing in the market. The punch line is, we're winning in the market.  Relative to your question about guidance, the guidance that we gave on PSTN for the year was around the same run rate as last year. Now the good news for us, so far, is that the value propositions that we have in the market are working well. And the price issues that some like to report about are being dealt with in different ways as to how we run our business here, because we're not a one-dimensional company. And so, we're going to keep our guidance where it is at this stage, but hopefully we will continue to outperform.  As I said back in August of last year, we stand here today to say, we did outperform what we thought the run rates were at that point in time.  Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, <mark type="inaudible" />. I was just looking at the reporting numbers in this half.  Am I right in thinking that they include <mark type="inaudible" /> Yellow Pages this half, and weren't included the previous corresponding half?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're trying to smooth that out, and just taking that out, I can't tell you off the top of my head.  But that smoothing that I did, we adjusted for that. And we also adjusted for, you know, redundancies and transformation costs, that 8.5% is what I would call an underlying EBIT rate.</p>

          <p>Especially at the EBITDA level, given this margin. So what would have been since this revenue growth, like-for-like, half and half?  You're saying it's up, but if you normalize that impact, what would that have been?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You understand for us it's important to know what is underlying, like-for-like organic growth is. And so it's obviously a big adjustment from one house (1.08.34) to the other. Anyway, second question was on the dividend. Usually at the first half you kind of concerned the intention on full year. You got ahead of your four, five billion potentially, I should think, at four, five billion investments on FTTN, does the $0.20 compare in any way on this particular investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the FTTN investment, whether it happens or not, I don't know whether it will happen or not and we're not building it into our financial planning at this stage. We're working with the government, trying to go through the processes and all that sort of thing. In terms of the financing and how we think about the business, obviously we would be looking at some point if we were involved and chose to be involved and were selected. We would have to finance to some extent whatever additional CapEx would be involved. Would it affect our dividend? That is a decision for the board but I don't think that's a necessary issue for people to be concerned about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, lastly, in the last year obviously the businesses have great retail momentum. Does it change in any way the way you're going to approach this new situation with the government?  Your terms, as they were a year ago, would they have changed materially from a year ago now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>We're very shareholder-focused. The competitive returns we have to provide haven't changed at all. As a matter of fact, you know market conditions are even tougher today than they were a year ago. So punch line is that the principals, the terms, all of that are still the same. It's just now the question is, "Is there a focus on outcomes versus just rhetoric and talk?"</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />  Congratulations on a good result.  I just wanted to ask, to get some more data on TR1 and how that's progressing in terms of the number of customers or the potential customers that migrated to date versus those that will be done by June 30?  And also what June 30 deadline involves, whether it actually involves everybody who is on budget and didn't even build at that time &#x2013; really I suppose to shut down the legacy systems.  And the second question was just an accounting question on what the accounting treatment of the FOXTEL distributions will be going forward seeing that you're going to become more regular, if there is any change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, number one relative to details on our conversion and customer accounts and all that, we don't disclose that so I won't tell you other than to say that we're on plan and when we meet again in August we'll talk about whether we hit it or not.  Now I'm going to also add a sentence to your question because I've been hearing this kind of on the periphery, well the APT had their problems and some bank had their problems and gee, what's going to be different about Telstra? The simple answer is that we're on plan. OK? However, if there was a problem, whatever it might be, we will not &#x2013; I'm so focused, I'm getting this company so focused on customers that we're not going to do anything that would be silly or create the kind of problems that you see happening elsewhere. So that will always be part of our operating plan just like everything we've done so far.  But let me go back to statement one, we're on plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll address the FOXTEL distribution but first let me go back to that prior question <mark type="inaudible" /> It isn't an issue for the first half. The first half is like-for-like so there's no variation or normalization that's to take place. When we get to second half next year when you look at the half or the end of this year I should say that's when we'll have to talk about adjustments for the Yellow book. So this year's growth incentives is pure and like-for- like.  So, just clear that up. FOXTEL distribution, accounting for FOXTEL distribution, I've told you that the $100 million accounting is because it's come from borrowings and so far they are accumulated losses, concerns it went from 83 up to 193. The $30 million that we get in March isn't in borrowing so that accounting won't take place. But when it comes from a borrowing the accounting I described previously will continue to take place. Our accumulated &#x2013; so after our share of FOXTEL's profit this half is gone, now accumulated losses now 144 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we're going to take a question in Melbourne now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's <mark type="inaudible" />. I have three questions for you. The first question is on David Thodey's Enterprise division. Just wondering if you could tell us how of much your total sales, total sales Enterprise and Government is?  And more specifically have you seen any weightiness into sort of January and February at the revenue line given that the top four banks in your top 15 to 20 customers Australia-wide?  Secondly, John, just a question for you on the tax rate, that looked a little bit low, I was just wondering if you could make a comment there please? And just update us on how the banking account is going, and thirdly, just with the improving cash flow, I was wondering if you could make a comment on how you see the priorities going forward between acquisitions given that 2011 census target versus returning capital to shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me take part of it and then I will let John take the rest of it. In terms of the business, you know, we have already had one question about what is happening in January, etc., and the answer is we are not disclosing anything other than our full year results. You know, our raising of guidance should be enough signal to everybody in terms of how we think about the second half. In terms of the last question that you asked, and I will let John give you the number response because I don't have it with me here, if you look at how we think about our business , obviously the board is going to make their decisions based upon the cash that we will have at hand, and as I have said in the past the board will always have that option of dealing with dividend adjustments, the board will have the option of looking at share buybacks, and the board will also have options about strategic investments that will be there. We're confident about where we're going to be in terms of improving our free cash in the business and we said that back in November when we had our sessions, and I'll say it again today, the run rate that we are on to, to 2010, with our free cash flow targets, we're still onto. So it will give us flexibility, it will give us the kind of options that every board and every management team would love to have. So beyond that I am not going to say much, Christian, other than to say we will explore all options from the very beginning, I will always go back to this notion that says we are very shareholder-focused. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, the answer <mark type="inaudible" /> abet, the Injulius revenue is total.  I think you can see it from the result, I know the <mark type="inaudible" /> revenue is $2.2 billion and sales is $12.2 so you can see the percentage there of the total growth, if that is the question you are asking.  If you are asking how much is contracted revenue in the company <mark type="inaudible" /> revenues are mostly contracted so I'm not sure what you're getting at there. Frankly, frankly, <mark type="inaudible" /> 100% frank.  The half and our expectations <mark type="inaudible" />) fully frank and fully evident.  With respect to the tax rate, yes it is low and I alerted to that in my presentation. It is low because we had some successful objections to our previous year tax return so we had to amend a tax return which gave us a 40 million output or outcome. The distribution's not taxable from FOXTEL so that helps and we also received a CSL exempt from tax dividend ARM they contributed to it as well So that's the array of things that occurred to give us the lower effective tax rate, Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we're going to move here to Sydney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> again. Just in view of the strong revenue growth, how much do you think the, for one of the better description unimpressive results that have been delivered by some of the competitors and their distractions have resulted in that very positive outcome. I'd point to Telstra Business where IAPT and Commander have certainly been distracted.  And then secondly, to what extent have those impacts, those competitive impacts helped you to reduce your activity-based costs in terms of customer acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say first of all, our growth really again is not tied to what Company A, B, X or Z are doing. It's based on, we have a mobile platform that is dramatically better than any competitor in the market. We have a Next IT platform that is dramatically better than any competitor in the market. We have a whole ISP business and portal and set of content and services that is dramatically better than any competitors in the market and we have our advertising business that's better than anybody's in the market. So it's about what we're doing.  And yes, others might have problems here and there but those problems have occurred in the past may vary by company.  Punch line is, customers get to make the choice, they're making the best value choice at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And all the costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I've already said to the acquisition costs in terms of business are going down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That you've undertaken thoughe that you could point to that have pushed that forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The head of the business unit is here...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the benefit of those who could not hear what Deena said, Deena Shiff, head of Telstra Business responded. Basically she said it's better planning in terms of the targeting that we do for our customers. And I would add to it, it goes to the segmentation that we have, it goes to our knowledge of customers that we have, it goes to the product sets that we have, it goes to the integrated features that we have, all of that enables us to keep on driving some of the cost improvements that we have along with the revenue growth. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning Sol, morning John. Firstly full credit to all the management saying this is a very encouraging operational result. Couple of questions I just wanted to cover off, firstly, previously John, you've disclosed mobile margins I'm just wondering if we could get an update on that in case I missed it?  Secondly, Sol, just looking at FOXTEL Mobile you outlined in Barcelona that there's only 2% of the base is using FOXTEL Mobile service. Does that raise concern in terms of consumer appetite to use mobile content or content that's within the walled garden of Telstra as opposed to the wireless broadband performance, which is, you know, sky rocketing, but you've also got three competitors that have got effectively N3G networks as well. So just interested to get your take on that?  And finally, just looking at the FCTN potential, would Telstra consider taking a minority stake in an FCTN network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is an easy one to answer. The answer is no. And in case you haven't heard that answer at least 20 times out of my mouth, the answer is no. In terms of, you know, your first question and walled gardens and things like that the answer is we do have our own content, but we also provide access to everybody else's content. I don't know if you saw the slide up here and what we're doing with our 3 Tab Portal, it's on the mobile, it's on the fixed line, it's on the desktop, it's everywhere. So I think, you probably should erase language like that and understand we are both moving content that we own and control and distribute, as well as others.  But seeing your point again, you quoted a number of 2%.  Almost 5% of our Next G customers are subscribing to our FOXTEL mobile capabilities. And what we now have done, as of you saw it in the November session we had, we've upgraded the platform essentially to have the ability to remotely program and control along with channel change, along with more channels.</p>
          <p>So we've enhanced the capability. I would say on first release, it was interesting but not good enough and I will tell you today, we will continue to enhance the capabilities as we go forward because I do believe given our numbers being dramatically better than anybody else in the world, there is an appetite and for those that are using it, they're spending about $11 of ARPU a month. Now, the way I do math, and this is the way I learned math, is that people that generate another $11 of ARPU a month, they're equivalent of 5x of those that are generating another $2 plus a month. So, it's not so much about getting to 50% penetration of Mobile FOXTEL, but it might be getting to 10% or 15% of people that are going to spend 10 to $15 more. Then it's going to be about adding search capabilities and then it's going to be about adding access to other content capabilities. And it may be different segments, again back to market-based management, different segments buying different things and generating ARPU within that segment. And that's how we're driving this business. This is not about you paint the whole building red and that's the way we manage. That's how our competitors do it.  Right?  They come out with a discount a day, a week and all that sort of thing. We're very different in terms of how we're managing. We're managing by segments; we're managing with knowledge; we're managing to grow value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> you've only added 30,000 in the last 12 months to FOXTEL Mobile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm pleased because we've got better results than anybody else.  We're developing a business. We're developing a new way for customers to use the services. So, I think our results are terrific and when you compare them to anybody else's they speak for themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you concerned about pricing in on the wireless broadband front given where Telstra's pricing is relative to other major competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I haven't seen any competitor that has more volume than we do, generates more margin than we do and has more customers than we do, unless you've seen something that I haven't. The second thing is, is that those of us that know how to run businesses, we also looked at what the costs are and those who invest in companies also pay attention to looking at what's the cost of doing whatever somebody is doing. Some of these companies that like giving away the service, now they have to give it away because they're about four square blocks and their at one-third the speed and you know one-tenth the quality, but the other thing is is that when people do take the buffet meal, all you can eat for five bucks, there's not many of those restaurants that last very long because the costs of goods far exceeds the revenues generated, and you can only do it for so long and then people quit financing what you do. And over time you will see a combination of what I just described play out in the market. We will always be value competitive and price is not the only variable, in case you haven't heard that, <mark type="inaudible" />at least 20 times before, price is not the only variable behind what customers making their purchase decisions. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, overall margin is 34.1% which is up 3.7% on the previous half and compared to  <mark type="inaudible" /> margin of 31.7.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> just on FOXTEL distribution so if you get another distribution by some gearing up of FOXTEL first half '09, that will come through at the EBITDA line, is that right?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just have two follow-up questions please. The first one is so you recently made some comments about making acquisitions in the Asia Pacific region, just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what your strategy is and what sort of potential opportunities you may be looking at in terms of business areas, and secondly, I have a question for Justin Milne just if he can maybe talk us through the thinking or the revenue model behind the BigPond TV Sport Weekend program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, relative to the comments about interest and acquisitions in the Asia Pac region, it's centered around what we've been doing with SouFun, I think you've now have enough data, the market's had enough data to see that the sustainability of a new business model that's very similar to the business model of our Sensis business. Great top-line growth, great bottom-line growth and we will look for smart opportunities as we do that, we are going to continue to look at our portfolio and managing those elements within our portfolio as we did with SouFun where we sold off an asset that was not strategic to help finance the acquisition of an asset and there is a combination of things, <mark type="inaudible" /> I won't get into specifics because I'm not going to pre-signal anything that we might or might not do in the market because I don't like overpaying for assets and I don't like creating bid situations around assets if I can avoid it. Justin, do you want to talk about the 3 Tab Portal and the BigPond Sports Weekend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>BigPond Sports Weekend. <mark type="inaudible" />), we're pretty excited about this. It launches this Saturday. We were rehearsing all last Saturday. We see BigPond Sports Weekend as a kind of a lightning rod for all of our sports properties. So they have all been collected together under one title called BigPond Sports Weekend. And the customer experience will be that virtually any time on the weekend starting 9 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock at night, Saturday and Sunday, the user can flip open their mobile phone and find out what's going on with a continuous stream of live broadcasts, to process for results, updates, sports from all around the world and all around Australia. And we think that's pretty compelling so that it gives you continuous sports update in your pocket.</p>
          <p>The business model for that is a subscription model that will cost AUSD 3.95 with an introductory offer to start off the season. So it will be $3.95 per month to subscribe to that service and you will be able to have a day pass for a $1.95 or you will be able to just click on it for just $0.50 a click and the click will last for five minutes. So there is lots of ways for people to get used to the service and it will also become part of our subscription for AFL, BFL or NRL. Those subscriptions are $9.95 a month for a full pack of special AFL for example stats and special reports and videos on demand and BigPond Sports Weekend is part of that subscription as well.</p>
          <p>Over time we expect the model to move more and more to advertising and we will in fact start off with advertising in there and because we think along with our brothers at Sensis that the mobile advertising model is just huge and going forward and so this is one of the early forays if you like which is you know truthfully experimental but you mostly use experimental when you get right down to it. So we will be very excited about it. We think it could be good and the customers will vote with their feet. So we'll see you next time we meet. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. <mark type="inaudible" /> three questions.  Firstly I'm wondering if you could update us on the customer numbers for CDMA?  In previous statistical abstracts, you provided that number; it's not there this time. Secondly, I'm just wondering if you could expand a little on your thinking about your competitive strategy in mobiles and particularly in the context of the reduction in the handset subsidy rate?  Does this signal a shift from aggressive subscriber growth orientation to improving the margins from the existing customer base through higher ARPUs, lower subsidies, et cetera, and whether we can expect that reorientation to be ongoing? And thirdly, really a refinement of the previous question from the last analyst, with respect to corporate opportunities, but specifically in Australia. Given that we have Commander with assets on the block, there are rumors that SingTel is looking to divest the Optus satellite fleet. What opportunities do you see for liquidity-based growth, specifically within Australia?  Or is Telstra simply too big to be able to look at any meaningful acquisitions in the domestic market?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me handle them fairly quickly because we are about out of time.  In terms of CDMA we are not disclosing any numbers because now it is almost immaterial they're, I think that we report that at the end of the year they are less than 3% of our mobile revenues, so I am not even watching the full numbers other than watching the process so that we can close on April 29th.  In terms of SARCs and as we think about acquisition and retention costs and the reductions you have seen, I want to remind you about the fact that we have grown, we have added more post-paid customers by a factor of two to three X than our nearest competitor so we are still adding customers to our base. In particular as we focus on post-paid in the last wave of our launch of Next G; however, to your point, we are reducing the cost associated with those acquisitions and it is all about, you know, John covered handset cost reductions, it is about the effectiveness of our market-based management system, all the segmentation, all the work we are doing, so we are reducing the amount of cost, not so much because we are trying to "just cut costs" while we manage or mine an EBITDA margin. It is about being much more effective as we market that is driving the cost down as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The third part of your question, which is about acquisitions in Australia, you know, naming some of the assets that you did, my view right now is that we have real strength in our channels, we have real strength with our product set, we have real strength in terms of our footprint and coverage in almost every metric and every category, and so we don't have the need to supplement where we are already the best in the market. So that's the mind set that I have, and obviously I won't comment on any specific opportunity other than to say we will explore something that might enhance our capabilities, but right now I won't say anything more. Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks. So, John, <mark type="inaudible" /> here. Just a couple of quick questions.  Firstly, on the tax rate, John, you did mention, obviously, the one-offs in the first-half result, can you just, for a modeling purpose, can you give us a tax rate that we should expect for the full year and whether that should change in subsequent periods?  The second question in terms of obviously there's talk about a potential hard landing from a domestic economy point of view, so just to get some clarification in terms of the magnitude of contractual revenues within the base?  And lastly, just from your trip to Barcelona, obviously there's been a number of equipment vendors now thinking about pushing further into the service layer from a competition point of view, Nokia AV, for example, can you just give a few comments in terms of how that changes the competition within the service layer from a global perspective and also how that changes your relationship with the vendors themselves?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the tax rate will be less than the 30% at the end of the year because the distribution, all those things that I've said, will flow through. Now I think your question is about going further forward. I don't expect the size of those sort of tax amendments to recur. Distributions will still be treated as non-taxable, so the 30 million that we're getting back, that will be not taxable, so that will help the end of this fiscal year tax rate, and if there are future distributions, the same application will apply. R&amp;D always is around that same sort of level, and so we will likely have a less than 30% corporate tax rate the following year, but not to the same extent as this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Did you want me to talk about contract base? <mark type="inaudible" /> it's a difficult question to answer.  I said before about the contracted revenues in A&amp;G. Most of A&amp;G's revenue is contracted. It depends on your definition of contracted. I mean I could argue that every customer with us has a contract, but they're easier to get out of than other contracts.  I mean <mark type="inaudible" /> customer has a single form contract, right, but it's easier to get out of, and there are mobile contracts that are harder to get out of. How I look at this, depending on your definition of contracted rate, is somewhere about 40 to 60% of our revenue base.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The good news about our business is that, you know, mobiles now are almost, the one thing that we won't give up in terms of our daily lives, and the second thing is is in terms of our fixed line, they're so embedded in terms of our personal lifestyle, as well as business lifestyle that our vulnerability versus others is probably not quite the same. However, if there is a downturn of some sort, we could be affected. I won't say that we wouldn't be, but here in Australia, we have different issues than other parts of the world. Got full employment, got fairly robust economy at this stage and what the Federal Reserve Bank and others have been worried about is more on the inflation side than on is there a problem much like what you see in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Your question about Barcelona and the players, the handset manufacturers that are thinking or trying to get into the services business, it's an interesting question because on the surface you could say that we will be in conflict. And in the case of Nokia, they made an attempt about four years ago with Nokia World or whatever it was, and there were a lot of us, I was in Europe at the time running Orange and we had a conversation with them about encroaching essentially on our business model and what happens. And I think they learned a lesson at that point in time. I think their approach on OV is a little bit different.  I think their approach is trying to find the harmony of models because in some cases companies like Telstra, we have our own content, we have our own Australia-centric kind of muse of what we want to do, question is can we leverage some of what they have that we don't have, bring it on in term of our customers, and find a model that works for both of us. That may make sense. We have the Apple conversations where in the U.S. it was launched parts of Western Europe, it was launched as a share of revenues, well you saw in China, China said no, not interested.  And there's a lot of conversations going on in the industry, I'm not going to get into specifics about what we're doing and what we're saying and what we're going to do, but suffice it to say that we, Telstra, will stay true to our principles, stay true to the shareholder, the customer ways that we think and we will leverage assets as an integrated company delivering integrated services, that won't change regardless of who we do business with.  As you've seen we do business with all the big players but we've introduced new players to the market like ZTE and others and we will continue to do that as necessary, as appropriate so that our shareholders and our customers win in the long term.</p>
