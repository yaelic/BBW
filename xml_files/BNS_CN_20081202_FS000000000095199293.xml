        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the presentation of Scotiabank's Fourth Quarter Results. I'm Luc Vanneste, CFO. Rick Waugh, our CEO, will lead off with the highlights of our results.</p>
          <p>Next, I will go over the financials, including a review of business line performance. I will be followed by each of the three Group Heads &#x2013; Chris Hodgson, Rob Pitfield and Mike Durland, who will discuss their outlook and priorities for 2009. Then Brian Porter, our Group Head, Risk and Treasury will discuss credit quality and market risk. And finally Rick will cover our outlook and priorities for 2009. We will then be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Here with us to participate in the Q&amp;A, we also have Sabi Marwah, our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer; Steve McDonald, Co-CEO of Scotia Capital; Jeff Heath, our Group Treasurer, and Dieter Jentsch, EVP of Commercial Banking, Canada.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to slide number two of our presentation, which contains Scotiabank's caution regarding forward-looking statements. Rick, over to you.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Luc. Well, clearly 2008 was a difficult year, one marked by challenging market conditions and unprecedented volatility in financial markets globally. We were of course not immune to the market turmoil as all Canadian banks have been affected. These events led to writedowns of 642 million after tax this quarter, and as a result our earnings per share was $0.28 for the quarter and $3.05 for the year.</p>
          <p>Although we are disappointed to having to take charges of this magnitude, it is important to note that we've performed well over the past year compared to many of our major Canadian and global competitors. Notwithstanding these challenges, I am pleased to report solid core earnings from each of our businesses. We are cautiously optimistic about our earnings next year. We believe we have the right strategies and the right team, but I am going to come back to that later.</p>
          <p>The 2008 results were marked by a record year in Canadian Banking, solid earnings in International Banking, reported earnings declined by 30% at Scotia Capital. On a core basis, all three businesses delivered solid performance &#x2013; impressive given this weak environment.</p>
          <p>Canadian Banking had a strong year, growing earnings by 17% if we exclude last year's Visa's gains. Strong asset and deposit growth resulted in good top line revenue growth. International earnings were close to $1.2 billion, down 5% from 2007. However, on a core basis net income rose 11%. We benefited from strong business growth and increased contributions from our acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Scotia Capital was the division most affected by the global market conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter. However, underlying performance was comparable to 2007 as we achieved record results in our foreign exchange, precious metals, Scotia Waterous and our fixed income businesses.</p>
          <p>Partly offsetting the solid core performance of the three business lines was a large negative result in the other category largely reflecting several of the writedowns and higher funding and liquidity costs.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratios remain strong, and of course strong capital is very important in this difficult environment. As you can see our tangible common equity was a strong 7.3%. Our Tier 1 ratio was a strong 9.3%. Our total ratio was 11.1%. These ratios remain strong despite double-digit asset growth in all of our business lines. Our ratios are well above the regulatory minimum and are high by all global standards.</p>
          <p>We've also been proactive in raising capital, both equity and debt. The quality of our capital is high, given the quality of our assets, the low level of goodwill and a large component of common equity. As well, despite the challenging conditions the overall strength of our capital and fundamental earnings allow us to generate sustainable dividends for our shareholders. Our strong capital provides us with a cushion against economic turbulence, allowing us to grow and as well to look at opportunity to make investments that will help our growth even more.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Luc to go through the financial details with you now.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rick. As Rick mentioned, our fourth quarter results included writedowns of $642 million after tax. Valuation adjustments totaled $416 million, including a $137 million charge relating to the purchase of certain CDOs from the Bank's U.S. multi-seller conduit, $122 million writedown on CDOs held on our balance sheet, and 150 million charge for AFS securities. We also had a $117 million trading loss relating to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and a $109 million mark-to-market loss on ALM hedging. You can refer to slides 35 and 36 for more details on these items.</p>
          <p>Excluding the writedowns, our core results were solid this quarter. Net income was up 8% versus Q4 last year, but down 5% from last quarter. Compared to Q3, we benefited from asset growth across all business lines, increased spreads in the U.S. and European corporate loan portfolios and acquisitions. However, these gains were more than offset by lower underlying securities gains, a decrease in Wealth Management revenues given the challenging market conditions, and higher loan losses.</p>
          <p>When compared to Q4 '07, net income was up 8%. This was largely due to strong business growth as well as acquisitions; partly offsetting were higher PCLs and expenses, lower underlying securities gains and higher funding costs. On a core basis, we continue to achieve an impressive ROE -- over 19% -- and maintain a solid productivity ratio at 54.9%, comfortably below our 57% target.</p>
          <p>Looking at revenues in more detail on slide 10, year-over-year core revenues were up 9%. Net interest income increased 14%, benefiting from acquisitions and broad based loan growth, partly offset by a lower margin. Other income rose 3%, driven by record forex and precious metals trading, businesses which benefited from the market volatility. Higher securitizations and acquisitions also contributed.  Partly offsetting were lower underlying securities gains versus a high level in Q4 '07. Compared to Q3, core revenues were up 2% with higher net interest income offsetting lower other income. Net interest income was helped by continued asset growth and a stable underlying margin.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 11. Adjusting for the 162 million pre-tax impact of the ALM hedging, the All-Bank margin increased by 3 basis points this quarter. We continue to see wider spreads in our U.S. and European corporate books and we also benefited from higher margins in Latin America. These factors were offset by relatively higher funding and liquidity costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses on slide 12. Expenses increased 8% year-over-year driven primarily by acquisitions, forex and growth initiatives, such as new branches and increased staffing. Partly offsetting were lower performance and stock based compensation. Compared to Q3, underlying expenses were well managed. The increase was due to acquisitions and forex, partly offset by lower performance in stock based compensation as well as lower capital taxes.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the business line results, beginning with Canadian Banking. Canadian Banking had another strong quarter with record net income of $466 million. Excluding the Visa gain in Q4 '07, net income was up 35%. Revenues rose 14%, driven by strong deposit growth, continued asset growth and a 16 basis point increase in the margin. Expenses continued to be well managed, rising only 1% versus Q4 '07. This reflected multiple acquisitions, 13 new branches and more customer-facing staff, mostly offset by our cost containment initiatives and lower commission-based compensation in Wealth Management. Net income was up slightly from a strong Q3, driven by positive volume growth. Partly offsetting were higher expenses largely from acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Looking now at International. Core net income was up 14% versus Q4 '07. Revenue growth was very strong, up 29%. Key drivers were acquisitions, asset growth and broad based increases in fee income. Expenses also increased 29%, largely as the result of three factors: acquisitions, which added $85 million; forex, which increased expenses by $37 million; and investments in revenue growth initiatives. Provisions grew $63 million versus last year, mainly because of higher retail provisions. Compared to Q3, net income was slightly lower, revenues rose 4% mainly due to acquisitions in Peru, a higher margin and forex. Expenses rose 8% due to acquisitions and forex.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Scotia Capital on slide 15. Excluding the writedowns, Scotia Capital had solid core results. In fact, some of Scotia Capital's businesses such as foreign exchange and precious metals benefited significantly from volatility as customers were more actively hedging their exposures. Taking this into account, Q4 net income as shown on the chart should not be taken as a normal run-rate. Compared to Q4 '07, we had higher corporate loan volumes and benefited from wider spreads as the portfolio continued to reprice. As mentioned, we also benefited from record precious metals and foreign exchange trading. Expenses were up 11% compared to last year as we are selectively investing in the franchise and adding new teams in focus areas such as infrastructure.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it over to the business line heads to talk about their outlook and priorities for 2009. We'll begin with Canadian Banking. Chris?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc. In 2008, we made good progress against our priorities. Those priorities included driving sustainable revenue growth organically and through acquisitions and expanding and enhancing our sales capacity. In meeting these objectives we've made several acquisitions, including Dundee Bank and E*TRADE.</p>
          <p>We're also in the process of closing our transaction to purchase Sun Life's interest in CI. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect this transaction to close mid next week. We're looking forward to building our relationship with the management of CI and have agreed on board representation. CI recently reported strong gross and net sales for November, a month that saw significant market movements. We're also looking forward to building our relationship with Sun Life as we explore many opportunities in the insurance sector. We're very pleased that Sun Life will continue to have a strong distribution arrangement with CI.</p>
          <p>We've also opened 13 new branches and added customer facing sales staff. And as a result, we gained market share in key product areas like deposits and mutual funds.</p>
          <p>Going forward, our long-term priorities to generate positive operating leverage and enhance earnings momentum remain unchanged. At the same time we'll clearly adjust to a slowing economy in 2009. We expect asset growth to slow and we also anticipate Wealth Management results will be impacted by continuing market difficulties.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we'll move forward on our growth initiatives, selectively and with a focus on careful investment of capital and cost containment. For example, in 2008 we made investments in the small business and multicultural banking segments and we'll leverage those in 2009 to continue our market share gains. In retail banking, we'll build on our market share success in 2008 by continuing to focus on growing personal deposits. We'll do the same in our commercial business by realigning our resources to focus on the deposit side of our customers' balance sheets rather than just assets.</p>
          <p>Also in commercial, in 2008 we acquired a small ticket leasing platform that gives us access to many new customers and a source for targeted growth in 2009. Similarly in 2008, we made significant investments in Wealth Management including the acquisitions of E*TRADE and our stake in Dundee Wealth. And we continue to concentrate on growing our mutual fund business.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we will focus on consolidating and integrating these operations. A good example is E*TRADE, where market volatility should result in higher trading volumes. And we will also continue to develop our partnerships with SCENE, Cineplex and NHL to acquire new customers and exclusively market our products and services.</p>
          <p>So in summary, in 2009 we'll build on the progress we've made in 2008. At the same time in view of the economic and business environment, we will be very selective in our initiatives and investments and will be prudent in containing our costs.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Rob Pitfield.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. In International, we expect asset growth will moderate due to slower economic growth in some markets specifically Caribbean, Central America and Mexico. On the other hand, we expect relatively strong growth in key countries such as Peru and certain countries in Asia. It's important to note that the majority of our countries are forecasting slower growth but still positive growth unlike many developed countries.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth will come from the momentum of last year's strong asset growth as well as wider lending spreads. Because we expect slower asset growth, we've revised our management's score cards to put more emphasis on a wider range of profitability drivers, including growing deposits, fee based businesses such as insurance and wealth management. Maintaining the long-term trend of positive annual operating leverage continues to be a key priority.</p>
          <p>We know expenses will increase due to the acquisitions last year in Chile and Peru. Inflation will also be a factor in markets such as the Caribbean. In response, we're tightening our expense management. We are reprioritizing our initiatives in order to reducing our discretionary spending. While we will manage our business more tightly, we are also going to continue to invest in it. We'll invest in initiatives to increase revenues by optimizing the profitability and retention of our high-value customers. We'll also focus on initiatives to improve operating efficiencies by reengineering processes and systems which we've done for quite a while now. For example, we'll continue to upgrade and roll out our call center programs, the new internet platform that we just launched, and our financial MIS to bring all three to best world-class standards.</p>
          <p>Clearly, credit risk management is going to be a priority. We've done a lot already including tightening underwriting standards early in the cycle. We are adding resources in collections and implementing world-class platforms both in retail account management and pricing platforms. While our focus is on organic growth, we continue to assess opportunities for acquisitions and investments in key markets.</p>
          <p>In summary, we expect 2009 to be a year of prudent solid growth. Mike?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. As Rick mentioned, we expect the challenging economic conditions to continue through 2009. Some businesses will be negatively impacted and others will be positively impacted. In those businesses that we expect to be negatively impacted, we believe that the many steps we have taken over the past several years have positioned us well.</p>
          <p>In our lending businesses, we have significantly improved the percentage of investment grade exposure and the diversification of our portfolios. In our trading businesses, we have exited our proprietary equity trading business, significantly reduced the level of structured derivative activity, and generally reduced our risk exposures. We will continue to focus on providing those products that are important to our client base. We will grow our NAFTA platform, which is a significant competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>We will also focus our efforts across all of Scotia Capital on key client sectors such as energy, mining and infrastructure. We have taken steps to improve our equities and investment banking offering including changing the leadership and better aligning our activities with our customers' needs.</p>
          <p>And finally, given the challenges we face, we will continue to manage our costs carefully. I will now turn it over to Brian.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. The global financial system has encountered unprecedented stress since the Lehman bankruptcy filing in mid-September. Earlier, Luc talked about the significant writedowns we took this quarter relating to asset valuation, a failed Lehman trade and ALM hedges. I will now provide some comments on credit and market risks as well as areas of current focus, namely Bank-sponsored multi-seller conduits, auto exposure and International retail loan portfolios. I will conclude my remarks by providing some comments on our 2009 risk outlook.</p>
          <p>Looking first at provisions, the specific provisions were 207 million this quarter compared to 159 million last quarter. There was a slight quarter-over-quarter increase in the commercial portfolios in Canada. Canadian retail portfolios continued to perform well. International provisions increased by 34 million. Of this increase, 24 million were in the retail portfolios and the remaining increase was due to lower recoveries in the commercial portfolios. I will have some additional comments on the International retail portfolios later on. Scotia Capital's Q4 provision was $10 million reflecting one account in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In terms of relative PCL performance on slide 23, our loss ratio compares very favorably against the peer group. This quarter, the loss ratio was 29 basis points, slightly higher than last quarter's 23 basis points.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the upward trend in gross impaired loan formations, which is expected given the current credit environment. Gross formations amounted to 615 million in Q4, unchanged from the previous quarter, but well up from last year. Formations have been relevantly stable in the Canadian P&amp;C business, a reflection of the solid credit quality of the portfolios and the relatively favorable credit environment in Canada to-date. The year-over-year increase in International formations arose mainly from classifications in Chile and the impact of some economic slowdown in certain regions. The formations in Scotia Capital have been modest, only 6 million this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risk. The unprecedented swings in currency, equity and credit markets from about mid-September triggered mostly by the Lehman bankruptcy filing created volatility in the Bank's trading results. As a result, our trading losses on one day during the week of the Lehman bankruptcy exceeded our VaR. However, this loss was well within our stress testing parameters and our credit risk model measures. The trading results recovered from this loss and the trading revenues were positive for the quarter. We expect VaR levels in 2009 to be somewhat higher in the mid to high 20 million range. This is the result of factoring in the extreme volatility experienced in September and October into our 2009 VaR measurements.</p>
          <p>Looking next to slide 26, we had a wider distribution of trading results this quarter arising from the extreme volatility. The largest one day loss of 39 million and the largest one day gain of 39 million both occurred in the week of the Lehman bankruptcy. That same week the TSX composite index was down about 7%, before recovering on the last day of the week to be up almost 9% on the week.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Bank's multi-seller commercial paper conduits, funded assets of 3.8 billion in the Canadian conduits are down approximately 20% from Q3. Excluding forex, funded assets in the U.S. conduit are down approximately 9% on the quarter. The weighted average rating of these assets held by the conduits is high, with the Canadian conduit assets having an average rating of AA- or higher, and 92% of the assets in the U.S. conduit rated A or higher. The assets have mostly 364-day term with a mix of auto loans, consumer and trade receivables. During the quarter the Bank acquired U.S. $330 million of CDOs and CLOs from the U.S. conduit. These were written down to fair value and, as Luc noted, we recorded an after-tax loss of 137 million. We now have no direct CDO or CLO exposure in the conduits.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we have updated our exposure to the North American and European wholesale auto loan and acceptances, consumer auto-backed securities and auto exposures in the Bank sponsored and third-party conduits. As discussed last quarter, almost two thirds of the wholesale portfolio is investment grade with more than half of the exposure to dealers and floor plans, mostly foreign auto dealers in Canada where the loan loss experience has been quite low.</p>
          <p>Our consumer auto-backed securities of 7.8 billion increased by 700 million in the quarter due entirely to appreciation of the U.S. dollar. 98% of this exposure is auto loans, the remaining 2% auto leases. A large portion of these securities &#x2013; 6.6 billion &#x2013; were purchased from GMAC under the revolving facility. We have reduced the U.S. component of this exposure by taking more Canadian receivables, now 22% of our total exposure. While the recent loss experience in the U.S. has been above our original estimates, we continue to have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated losses in the program.</p>
          <p>The last category is liquidity facilities to our own multi-seller conduits, as well as liquidity facilities to third-party conduits which are primarily consumer auto loans. Of the total of 7.8 billion, 1.2 billion relate to third-party conduits. Approximately 91% of the assets of the third-party conduits are externally rated AAA, with the balance internally rated investment grade by the Bank.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the composition of our International retail portfolios. Overall, we have roughly 60% of our portfolio in mortgages, 30% in personal loans and the remaining 10% in credit cards. Our Caribbean and Central American region make up approximately half the portfolio. In terms of provision for credit losses, the ratios are higher than in Canada as you would expect. However, we are adequately compensated for risks through higher margins.</p>
          <p>The loan losses have been for the most part within our tolerance level except for credit cards in Mexico, which have been problematic for all banks including ourselves. At 600 million, we are a small player in the Mexican credit card market. We have recently clamped down by reducing risk levels since early in 2008. We expect to see the results of these measures by mid 2009 in terms of a leveling-off of delinquencies and losses. Overall, the risks in our International retail portfolios are manageable.</p>
          <p>In summary, our exposures to Bank-sponsored multi-seller conduits, the auto sector and International retail are manageable. As we look ahead to 2009, the focus will largely be on credit risk. While we are comfortable with the quality of our portfolio at this juncture, we expect overall provisions to increase but be well within our risk tolerances.</p>
          <p>In Canadian Banking, we expect the effects of the economic slowdown to result in a moderate increase in provisions. International will be impacted by the effects of the U.S. economic weakness, most noticeably in Mexico and the Caribbean. Lower commodity prices will also have an impact on resource dependent countries such as Chile and Peru. As well, we anticipate lower commercial recoveries in Mexico and Peru.</p>
          <p>For Scotia Capital, we expect to see higher provisions in 2009 as the general decline in the U.S. economy will have some impact on our major clients in North America and Europe. In particular, we will be closely monitoring our exposures to the housing and auto sectors.</p>
          <p>Overall, we feel our portfolios are better positioned in terms of diversification and asset quality going into this credit downturn. Hence, we expect better credit performance in this cycle than in the past.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it back to Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Brian. I'm now going to turn to the 2009 outlook and goal or our priorities.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook, we believe that the economic activity will likely be weak through much of 2009. We also expect this volatility in the financial markets to continue. But consequently, we're going to manage all our businesses under these assumptions. However, it will be the strength of our diversifications which are by business, by product and by geography which will give us confidence that we will achieve growth in 2009, albeit at a more moderate rate than in the past. Although GDP growth in many of our key international markets is expected to be slow, as Rob mentioned, most will continue to grow at a faster pace relative to the North American economies, and particularly of course, U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>Now obviously as I said, we'll be managing with a view to the challenges that we're facing, but we see no reason for any drastic changes in our strategies, and we will of course execute them very effectively &#x2013; we always do. We remain committed to our three priorities that we mentioned continuously. First, to drive sustainable revenue growth; secondly, to manage our capital prudently; and third of course, leadership and its development. But we are adding two more, these are actually areas of our long-standing traditional strength, that being of course risk management and expense control.</p>
          <p>Firstly, let's talk about driving sustainable revenue. This will be both organically and through acquisitions, and remains one of our top priorities and is still achievable in this environment. We will leverage all our recent acquisitions and investments and look to take advantage of market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Second, as I said, we will continue to prudently manage our capital. Strong capital is important in challenging markets as these, and yet provides us with the flexibility to continue to invest in our businesses.</p>
          <p>Third, our priority on leadership and its development at all levels of our organization will remain a key priority. Identifying and developing talent to drive business innovation and to drive growth will be a critical component of our future success. And in 2009, we'll also be highlighting risk management and expense controls even more than we have in the past as key priorities which build on our strengths in this uncertain current environment.</p>
          <p>So overall moving into 2009, let me be as clear as possible in these uncertain times. We are obviously cautious given the environment, but we are confident in our future &#x2013; confidence that is shown by what we are communicating now to all our main stakeholders.</p>
          <p>We're telling our customers that we will continue to meet their needs with prudent lending, good advice and great service just as we always have. We are telling our employees that despite the economic conditions, which do require tight expense management something we are extremely good at, we do not foresee any forced layoffs. Indeed, I continue to see great career opportunities for our employees as we move forward.</p>
          <p>We are saying to our communities &#x2013; as always, we take our social responsibility seriously and will continue to contribute positively to the communities in which we live and work. And we are saying to governments, regardless of who leads them, that we are confident that we do not need any subsidies or capital from them. However, we do need continued reasoned support to ensure that we have a level playing field with our global competitors as most of them are receiving subsidies, including substantial government capital.</p>
          <p>So finally, let me tell our shareholders that their dividend is safe and well maintained, and that we do see increased earnings and growth in 2009 with great long-term opportunities even in this difficult environment. However, we will evaluate these opportunities as we always do with discipline and prudence and adherence to the priorities that I've just outlined.</p>
          <p>Finally, our targets for 2009. First, we are maintaining our earnings per share growth objective of 7 to 12% over 2008. Our target range for return on equity is 16 to 20%. Now this is down from 20 to 23% of last year's objective, but reflects the realities of the current environment. We are maintaining our productivity ratio target at less than 58%. And as I have said, we will continue to maintain strong capital and dividends.</p>
          <p>With our clear focus, executing effectively on our strategies, we are confident we will be able to achieve these goals and objectives both in 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So with that, we'll pass over to Luc and open up the questions to the management team.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just wanted to elaborate on acquisition opportunities. I know that you are talking about prudent capital management. But it seems that Scotia has gone through a cycle of acquisitions, first running through International, and then more on the domestic Wealth Management area. And Rick, where do you see opportunities to deploy capital, not necessarily in 2009, but over &#x2013; call it the next three to five years?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a long way out, but we're going to stay on strategy. We're going to stay in the areas that we know and we know well unless we see some extreme opportunities. We always reserve the right to be opportunistic, but there are so many opportunities that are developing in the markets we already are. So we want to stay on strategy, improve where perhaps we are below the levels we want to be, and -- or where it builds into even strong levels where we're at right now. So, lots of what you've seen is probably what we're going to be able to do.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Luc, it looked as if the charge on the AFS was bigger than you had pre-announced. Can you talk through how that AFS charge that flows through income, how it could have changed as much as it did over the course of a couple of weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly Ian. When we made our pre-announcement on November the 18th, we were still going through our year-end process and looked at all the securities that had unrealized losses. The environment was such volatile and directionally it was going the other way, and we decided to &#x2013; on the relatively few number of securities for -- take another impairment writedown. And that was 67 million pre-tax, 45 after-tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I thought it was significantly different from what you pre-announced on the AFS. Did I get that wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of the numbers that we had in the earlier, in the November 18 press release were rounded numbers at that point. And these are the actual numbers after going through the year-end audit process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess, Luc, the question I would have &#x2013; I mean when I look at the large unrealized loss now in the AFS book. How should we think of that if, in over the course of a couple of weeks, the charge coming through income presumably because it's no longer of a temporary nature, how should we think about that large negative mark --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the AFS securities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of very important points here, Ian. One, we did not transfer very much from the trading account over to the AFS account. I think that that is important. Secondly, about 78% relates to debt securities, and you look at debt securities very differently than you look at equity securities. We have the ability to hold those debt securities to maturity and that is an intention currently. So when you take a look at what we have unrealized &#x2013; net unrealized losses as at October 31, it is a relatively small number. It is under $300 million. So that &#x2013; while there is certainly is some risk depending on what happens with the economic environment that we could have other than temporary impairment charges. We do not expect them to be particularly difficult to take from an equity perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What proportion of those AFS securities have highly transparent markets and how many don't, can you talk to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, it's Brian Porter. Most of these securities would be high grade equities or bonds. There were a couple of equity securities in particular, that Luc was referring to, that between ourselves and the auditors thought that there was impairment.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mario Mendonca [Genuity Capital Markets].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. The multi-seller conduit, I want to see if I can understand what's going on there a little better. It sounds to me, Brian, that in the quarter the company changed &#x2013; altered the obligations somehow. Your press release reads the Bank will fund full par value of all assets including any defaulted assets. And it sounds like that was a change in the quarter. The first question I have is, what caused the Bank to change this?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is &#x2013; it seems like because of a note issued by the conduit to an unrelated third party -- that's redundant -- but the third, to this third party that the Bank is not responsible for any losses from the conduit. And I find that confusing given that a loss was taken on the CDOs that came from the conduit just this quarter. So could you address those two please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Mario. Just by way of background is that clearly, given widening of credit spreads and the impact of the turmoil in the marketplace, it had an impact on three CDOs which had face value of $250 million and to a lesser extent 80 million face value of CLOs in the portfolio. And they were put to us in the Bank. We recorded the loss. While we did that, we resized the expected loss note in the conduit, and then the conduit has been wrapped by Scotiabank as well. So that's the outcome of what we did in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My last question would directly be the -- can the Bank experience further losses on this conduit? And why was the conduit altered in the quarter -- or the liquidity provided?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you that what we've tried to do and what we're doing is high grading the assets in the portfolio. There is one amount &#x2013; it amounts to US770 million of a diverse asset backed securities, which are wrapped primarily and secondarily by the monolines, okay, Ambac or MBIA. The way it's structured now, if there is a downgrade, one or two or three downgrades, we'll be fine. If there's downgrades beyond that, we'd have to access the whole portfolios in terms of PDs, the impact it would have on the expected loss note, and we could possibly &#x2013; one of the two outcomes would be we'd bring the assets on balance sheet, or we'd resize the expected loss note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I'm not sure I understand what the expected loss note does if in fact the Bank took the losses on the CDOs this quarter? What does the expected loss note do for the Bank then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most of these conduits have &#x2013; well all these conduits have expected loss notes, and they're really -- they take the first loss if you will on any losses in the conduit. The impact of the mark-to-mark on the CDOs given widening of credit spreads happen to be larger than the expected loss notes. So we took the CDOs and CLOs out of the conduit and resized the expected loss note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so &#x2013; I'll just &#x2013; I'll leave this then, I just want to make sure I understand this. What does the expected loss note do for you on a go forward basis? If losses exceed a certain amount, does the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a first loss. It protects us from loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; but it didn't protect you from the CDO loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the CDO losses happen to be wider than &#x2013; in terms of credit spreads widening, happened to be longer &#x2013; bigger than the amount of the expected loss note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything you can tell us now about the expected loss note that would give us comfort that losses emerging from this point forward would be covered by the expected loss note, and not by BNS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think I have been pretty direct. I think that &#x2013; the risky asset in the conduit is this package of diversified asset-backed securities, wrapped primarily and secondarily by the monolines. If the monolines go through a significant downgrade, the result would be we either take the assets on balance sheet or we can go back and look at resizing the expected loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Question for maybe Luc or whomever. The increase in NII this quarter and the stability of the margin &#x2013; the NIM &#x2013; not necessarily in retail but just for the Bank as a whole, given what was happening with funding costs and I am excluding anything to do with trading here, I was surprised at the resilience of the margin. Is there anything that you can tell us that happened in the quarter that may have caused the margin to appear more resilient, or does this feel right that the margin can be this resilient going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me turn it over to Jeff initially to talk about the funding costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in the quarter our &#x2013; if you look at the sort of medium-term funding costs, while spreads have widened out, the curve has come down. So the all-in costs of medium term funding year-over-year really haven't changed that materially. So, that's from the cost side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the business side of it, as you know spreads have widened out on the credit spreads and of course that cost is short run on these mark-to-markets than that . But the repricing of our assets, especially in the commercial corporate books and indeed in the retail books is widening. Now that repricing is ongoing as we speak. I was frankly a little disappointed we didn't see as much in 2008 as I had expected, but of course customers are doing what they should do. They're resisting going and repricing their loans, whether it be big corps or small individuals, so that is taking more delay, but it will come. You just look at the spreads today and where they're going. So I think in terms of &#x2013; yes, the funding is little more volatile, but hopefully we're through the worse of that and then we can hopefully look forward to the repricing on the asset side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rick just for perfect clarity, the guidance &#x2013; the 7 to 12, is that on the reported number or the adjusted number?</p>

          <p>I think, Mario, one other point that I'd make that the margin at the All-Bank level &#x2013; it's Sabi &#x2013; is that the All-Bank margin is also supported by the growth in International. As you know, we've had pretty strong asset growth in International which comes in at a much higher margin overall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. The 9.3% Tier 1 ratio, I assume does not include the impact of the CI transaction yet. So, I guess pro forma that deal, we go to 8.8. How do you feel about a Tier 1 ratio under 9% in this environment? And I guess with the tangible common still at 7.3, is it fair to say that at this point to the extent you would be looking for more capital, it's likely on the preferred share side, not on the common equity side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just talk about -- of course as you know, in Europe, your 4% is your Tier 1 and regulatory Tier 1. And in the United States, if you're capitalized at 6% you're well capitalized. OSFI's prescribed rate, regulatory rate is 7%. And we have chosen as a Bank to keep the ratio, the Tier 1 ratio well above that, and it has been in the 9 to 10% area. Yes, there has been a lot of recapitalization by a lot of other banks to recapitalize based on asset deterioration. So, and we don't see that need to do that. So, we're well above the regulatory levels.</p>
          <p>As you mentioned, I think our tangible common, the quality of your Tier 1 is very, very important. I think we have the highest quality -- or one of the highest qualities of Tier 1 with 7.3. So, we're feeling -- and then we do have earnings growth that we're projecting. So we'll watch &#x2013; our second priority is to make sure we manage our capital, to make sure we can obviously meet &#x2013; well meet the prudential and meet the growth.</p>
          <p>So, these ratios are going to have to see what develops. And I wouldn't be careful of generalizing what's happening in Europe because they are coming from a very low base, even in the United States, we &#x2013; and it is not just us at Scotia, the Canadian banks have always maintained high quality. So 9, 10, or 8, we're going to retain flexibility, but always ensure we've got relative strength. So we'll leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can just follow up on Mario's question about the targets for 2009. I mean if we were to take out the items of note, I understand that you don't, but you get an EPS number of closer to $4. And I guess your guidance or your targets for 2008 (sic) [2009] are somewhat closer to 3.35 or 3.40. We're talking about a margin that's relatively stable. I mean is this all about loan losses and capital markets, or is there something else that is going to be a bigger headwind next year than we're seeing right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's &#x2013; we're going to prudently be optimistic and forecasting &#x2013; we think it is important to give guidance. We have usually given guidance in the 7 to 12 range. That's what we did last year, and I think the year before it was very similar to that. So this is not out of line as the normal targets we give. We believe in giving prudent and yet achievable and yet aggressive targets. I think it's a very prudent target in this environment. Hopefully we will overachieve, but that's the way we it see right now. And so it's very consistent to the growth rates that we have managed to, what I am telling management to manage to, and we'll see how this all develops. But it's important that we do produce sustainable revenue growth. The quality of the growth is very much important rather than going for home runs when you just want to get around the bases.</p>

          <p>Thanks. You mentioned that you've got out of equity prop trading during the year. I am not sure exactly when during the year. But let's suppose that you got out of all prop trading altogether in your business, and when we look at your trading revenue for 2007 and 2008 excluding prop trading, how much different would the numbers have been overall?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question was when we exited the proprietary equity business, and that was &#x2013; we commenced that in the first quarter of '08 and we ran off the positions throughout 2008. We are completely out of those positions now. As far as proprietary trading and the impact on Scotia Capital's results, we don't really have any pure proprietary trading businesses anymore. The one we did have was the equity business which we shut down last year. We made a bit of money in that in 2007, lost a bit of money in that &#x2013; 2008. What we do engage in though are trading activities around our client flows. The business is organized to be much more client focused, but even if you include these trading numbers, you would get a revenue number that was well below the 5% of total Scotia Capital revenues for both 2007 and 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I just want to go back to the issue of guidance, please. I understand you don't want to get into too much detail, but previous analysts suggest that earnings would have been $3.94 excluding writedowns. What takes that number to 3.35? I mean you talk about strong asset growth that will slow but was strong, a steady margin, you classified many items as items of notes on the assumption they don't recur. So, is it all credit that causes you to be cautious or is there more than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the world causes us to be cautious to start off with. Secondly, look &#x2013; the variables, the drivers, look at what the foreign exchange rate did from this time today to last &#x2013; this day last year or the prior previous quarter. We were talking 97-cent dollars last year or even in the third quarter, and what did we get in the &#x2013; $0.80, something like that?</p>

          <p>$0.83. So the volatility of exchange rates, the volatility of credit swaps. Where is this economic recession? We're not going to &#x2013; and we never have given you line by line guidance and we won't. Let me tell you this &#x2013; we are being very conservative, we think, in our loan loss forecasts, they are obviously going up. We are very confident in our risk management abilities and our ability to prudently manage this risk, but they are going up. There is a lot of volatility &#x2013; the ability to predict &#x2013; I have a lot of empathy for all you analysts who have to come up with a prediction, and I think some banks have even not given guidance and I understand how they may want to get that. However, we have sustainable revenue growth as our objective and we give broad guidance and we feel comfortable in those numbers. And I ...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Maybe just a quick one for Chris. Very strong growth in assets and deposits. Was there any change as the quarter went on, i.e., did things slow down later in the quarter or it looked the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andre, the short answer is no. We've almost had the same growth in both sides, as you know. We made a conscious effort to slow down our growth on the asset side over the last couple of years and that's been reflected in our mortgages where our market share has come off a little bit, but we've been very focused on the deposit side and as a result of that we've gained our deposit market share quite significantly. So we've actually been surprised that it hasn't slowed down, but we have factored that into our thinking for '09 is certainly more moderate growth in terms of the asset side. We are going to be very focused in gathering deposits and building that side of our business in '09, but at this point we haven't seen a significant slowdown.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks very much. This is a question for Chris. Just wondering &#x2013; looking at your charts with your market share, just wondering if we could just make sure that I understand exactly how these are reading. You're giving us year-over-year market share gains in the fourth quarter, they are lower than the year-over-years that you've provided in the third quarter. Am I right in interpreting that, Chris, as being deceleration in your market share gains? And if so, could you explain what some of the components contributing to that were? Is that intentional, was it the result of pricing in either the deposit or the mortgage business during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Brad, the answer is yes. I think that you're on the right track there. I mentioned a moment ago that we have consciously made a decision to be selective in our mortgage business and look at specific products. So we have seen a slowdown in market share and in fact we've lost a little bit of market share there, we've done that consciously.</p>
          <p>On the deposit side, it's a very, very competitive market and we've been quite active in dynamically pricing our product on that side and making sure that we're not giving it away from that perspective. So we've made a conscious decision on that front, and as a result of that while we have had good deposit share gains it has slowed down a bit, but we look at that on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>There is a few other things that we've actively done. We expanded our partnerships, which would be things like SCENE and Cineplex, we've had a number of new products that we brought out through &#x2013; called "Bank The Rest" and high interest savings accounts. And a long and short of it is that's -- it's a very competitive market out there from a deposit perspective, and we are going to pick the spots that we think we can get a good margin and we can get good assets, and we'll step back where we feel that it's just too aggressive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, it's Rick, just two added comments. I mean the mortgages was a definite strategy. We didn't want to go after the last 10%, and we feel very comfortable with that strategy. There is lots of ways of looking at it, but on the graph you've got on a quarter-over-quarter -- I know there is lots of ways of looking at it, but if you annualize the quarter-over-quarter and compare that to year-over-year, we're up in mutual funds, we're up in personal deposits, we are down in term deposits. That's another way of looking at it to show that we really maintain ourselves, and in some products, we're actually doing better, term deposits, we're not.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Darko Mihelic of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a bunch of little questions. So I hope we can get through this quick, I apologize for probably throwing three or four at you. The first question is can you remind me where you stand with Thanachart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With Thanachart Bank right now, the government has approved it. We will look at going forward with the 24.9%. We'll see what the situation in Thailand does with respect to the government and the ability to proceed with that, but at this point in time, we intend to go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a 24% increase. So we go from 24 to 49 increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would the impact -- would there be any impact on Tier 1 capital if you went ahead with that increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's minimal, Darko.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we have 47 basis points of impact let's say from CI, let's say minimal from Thanachart. I'm curious about what your expectations are for risk-weighted asset growth and what the dynamics are for that going forward? If you could help me with that, that would be very useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly the risk-weighted asset growth between Q3 and Q4 was higher than what we are expecting on a go-forward basis consistent with what we said about asset growth not on a risk-weighted basis. And as Rick mentioned, we manage capital very dynamically. So it all -- it's a question of how we fund these various acquisitions. As well, you can see that we have been active in raising sub debt and pref shares over the year, Darko.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a question for Brian. Where do you stand with the general reserve? Some of your competitors are taking general loan loss provisions. And when I take their general reserves as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and do it relative to you, I mean if I just took one of the banks, it looks like you &#x2013; to get to that level that they would have that you'd need a $400 million provision in general. So what would your comment be on that? Is there a prospect that maybe perhaps that's part of the issue going into 2009 that you'd have to increase your general reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll make a general comment at just where we are in the credit cycle generally, and then get to your question. It would be our view that we are in the third inning of the credit cycle. So 2009 is going to be a focus on credit, credit and credit. There is no mistake about that, and you've heard my comments about what we're managing, what we're concerned about and how we think we're better off this time versus the last downturn in the credit cycle. But in terms of coverage ratios, what we focus on here is if you look at specific allowances for credit losses as a percent of gross impaired, we're around 52.3%, somewhere around that. So, and  then loss given defaults historically for the Bank have been in the mid-40s, so you've got a cushion there. And if you add the generals on top of that, you're well through 100. So we think the cushion is more than adequate for where we are right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so generally speaking then, I'm hearing from you that risk-weighted asset growth will be dynamically managed, don't really need the general; impact on Tier 1 from acquisitions is, say, 50 basis points going forward. So unless there is a hiccup, you are comfortable bringing your Tier 1 capital ratio down to 8.5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Darko, if I could just comment on that, it's Sabi again. I don't think you should assume that we won't take any other action in raising capital. We have significant room we have left on the preferred share capacity or in our innovative capacity. We have lots of room. So, don't assume that we are not going to take action on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's exactly what I am getting at, Sabi, which is perfect. Thanks very much for interjecting there. I guess the point is that I guess you could say strongly to your shareholders today that it's not necessary nor would you want to do an equity issue, that you have lots of space to do other things to suck up maybe a 50 basis point hit over the course of the next quarter or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have lots of capacity in virtually every category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. And last question for Brian. It's been my recollection that when I look at Scotia, if we go back, usually the first quarter of every year during a credit cycle is when we get a big scrub down of the book and an increase in loan formations. And I am rather surprised to see just $6 million of formations at Scotia Capital. Can you tell us about your watch list, the scrub process, and the prospect of perhaps seeing an increase in formations in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Obviously you heard my earlier comments about credit quality in the Bank. Generally, we've seen some migration over the past couple of quarters. That's a function of SNCCs in the U.S., so some migrations downward of those SNCCs. There is two to three names that we're really concerned about that are in the sectors that we spoke about this earlier, automotive primarily. And anything that touches the house in the U.S. So look, the way things are tracking from where we see it today &#x2013; don't see a significant uptick, although we expect moderate increases across all the books, as I said and as Rick said. But don't expect a big surprise from where we sit in terms of formations in Q1 in Scotia Capital.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, for Rob Pitfield. If I go back just over a year to the Investor Day in Peru when you talked about some of the objectives for International Banking over the next five years. One of the ones we heard most about, as I recall, was consumer finance, the success that you'd had in Peru and Chile and looking to bring that over to Mexico. Now clearly we get a lot more color today on what's happening in the retail book in International. When you think about your comments on, and I don't want to misquote you here, was it prudent growth for 2009? I mean, aren't there a lot of areas in the retail book that may have been looked at for driving the growth going forward that perhaps the Bank has decided to pull back given the economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with respect to consumer finance, Sumit, you're absolutely right. We will be very circumspect with that portfolio. It's not -- as you know from Peru, it's a very small part of our overall portfolio, and we will grow it very slowly, very circumspectly and we've taken a lot of action to tighten up on that market already. But as you know from being there in Peru, there's lots of other ways that we were going to grow our revenues such as ancillary revenues, such as focus on segmentation, on wealth management, on insurance and we'll continue to do that. So what we'll do, faced with that &#x2013; faced with a potentially slow growth environment, we're focusing on non-interest revenues. We're focusing on our margins which &#x2013; that was brought up earlier in the questions. We'll focus on our expense management, we'll focus on PCL management, and we'll focus on these ancillary segments. So there is lots that we can do besides just consumer finance. We'll continue in that market, but it will be very circumspect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on Peru, because I just got back eight or nine days ago down there. And it's a very important part of our Bank. It's the third largest bank down there and we did go through those portfolios quite extensively. Real growth in Peru next year, regardless of where these copper prices and whatever, is probably going be 6 to 7% based upon internal domestic consumption and based on the demographics. So the retail, and this will include that consumer finance which is very unique to the Peruvian market although there are other markets which get into that, is -- and very profitable spreads -- is one that we're going to have make sure, especially on the sales force, we tighten up. But with that 7% growth in Peru plus or minus, it's quite a different view than United States and Canada. And I think that's &#x2013; and there are some other countries with that same maybe not quite as dramatic growth rate but still positive growth rate. So we've got to keep a balanced approach and expect some widening of losses, but again the spreads are wide and the growth is reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, as Rick said, Rob again. I just want to mention that the spreads are very attractive in this business even after PCL. So it's just something &#x2013; the overall business is a good business, if well managed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more for you, Rick, and I'll wrap it up there. Your comments on the fact that the Canadian banks don't need any kind of capital injection and certainly the banks have held up better than their global peers. That being said, in a world where Citigroup's got a 14.5% Tier 1 heavily aided by Uncle Sam, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to think that a little bit of extra capital and if the taxpayers can make money on it, if the banks will benefit from that position is bad for anybody. Your comments on government aid or stability on that front &#x2013; what exactly would you be looking for here? And why would, in your view, it'd be such a bad thing for a little bit of a capital top-up for all the Canadian banks or financial institutions given that in the last two weeks, there's probably a couple of guys who have come to market that didn't think they would?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think government capital comes cheaply, quite frankly. I think the government capital &#x2013; and some of them were given into it whether they wanted it or not, and I do know as a fact some of them did not want it. It was given to them at attractive rates and that looks in the short run very good and they were instructed and many of them have to go ahead and use that, but I just think politically that, it's a big word for me, that the &#x2013; it comes with a true cost. And we've had a lot of experience over many decades in emerging markets, we've gone through this.</p>
          <p>It's kind of ironic that what the United States is going through, a lot of these emerging countries went through 10, 20 years ago and when government starts to inject capital, I think it's na&#xEF;ve because we are all regulated that it doesn't come with a significant cost. And also puts pressure on you to refinance that as quickly as possible, and as the levels are very high, of course they were mandated to do things with them. And some of them have to use it because of what they knew was coming in terms of future mark-to-markets, because we're still in this awful mark-to-market world, and so some of it was more of a recapitalization rather than getting excess capital.</p>

          <p>Your next question is a follow-up from Ian De Verteuil of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Rick, I want to totally endorse your view that I think people think money from the government is free or cheap, but I think they are wrong. There is a cost to that and we may not see it in the coupon, but we will see it. I guess, though, having said that, the capital that you have currently, the 9.3 Tier 1 and 7.3 tangible common, I mean it shouldn't be lost on us though that you've picked up 100 basis points of Tier 1 just from the shift from B1 to B2. And it seems as if most of the world is actually almost moving away from B2 here towards sort of more transparent metrics. So I guess I am surprised you have allowed the risk-weighteds to continue to rise as significantly as they have here. And what else can you do to get risk-weighteds down? Because I am not sure I agree with Sabi that the preferred market is going to be there in one week, two weeks, six weeks, I don't know. So what can you do to get the risk-weighted down meaningfully at Scotiabank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, two things. And just on the B1/B2, look at our leverage ratio, the nominal ratio. Look at our ratio versus our competitors around the world. We're in very good shape on our leverage ratio, when you look at some of the European banks and the American banks. So that -- no that's not risk based, that's nominal and it's real.</p>
          <p>What you can do in risk-based, I'm not saying we are doing this principally for one reason. I think our ratios are very acceptable and that's &#x2013; our ratios are very acceptable because we have rule on our risk base. And that has been a voluntary strategy to lend where we thought the risk was prudent and the spreads were wide. And that's how we are going to measure it going forward. And we can pull that back pretty quickly because first of all, most of our &#x2013; and I don't want to sell-off good assets at all, but we have good assets. So the flexibility or the quality of capital, the quality of your capital is the quality of your assets, plus the makeup of your mix. And, and we have to, I know I am sounding like a broken record, we're diversified in so many different countries and what have you. There is a lot of levers to pull.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, we are not going to compromise the level of our capital. I remember the challenges three years ago from certain camps that we had excess capital. We went into this crisis 14, 15 months ago, I think with probably around 10%. We were at 9.8 in the third quarter and we're 9.3 now, and that's despite growing our assets in double-digits. And so we can pull back lending if we desire and we're certainly been very much prudent and in fact we're there.</p>
          <p>I mentioned our market share and mortgages. We made that decision several months ago that we weren't going to chase. We were leading in mortgages for most of '06, '07 and probably the first part of '08, I'd have to check my numbers on that one, but I'm pretty sure we were leading in market share. This was before all this stuff. We chose not to chase it and, so yeah, we gave up market share and our assets there are going down.</p>
          <p>So, long answer. Because it's &#x2013; we call it dynamic capital management for a reason. And then again just to the point on quantity, with &#x2013; the government did give us that 30 to 40% and you got to have a market there, I agree with you. We have almost 5 billion of capacity on that, because we haven't used them as much as we could have. We have that opportunity. We have the hybrids, stuff in that market. Don't like the price on any of this stuff, so we'll have to watch that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What was the other 60% increase in the RWAs, Luc, except for working forex? Was it intrinsic growth or was it migration within the PDs and the risk weightings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the 25, about two-thirds of that was on balance sheet. We had some growth in the off-balance sheet, some increase in market risk because of what is happening, operational risk as well. And then of course there is always the scaling factor, but the largest single factor was the FX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm trying to get at is how much is the PD migration as opposed to the actual volume growth it's held for? And when I say volume growth, I know foreign exchange is a big part of the volume growth. I don't know if it's clear what I am trying to get at. Is there any part of the issue on B2 is the procyclicality of the model. Can you talk to, was that a factor at all in the growth in RWAs?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know what you are getting at, Ian. You're thinking we're putting a lot of assets on the books to try to grow our way out of the &#x2013; in this type of market. And if you look at Scotia Capital, the growth has been extremely moderate. We've seen growth in assets in International and to a certain extent in the domestic business as well. There was an increase charge for market risk capital, as Luc said, and that's a function of credit spreads and currency et cetera. But look, as Rick said, we're moderating in some businesses, we're not interested in putting assets on, and we're being prudent as we should in this point in the cycle.</p>
