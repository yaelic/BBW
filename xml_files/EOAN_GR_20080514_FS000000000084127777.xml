          <p>Thank you, Mia. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. [Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining us on our conference call on the first quarter results 2008. For your convenience, we have provided detailed information on the first quarter results through charts provided to you a few hours ago. This information is also available on the Internet in case someone has not seen it.</p>
          <p>On the call, as usual, we have Wulf Bernotat, CEO; and Marcus Schenck, CFO. In addition, we are delighted to have Jonas Abrahamsson, Chief Financial Officer of E.ON Energy Trading. Jonas has been with E.ON Group since 17 years and has been instrumental in developing successful hedging strategy at E.ON Nordic since he became Board Member responsible for trading in 2002. Jonas brings with him more than 10 years experience in trading.</p>
          <p>With this remark, I hand over to Wulf.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Kiran and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on this conference call on our first quarter 2008 results. With adjusted EBIT almost flat, this is maybe not the strongest quarter in E.ON's history, however, underlying trends are clearly positive and the outlook for the full year remains unchanged. We expect adjusted EBIT to grow by 5 to 10% and adjusted net income by 3 to 5%. While Marcus Schenck will present our results and outlook in further detail, I would like during today's call to touch on the following three topics.</p>
          <p>First, I will update you on the progress of the remedies proposed to European Commission. Second, I will discuss the current status of our acquisition of selected Endesa assets and Viesgo; and the asset swap with Statkraft; and third, I would like to explain our strategy regarding nuclear energy.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the status of the structural remedies that we have proposed to the European Commission. We finalized this week the package of assets that we will propose to divest and will shortly hand it over to the EU Commission. As already announced, we proposed to sell 4.8 gigawatts out of 25.6 gigawatt of capacity in Germany. The package that we have put together is broadly representative of E.ON's overall generation portfolio and breaks down as follows.</p>
          <p>1,500 megawatts nuclear, 580 megawatts lignite, around 1.8 megawatts coal, and 270 megawatts gas, and 660 megawatts hydropower. You will find a full list of the power plants concerned in the back up charts.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will divest the 380 and 220 kilovolt transmission network of our subsidiary E.ON Netz. At this stage, we have not determined how exactly these assets will be divested. But as far as generation capacity is concerned, we will favor asset swaps whenever possible.</p>
          <p>With regard to the timing, the EU Commission first has to conduct a market test. This is a standard procedure, which is also used when assessing remedies in the context of M&amp;A transactions. Thereafter the Commission will have to consult the member states. Only then will the Commission be able to reach a final decision and will the proposed structural remedies become legally binding.</p>
          <p>All in all, we assume that the EU Commission will reach a final decision somewhere around October this year. We will then have two years to divest the transmission network and six months with a possible extension of another six months to divest the generation assets.</p>
          <p>Let me now update you on the two M&amp;A transactions, which are still pending. It is only a few weeks ago that we had a conference call with you to discuss the outcome of the valuation process related to Viesgo and the Endesa assets. We expect that the EU Commission and the Spanish Ministry of Industry will approve the transaction before the end of this quarter, the Share Purchase Agreements should also be finalized in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>Also investment banks are now finalizing the valuation of the 450-megawatt nuclear drawing right agreement. We expect the transaction to close during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The Statkraft asset swap is also on track. We have agreed to a slight change to the assets that we swapped in Germany. Instead of E.ON's stake in the Veltheim gas-fired power plant, Statkraft will receive the Robert Franck 4 plant. We expect the transaction to close towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss our strategy for nuclear energy as I have received a lot of questions lately to this topic. Across our whole portfolio, nuclear power makes up 18% of E.ON's total generation capacity and 30% of its generation output. Although our nuclear capacity will remain broadly stable until 2015, it will decline in relative terms due to the growth of other technologies.</p>
          <p>Moving further towards 2030, we want to achieve a portfolio mix consisting of 50% low carbon generation gas together with coal, possibly fitted with carbon capture and storage; and 50% carbon-free generation.</p>
          <p>The carbon-free part comprises hydro-electricity, renewables, and nuclear energy. Most countries have already largely used up their hydro-electric potential. Few opportunities for growth are left in this area. Renewable energy will certainly continue to see a very strong growth, but still has limitations in terms of availability. Nuclear power therefore remains one of the preferred options for base load generation; carbon-free, reliable, and competitive. Of course the most sensible way to keep a high share of nuclear energy is to run the existing fleet for as long as possible.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., some nuclear power plants have received the permission to operate for up to 70 years. In Sweden, not only have the premature shutdowns been halted, but the lifetimes of some nuclear power plants have been extended to 60 years. Belgium is about to remove the 40-year limit for its existing power plants. With its phase-out after 32 years, Germany is increasingly isolated and even criticized internationally. No one should be surprised. The nuclear phase-out will reduce security of supply, increase carbon emissions, and certainly not dampen electricity prices.</p>
          <p>We will continue to try to convince the German public and politicians to drop the nuclear phase-out. We feel that the debate is moving in our direction, but we do not expect anything to happen before next the federal elections in September 2009. However, running the existing fleet for longer will not be enough. Nuclear new builds are also needed.</p>
          <p>Finland has already opted for the construction of a new nuclear station to cover part of its demand growth. Many countries in Eastern Europe see nuclear energy as a key component of a balanced generation mix. And in the U.K., the government now supports nuclear new-builds to replace the nuclear capacity that will largely have to be shut down by 2020.</p>
          <p>We are convinced that E.ON is well positioned to play a substantial role in this nuclear renaissance. We see three major criteria for success: access to cutting edge technology; access to top-level operational skills; and access to adequate sites.</p>
          <p>We have recently selected AREVA and Siemens as partners for nuclear power projects. The agreement envisages cooperation on the construction of nuclear power stations in the U.K. on the basis of AREVA's 1600 megawatt advanced pressurized water reactor with a conventional island from Siemens. We also agreed to collaborate on further developing AREVA's boiling water reactor with an intermediate capacity of 1250 megawatts for use in other countries.</p>
          <p>Both types of reactors are the latest development in nuclear technology and offer maximum safety. The agreement also secures access to components in due time.</p>
          <p>With 9 plants operated by E.ON, and stakes in a further 12 plants, we obviously have extensive experience in running nuclear power plants. The high availability of our plants strongly demonstrates the level of our operational skills.</p>
          <p>Undoubtedly, the hardest nut to crack for new-builds is finding suitable sites. A suitable site is much more than a simple piece of land. There are technical requirements such as strong connections to the grid and sufficient availability of cooling water. But most important is support from local and national citizens and politicians. Many countries are well aware of the issue. We believe that over time a sufficient number of sites will become available.</p>
          <p>We are actively pursuing a project in Finland, and are also interested in building new nuclear power plants in the U.K. and in Eastern Europe. We are everywhere at the early stages of the process. Also, we should keep in mind that the construction of a single 1600 megawatt nuclear power plant represents an investment of up to &#x20AC;5 billion. Even for the largest players, this is a very large amount of money.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now conclude my remarks.</p>
          <p>We are well on our way to finalize two major M&amp;A transactions, the acquisition of Viesgo and of selected Endesa assets as well as the Statkraft asset swap. During 2008, we are thus focusing on optimizing the group structure and on integration of the acquired assets. Meanwhile, we continue to roll out our ambitious investment plan.</p>
          <p>In the second half of this year, we will commission the Livorno Ferraris CCGT [Combined Cycle Gas Turbine] for example. And with our nuclear strategy, we are already preparing the organic investments of the next decade.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I will remain on the call to answer your questions later on. Marcus Schenck will now present our First Quarter results and the outlook. So, over to you Marcus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Wulf. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.</p>
          <p>As you have already received our first quarter results 2008 earlier today, I will only refer to the main developments. The highlights for the first quarter's performance were: Group sales increased by 8% to about &#x20AC;23 billion; group adjusted EBIT remained almost flat at &#x20AC;3.3 billion; group adjusted net income decreased by 7% to &#x20AC;1.8 billion; and group cash provided by operating activities increased by 8% to now &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Before I explain the main developments of the first quarter results, I would like to refer to the changes in our group structure and give you a brief insight into our new market unit Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of 2008, we have added the two new geographical market units Russia and Italy to our already existing market units. A third one, namely Spain, will follow in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we also created two new functional market units, which are: First, Climates &amp; Renewables, comprising our worldwide renewables activities and climate projects with the exception of hydropower; and then second, Energy Trading where we are bundling all our group-wide trading activities in power, gas, coal, oil and CO2 certificates.</p>
          <p>As shown on chart 2, starting this year, all trading, renewables and Italian activities that have so far been part of the traditional market units in 2007 were transferred to those new market units.</p>
          <p>In 2008, Energy Trading is the only new market unit which will be shown as a segment. For materiality reasons the other new units will at this stage still be reported within Corporate Center/New Markets. As a consequence, this year's figures are not fully comparable on a market unit level with last year's figures.</p>
          <p>Let me now briefly explain our E.ON Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>As you remember, we announced on our Analysts and Investors Conference on May 31st last year that we would bundle the already existing group-wide trading activities under one new market unit. With this measure, we target an additional value up to &#x20AC;400 million from all our trading activities by 2010.</p>
          <p>Since January 1, 2008 E.ON Energy Trading has been established in D&#xFC;sseldorf and the migration of existing activities across Europe is underway.</p>
          <p>I would like to emphasize that the reorganization of our trading activities has no impact so far on our general hedging strategy. As before, any changes to the hedging strategy are decided in conjunction with the Corporate Center and are reviewed on a periodical basis.</p>
          <p>What has changed is the assignment of internal responsibilities as shown on chart four. The entire commodity price risk for the hedged positions as well as the open positions within 3 years, which is current year and the following two years &#x2013; are now transferred to Energy Trading. The only risk which remains at the respective market units is the asset availability, for example the reliability of the power plants.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, responsibility for risks related to asset investments and long term commodity price risk management as part of long term contracts beyond the three year period still remains with the respective market units as was the case before. Because the short term commodity price risk is transferred to Energy Trading from the market units via an internal transfer pricing mechanism, all EBIT volatility as a result of changes in commodity prices is now transparent within Energy Trading and no longer included within the other market units. In short, the overall impact on the group's adjusted EBIT remains the same.</p>
          <p>On chart 5 we show with an example how the commodity risk is transferred from the market units to Energy Trading. The transfer price is basically determined on a yearly average generation price based on expected price curves and volumes. These price curves are calibrated to observable market developments. Once the transfer is done, Energy Trading takes the whole commodity risk within the next three years. Energy Trading therefore centralizes the vast majority of the group's commodity price risk. This enables Energy Trading to develop an optimized risk/reward strategy for the E.ON European commodity portfolio. I would like to stress that this clearly improves the transparency we have on the group's risk position and it has already allowed us to actually tighten some of the risk limits we had allocated before, in particular as it relates to proprietary trading.</p>
          <p>Chart 6 evidences the seasonality effects within a year and shows how the imbalances between the internal transfers and sales into the wholesale market affect the Energy Trading's adjusted EBIT.  E.ON Energy Trading compensates via the transfer pricing mechanism the other market units on the basis of calculated hourly prices for power. In the winter months, these purchases as well as other purchases from the wholesale market are typically higher than in the summer months. On the other hand forward hedging contracts are typically full year contracts at one flat price. This squeezes Energy Trading's margins in the first and last months of the year, while we see an offsetting increase in earnings during the second and third quarter. This explains the loss of 80 million Euros shown by Energy Trading in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In the past, these seasonality effects were only seen internally within the respective market units. However these effects are now visible externally. I would like to point out that during the course of the year these mismatches should balance out.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we have already begun to work on implementing changes that will release future additional value and synergies brought about by the creation of our new unit Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>Let me now come back to the first quarter results. Group adjusted EBIT reported a slight decline by &#x20AC;36 million to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. The main developments by market unit were as follows:</p>
          <p>Central Europe's adjusted EBIT increased by 12% to 1.6 billion Euros. At this point, I would like to emphasize that for further transparency in Central Europe West we now disclose by non-regulated and regulated business as we had promised last year.</p>
          <p>Whilst the non-regulated business includes the power generation and power and gas sales activities, the regulated business comprises power transmission, as well as power and gas distribution networks. Central Europe West non-regulated was the major contributor with an improvement of about 9%. The main items were the following: Positive power transfer price effects of &#x20AC;281 million, of which only about &#x20AC;80 million are effective at group level; the transfer of activities to the new market units Energy Trading, Climate &amp; Renewables; and Italy had a positive net effect of &#x20AC;127 million.</p>
          <p>These effects were partially compensated by the burden from the continuing outages of the jointly-owned nuclear power plants Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel totaling &#x20AC;116 million, and higher fuel and power procurement costs of &#x20AC;89 million.</p>
          <p>Further positive contributions to Central Europe's adjusted EBIT came from Central Europe West regulated, due to the higher contribution from the gas business as a result of colder weather conditions compared to last year contributing with &#x20AC;10 million, and also from Central Europe East, related to higher power gross margins in Hungary mainly due to higher electricity prices and positive regulatory effects amounting to 44 million Euros.</p>
          <p>Pan-European Gas adjusted EBIT decreased by 10% on a year-to-year basis to &#x20AC;1.0 billion. The main reasons for this decline were the following: The downstream business was adversely affected by the absence of book gains from the divestments of Th&#xFC;ga participations in 2007 of &#x20AC;55 million. Another adverse effect was the transfer of the Th&#xFC;ga Italy Group to the new market unit Italy this year amounting to &#x20AC;23 million.</p>
          <p>The midstream business was affected by the unfavorable gas procurement cost developments due to the correlation with still increasing oil prices. Any pass-through into the downstream market will come with a time delay given how the purchase and sales contracts are structured. In addition, intense market competition led to negative price effects. These together had a negative impact of &#x20AC;130 million.</p>
          <p>Those effects were mitigated by firstly, &#x20AC;63 million higher contributions from the expansion of oil and gas production in the upstream segment; and secondly, &#x20AC;24 million contribution from the favorable storage valuation due to lower average gas prices for storage withdrawal compared to higher gas procurement prices in the midstream business.</p>
          <p>The adjusted EBIT of the market unit U.K. decreased by 38% to &#x20AC;269 million. The decline, which is related to the non-regulated business, is caused by lower retail power and gas margins compared to the exceptionally high first quarter of 2007 margins. This causes a decline by &#x20AC;139 million. In this context, we would like to remind you that our recently announced prices have not been effective for the full quarter. Hence, this effect should be mitigated over the rest of the year after the price increase of 15% for gas and 9.7% for power effective as of February 8 , 2008 driven by a sharp rise in energy wholesale costs.</p>
          <p>Wholesale costs have gone up by 60% for gas and 88% for electricity since February 2007, when E.ON announced the lowering of prices for its residential customers.</p>
          <p>Another negative impact was the appreciation of the Euro against British Pound amounting to &#x20AC;18 million.</p>
          <p>The transfer of activities to the new market units Energy Trading and Climate &amp; Renewables had a positive net effect of &#x20AC;21 million. Nordic's adjusted EBIT increased by 23% to 353 million. The main contribution came from non-regulated business due to increased market-based transfer prices for generation volumes.</p>
          <p>The adjusted EBIT of U.S. Midwest increased by 5% to &#x20AC;98 million. This increase is attributable to higher retail power and gas margins due to the timing of fuel and gas cost recoveries from customers, and this is partially offset by the stronger euro.</p>
          <p>The new market unit Energy Trading reported a loss of &#x20AC;80 million. As I explained earlier, this was fully in line with our expectations and primarily due to the seasonal earnings development.</p>
          <p>Now I will refer to the net income attributable to shareholders of E.ON AG, which decreased by 32% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. These are the main changes: Adjusted net interest income declined by &#x20AC;100 million reflecting the increase in financial indebtedness of the group, resulting from the share buyback and implementation of the investment programs. Net book gains decreased from &#x20AC;885 million to &#x20AC;294 million mainly due to the higher divestments of securities at Central Europe in the first quarter of 2007. Other non-operating income showed a significant decline from &#x20AC;471 million to &#x20AC;33 million. The main effect was caused by the lower result of the positive mark-to-market valuation of derivatives of 433 million euros as of March of last year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income decreased by 7% to &#x20AC;1.8 billion due to the lower net interest income. However, our extensive investment pipeline will improve earnings over time.</p>
          <p>Now, I will refer to the development of group cash flow. The cash flow provided by operating activities reported an increase by 8% to 2.6 billion euros. The main developments on a market unit level are in several cases of limited comparability but can be summarized as follows: Central Europe's rise by 1.4 billion euros to 1.9 billion euros was mainly attributable to outstanding payments to E.ON Energy Trading of 1.1 billion Euros. Hence, this is just an internal effect. Improved working capital and higher power margins, however, also contributed positively. These factors were partially offset by the outages of the nuclear power plants.</p>
          <p>Pan-European Gas decreased significantly by &#x20AC;619 million to 1.2 billion Euros, which was mainly related to lower withdrawals from gas storage and higher internal tax allocations.</p>
          <p>U.K. increased by &#x20AC;353 million to 384 million mainly due to improvements in debtor days in the retail business by 175 million euros and seasonal effects from commodity purchasing contributed with &#x20AC;186 million.</p>
          <p>Energy Trading showed a negative cash flow of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. The reason is a temporary effect related to internal payments from the other market units, mainly Central Europe as I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Our investments increased by 72% to &#x20AC;2.0 billion, mainly due to higher investments in power generation across the group. The total share investments amounted to &#x20AC;445 million.</p>
          <p>Our economic net debt slightly improved in the first quarter of 2008 by &#x20AC;410 million to &#x20AC;23.7 billion; investments of &#x20AC;2.1 billion and share buybacks of &#x20AC;0.7 billion were slightly overcompensated by the cash provided from operating activities of &#x20AC;2.6 billion and changes in pension provisions of 600 million.  This change in provisions resulted from a lower valuation of the benefit obligations as a consequence from an increase of the discount rates in Germany from 5.5 to 6% and in U.K. from 5.8 to 6.7%.</p>
          <p>Given our significant investments in organic growth as well as the acquisition of Enel and Acciona participations, the economic net debt will clearly increase until the end of the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now discuss the outlook for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned on our last conference call, our outlook for this year remains unchanged. We continue to expect group adjusted EBIT to be 5 to 10% higher than in 2007. The consolidation of Enel and Acciona participations, operational improvements from the power business, and ongoing implementation of efficiency measures will lead to this expected increase.</p>
          <p>At this point I would also like to remark that our target to achieve an adjusted EBIT of &#x20AC;12.4 billion in 2010 remains intact.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008, we expect the adjusted net income to be slightly i.e. 3 to 5% above the 2007 level: Higher operating results will be partially compensated by higher interest expenses.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this point let me update you also on our share buyback program which we announced May 31st last year. Up until now, we have bought back 36 million shares worth approximately &#x20AC;4.5 billion of which 25 million shares have already been cancelled. In addition, we have sold put options on 13.5 million of our own shares. The exercise price is between 108 and 117 euro per share.</p>
          <p>We would like to remind you that we will have bought back an equivalent of additional &#x20AC;3.5 billion in 2008 completing our &#x20AC;7 billion, 2008. These additional bought-back shares will also be cancelled.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to give you an update on our funding program which we started last autumn. After we had already issued an equivalent of nearly &#x20AC;6 billion by the end of 2007, we successfully pursued our funding program in 2008. We placed to date an additional total amount of nearly &#x20AC;6.5 billion of bonds and promissory notes in the international capital markets, raising the overall volume we issued since October last year to approximately &#x20AC;12.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition, our financing activities are complemented by an increase in our commercial paper usage. Two prominent transactions that were both carried out in April 2008 were our debut transaction in the U.S. debt capital markets with an overall amount of US$3 billion as well as the launch of another Euro. Benchmark bond which had a total volume of &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Throughout our funding program, we received a high demand for our bonds and promissory notes, which demonstrates that we are seen as an attractive and reliable issuer amongst investors. This concludes my remarks, Wulf, Marcus and I are now ready to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now starting the Question-and-Answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is Martin Young [Lehman Brothers] .</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to all.  The two questions; the first relates to your <mark type="inaudible" /> power prices, obviously, they have risen quite remarkably in Germany during the past couple of weeks. If I recall back to the time of the full-year results and you indicated at that stage, you haven't yet updated your power price expectations and fed that through to your guidance. Wondered if you could just provide us with the latest state of affairs there?</p>
          <p>And then the second question relates to Russia. I know from the reports that the revenue earned in Russia in the first quarter of the year was round about &#x20AC;250 million, yet the operating income was negative to the tune &#x20AC;9 million. Wondered if you could shed some lights on what exactly that is &#x2013; high costs, high depreciation, etc.? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay, Marcus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Russia first, the negative 9 million in Q1 of this year is mainly &#x2013; when you look at the results, is mainly caused by one, the outage of one block in Zugertkayah] which has an effect of around 15 million. And then, secondly, when you compare it with the standalone numbers of OCK 4 , they are also in mind that they are effects from purchase price allocation that feeds through into our accounts. And here this is another around &#x20AC;25 million.</p>
          <p>And then as it relates to power price assumptions, we are obviously not going to provide our long-term power price assumptions, we have never done that. I would like to basically reiterate what we said on March 6, which is that we continue to target a 12.4 billion EBIT in 2010, that obviously there are things moving, which is on the one hand, power prices which have gone up. But there are also other effects which we indicated. Which is, for example, a net favorable outlook in some of the German regulated businesses.</p>
          <p>And all those --  Putting all these effects together, we at this stage would not want to change our 12.4 target; we are still targeting for that. People should also bear in mind and when they talk about power prices, they always talk about wholesale power prices. And people should also bear in mind that we are also in the retail business.</p>
          <p>And then as we also mentioned in the March call, in particular in our Ruhrgas business, we increasingly see pressure on margins. And, again, when you put all these effects together, we continue to consider 12.4 as a decent target for the Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's one additional remark from me. During a recent road show we were often asked the same question, I mean, how does &#x2013; how do higher power prices translate into EBIT and therefore ultimately for into share price? And I think it's a too simplistic view of our business. We are also strongly involved in the gas industry and the gas industry has a different logic than the power market.</p>
          <p>Their temperature developments are far more important than those trends and we have seen a relatively weak winter, at least in the first two months of this year. And that should be taken into account. Plus, that what Marcus mentioned, we are also seeing now foreign exchange developments are hitting us more than ever before, the euro versus the dollar, pound sterling and Swedish krona. That has a sort of more significant impact now than previously.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I was hoping actually just to follow up on a couple of those points. First of all, if you could help us understand what you're expecting the impact of grid regulation to be in 2008 in Germany, how that is incorporated in your outlook for the year?</p>
          <p>But if you could also just clarify, Marcus, the statement you just made about &#x2013; we're looking at wholesale prices but we need look at retail prices. What exactly do you mean? Are you talking about the grid impact or are you saying that you don't expect retail prices to reflect the underlying wholesale price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the second question first. What I'm indicating here is that there can either be a time delay when you see wholesale prices feed through into retail prices, but there can also be a situation where you'll see a wholesale prices simply eat into retail margin. That will very much depend on what the competitive position is going to look like in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Hence, some of the analysis that we are obviously seeing in the market, which simply takes our nuclear position and then multiplies it with the wholesale power price a year back and now the forward price, and then you see what is the expected increase in EBIT. That is too simplistic.</p>
          <p>You need to pass, you need to be able to, or the market needs to be able to, pass this through to end customers. And, again, obviously, this is only in effect which we have on hydro and nuclear. Our gas and coal. as you know, are in the 'spot' businesses where an increase in the wholesale price not necessarily means an improvement in profitability, it will then depend on where clean, dark and spark spreads are.</p>
          <p>As far as the grid regulation is concerned, our outlook fully reflects the tariffs which have now, partially in writing, partially orally, been confirmed and agreed with <mark type="inaudible" />, our regulator. This is fully reflected. It goes without saying that the outcome of that is slightly negative and it causes roughly a 5% decline over last year's tariffs, or against last year's tariffs. But this is fully reflected in what we have said on outlook.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. And just two questions, both related to power prices. One is, could you perhaps explain the number you gave on page eight in Dr. Schenck's presentation? The positive power transfer price effect of 281, I didn't quite understand that.  Is this equivalent to the higher gross margin you stated in the past with full-year results?</p>
          <p>And you also, I believe, made a reference to only 80 million of this being effective at a Group level or perhaps to just make things a lot more simple maybe just give us the average achieved power price in Q1? That would preferably be the case.</p>
          <p>The same question is, the off peak dark spread for Q3, Q4, and also the calendar '09 in Germany are still negative. So despite all the rise in power prices we have seen, they are still negative. I just wonder if you have an explanation for that &#x2013; why that might be the case and what could possibly change that given that it is probably not sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Lueder.  All right, Marcus?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I admit that understanding sort of those detailed effects, which we have put out on page 8 is maybe not so simple. Which is why we were trying to indicate that sort of at the Group frontier, the overall impact on our Central Europe generation position is around &#x20AC;80 million.</p>
          <p>The 280 that you see there is really the internal transfer pricing mechanism and, as you can tell from this, I think it's chart six, showed as a U-shape form. There you can see, basically, that the prices at which the generation is being transferred to E.ON Energy Trading is higher in Q1 than the average price that E.ON Energy Trading realizes in the &#x2013; through the outside world.</p>
          <p>The price realized to the outside world in the first quarter on our economic generation, which is those plants that we control and not simply operate on behalf of others, is around &#x20AC;66.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions from me. First of all, just trying to understand the profitability that we can expect to see from the trading division going forwards. Are you suggesting that the -- all other things being equal, the asset optimization bits of the profit should basically level out at zero for the full year. Then how does the &#x2013; how should we expect the sort of &#x20AC;400 million operation improvement speed through &#x2013; are you basically saying that by 2010?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Trading will be reporting possible &#x20AC;100 million? That is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's like two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second one? Second <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question I had was does the higher fuel and power procurement costs number of minus 89 million, does that they include increased CO2 permit acquisition costs as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay the second one is easy, yes it does.</p>
          <p>On the first one, for 2008, we actually do expect Energy Trading to deliver positive &#x2013; to contribute positively to Group EBIT in the full year, and it is not meant to be a breakeven business. And then secondly, the up to 400 million is the improvement in our &#x2013; from our asset optimization that we expect compared to the year 2006, please bear in mind we put out this target in May of last year, and we were basically benchmarking everything against the 2006 result. That will obviously be tough for you to track that, I confess that &#x2013; though when you think of that as a proxy for what E.ON Energy Trading &#x2013; where they might be at the end of the decade, that is not entirely incorrect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi guys. A couple of questions. Firstly, you've maintained your guidance, can you just confirm that you still have the general concept saying the later the deal with Endesa and Enel closes the closer you are to 5%, and the earlier it closes, the closer you are to 10%.  If of course the sensitivity is possible that would be ideal.</p>
          <p>And secondly you don't seem to have done very much forward contacting by the end of March versus the end of December, in fact no extra contracting in 2010 for Central Europe, and none for 2009 in the Nordic and UK markets. Is there a buyer's strike or have you changed your policy there? Has there been any changes in the recent weeks in your overall contracted positions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're saying, Chris, on 2010 any contracts we have done or so, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right. I mean if you look at the chart 23 compared to previous ones, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the second one maybe first. You will not see the exact hedge volumes on this chart &#x2013; you are referring to page 23, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...of the document, which not necessary changes dramatically within any given quarter, because we might within the band that we are showing we might change from the left to right end of the band. So, basically it's fair to assume that there has been continued hedging of volume for 2009 and 2010. And as I was trying to explain in wrapping my remarks, there is no change to our hedging strategy that we have implemented. We feel way better equipped now to review this strategy regularly because we really have all the information in one place. But at this stage we have decided to not change our strategy going forwards.</p>
          <p>As far as your first question is concerned the 2008 guidance the principle remains intact, i.e., the earlier we can close, the closer we are or the higher we are in the 5 to 10% range and the later we close, the lower we are. Now I'm a little bit hesitant to do this on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The one thing I would like to highlight is that &#x2013; but again it's really a technical effect that's the likelihood that we would see a closing in the first half of this year, clearly has diminished and hence coming out at the top end of the range, is &#x2013; as we also said in the call when we announced the valuation results, not likely, because of the effect that there are months of consolidated income that are missing.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess so, so it's a &#x2013; .</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. So if you only close on December 31, it would be 5%, is that the comps set or it could even be in the fourth quarter, you would still only be in 5%.  I know this is splitting hairs a little bit, but we have seen kind of fairly, serious reactions in your stock price to very small changes in your comments here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, I will not answer the question, and not because we don't have visibility on the numbers, but because the way the market seems to take these comments &#x2013; again, this is really just a technical point, you know whether we close in May this year or in November or in September has nothing to do whatsoever with the underlying business. I mean, you know that it's just a technical accounting effect, and quite frankly, one would almost have to look at the numbers on a pro forma basis, and then it almost doesn't matter in terms of when you close.</p>

          <p>I have a question on the gas market. We saw in the French press recently that you might pick up a case from the 70s regarding the network &#x2013; your transmission gas network and it's in agreement between Gas de France and EON, and the article says that you might use this agreement to enforce ownership and lending of the gas networks. And I would be interested in your view on that case, if you feel under pressure to find a solution for your gas-transmission business in Germany?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be regarding the CO2 burden; if you could give us the number of the CO2 burden you had in the first quarter of 2008 versus first quarter of 2007 for Central Europe and UK?</p>

We don't know what direction it will take, and we have to wait until the Commission comes up with its conclusion out of its investigation, and certainly there are no talks underway as far as our gas-transport business is concerned, and I must say, due to the state of this investigation, there is no such possibility quite frankly to do any settlement. So, we have to wait what the commission will finally come up with and then we will handle the issue.</p>

            <mark type="Inaudible" /> everyone, good afternoon everyone. You mentioned Dr. Schenck that the energy trading is a seasonal effect. Maybe you can give us the number or even a hint if we have seen the same effect last year. And my second question is, on the impact of the new structure on your sales figure in Q1, can we expect these higher sales figures due to the organizational structure &#x2013; do you expect the same for the full year or is it a one-time effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the sales, this is not a consolidated number, so they are partly internal volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not yet a full consolidation that has been feasible. As we highlighted earlier, carving out Energy Trading is like open-heart surgery in some sense. As far as the seasonality effect is concerned, we also do not have the &#x2013; the exact results on a like-for-like basis for our trading activity for last year's &#x2013; this is the key reason why we &#x2013; where we have been and are shying away from giving a market unit specific outlook. What I can say though is that we have seen basically the same seasonality effects, in our traditional market units, certainly as far as our Central European business is concerned and then also our Nordic business. We have not the exact same structure in our UK business because there we had a different transfer pricing mechanism &#x2013; so there you had been rather the wholesale &#x2013; the overall wholesale business fluctuate. But as a general comment we can say that this seasonality &#x2013; and I mean, I've seen some of the press suggesting, oh, EON has lost money in trading, and this is entirely a function of how the transfer pricing is structured, and it will go away in the coming two quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon. Two questions please. First of all, one of my favorite blocks of discussion, tariff cuts. Now you said you've already seen some in 2008, but I'm presuming that you haven't got decisions on the table for all your DSOs. And yet, well, I am pleased to see I can now read the regulated portion of your Central Europe division and I'm also pleased to see that the EBIT has actually gone up. So I wonder what you are expecting in terms of tariff cuts when the timing comes through; and most importantly, whether you're considering to, again like you did in 2006, build up a provision for potential retroactive claims from the regulator? That's my first question. The second question &#x2013; sorry to come back to the closing time. I am not that interested in the date of when you actually closed the transaction with Endesa and Enel, just wonder whether you could give us an update with your &#x2013; on your discussions with A2A, and you said the discussions &#x2013; your negotiations on the SB&amp;A are going well. Is that true on the Spanish side or is that separate process? Maybe you could give us an update on the thinking there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me comment on the first one, on your question related to the TSO and the DSO. We do have agreed tariffs on all our power transmission distribution businesses in Germany. Three of them are &#x2013; we do have in writing and the remaining four are basic &#x2013; are agreed. And the overall negative impact compared to the tariffs we had last year is in the, say, 3 to 6%, depends on which of the DSOs you're looking at. The issue we have in Q1 is that we have at this stage, not yet reflected in those numbers a negative impact from those new tariffs, because basically these are developments of the last two to three weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I understand that the regulator is not asking this time for &#x2013; or claiming that, these are retroactive decisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to comment on the second question concerning our talks and negotiations with Enel and Acciona or the transaction as it develops in Italy, Spain and France. I can confirm that those talks and discussions are progressing well. I would like to make a small correction to my statement. We received yesterday the approval of the CNE for the transaction in Spain, because we had to resubmit our application because we swapped some of the power stations there, that's now in place. As far as our talks with A2A are concerned, I think I mentioned in one of our previous conference calls that we basically had two options to sort of find agreement with A2A for their departure from the company with 20% share; one option that I was to negotiate directly with them and the other one to leave it to Enel to do it. We have decided to merge the two options, and as a tripartite approach, but now in talks the three parties involved, Enel, A2A and E.ON to find a solution and after first contacts  we had &#x2013; it looks promising that we will find an amicable solution there. So, no negative news to report from this call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon gentlemen. Just a quick follow-up. First of all the grid &#x2013; the transmission grid and its total there, it seems you are mainly talking to the EU Commission; is there any talks ongoing to Germany, any interest from their side; what you intend to do with the grid or is that more or less have that calmed down? And the second question maybe on the Energy Trading business. I mean how do you manage it, how much risk can they won &#x2013; now where you have centralized it with regard to &#x2013; what kind of visibility do you have and how is the profitability there, mainly driven by transfer pricing as you said before, or what is the kind of underlying profitability you're expecting there? So how in the way of risk management do you see this division now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me reconcile with the first one on the grid's divestment, and I got from your question that you mentioned in the second part of your question that Germany &#x2013; or reaction of the German government, I couldn't quite understand it because of the quality of the line. We are now in agreement with the EU Commission on the process going forward; we will submit our mitigation package to the Commission soon. There we see the market is to &#x2013; as far as the remedies are concerned &#x2013; and after the summer break we will finally reach agreement, and then the two periods given to us to divest from assets, two years for the grid, six plus &#x2013; potentially another six months for generation capacity will then start. As far as the German government is concerned, the offer is still on the table to discuss a German grid company, provided that other grid operators of the high-voltage grid are prepared to divest as well. We don't know that for sure, but there are some rumors in the market that one of those three might be interested in divesting as well, and that could be a triggering point for the government to get involved and moderate the process, where at the end, a German grid company could emerge as a result. But that's not certain. The offer is there but the government has to pick it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question <mark type="inaudible" /> going to answer the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when it comes to the second question, I mean the basic rationale for creating AG is basically to bundle all the commodity risks that already exist within the group through <mark type="inaudible" />. The way that we are managing that is of course, you see efficient risk measurement methods like prohibited risk and value at risk, and we are of course by creating AG also creating much more transparency on the cross European portfolio that we have, so we actually can take benefit from the increasing correlations of the different regional markets in Europe. Yield by definition improved the risk management, and we have a lot of different tools for that and the focus is on assets optimisation and managing the existing commodity risk, and to a lesser extent, figuring the prop trading that we have been doing. Now, from a steering perspective, we had a governor structure in place within the group that we had within EHE, and a risk committee is actually approving all <mark type="inaudible" /> within the limits that is given to EHE, but even more importantly. there is an E.ON AG risk committee which is governing all the limits and mandates that are given to EHE, where market sharing is sitting as share, where every significant change in the hedging framework or in the limits has to go through. And I think as Marcus said in the beginning that we have already seen the possibility to actually tighten up some of the limits due to the creation of EHE, more specifically referring to the profile <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>I have not said that quite frankly; I have said that we are positively interested in building new nuclear sites in the UK and I have deliberately refrained from commenting on all the speculations that we have seen in the press &#x2013; in the last couple of weeks concerning the 'E' &#x2013; and I prefer to keep that position, as I said before.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, guys. Just have a couple of follow-ups. You have mentioned already the 2008 regulation but the theme of incentive regulation continues to drag on, do you have a sense yet of when we might get some announcements, some hard numbers, some regulatory decisions on this? Because obviously, you have some sort of assumptions within your 2010 targets, but on what date roughly do you think we could get some confirmation from the regulator? And secondly just to confirm, again on regulation, just some of the data points on page 22 of the earnings release, you give the sales for the regulated bit of Central Europe West, is that literally just the regulated network part of Central Europe West <mark type="inaudible" /> supply component?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in E.ON. I mean your first question, in a way, I am the wrong party, I mean sometime during this year, but when we really don't know, I mean looks like there are several open points, things like a loud return on equity on new investments and so on, politicians are also increasingly engaged in some of those topics of, my view would be this is going to take really a few more months until we get something definitive there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean the way the incentive regulation is supposed to work is that basically the 2008 tariffs are the basis and then from there on, during a certain time period, one will have to gradually sort of approach the benchmark. However that it is then going to be defined, I mean that's one of the things that is still a little bit up in the air, but we will not see your kind of a sudden decline in allowed tariff for one of our deals or you know any grid in Germany.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add one point, which I also mentioned in the press conference call we had earlier this afternoon. And I said there that according to my reading of the development concerning the regulator and its practice, there is some &#x2013; some thinking on the way there on their sides. Certainly as far as the offshore grid connections are concerned whether they have not gone too far in how they have calculated the allowed return, which we have made public and whether the politicians also are now showing some interest, because it is very much in their interest, especially some specific politicians, that those offshore wind parks will be built and will be connected and within an allowed return of 3.8% as we calculated or may be at best 3.9%. The readiness to invest is very limited and therefore I believe that the regulator starts thinking about its own practice and so reviewing certain aspects of how they so far interpreted the law, so I think there is some development possible, which would give all operators then more decent returns than what is currently on the table.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My first question is on the Statkraft deal. Could you please remind us why the completion of the deal is taking what looks like more time than is initially scheduled &#x2013; you are mentioning the end of the year. Is there any issue with evaluation of the assets or is it simply because you want to make this swap as part of the 4.8 deal with agreement with the European Commission? That was my first question. And my second one is on the <mark type="inaudible" />, wonder whether there has been any evolution in your discussions with the Russian counterparts on <mark type="inaudible" /> agreement with <mark type="inaudible" />. Thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine, let me start with <mark type="inaudible" /> where we have seen the increase of oil prices pushing up gas prices and therefore making valuation more and more complicated. We are &#x2013; it seems to me that we are chasing a moving target, almost a phantom now. It is very difficult on that basis to really sit down with them and agree on valuation and that is long-term and will be the basis of the deal. So I'm, quite frankly, I'm getting a bit more skeptical as far as this deal is concerned because the Russians are basically not in a position to finally &#x2013; put the final touch to evaluation and we've seen sort of our positions being pretty close in the past and then they moved apart again. So I must admit I'm not too optimistic about short-term solution there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is another evaluation on the &#x2013; it's certainly not evaluation is more the technical details for the transaction, there are transfer of certain assets and the, let's say, approval from some of the partners in those businesses. So it's more on that side, there is nothing to do evaluation any longer.</p>

          <p>Hi Kiran. Good afternoon everybody. First question is on OGK-4. Perhaps you can update us here on the development of the electricity process, so what level could you realize in the first quarter of '08, what was the development in comparison to one year ago. Second question is on the nuclear drawing rights you are selling. I can imagine that these drawing rights are limited to the average lifetime of 32 years, so what will happen if these limitation of the lifetime will be cancelled in the future, so what would happen then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the first question first. We have in the first quarter of 2008 sold about 20% of the volume into sort of the free markets at an average price of around 17 euros. That is compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase in average price realized of around 12%, which is basically in line with our expectations from when we acquired the business. And then on the second question with year, anyone who would buy those drawing rights would also benefit from the &#x2013; from a potential extension of the lifetime of a given power plant. So that's &#x2013; the upside from that would go with a drawing right.</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm sorry couple of follow-up questions. Firstly, I'm just trying to understand that positive power transfer price effect a bit better in Central Europe. You said only 18 million Euro of that is effective at group level and given that you sort of produce what 35 to 36 terawatt hours of power in the quarter, suggests only a two euro a megawatt year-on-year benefit, which seems a little bit low, all things considered. Is that representative of where you might be for the full year? And I guess sort of a similar question applies to your, sort of, fuel costs, I mean I would have expected a higher increase in fuel costs given that you're purchasing more CO2 permits year-on-year. Is there some sort of transfer pricing effect going on ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay on the first one, the average price that I mentioned, the around 56 euros, you need to apply to only our economic generation volume, which was around 26 terawatt hours in the first quarter of 2008, yeah, and when you then when you do the math you could see what that implies. As far as the second question is concerned, I must admit, I'm not aware whether there is also a certain transfer price effect in particular on the CO2 side that has resulted from carving out, from basically giving the exposure there on CO2 also to EET that has a positive or negative effect ..</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>..on the Central Europe fitness position. I think we don't know the answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure would you agree though that sort of 90 million year-on-year increase in fuel costs is quite low though considering where CO2 prices and coal prices have gone?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wait a minute &#x2013; he just said hundred million. CO2 in fact already we have mentioned under</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hundred million is for the entire group total cost</p>

          <p>Total cost.</p>
          <p>A &#x2013; Marcus Schenck&gt;: And the question is to what extent &#x2013; what of that is actually allocated to Central Europe. I mean we would have to come back to that.</p>

          <p>And the last question comes from Martin Young</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there once again. A couple of quick questions. The first relates to the minority interests. Obviously they have gone up recently very significantly, yet the net income is down, just wondered if you could share with us where that profit was being generated and hence the higher minorities. And then secondly getting back to this whole issue of trading, does the fact that you have recorded negative 80 million in trading and accepting that the overall volume impact on the group is round about zero, indicates that there are positive effects in the various geographical business units and if so, could you shed some light on where the majority of that 80 million has actually ended up on the positive side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question on minorities, I'm mean the lion share of that sits &#x2013; basically results from our Nordic business, which as I mentioned is up on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And this is mainly a position as it related to the position of sub cost that they still have that number once the deal has closed should obviously disappear. You want to comment on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, the answer is yes. There is an opposite effect on the other side of the transfer price of course and the vast majority of that effect comes from Central Europe this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have a one question on the Internet from <mark type="inaudible" />, asking could you give us an indication, how your expectations is concerning a presumably simple outage of the nuclear power stations <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all we can do is highlight what the operator of those power plants and then Department for Europe is saying and I believe, what they are saying is that bone spittel will remain to be shut down until the end of June this year, and the coal plant until the end of the August.</p>
