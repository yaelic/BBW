          <p>Good day and welcome to the Diageo U.S. Analysts and Investors Conference Call.  Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to you host today Mr. Nick Rose.  Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Good morning and good afternoon everybody and as always thank you for joining us today.  We are running this call a little differently this afternoon and I hope in a minute you will see why.  I know that many of you will have already seen today's results announcement and probably a lot of you also the webcast.  I think the introduction should be suitably brief from me.</p>
          <p>I think Diageo's weathered the economic challenges of fiscal 2010 to not only deliver both top and bottom-line growth, but frankly more importantly to strengthen our business.  We have weighted our marketing investment behind campaigns which we know drive growth.  And we've also taken the decisions which are often difficult to kind of restructure most areas of the business.</p>
          <p>We've implemented strict control of COGS and also production overheads and that will certainly serve us well for the future and we've invested in our developing markets.  We enhanced our financial strength, which as you know is very important to me, and cash flow was exceptionally strong at over &#xA3;2 billion.  Our return on invested capital improved once again and in addition to all of this we found, I think, a very innovative funding structure to address our pension deficit.</p>
          <p>There are many examples of great innovation and marketing which resulted in share gains for our brands in about two thirds of our top 20 markets.  And we significantly enhanced the benefits that we believe we get from working together with our key customers and this clearly has improved the way in which our consumers shop our category in the off-trade.  I think we are therefore positioned very well as we enter this new fiscal year.  Having said that and as I think we saw in the discussions this morning, this is still a very uncertain environment in our view and the level of economic recovery is therefore difficult to forecast.  I'd say particularly in the developed markets.</p>
          <p>In contrast to that, in the developing markets, which, of course, are now a significant part of our business, we will benefit from a more stable economic outlook and, of course, a growing middle class and we are confident about the future as a result.  And even with these uncertainties, we issued guidance today that kind of takes all that into account and says that our organic operating profit growth in fiscal 2011 will be stronger than the year just ending.  And we've already taken the decision to raise our final dividend growth rate to 6%.  Many of you will recall we were running at 5%.</p>
          <p>So, I think I want to open the lines with not much more of a briefing from me.  But before I do, I want to take the opportunity to introduce you to Deirdre Mahlan who is with us here on the call.  I think everybody knows that Deirdre will be taking over from me as the CFO of Diageo.  And again everybody who knows me, I think, knows how pleased I am that Deirdre will be my successor.</p>
          <p>That's not to say that working at Diageo hasn't been one of the great pleasures of my life, but it is to say that I am delighted that in Deirdre we've got somebody as capable as we do have within the business.  And I know that Deirdre will do a fantastic job for us and actually for you in the future.  So, I couldn't be more pleased.  Many of you will have the chance to meet and speak with Deirdre over the next few months.  We will make sure that happens.  We will engineer that to be the case.  But I also &#x2013; we also wanted to give you the opportunity to have Deirdre address any specific questions this afternoon that you might have for her.  I have to say if you make them kind of too unfair, I might jump in at that point.  But otherwise, if there are specific things you'd like put to Deirdre, we wanted to give you a kind of early opportunity really before she even takes over to do that.  And if you have any very specific questions about F'10, given that I'm obviously fully accountable for that, I might jump into those as well.</p>
          <p>So, that's really why we're having a slightly different format this afternoon on the call.  And with that, I'd like to pass it back to the operator so that we can open the line to your questions and your areas of interest.  So, over to the operator.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  We'll now move to our first question which comes from Thomas Paulson from Cornerstone Capital.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to you all and Nick, all the best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had just two questions or two topics; one is just looking at the associates line and your interest in LVMH.  I'm a little bit perplexed with the growth there for the half.  Obviously, fixating back on LVMH's reported results and in the earlier call you had called out champagne as part of the reason why it's maybe more subdued, yet LVMH had good champagne results.  So, could you kind of help us through what's going on there and then what the expectation really should be for this year and just reference back to sell-side models that look at LVMH's business and that segment being up probably mid-teens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean a couple of comments from me around LVMH.  Obviously, their financial year is a sort of different financial year to ours, so when we report our full financial year, we effectively have a first-half of their year and a last half of their previous year.  And so, while they are seeing some recovery in the first-half of their financial year, part of that, and I know they've said this, is because they are lapping the prior year when they were in the teeth of the recession and particularly in the champagne.</p>
          <p>So, when you look at what we report for, if you like, a full-year of LVMH, it's a kind of half of one of their years and half of the other years.  And I think you'll find the first-half was the end of the prior year for them, which was particularly tough.  So, if you look at those two numbers and obviously factor in the exchanging rate adjustment from their euro reported numbers to our sterling reported numbers I think you will get this.  I know you will get this.</p>
          <p>The issue, of course, for them like, in a sense, the issue for us is, they are lapping two very different kind of base lines and their comparator in their most recent published half was an easier comparator and therefore, we all expected them to have a good half just reported.  The real test of the strength &#x2013; underlying strength of the consumer for them will be lapping a more difficult kind of prior half, which is the one they're in.</p>
          <p>And in a sense, that's a little like our results where you saw us have a relatively challenged first half because we were lapping a business that hadn't really gone into the teeth of the recession.  And therefore our first half showed some down kind of momentum, whereas in our second half we completely turned that around, part of which, not all of it, but part of which was because we were lapping some relatively easier comparators from the prior year.  And so, I think you will see the same thing within the MH results, which drives our associate line.  They are kind of slightly out of step with our reported results by a half year and all eyes on the kind of second half of their financial year to know what's really going on in champagne, in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, even if I look at your half just the second half, you're up about 10% in profits and that would contrast to LVMH's wines and spirits division that was up 18% in top line on an organic basis and EBIT was up 35%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and there, you'll see there again if you look at what they were comparing against as is typically the case, champagne goes down much harder than almost any other part of the beverage alcohol business.  So, what they were lapping was a very much more down period than we have been lapping kind of in our half year.  And therefore, it's not surprising that they bounced back 27 or 28% because when you look at the prior period, it was down much more than we were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  And the second topic I had just is the savings program, to understand kind of what you were saying this morning in terms of the flow through for this year and this coming fiscal year and fiscal '12 as you're looking at roughly 30 to 40 million in net savings per year or about a point in growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, essentially when we announced each of the savings programs and the charges, the exceptional charges that went along with each of those programs, we did guide to a sort of cumulative benefit of about &#xA3;195 million.  The biggest chunk of that was in our broad scale overhead reduction program, which was kind of across the globe and that was worth about &#xA3;120 million.  Pretty much all of that is, if you like, implemented in place and therefore those savings are running through our P&amp;L.  That's one of the reasons why for the last couple of years we've had pretty tight overhead numbers in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the savings 60, 65 million are more supply related &#x2013; supply footprint related savings in Ireland and in Scotland.  And particularly the one in Scotland involves a significant plant closure and some relocation of assets and production to a different plant in Scotland.  That has a much longer timeframe on it and we would expect, therefore, the &#xA3;65 million of savings to come through over fiscal '11 and fiscal '12 I think broadly it will be equally split between those two financial years.  So, we will be getting kind of incremental benefits through the P&amp;L to the tune of about 30 to 35 million a year for the next two years from those programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Thank you so much.  And then last quick question just in terms of how you're thinking about marketing spend this year obviously a big jump in this second half of this fiscal &#x2013; last past fiscal year, I would assume that you are still looking to drive marketing spending in aggregate a few points ahead of your net sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I think we will &#x2013; we are planning on a moderate increases in A&amp;P as a percentage of NSV in the coming financial year.  So, the kind of big step up that you saw in our second-half year this year of about 14%, I don't think we will replicate again.  I think that was almost a kick-start to get us out of the tough year we've been through.  Having said that, I do think we will carry on with above NSV growth rate kind of marketing spend, and therefore you will see, I think, a few tenths of a point of A&amp;P as a percent of NSV growing into fiscal '11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the reinvestment would be something in the range of 20 to 40 basis points if I understand you correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's going to be in that range.  It's not going to be sort of the 4%.  It's going to be 20, 30 basis points of improvement probably in the ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Thank you so much, and again all the best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  We'll now move to our next question from Del Warmington from Delwar Capital.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in reference to your Red Stripe, what percent of the volume was Red Stripe Light?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Red Stripe Light was a relatively recent introduction and therefore I think probably less than 10% of the overall volume.  Having said that, in terms of growth rate, it was obviously significantly better than the core underlying Red Stripe growth rate.  So, less than 10%, but growing a lot faster.  If you ask the question next year then I suspect it would be significantly more.  And I think the general reception and our view of the Light product is very, very favorable.  But it started little later in the year and obviously is growing from a tiny base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as it relates to Johnnie Walker, what in terms of the volume growth, was it Johnnie Walker Blue and Black that provided this growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things about scotch I think that look quite promising to us.  The first is the overall scotch grew about 5% and the Johnnie Walker brand itself within scotch was the best performer.  So, Johnnie Walker grew net sales by 7%.  That's generally a good sign for our business, A) because we are very dependent on scotch as a business and certainly Johnnie Walker within scotch.  Secondly, the margin structure of scotch for us is better than the average.  So, when scotch is growing again, the way it is, that is generally a very good sign for our business and Johnnie Walker is the star performer within that.</p>
          <p>When you disaggregate Johnnie Walker the very good news is that Black is growing again quite strongly.  I wouldn't go quite as far as to say that Blue yet is growing again strongly.  That kind of really ultra-premium part of the portfolio hasn't yet really kicked into life, in my view.  But, Johnnie Walker Black Label, particularly in Latin America and Global Travel is growing again very strongly.</p>
          <p>So, good news is, scotch is growing.  Even better news is, it's Johnnie Walker led, and even better news is Black Label is a significant part of that.  If we can sit here next time around and say that Blue is growing again strongly, then that will be certainly even more exciting.  But, a big piece of it is Johnnie Walker Black Label.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question as it relates to ForEx, you made &#xA3;170 million in your operating profit from ForEx.  What currencies were the major contributors there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as always, our foreign exchange numbers are going to be driven by the dollar, sterling-dollar, and sterling-euro.  In the particular case you're referring to the biggest benefit actually came out of the dollar and the biggest benefit came out of the transaction hedging rates that we'd locked in against the dollar.  So, we had most of our benefit from dollar, euro I think actually Korean won, and the most negative impact was probably the Nigerian naira.  But it's always &#x2013; almost always going to be dominated by dollar and euro in our case.  And that was definitely true in this year.  We gave guidance this morning for an &#xA3;18 million benefit on foreign exchange next year, as we currently see the rates.  And once again the biggest impact within that 18 million is the dollar-sterling rate on our transaction hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  As there are no further questions, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nick Rose for any additional or closing remarks.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, thank you very much for making my last U.S. conference call so easy.  As always, we thank you for your time.  Probably more importantly for me, I want to sign off by thanking you for all the support that you've given us and me over the years and I also want to take the opportunity for wishing you all good luck and best wishes for whatever you might do in the coming years.  So, thanks for dialing in and thanks for your support of Diageo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  That will conclude today's conference call.  Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen.  You may now disconnect.</p>
