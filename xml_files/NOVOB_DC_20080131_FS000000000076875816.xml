          <p>Good day and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Full Year 2007 Result Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host today Mr. Lars Rebien. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And welcome ladies and gentlemen to this Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our results for 2007, which we released earlier today.</p>
          <p>I am Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO for Novo Nordisk, and with me, I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer, as well as our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our homepage, novonordisk.com, along with the slides that we are using for this conference call. And the conference call, as usual, is scheduled to last approximately one hour. We'll also start with an outline of the presentation on slide number one. And as usual, again, we have a Q&amp;A session, which will begin in about 30 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number two. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Also note that this conference call is being webcast, as mentioned and the replay will be made available on our website after the conference call.</p>
          <p>Slide number three, please. We're pleased with the performance in 2007 with robust sales development of our key products and solid progress of our pipeline. Our portfolio of modern insulins continues to show strong growth in all key markets. 2007 sales of modern insulins increased 35% in local currencies thereby maintaining strong momentum in Novo Nordisk's insulin franchise.</p>
          <p>In the biopharmaceutical area, NovoSeven sales increased 10% in local currencies and Norditropin also continued the growth pattern with an 11% sales growth in local currencies. The launch of Levemir in Japan took place in December of 2007. With Levemir on the market, Novo Nordisk is the only company with approved portfolio of modern insulins in Japan.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the entire Phase III program to be used for the regulatory filing in the US and in Europe for the once-daily human GLP-1 analogue liraglutide was successfully completed with highly encouraging results. We still expect filing in the US as well as in Europe in the second quarter of 2008. And in Japan, Novo Nordisk has now completed, as you can see from the release, two Phase III studies with liraglutide, with also encouraging results. Regulatory filing in Japan is now expected in Q3 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we saw solid progress of our recombinant Factor VII portfolio. The current product NovoSeven high dose regiment has been approved and launched in Europe and heat-stable version has been filed for approval in United States, Europe and Japan.</p>
          <p>As for the earlier part of the portfolio, the NovoSeven Phase II study for the use of cardiac surgery has been finalized. The preliminary results from this study confirmed the safety profile known from  the previous studies using NovoSeven outside of hemophilia with inhibitors. While the primary end point of this trial was safety, the trial also demonstrated the biological haemostatic effect of NovoSeven.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, two next generation Factor VII analogues, a long-acting and the fast-acting version has been progressed into Phase I and Phase II respectively in 2007. And lately a formulation of recombinant Factor VII for subcutaneous administration has entered into Phase I clinical development.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial performance in 2007, it has been driven by the robust sales development of 13% growth in local currencies corresponding to 8% as reported. Improvement in our productivity and manufacturing has continued throughout 2007 and contributed to an increased gross margin of 130 basis point as reported. These improvements are mainly related to the increased productivity in insulin bulk manufacturing and insulin selling activities.</p>
          <p>The decision to discontinue clinical development and manufacturing activities related to the AERx inhaled insulin system has impacted operating profit as reported with a non-recurring cost of around DKK1.3 billion related to primary write-down of an impairment of tangible and intangible assets. Thus growth in operating profit reported decreased 2% compared to 2006; however, increased 13% adjusted for the non-recurring cost related to AERx. Adjusted for currencies, the underlying operating profit growth is close to 25%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number four. The diabetes care segment grew in 2007, 14% measured at local currencies and contributing 78% of Novo Nordisk overall growth. The portfolio of modern insulins was the main growth driver accounting for 76% of total sales growth. Biopharmaceuticals grew 10% measured in local currencies. Sales of NovoSeven increased 10%, while growth hormone increased with 11%, both measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Sales percent of -- sales of HRT franchise products increased with 9% measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to next slide please. In 2007 sales of modern insulins grew 35% measured in local currencies. The growth is driven by the underlying market growth and market share gains for the entire portfolio of modern insulins, that is NovoRapid, NovoMix and Levemir. Global market share continues to increase for all products. The market performance for all of Novo Nordisk's three modern insulins exhibited a steady and durable penetration of the various insulin segments.</p>
          <p>Levemir continues to gain momentum with sales increase from below 500 million Danish kroner in the first quarter of 2007 to 800 in the fourth quarter of 2007. From a regional perspective, growth is primarily driven by North America and Europe. However, international operations increasingly add to the growth of this important segment.</p>
          <p>In 2007 modern insulins made up 53% of our total insulin sales compared to 45% the year before,  emphasizing again the momentum in the ongoing conversion from the old human insulins to modern insulins. NovoRapid is the single largest modern insulin for Novo Nordisk with sales of 6.7 billion Danish kroners. Similar figures for NovoMix and Levemir were 4.7 and 2.6 billion Danish kroners respectively. Share of growth for all three modern insulins are roughly equally distributed, with Levemir increasing its share of growth.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for a further insight into the dynamics of the modern insulin market. Around 52% of global insulin market measured by volume has now been converted to modern insulins, compared to 46% same time last year, and we expect this conversion trend to continue within all segments of the market. This drives value of growth for the insulin market along with an ongoing conversion to prefilled devices.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk continues to gain market share within this segment. Novo Nordisk's market share of modern insulins are now 43% measured in volume compared to 41% 12 months ago. We also continue to be the only company with a full portfolios of these modern insulins with short-acting, premixed and long acting modern insulins in the most advanced and user friendly delivery systems such as the easy to use, disposable FlexPen.</p>
          <p>Turn to Slide number 7 for an update on NovoSeven sales development. Sales grew 10% in local currencies and 4% as reported. Sales growth was primarily realized in United States. The sales growth of NovoSeven reflects increased sales within congenital and acquired hemophilia where Novo Nordisk is a global leader. Treatment of spontaneous bleeds for congenital inhibitor patients remains the largest area of use.</p>
          <p>Next slide for the update on Norditropin. Norditropin sales increased 11% in local currencies and 6% as reported, thereby continuing again solid growth of the growth hormone franchise. The growth was primarily realized in North America followed by Europe. However, all regions contributed to growth measured in their local currencies. Norditropin, as you know, is a liquid ready-to-use heat-stable growth hormone, and it's increasingly sold in our prefilled delivery device NordiFlex. It  continues to be the most advanced offering in the market characterized by significant convenience benefits for patients and their families.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 9 for an update on sales by region. From a region perspective North America continues to be the main growth driver for Novodisk. In last year 2007, North America contributed 53% of the overall sales growth.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we continue to see solid growth rates for our portfolio of modern insulins due to market share gains and underlying market demands. NovoMix 30 and Levemir contributed majority of the growth.</p>
          <p>Sales in international operations grew 18% in local currencies. The main growth drivers were the sales of modern insulins primarily in Turkey and China. Sales of human insulin continues to add to the overall growth in the region also driven by China. The key contributor to growth in the region overall is China, accounting for around 50% of total sales growth as measured in local currencies. China is currently the fifth largest market for Novo Nordisk but it's predicted to be the fourth largest market already this year in 2008.</p>
          <p>Sales in Japan and Oceania increased 3% local currencies, sales development reflects sales growth of modern insulins &#x2013; NovoRapid, NovoRapid Mix -- both of which are increasingly being sold  in the leading prefilled delivery device FlexPen. Novo Nordisk has the leading market share in the modern insulin market in Japan, holding 73% total insulin market and 63% of the modern insulin market, both measured by volume. Levemir was launched in Japan in December of 2007 making Novo Nordisk the only company with a full portfolio of these new products.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 10, which provides you with an update on the development of our modern insulin market share in Europe including the rollout of Levemir. Novo Nordisk holds a clear leadership position within the modern insulin segment in Europe with a volume market share of 51% compared to 3 -- 48% one year earlier. The solid leadership position is reinforced by a continued market share gain of Levemir, which is now holds 26% of the total European market for long-acting modern insulins.</p>
          <p>And on to slide number 11 for an update on the US insulin market. Total diabetes care sales in North America increased 25% in local currencies and 15% as reported reflecting the solid penetration of the modern insulins Levemir, NovoLog and NovoLog Mix. NovoLog continues to consolidate its leadership position in the US insulin market with 42% of the total insulin market and 30% of the modern insulin market both measured by volume.</p>
          <p>NovoLog reinforces its position as a market leader within the short acting modern insulin segment of the US. NovoLog has obtained excellent formulary coverage for Levemir with almost 90% of total lives covered in a co-preferred status. According to the latest monthly market share data covering in November, Levemir now holds almost 10% of the total long-acting modern insulin segment measured in volume.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to hand over to Mads, who will give you an update on the development of our products.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to slide 12 for an update on our diabetes care pipeline. Last quarter, we submitted NovaMix 70 for regulatory approval in Japan. NovaMix 70 is intended to expand the treatment options for the approximately 50% of the Japanese insulin treated patients who are currently on a premixed insulin regimen. As Lars already mentioned we have now launched Levemir in Japan providing us with the broadest portfolio of modern insulins also in this country.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk has finalized the Phase III LEAD program and the two Japanese Phase III studies for the once-daily human GLP-1 analogue liraglutide. In a few minutes I will revert to the Japanese studies. Regarding the LEAD program involving in total around 4,000 patients, we recently announced clinical results from the LEAD III monotherapy trial, the last of five Phase III studies to be used for the regulatory filing in Europe and the US. Patients in the one year LEAD-3 study were randomized treatment with one of two doses of liraglutide or a maximal dose of glimepiride, a widely used sulfonylurea. At both doses tested, liraglutide provided statistically significantly better glucose control than the sulfonylurea. Among diet failure patients that were treated with liraglutide, an HbA1c lowering of more than 1.5 percentage points was observed throughout the full year of treatment.</p>
          <p>As has been seen in all previous studies where liraglutide was used without sulfonylurea co-treatment, patients receiving liraglutide in this study also experienced a very low level of hypoglycemia corresponding to the background level and contrasting with the sulfonylurea treated group where hypoglycemia occurred in a larger number of patients. Furthermore, a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure and a reduction in body weight of between 3 and 4 kg was seen in patients treated with liraglutide when compared to patients treated with the sulfonylurea. Based on these very comprehensive and successful Phase III studies, Nova Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approval of liraglutide for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in Europe and the US before the end of the next quarter.</p>
          <p>Also in the fourth quarter, we announced positive results from a Phase II study comparing the weight management properties of liraglutide with orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, in obese people who do not have diabetes. The study demonstrated that liraglutide given once daily over 20 weeks at the highest dose led to a weight loss of just above 7 kilograms in comparison to a weight loss of just below 3 kilograms in the placebo group. And a weight loss of just above 4 kilograms in the orlistat  treated group. All doses of liraglutide reduced body weight. More than 3 out of 4 people treated with the highest dose experienced a weight loss larger than 5%, and more than 25% experienced a weight loss larger than 10% relative to their body weight at randomization.</p>
          <p>Finally, the study revealed a beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure after treatment with liraglutide. Almost a third of the 564 participants in the study exhibited pre-diabetes at randomization. Following 20 weeks of treatment with any dose of liraglutide, between 80 and 90% of these participants no longer showed any signs of pre-diabetes as opposed to approximately 40% in the placebo and orlistat treated groups. liraglutide was generally well tolerated. Based on these data we now plan to meet with the regulatory agencies and initiate a Phase 3 obesity program with liraglutide before the end of this year.</p>
          <p>For two of the expected of the next generation modern insulins, Novo Nordisk has initiated clinical phase 2 studies. The programs involved NN1250 a neutral, soluble, long action modern insulin with a flat and predictable profile providing more than 24 hour coverage by once-daily injection, and also NN5401, a neutral, soluble modern insulin fixed combination with improved properties. Novo Nordisk expects to finalize both these Phase 2 programs in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally and as communicated on January 14, Novo Nordisk has decided to refocus its activities within inhaled insulin and to discontinue clinical development of the AERx project. The decision was based on a detailed analysis of the future prospects for the different types of inhaled insulin and a review of the medical and commercial potential of AERx. The decision to discontinue the development was not due to safety concerns. Consistent with the outcome of our analysis, Novo Nordisk will now increase research and development activities targeted at inhalation systems for long-acting analogues of insulin and GLP-1. The preliminary device activities will take place at two centers of excellence in Hayward, California, and Hiller&#xF8;d, Denmark, and design and biosynthesis of pulmonary long-acting GLP-1 and antigen analogues will continue at our R&amp;D campus.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for more about the Japanese Phase III results. Novo Nordisk has finalized the two planned Phase III liraglutide studies in Japan. One trial studying liraglutide is monotherapy, the other is combination therapy with sulfonylurea, a widely used oral anti-diabetic. The 24 week monotherapy study included 411 Japanese subjects with Type II diabetes previously treated with diet and exercise or a single oral anti-diabetic medication. After a four week washout period, subjects were randomized to either liraglutide or therapy with the sulfonylurea glibenclamide.</p>
          <p>From an average baseline HBA1c level close to 9%, HbA1c levels decreased by close to 2 percentage points in the liraglutide treated group. The change in A1c was statistically significantly greater than that observed for the glibenclamide group. At the end of the study, approximately 50% of patients in the liraglutide group were below the ADA target of HbA1c below 7%. The improvements in A1c levels in the liraglutide treated subjects were obtained through lowering of both fasting and postprandial glucose levels.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the study, average BMI was close to 25 and the average body weight was around 65 kilograms. The bodyweight difference of approximately two kilograms in favor of the liraglutide treatment was observed when compared to treatment with glibenclamide. Treatment with liraglutide was generally well-tolerated. Subjects treated with the liraglutide experienced a low rate of hypoglycemic events and this was significantly lower than the rate observed in subjects treated with glibenclamide. Nausea was reported in less than 10% of the subjects.</p>
          <p>The 24 week sulfonylurea add on study included 267 Japanese subjects with Type 2 diabetes where either placebo or two different doses of liraglutide were added to the existing sulfonylurea therapy. From an average base line A1c of around 8.5%, a significant improvement was observed following liraglutide treatment. The average A1c at the highest dose tested was reduced to below 7.0% thereby bringing around 70% of the subjects to a target A1c level of below 7%. From an average starting weight of around 65 kilograms and a BMI of around 25, there was no weight change from baseline in the liraglutide treated subjects in spite of the improvements seen in glycemic control.</p>
          <p>Similarly, there were no subjects reporting major hypoglycemic events. Subjects randomized to the liraglutide treatment experienced the highest completion rate in the study, around 95%. Overall, reporting of side effects occurred at a low level and the most frequently reported side effects in liraglutide treated subjects were constipation and diarrhea in around 10%, and nausea was reported in less than 5% of the subjects. Based on the results from the two Japanese Phase III studies, Novo Nordisk now expects to file for regulatory approval in Japan before the end of the third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide please for the development portfolio in haemostasis. The heat-stable version of NovoSeven was submitted in December 2007 for regulatory approval in Japan. This follows the regulatory submissions of the heat-stable version of NovoSeven in Europe and the US, which took place in mid 2007. The global Phase III NovoSeven trauma trial is recruiting as planned and on a blinded basis currently runs with a somewhat low mortality rate. A preplanned interim analysis investigating the assumptions underlying this statistical analysis planned for the study is expected to be communicated in connection with the financial results for the first six months of this year. Novo Nordisk has finalized the Phase II safety study for the use of NovoSeven in cardiac surgery as mentioned by Lars. A total of 172 cardiac surgery patients in the intensive care unit setting were bleeding and included in the study. Preliminary results from the study confirmed the safety profile known from previous studies of NovoSeven. While the primary end point of the trial was safety, the trial also demonstrated the biological haemostatic effect of NovoSeven. We expect to communicate next steps for NovoSeven in cardiac surgery during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Recently a formulation of Factor VIIa for subcutaneous administration has entered Phase 1 clinical development. Compared to today's NovoSeven therapy, subcutaneous injections are expected to, if successful, improve convenience significantly for hemophilia patients with inhibitors and thereby enable, e.g., daily prophylactic therapy.</p>
          <p>Prophylaxis is also a target indication for the long acting recombinant Factor VIIa analogue in Phase I clinical development and based on the two above mentioned positive developments, Novo Nordisk has now decided not to pursue further development of the current NovoSeven product for prophylaxis despite positive Phase II results. Driven by a higher aspiration level within the hemophilia  portfolio of Novo Nordisk, we are now actively pursuing the development of new molecules for the treatment of general hemophilia  i.e. also patients without inhibitors. The portfolio includes clotting factors targeting different parts of the coagulation pathway and aim at on-demand as well as prophylactic therapy. Among the preclinical projects, the most advanced of these are expected to enter clinical development within the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on our other biopharmaceuticals. In December 2007 Novo Nordisk filed Vagifem low dose which consists of 10 micrograms of estradiol for marketing approval with the FDA. Within the growth hormone area we have, with the aim to further improved patient convenience, initiated a Phase I study with the long acting human growth hormone analogue. Based on Novo Nordisk's particulation technology, the compound is designed for once-weekly treatment with expected administration via a convenient injection device.</p>
          <p>Finally, the R&amp;D strategy for the emerging biopharmaceuticals area has been updated. Based on an evaluation of the overlap between the Novo Nordisk skill base and the skill base required, as well as the level of investments needed and the likelihood of commercial success, we've decided to increase and focus our activities on auto-immunity and other inflammatory diseases. As a consequence, research and development activities within oncology will be terminated and resources applied to the growing inflammation portfolio. Existing oncology projects including the IL-21 program and the Anti-KIR project are expected to be partnered out in collaboration with our strategic partners in the cancer area, Innate Pharma and ZymoGenetics. The ongoing development activities for these two projects will continue while discussions with potential partners take place. The first two compounds targeting inflammatory diseases are expected to enter clinical development this year.</p>
          <p>Now over to Jesper for an update on the financial results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mads. Please turn to slide 16 providing you with the details on the financial results. We're satisfied with the overall sales growth in 2007, up 13% measured in local currencies and 8% as reported. The improvement in gross margin was 1.3 percentage points in 2007, primarily reflecting improved production efficiency in both upstream and downstream manufacturing, a lower level of write-downs and impairment in 2007 compared to '06 and higher average prices in the US.</p>
          <p>The improvement in gross margin also includes a negative impact of around 0.8 percentage points due to currency developments primarily, the lower value of US dollar and Japanese yen versus Danish kroner compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>Sales and distribution costs increased by 7%, primarily reflecting the increase in the US diabetes care sales force from 1200 reps to 1900. Research and development costs increased significantly more than sales, primarily reflecting the non-recurring costs related to the discontinuation of AERx of 1.325 billion, of which 870 million relates to write-down and impairment of tangible and intangible assets; 326 million relates to the discontinuation of clinical trials. And finally, 129 million relates to other exit cost such as leasing and investment commitments. The increase in research and development costs also reflect the high number of late stage clinical development projects currently being conducted.</p>
          <p>Reported operating profit decreased by 2% in 2007, primarily impacted by the costs related to the discontinuation of AERx. Adjusted for the costs related to the discontinuation of AERx, reported operating profit growth was 13%. This compares to our expectation of the growth in reported operating profit of around 10% noted in connection with the release of Novo Nordisk's third quarter results on 31st of October 2007, and despite a disadvantageous currency environment. If the operating profit is adjusted for both the currency impacts between 2006 and 2007 and the non-recurring costs in relation to AERx -- the AERx discontinuation, then the increase would have been 24% as stated by Lars in the introduction.</p>
          <p>Net financial income was 2.29 billion in 2007 compared to an income of 45 billion in 2006. Included in these financials is the result from associated companies with an income of 1.233 billion, primarily related to the non-recurring tax exempt income of approximately 1.5 billion from Novo Nordisk's divestment of the ownership of Dako's business activities, as well as Novo Nordisk's share of losses in ZymoGenetics of approximate 0.3 billion. In 2006, the result from associated companies was an expense of 260 million.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange result was an income of 910 million compared to an income of 141 million in 2006. This development reflects gains on foreign exchange hedging activities due to the low value of especially US dollar and Japanese yen versus Danish kroner in 2007 compared to the exchange rate level prevailing in 2006.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for 2007 was 22.3%, a decrease from 29.6% in 2006. The significantly lower effective tax rate for 2007 primarily reflects a non-recurring effect of around 3 percentage points from Novo Nordisk's divestment of the ownership of Dako's business activities as well as the non-recurring effect of 2 percentage points from the re-evaluation of the company's deferred tax liabilities as a consequence of the reduction to 25% in the Danish corporation tax rate introduced in 2007.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on our currency exposure. The depreciating trend for Novo Nordisk's most important invoicing currencies including the US dollar and Japanese Yen versus euro and Danish kroner has continued during 2007. With the decline of especially the US dollar, the hedging gain arising from our longer-term hedging activities have increased. Based on our forecast of 2008, we've estimated the expected currency impact on operating profit as a consequence of a 5% depreciation.</p>
          <p>Please note that we've reduced the number of currencies which are included in the US dollar related currencies and the related estimate. With the former basket of currencies, the impact of a 5% change in the currency rate would have been 130 million on operating profit in 2008. With now only the Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar included in the US dollar related, the impact is estimated to be 100 million Danish kroner leading to a total annual US dollar sales activity of 570 million from a 5% movement in the US dollar.</p>
          <p>Currently, Novo Nordisk's has hedged future expected cash flows related to the US dollar 17 months ahead, the Japanese yen 15 months ahead, and the British pound is hedged 10 months ahead. As of 31st of December 2007, foreign exchange hedging gain of 691 million has been deferred for future income recognition, primarily in 2008.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 18, for an outlook for 2008. Novo Nordisk expects slightly more than 10% growth in sales measured in local currencies for 2008. This is based on the expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk key strategic products within diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals, as well as the expectations of increased competition in both the diabetes care area and in biopharmaceuticals during 2008.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rates versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth in 2008 is expected to be around 3.5 percentage point lower than the growth rate measured in local currencies. For 2008, reported operating profit is expected to increase by at least 25% despite the negative currency environment. The guidance for reported operating profit for 2008 includes an estimate of non-recurring costs of 300 million in relation to the discontinuation of AERx to cover severance payments and other costs.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for the impact from currency and the non-recurring costs in 2007 and 2008 related to the discontinuation of AERx, underlying operating profit is expected to grow by at least 30 -- sorry 20%. For 2008, Novo Nordisk expects a net financial income of 450 million reflecting significant foreign exchange hedging gains primarily related to the US dollar. For 2008, Novo Nordisk expects an effective tax rate of around 24%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is expected to be around 2.5 billion in 2008, or equal to approximately 6% of sales. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are around 2.5 billion and free cash flow is expected to be around 7.5 billion. All of the above expectations are provided at currency exchange rates, especially the US dollar and related currencies remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner for the rest of -- throughout 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, cash returned to shareholders. At the annual general meeting on 12 March, 2008, the Board of the Directors of Novo Nordisk will propose a 29% increase in dividends to 4.5 per share of DKK 1 corresponding to a payout ratio of 34.9% when adjusted for the non-recurring costs related to the discontinuation of AERx and the non-recurring income from the divestment of Dako's business activities, compared to 34.4% for the financial year 2006. No dividend will be paid on the company's holding of treasury B shares. .</p>
          <p>During 2007, Novo Nordisk repurchased 15,500,000 B shares at an average price of 311 per share equal to a cash value of 4.8 billion. During 2006, Novo Nordisk repurchased B shares equal to a cash value of 3 billion. The Board of Directors has approved an increase by 6.5 billion in the ongoing 10 billion share repurchase program, bringing the total value of the share repurchase program to 16.5 billion. The program is now expected to be finalized before the end of 2009, as compared to the previously communicated completion time before the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash returned from recurring operations through the repurchase program will thus increase from 3 billion in 2006 to 3.5 billion in 2007, 4 billion in 2008 and finally 4.5 billion in 2009. This is in addition to the 1.5 billion gain from the Dako divestment, which is returned with 1.3 billion in 2007 and the last 200 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen will now moderate the Q&amp;A session. Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll now take our first question from Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello and good afternoon gentleman, it's Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Two questions that puzzled me a little bit in your Q4 report. One was the human insulin sales that were down 5% for the first nine months and down 11% in the fourth quarter. Obviously, somewhat impacted by currencies, but I wondered if you could comment on the human insulin sales development during the fourth quarter and why that was down so much? And then secondly, on the cost side, I noted that the sales and distribution costs only rose by around 200 million from third to fourth quarter, whereas in previous years excluding '06, we saw a more significant jump. So why were sales and distribution costs so much lower in fourth quarter? And what would you be expecting for the cost structure, gross margin, sales and distribution, R&amp;D in 2008, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much Henrik. I'll ask Jesper to comment on the evolution of our cost picture in sales and distribution. And give you a rundown on the different elements that led us into the results for 2008 going forward. And then I will revert hopefully with a comment on the evolution of the Q4 human insulin sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Henrik, the development in the sale and distribution costs in the final quarter is also reflecting what level of provision it has been necessary to make to cover our payments especially in developing counties. The final quarter had a very, very positive payment profile also related to the payments inked in Russia. And as a consequence of a lower level of outstanding in a number of IO countries and hence a lower level of country provisions, the cost from selling and distribution side in 2007 final quarter was slightly lower that what we've seen in a historic picture. In terms of the guidance looking ahead in towards 2008, I think you should anticipate -- and assuming a stable level of medicals reps in primarily the US -- you should expect a selling and distribution cost going slightly down, moving to a level of around 29% compared to 29.5 in 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you very much, Jesper.  And then on to human insulin, we saw an acceleration in the fourth quarter of the decline in human insulin. It was perhaps slightly abnormal as it could -- some of the effect is contributed to the prioritization of channel orders for International Operations. But we also have to emphasize that the general picture is a slight decline in the human insulin market as a result of the increasing penetration of modern insulins also in the International Operation markets. So some specifics, internal orders impacting the number in Q4 but a general trend towards declining human insulin consumption for Novo Nordisk. Thank you very much.  Next question please</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, gentlemen. Sebastien Berthon from Exane BNP Paribas. Just two questions on the tax rate, which you now guide towards 24%. Is this your underlying tax rate going forward or are there any elements from the remainder of Dako that would effect this. Secondly, on your lowering of HbA1c in the Japanese study, could you give us what's the difference in terms of reduction versus the sulfonylurea? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars Rebien here. Jesper, tax rate, do you see 24% going forward as a sustainable underlying tax rate for the company or does that still include some of the run-off from the Dako divestment? And then Mads later on you, with the HbA1c reduction of the Japanese study in the SU arm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate of 24% is a sustainable level, I believe for Novo Nordisk going forward probably at least the remaining part of this decade. The uncertainty in the longer term horizon would partly be ascribed to the development in the two segments. Whereas the diabetes care franchise is primarily related to a Danish taxation in our biopharmaceutical franchise is to a larger degree related to a Swiss taxation base. So a movement and a faster growth in our diabetes care franchise longer term could have a slight upward pressure on our tax rate. But near term, 24% is very realistic, and there is not included in the guidance for 2008 any income from the Dako transaction; that was taken in 2007. And hence there is no impact on our tax rate from the divestment of Dako.</p>

          <p>Thank you Jesper, and Mads, the SU arm of the Japanese study, what did you see in terms of HbA1c reduction from baseline?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Here I should emphasize that many of the patients in the study they came from a background of seeking low Hb, but everything was washed out and this was true monotherapy. Liraglutide reduced HbA1c by around half of percentage point greater than the SU arm, and this was statistically highly significant.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Lara Lombare from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually Andrew Baum from Morgan Stanley. Firstly, it seems that you are focusing your assets as opposed to what your competitors in the industry are doing in terms of diversifying. And I refer to withdrawing from oncology, TransTech cessation, and also your oncology. Does this indicate that you are going to stick with the knitting or are you looking still at building alternative therapeutic areas potentially using external collaborations and potentially M&amp;A? So that would be the first question, and the second question relates to you indicate you've got a couple of auto-immune compounds going into your early stage pipeline. Could you just indicate which targets and which mechanisms you are focusing on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much Andrew, Lars Rebien here. I'll try to attempt to answer your first question and then I hope Mads Krogsgaard will help out on the auto-pipeline that he's seeing. You are absolutely correct that we are focusing our assets. We would like to continue to remain leaders in the diabetes care area, looking at proteins, strengthening our portfolio of modern insulins, expanding usage in the future of the GLP-1 segment, perhaps even expanding it beyond diabetes into treatment of pre-diabetes and serious weight management of people with other risk factors. And we're expanding our growth hormone franchise. We are hoping to expand our hemophilia franchise.</p>
          <p>And we have acknowledged the fact that we probably in assessing our abilities to be long term competitive in the oncology area have concluded that due to the shortened product lifecycle of current cancer products, increasing competition, difficulties of accessing patients for clinical trials, our inability to acquire cancer-related companies at a price which we found were relevant or find companies that were interested in being acquired by us. You should expect that we will be sticking to a very focused agenda on the areas that I have just mentioned, the biopharm being primarily focused on inflammation.</p>
          <p>In terms of M&amp;A, we would be looking at acquiring technologies that can support our diabetes business. We would be looking at acquiring research programs in that field, but that is typically discrete license agreements or acquisitions, not companies. When we are talking about our future in inflammation, we would like to be able to acquire if possible pipeline and competencies in the area. It is also obvious from the continuing decline of the US dollar that US dollar related assets are becoming attractive for a company with our profit and loss. And so you should expect that we'll be continuing to be on the outlook for acquisitions in the inflammation area, but not major major investments in that regard. Mads?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>On to you, the auto-immune pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and Lars -- first I'd like to add one comment to what Lars has already said, and that is the notion that we actually believe at Novo Nordisk that using our protein engineering skills and isolation skills. And increasingly devoting those technologies also to alternative groups of administration of protein such as GLP-1 and insulin. There is a lot of innovation to be harvested in the years to come. And Novo Nordisk will seek to reap the benefits of such products using our dedicated skills. And we actually think this is a very viable route for the long-term improvement of patient outcomes.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the inflammation area, we are looking at auto-immune and other diseases, and these are inflammatory diseases. And these are the ones that you should expect. We're looking at --things such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis and so on. And the targets, they can either belong to the innate immune system such as antibodies against the complement C5a Receptor, or they can be cytokine inhibitors, such as interferon inhibitors for systemic lupus erythematosus. Or they can be let's say a T-cell cytokine inhibitor such as we know it from the IL-20 and certain other interleukin systems. So it's an array of targets, but they all seem to leverage our immunology insight from the diabetes area with our protein -- let's say technology base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Poul La Cour from Kaupthing. At your 3Q result, you guided for reported sales at the level around 10%. And now you're guiding for reported sales above 6.5%. On my calculations, this cannot be explained by the FX change alone, so are you seeing or expecting an underlying change in the sales development by segment or by regions, that's the first question? And the second question, in relation to NovoSeven. You state that you now have the results from the Phase II trial, and that the next step will be the communication later in the first half. I guess if it was clear cut results, you would communicate them now. And therefore I speculate that you're are postponing the decision either because the data are mixed or because you are now evaluating whether to wait for the second generation NovoSeven? Can you elaborate on this please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Poul. I will try to attempt the first question which relates to sales development and underlying perspective for the different franchises going forward, and Mads will talk to how we see the cardiac surgery data. And it is correct when you say that we talked about in Q3 a perspective of 2008 underlying sales growth of 10%, whereas we're now guiding slightly above 10% and then a negative currency impact of 3.5%. So you're correct in your calculation that it -- that what we are now guiding is more than 6.5% of top line growth. What this signals to you is that we still have a strong expectation for growth of our insulin franchise. We do however caution the potential development in the NovoSeven area, quarterly sales in NovoSeven have been erratic. And so we are guiding that the sales growth in this area will be less than double-digit in 2008. And likewise we're seeing increased competition and slower growth of our human growth hormone business, and then also the currency effect from the end of the year until now has actually -- Jesper, you probably want to comment on this. So I'll stop right here and give you a chance to comment on the currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just bearing in mind that the currency that we were -- the currency impact we were expecting on our top line at the end of October when we guided Q3 was a currency impact just below 2%, and now we are seeing 3.5%. So a bit over 1.5% worse currency impact. At that time the dollar was at 5.18 and we have used for this guidance the dollar rate on Monday of 5.05, so that's the main change in terms of currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you for clarifying that Jesper. Mads, on the cardiac surgery trials and what is the future for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes well, here Poul it's important to notice that these are very recent data and they are actually so recent that we've not had a chance to even host an investigator meeting to discuss it with the actual cardiac surgeons who have performed the trial. On the other hand, we find ourselves obliged of course to inform the market about the results even though these are headline results and early days.</p>
          <p>So what we will do now is actually have the investigator result meetings and discussions with the experts and then we'll be able to revert to you. There is no specific, let's say, guidance in our using  of the various patients in this context aside of the fact that it's early days. I should say that when we do make a decision on what are the next steps if any, it will based of course on the usual assessment of benefits of the compound versus the risks and how the regulatory agencies would see a path forward. And in the intensive care unit setting discussing cardiac complicated surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and so on and so forth, this is indeed a highly complex arena where we need to solicit external input.</p>
          <p>On the notion of the analogue NN1731, you are of course correct, that this is an analogue that seems to work preclinically in conditions such as hypothermia, acidosis, and dilutional coagulopathy; all of these parameters which are relevant to cardiac patients. But that is not an element of this discussion base.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello this is Michael Novod from Handelsbanken. First question is a follow-up to Poul's question before on the top line, do you also -- when you guide on sales growth -- see more difficulties in price increases in the US perhaps with regards to the potential of a new US government during 2008? Or should we expect that you will be able to raise prices significantly again in '08? And then a second question to the margin, if we, say, exclude the one-offs in the margin for 2008, we are now above your own target of around 25% at least based on my calculations. Could we soon expect that you will announce some new targets perhaps also for the next decade, which will be above 25%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. This is Lars Rebien here, price increases in the US, yes, you are right in assuming that we are less optimistic about the ability to continue to raise prices with the historical trend. So they will continue to be up, but at a slower pace than what we have seen historically. Jesper, would you care to comment on what the market should expect in terms of guiding on the margins as we now have reached almost the target of 25%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If we just take the guidance for the individual cost items, then the guidance we can provide for our gross margin, we previously stated that the improvement in gross margin would be 50 to 100 basis point improvement in local currencies. We can clearly see with the development in 2007 where we've realized an improvement of, if you add the 80 basis points of negative currency impact to the performance, then we've seen a 200 basis point improvement. Slightly over 100 basis points come from improvement in production efficiencies, which to a large degree is expected to continue into 2008. Whereas the two other effects, half &#x2013; a bit over half of it is related to a significantly lower level of impairment and obsolescence charges in 2007 compared to '06. And also a positive pricing environment, as Lars just alluded to, we are just not expected to continue to the same level in 2008. And that gives us hence expectations of around 100 basis point in positive local currency improvement in gross margin in 2008.  But of course, at the current level for currencies reported that would go down probably to the tune of 50 basis points or so a little bit depending on actual production mix.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the selling and distributing cost, I've already given guidance to around 29% in that one and in terms of R&amp;D we guided in connection with the discontinuation of AERx to around 17%. As for the admin costs you should expect admin to sales level dropping below 6.0% in 2008, as we are able to make our admin costs grow less than sales. And in terms of other operating cost and not including &#x2013; being specific on that -- not including income in relation to the out-licensing of our oncology franchise, they are estimating currently around 300 million in income from other operating income. Those levels of guidance would get you slightly above the 25% operating margin and hence we will be evaluating during this year whether it will be necessary for us to update our long-term financial guidance. I note that if we already in 2008, and despite the currency environment that we've been into, will be able to meet our long-term financial targets, this would have -- would be a significant achievement as they were pronounced at the outset of 2006 and hence a major achievement to realize in this short time horizon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question about your long-term strategy for liraglutide and also potentially your longer acting GLP-1 analogue. Specifically, focusing on patient populations outside of diabetes, looking at pre-diabetes, have you made any decisions in terms of how you will structure the obesity trial and whether there could be a pre-diabetes sort of follow-up study on that, and how specifically, do you think this would have to be a long-term trial sort of similar to what perhaps GSK did with its ADOPT study in Avandia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Lisa. This is Lars Rebien here. I'll defer this to my learned colleague Mads Krogsgaard to answer this question immediately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars, I'll do my best. As you are aware the overall strategy with GLP-1 is both to have the once-daily liraglutide analogue as well as the once weekly analogueue which is currently in Phase I, and long-term also a long-acting inhaled analogueue of GLP-1. This should enable us to fulfill requirements of different kinds of customers.</p>
          <p>Now as we move into pre-diabetes and obesity, you're absolutely right in stating that a major aspect of first of all during ethically correct and meaningful trials is to take not only weight management properties into account, but also risk reduction vis-&#xE0;-vis significant factors, such as conversion from obesity to pre-diabetes and from pre-diabetes to obesity. And this means that in order to study this conversion rates, you can imagine that in a population with a BMI above 30, you would typically have up to 30% or so who actually already have pre-diabetes. And the conversion rate from pre-diabetes to diabetes are such that you in this population will typically have to study around 3000 obese people of whom maybe 1,000 have pre-diabetes, ending up studying these for three years, and then you will have meaningful statistics to support your claims about the disease modifying potential in terms of pre-diabetes.</p>
          <p>Similar kind of calculations can be made, looking at other risk factors such as cardiovascular disease and so on and all of this is ongoing. What I can say at this point is that the study that we will kick -- the studies that will be kicked off in the Phase III program, they aim at filing for obesity and weight management after one year of therapy, and a pre-diabetes kind of inhibiting the conversion to diabetes after a total of three year duration. And the entire program is scheduled to be in the ballpark of 4500 patients.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Just two questions. Firstly for Jesper, you commented that for sales and distribution into '08 being based on flat number of US reps. Just the question therefore is, does this mean you've may not hire reps this year an '09 effect or are you not hiring reps at all? And then a question for Mads, just wondering if could elaborate on the difference in weight loss you've seen looking at the Japanese versus what we've seen in the LEAD program that you've historically reported? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Sachin Jain. Jesper, the development of the S&amp;D costs into '08 and the effect on any expansion or is it simply a reflection of the expansion that took place into '07, and Mads, weight comparison between Japan and the other studies that have been going on on liraglutide.</p>

          <p>Thanks Lars. The 29.0% I was guiding for the selling and distribution costs was based on the current level of the sales rep in the US, and that was just to make it explicit that as of when we take decisions on that and we previously communicated that we would anticipate in the second half of this year to make an assessment of what level of sales force would be relevant for the launch of liraglutide in the US. And then a little bit depending on the precise timing in that respect, there may &#x2013; potential changes may hit the second half of this year and then it may impact the selling and distribution cost. So it's just to be very elaborate on outlining what was the conditions for providing the 29.0 guidance on selling and distribution cost.</p>

          <p>Yes. And in the two Japanese studies if you look at the monotherapy study, the notion is that the 2 kilograms difference, this constitutes about 3% of the body weight of such a Japanese person because they tend to start out in the ballpark of the 64-65 kilograms. Now this difference is achieved, A, by a reduction in body weight in the liraglutide-treated group, and B, by increasing the body weight of the sulfonylurea treated group. So it is, in this study somewhat reminiscent of what we see in the Western studies, but there major difference is that, A, the Japanese are not so obese, their BMI on average is actually somewhat below or slightly below 25. And second of all that these people are already smaller individuals, meaning that the absolute numbers that you can report on in kilograms of course are less. And it should be borne in mind that the HbA1c lowering capability is very high in these studies, up to 2 percentage points, meaning that a weight loss in that context is a very good thing to see.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much Mads. Just ladies and gentlemen, before I close this conference call, I would like to draw your attention to our ambition in this presentation, and when you subsequently study the presentation, to the fact that we are also trying to create some visibility on our replacement power in the more long-term, in that we give you a heads up on the next generation of insulin analogueues; we give you a heads up on the new product in the growth hormone area. We give you heads up on new types of NovoSeven products -- faster, stronger and subcu administration, as well as a long-term strategy for GLP-1.</p>
          <p>So we really tried to give you also a longer term perspective on how we would grow our business, not only the nice growth that we are expecting for the short to medium term based on the products we have on the market and the expectations for liraglutide or GLP-1.</p>
          <p>With that ladies and gentlemen I would like to close the call and thank you for your participation. We are looking forward to meeting several of you over the next couple of weeks. Thank you.</p>
