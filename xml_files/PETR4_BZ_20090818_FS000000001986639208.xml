          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to our conference call to discuss second quarter 2009 results.  We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that can be accessed at the site www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the Slide 2.  We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by the use of the word will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras management and on information currently available to the Company.</p>
          <p>Finally let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with Brazilian GAAP.  At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues related to the U.S. GAAP results.  The conference call will be conducted by our CFO and Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa.  He will comment on the Company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss second quarter results.  This quarter is notable for the absence of extraordinary items and for the reduction in costs, particularly from inventories which were formed during when prices were lower.  The quarter also demonstrate the stability of our operating earnings as a result of our domestic pricing policy.</p>
          <p>Let's go to Slide 3 please.  During the second quarter oil and gas production in Brazil was up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.  Year-over-year growth would have been higher except that we have had a shutting &#x2013; to shutting 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent of gas capacity because of limited domestic demand.  We continue to maintain our target for average daily production in Brazil of 2.05 million barrels per day in 2009, but note that this includes a range of plus or minus 2.5%.</p>
          <p>This year we have experienced a number of minor operational issues and delays that reduced our expected average for the first seven months of the year.  Such issues are to be expected given the complexity of our operations.  We set our targets to reflect our production challenge, but even planning for contingencies, our target range is a more appropriate reflection of the reality of our business.</p>
          <p>Next slide please.  In the pre-salt, we continue to accelerate our activities, particularly in the BM-S-9 and BM-S-11.  We now have six rigs on location in the France basin cluster.  Three are drilling new wells in the Iracema, Tupi Nordeste and Abar&#xE9;.  Two are performing drill stem tests in Guar&#xE1; and Iara.  The purpose of these tests is to provide additional information about the productivity of wells and the quality of the oil.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have a rig work on the replacement of the Christmas tree of the extended well tests.  By the end of this year, we expect the arrival of PetroRig 2 and the SSV Victoria in 2010, five new built rigs that we're contracting 2005 should arrive.  This will be supplemented by the arrival of the Transocean's Cajun Express, which we recently contracted.  For the remainder of the year, we expect to perform additional drill stem tests, as well as new appraisals wells that form part of our evaluation plans for the pre-salt cluster.</p>
          <p>We continue to move forward on the bids for the eight standard FPSO hulls to be built in Brazil and hope to have a contract for these hulls signed by year end.  Additionally, we are nearing the end of the bidding process for two new pilots that are scheduled to begin production 2013 and 2014 and possible earlier.  It's worth noting that we processed the first cargo from Tupi.  We found the quality of oil excellent, with low sulfur and high yield of middle distillates.</p>
          <p>Next slide please.  We turn now to some key operating data that determine our quarterly results.  In this slide, you will see the average price of Brent increased from $44 to $59 per barrel.  The light-heavy differential decreased during this period, which is reflected in the differential between our crude oil and Brent.  Together, these factors contribute to a substantial improvement in our upstream segments' margin and income.</p>
          <p>Next please.  The increase in the price of oil, and the strengthening of the real caused a small increase in lifting costs.  Lifting costs expressed in U.S. dollars, and without government take, increased by almost $1 per barrel, reflecting the influence of the exchange rate on lifting costs.  Lifting costs were slightly lower when expressed in reais.</p>
          <p>Production taxes increased during the period, giving the linkage to international oil price.  Production taxes increased by nearly $4 per barrel, while Brent increased some $15 per barrel.  The net result was an improvement in our margin.</p>
          <p>We continue our policy of adjusting gasoline, diesel and LPG only in the long term when we believe a new international price level has been established.  The consequence is a smoothing of our operating income as well as price stability to the Brazilian market consumer.</p>
          <p>From the first quarter of last year until June we were recovering the difference between international market price and domestic market price, with the reduction of gasoline and diesel prices in Brazil in June 10, combined with higher the international price, we are now close to parity between the two markets.</p>
          <p>The markets for derivatives and natural gas rebounded in the second quarter versus the first quarter, although it is still down year-over-year.  To highlight some of the principal movements of our main products, diesel recovered in line with GDP growth.  The first half of last year also saw considerable consumption of diesel for thermoelectric generation.  Gasoline consumption was lower as a result of increasing competition with ethanol.  Fuel volume continued to decline as industrial consumers switched to natural gas, which is now abundant and relatively less expensive.  Natural gas sales increased but are still weak because of the lack of demand for thermoelectric power.  Next.</p>
          <p>We continued to upgrade our refineries to improve our margin and our trade balance.  Comparing the first six months of 2009 with 2008, we've reduced fuel oil production by 51,000 barrels per day while increasing the output of diesel by 33,000 barrels per day.  This enable us to capture the margin between these two products.  Additionally, while refinery throughput in Brazil was down 30,000 barrels per day due to programmed refinery maintenance, two-thirds of the reduction of feedstock &#x2013; two-thirds of reduction in feedstock was imported light oil, which represent a saving of approximately $13 per barrel more than the domestic goods we exported during the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Higher oil production, improvement in our refinery system and reduced demand are reflected in our trade balance.  The difference between barrels of oil and oil product exported and imported continues to improve with surplus of 184,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2009 versus a surplus of only 27,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2008.  The commercial trade balance declined at best to $567 million in the first semester of last year to a surplus of 1.3 billion in this semester.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn &#x2013; let's turn now to financial results.  Net revenue increased as a result of higher volume and higher price for our export and for those products in Brazil that adjust each two weeks to international price.  Cost of goods sold decreased as a result of inventory average and because we were able to process more domestic oil and fuel oil into the middle distillates that entered by Brazilian markets.</p>
          <p>Operating expense were reduced from the prior quarter by a decline in freight costs, lower operating expense plus freight orders as well as reduced write-offs for dry holes.  No inventory reductions, and no other impairments.  The net result was an increase in operating income by 31%.  Soon after the first quarter, improving operating income was partially offset by larger financial expense related to continued depreciation of the real against the dollar.</p>
          <p>The quarter-over-quarter net financial results increased from a negative R$849 million to a negative R$2.4 billion.  The increase in minorities interest expense from R$342 million to R$1.9 billion is also largely a result of the real appreciation, as is a portion of the 744 million increase in equity investments.  The net effect from financial results affected by the appreciation of the real reduced the net income by R$2.4 billion during the period.  This reduction largely offset the increase of net income from positive financial results due to the depreciation of the real against the dollar during the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>Also affecting the financial result was a quarter-over-quarter increase in financial expense of R$385 million as a result of a commercial hedge in the second quarter of 2009.  This loss was largely offset by the benefit of a reduction in cost of goods sold which had the effect of increasing operating income.</p>
          <p>With the deduction for interest on capital in the second quarter of 2009, our tax expense decreased by R$645 million.  Foreign tax benefit also reduced our tax view during the quarter.  Despite the higher financial expense and minority interest expense, net income increased 33% over the period.</p>
          <p>Next please.  Operating income for our Brazilian exploration production segments more than doubled from the prior quarter led by higher price and volumes.  As mentioned earlier low demand for natural gas cost approximately 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent of natural gas to be shut in reducing revenue potential and increasing per unit lifting cost.  As we saw earlier costs were higher as a result of higher production taxes.</p>
          <p>Next, operating income for our Brazilian downstream segment remained strong as revenues increased on higher volume and price, while cost of goods sold were favorably impacted by cost averaging.  Refining throughput was down slightly due to programmed refinery maintenance.  The percentage of domestic crude processed decreased slightly from 80 to 79%.</p>
          <p>Next.  Our Gas &amp; Energy segment recorded operating income of R$576 million despite limited thermoelectric generation of electricity.  The gain was largely a result of growing capacity based on greater supply of natural gas and completed infrastructure.  As capacity grows the Gas &amp; Energy segment has more opportunity for revenues from our purchase sales.  The completion of the infrastructure also eliminated the contractual penalties which adversely impacted earnings in the past.  The positive income marks a turning point in the Gas &amp; Energy segment, which now has the infrastructure and the supply of gas to give it the operational flexibility to generate income.  This year will mark the peak of the investment cycle for the Gas &amp; Energy.  As a result, investment should fall by half next year.</p>
          <p>The improvement in the International segment was due largely to absence of extraordinary items that hurt the first quarter earnings.  Growing production in Nigeria is offsetting declining production elsewhere.  Our share of Aggman production is now 20,000 barrels per day, Akpo is producing since last March.  We expect production from these two projects to contribute to 60,000 barrels of oil per day by year-end to our production and will contribute an average of 40,000 barrels per day to 2009 production.  Next.</p>
          <p>Capital spending increased to R$32.5 billion during the first semester of 2009, 56% for the first semester of 2008. Of this majority, 50% of our spending was for domestic E&amp;P and the remainder for our integrated operation.  Current spending is roughly equal to our EBITDA of R$1 billion during the semester although it is now below our free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures during the first of the year were based largely on existing projects and contracts and we have not seen substantial cost reduction for expenditure related to these contracts.  For new projects we are seeing some reduction in price but it's still too early to quantify.  What is more apparent in the greater &#x2013; is the greater availability of equipment and supplies at price below those of last year.  Ultra deep water rigs are a good example of this.  This increase in availability has led to some increase in CapEx above what was planned.  We are closely monitoring investment spending and if necessary we will revise our CapEx budget accordingly.  Next please.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we were active in values markets to finance the project GAAP between cash generation CapEx.  Since our conference call announcing first quarter results, we have announced a $10 billion loan from the Chinese Development Bank for 10 years.  We recently concluded our loan with BNDES, which was fully disbursed on July 31.</p>
          <p>Finally in July we reopened &#x2013; in June we reopened our global note due in 2019 to capture another $1.25 billion.  In the reopening we lowered our cost of borrowing from 8.125% rate to we've received in February to 6.875%.  Proceed will be used to reduce commercial bank bridge loans.  We have now tapped the capital markets for 2.5 billion of the planned six billion that we intend to issue during 2009 and 2010.  All those we have contracted or obtained commitment for more than $31 billion since the beginning of the year and have to fund the difference between our project cash flow in each branch were to average $66 per barrel during the next five years and our planned CapEx of $174 billion for the period of 2009 and 2013 business plan.</p>
          <p>Next please.  Total debt expressed in reais declined slightly during the quarter, but net debt increased as we drew down cash balance to fund CapEx and dividends payment.  Our debt when expressed in dollar, increased partially as a result of additional borrowings and partially because from converting our reais denominated debt into U.S. dollars.  Our net debt to net built capital ended the quarter at 28%, still comfortably between our target range of 25 to 35%.</p>
          <p>Thank you.  With that, let me stop and answer any question you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Our first question comes from Robert Kessler from Simmons &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good day.  I had a &#x2013; I wanted to see if you could provide some commentary around the pre-salt framework I guess, where we stand now and the next steps from here?  As I understand it, the committee has now put forward before the President some three proposals, and the next step is for him to then in turn propose one of those to Congress.  Is that correct?  And if so, could you give us your indication on timing for when that proposal to Congress will take place?  And any additional commentary you might have around your preference among the three proposals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are proposals that are the responsibility of the government, and the established committee to suggest alternatives.  We are &#x2013; although the president of Petrobras is part of this committee, we as a Company, we are not taking part on it, and we don't know more than it is in the newspaper.  So I prefer not to comment on these issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can I take a different line of questioning then on your pre-salt development plans, or early stages thereof, as you look at the next two FPSOs going into sanction here with Iara and Guar&#xE1; had 120,000 barrels a day of capacity, would you envision that increased capacity from, I think the earlier number was 100. Is the 120 now indicative of what you would expect for the next eight?  Or what are your thoughts, more broadly, about the optimum size of these units as you sanction them going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, going to ask Molinari our colleague from E&amp;P, if he can add some information on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Iara and Guar&#xE1; is just a formation test. We are doing the test with the drilling rigs, it's very short period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you fully develop the pre-salt, what is the optimum size of your FPSOs?  Is 100,000 barrels a day the right number, or is 120 a good number in your thinking today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was talking about these two formation tests, and then we will have a Guar&#xE1; net pilot system with 120,000 barrels per day starting production in 2013.  And then we will have eight FPSOs until &#x2013; from 2015 and 2016 to start production in this period, and these FPSOs will have a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Do you expect those to be relatively fully utilized?  I guess I'm thinking of examples in the Campos Basin where you add a number of modules to a given field or area and then the utilization of those &#x2013; of that top side facility is something less than 100%.  Thinking for example, let's say Marlim Sul, where you've got modules one, two and three whose capacity is now 430,000 barrels a day with another module in 2011. But I think your target there for Marlim Sul in terms of total output is around 288 for 2013, which implies a fairly low utilization of the top side facilities. Now recognize they're spread fairly broadly geographically, but as you think about these eight new FPSOs with the capacity of 150 each, should we expect a fairly high utilization of that 150 or something lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the FPSOs we produce at the peak this 150,000 barrels per day.  This is a expected production.  But of course we will have a plateau and then a decline as we have in any other field, okay.  So this full capacity will be for a certain period that we don't know yet.  It will depend on the other tests that we are going to do, the pilot system of Tupi that we are going to evaluate and then the reservoir, and have more data.  But the peak production will be in this range, to 150 for a certain period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Paula Kovarsky from Ita&#xFA; Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone.  I actually have three questions.  First question is on CapEx and actually what I was trying to understand is the breakdown of CapEx spending.  So then in the strategic plan E&amp;P accounts for roughly 60% of the spending, and it was around 45% this quarter.  So I'd like to understand if this CapEx is supposed to increase in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And most importantly, if you could give us a little bit of color on how is it being spent between exploration and development production since some &#x2013; what we hear is that some of the suppliers think that the contracted processes are kind of slow, and there's not been so much CapEx in production and development.  So I would like to understand a little bit how those things are working?</p>
          <p>Second question relates to expenses.  Indeed the Company posted a significant improvement in operating expenses, and I would like to get &#x2013; to understand how recurring those improvements are, and what shall we expect for the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And then third question relates to the Gas &amp; Energy unit.  I was just trying to understand in a quarter where gas sales are still kind of low given the installment of the industrial production here in Brazil, and where sales into thermal plants electricity are also low, the Company posts its best results.  So I would like to understand how is the profitability of both Gas &amp; Energy sales, and how should we look at this unit going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start by the last one.  Let me have some help on this question, Paula.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Basically gross profit that brings out the results on the quarter, and we have about R$2 million in the Gas segment of growing profits, and 300 million in the Energy sectors.  And what happened basically is that to have an exchange rate effect impacting both segments in Gas and in Energy, and also in Energy sectors, what happens is that our Energy costs to purchase Energy was very low because of the spot price that we buy to sell our product trade agreements.</p>
          <p>Also natural gas will have a growing volume that also helps to bring more profits in relation with the last quarter.  We see month-by-month basically we see a growing volume in the industrial sectors and we'll see by &#x2013; until the end of the year we hope to be on the same level of profitability.  We don't see any more trouble ahead.  The only point is that the operator said that will not be any other thermal generator in the year, and that's just a problem, but we already knew about that, and what we are trying to develop is to optimize our revenues from product trade agreements, and taking the opportunity of the low cost of energy.  And also we hope that with the growing volume of the industrial market in the gas segment, we believe that we're going to be pay the &#x2013; a quite best position in the later of the year than we had in the last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what do you do with the gas that is not being burned into the thermal plants? I mean does that go as a loss to the E&amp;P division?  How does that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are trying to do is to make some options of short selling gas like one month agreements of contract and with a discount price.  And but we're not burning gas because of the market, that's the important thing to say. I think that E&amp;P could say a little bit above this point.  What we made is that we've management our supply and our logistics trying to cut this demand.  Like we take less gas from Bolivia, our oil camps, our gas camps that are not associated, we shut it down and we bring less G&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So we are very flexible from the supply side and we've very cheap with this, the low demand.  But I think the worst passed away, the first quarter was really bad about demand, and now we see a growing demand in the natural gas business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding the CapEx and the percentage of the different segments.  I guess the best way to view these is to look our &#x2013; at our five-year business plan.  We have from $174 billion of the total investment in five year, we have 104 for the E&amp;P.  And in, if you take one year or one quarter or six months, sometime you have different composition on the distribution of this CapEx.  But on the long run, the climate in the five-year business plan shall prevail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so you don't see any particular trend in the quarter, for instance when talking about investments in exploration, development and production, they're kind of following the originally planned trends, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sometimes they can speed up and sometime, depends on the moment.  Now, for example we are planning to receive six, we have six rigs in the Santos Basin pre-salt, and we are going to receive another two and another six next year.  So you'll see the expenditure in the entire area is going to increase.  I don't know if I fully answered you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.  And then just could you comment on the four billion investment in the International area of the quarter?</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Thanks for the update on the drilling plans.  I was wondering if you could provide an update on when you may give more information on the various reserves on the blocks.  You've given an initial estimate for Tupi and Guar&#xE1;.  After you're drilling the additional wells on the Tupi block, and after you're done drilling these additional wells on BM-S-9, might you give a further update on reserves then?  And I guess if you don't it then, when might you be providing additional details on that?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>And then if you'll bear with me with just one final question.  Has the Tupi extended well test, or any additional information you've gotten give you any encouragement in terms of what types of flow rates you can expect from individual wells in the pre-salt as well as what kind of reserve recoveries you might have?  I think an earlier question was noticing that the FPSOs actually seem like that they're going to be a little larger than originally thought.  Is that a function because you think the wells can flow at higher rates?  Or can you provide any comments along those lines?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well the extended well test of Tupi before we could start the production was producing 14,000 barrels per day as planned.  You know that we are limited to amount of gas we can flare, which is 500,000 cubic meters a day.  To know the productivity of the wells in the pre-salt, we. need to evaluate further to study with the data from the pilot system of Tupi because in that pilot system we will not have constraints regarding production.  In Espirito Santo, we have one pre-salt well.  We had used some production from other post-salt wells in the P34 platform so we could increase the production from Espirito Santo 138 to 18,000 barrels per day, that's the production today.  And so we will need to evaluate further now with the pilot system to see the productivity of the well for the permanent systems.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys.  Two quick question.  First Almir, looking at the 2009 capital spending plan, I think your budget is $28.6 billion U.S. with the exchange rate is changing, and also I think that the unit cost in some of the surface are also changing.  Any update in terms of how that number is going to look for this year and also any update for the 2010 number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, we did not change our expected CapEx for the remainder of the year, except by the exchange rate because if you divide the 60.5 or R$60.4 billion by 1.85 that is the current exchange rate, you will get more that $30 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or I mean can I ask in another way then, all of the R$60 billion or $28.6 billion U.S. that you originally have, how much of them is the U.S. dollar denominate and how much is real denominate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is about 60-40.....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it for R$60 or $60 U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>R$60 and $40 U.S.  As you know we are increasing our national content and many of these investments that is not in the E&amp;P, we can do it with a large national content.  So 60-40 I believe is a fairly number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  My second question that, in the second quarter 2009 do you have a underlift or a overlift in the quarter?  And also I think in the first quarter you have pretty large underlift.  By the end of the second quarter do you know from an inventory standpoint balance or that you are still underlift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See Paul, we're sorry, underlift?  I don't think we're familiar with the term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It means that your sales volume is lower than your actual production.  Because sometimes that due to the timing of the loading into the FPSO or into the BFCC to sell, sometimes that the sales volume may be lower than your production and maybe sometimes it's higher.  It looked like in the first quarter that you may have a underlift and that the &#x2013; wondering second quarter do you have an underlift or overlift?  And by the end of the second quarter your balance in your inventory level or is that you still have some catch up to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've asked a very technical question that we have to go back and try to find the answer for.  But I don't think anybody in this room knows the answer of the question right now, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can provide some clue on this because our total inventory at the beginning of the year were lower than at the end of the semester.  So we grew our inventories during these 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You increased your inventory or you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You increased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We increased, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that means that you probably have an underlift volume. Ted, if you don't mind, if you can send me e-mail back or give me a call let me know what that &#x2013; how much is still underlift?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And that if I could have a &#x2013; sneak in a last one.  Do you have any inventory gain or trading gain in the supply result for the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're actually referring to actual where we would recognize a gain.  Yeah, I don't think &#x2013; no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen, thank you.  I have a question on your downstream segment.  In your Slide 14, you show a favorable price effect on revenues between the first quarter and the second quarter, and yet between the two quarters your average oil product realization prices actually came down slightly.  So can you comment on some of the non-oil product related revenues in the quarter, maybe petrochemical or other related revenues that would be driving that favorable price effect?  And then how we should think about those types of revenues and that impact going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To just clarify, Kate, I mean you're looking at the price effect on revenues which is a positive number in the segment and then you're looking at the PMR and the realization which actually looks like it's come down during the period, is that what are you talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, your average domestic product, domestic market, oil price products came in a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could also be just &#x2013; remember also it could be exports because this only refers to domestic pricing.  Ask our <mark type="inaudible" /> guy if he can think of any other reason why the downstream or maybe our accounting would have an explanation.  I think it probably relates to fact that the PMR only includes domestic sales whereas the <mark type="inaudible" /> does include international sales particularly of the products that they export.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi again.  Two questions actually.  One is I'm wondering I mean can you give us an update about the investigation of the government on the Company on the tax, where we are in the process?  If you can just give an update on that.  And secondly, that what is your July and August basin and oil production so far?  Even at the low end of your target for 2009, you would suggest the second half 2009 your basin and oil production will need to be close to about 2.04 million barrels per day versus the second quarter of 1.964 or a tune of 1.927.  And doesn't seem like that you have any really major new port, or maybe just one more that will come onstream for the remaining of the year.  Is that still a little bit stretching here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paul, I have Molinari to comment the second question to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  We have July a production of 1.938 million barrels per day.  We have started production of five platforms this year.  So all of them is in the process of increasing production.  And we have P51 that started production 24th of January.  The first semester we have a production, average production of 45,000 barrels per day.  Now in the first days of August until 12 we have a production of 78,000 barrels per day.  Then we have <mark type="inaudible" />, that started production in February, 26th of February.  It produced 50,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2009.  The production now is 45,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>We have P53, that started production November last year and in the first half contributed with a 63,000 barrels per day of production, and now it's producing 94,000 barrels per day.  So we will not have a new platforms, now all of them are installed.  In the period of hump up of production, and besides that we have the two FPSOs that are not operated by Petrobras which is FPSOs project is operated by Chevron start production 20th of June.  And it's &#x2013; the production is very low at the moment but will hump up towards the end of the year.  And also Parque das Conchas Petrobras has 10% in project in Parque das Conchas operated by Shell, Petrobras has 35% working interest and has started production recently, July 12 and it's at a very small production at the moment but will kick up, hump up the production towards the end of the year.  So the second half, the production will grow basically with these platforms, is solid in the first half.</p>

          <p>Okay, Paul.  Regarding the Congressional Investigation Commission regarding the tax process, last week there were the hearing of the Head of the Brazilian IRS and the Congress.  And he said that really the law was not clear enough regarding the procedure that Petrobras admitted.  And so &#x2013; and there were no problem.  The idea of the no problem that it was not so clear, because the intention of the law was to hedge the companies, the Brazilian corporates that owns assets denominated in dollars.  And with the exchange rate variation they can have a gain or loss depending on this variation.  And the law came to protect this Company against payments of taxes any moment that they were not realizing the income they were earning or losing depending on the variation of exchange rate.</p>
          <p>So the procedure that Petrobras adopted was in line with the intention of the law.  And so the head of this commission accepted that the answer was enough and considered as normal procedure the procedure that Petrobras has adopted.  We don't expect to have any other investigation or further demands on this subject.  The other subjects were not yet tested, were not yet exempt in the Congress, but the tax procedure we are considering as soaked, and with no problems for Petrobras.</p>

          <p>Yeah.  I guess today or tomorrow there will be a new one.  Today, this afternoon, yes, the Congress is working and they are hearing the E&amp;P, the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency people.  And next week and on they will be inviting Petrobras employees to tell about the other subjects.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that means that the investigation is going to be continued for awhile, maybe not tax but on different subjects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, yes.  The Commission will be for &#x2013; working for maybe three, four, six months maybe.  Depending on the complexity of what they are finding or what they are willing to get.</p>
