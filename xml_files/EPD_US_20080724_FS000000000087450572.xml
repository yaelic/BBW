          <p>Good morning, and thank you all for standing by. This is the conference coordinator. All lines will be placed on listen-only until we're ready for the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce your first speaker, Mr. Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Laurie . Good morning, and welcome to the Enterprise Products conference call to discuss earnings for the second quarter of 2008. Mike Creel, Enterprise's President and CEO, will lead the call today, followed by Randy Fowler, the company's Executive Vice President and CFO. Also included on the call today from Enterprise is Dan Duncan, our Chairman and Founder, as well as other members of our senior management team. Also, Hank Bachman will lead the discussion on our Duncan Energy Partners earnings today. Afterward, we will open the call up for your questions.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during the call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Creel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy. And good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. We had another quarter of record operating and financial results supported by strong performance from each of our business segments. As we noted in the press release, this is the third consecutive quarter for our pipelines to transport in excess of 2 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids, and 8.5 trillion Btus per day of natural gas.</p>
          <p>Also for the third quarter in a row, we fractionated more than 400,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids. We benefited this quarter from volume and cash flows related to new assets and expansions we completed in the last 12 months. The Meeker and Pioneer gas processing facilities, which were completed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year respectively, contributed about $75 million to gross operating margin this quarter, and the Hobbs NGL fractionator completed in the third quarter of last year generated $9 million of gross operating margin this quarter. Gross operating margin from the Mid-America and Seminole NGL pipelines was $77 million this quarter, a 61% increase over the second quarter last year driven in part by the 50,000 barrel per day expansion of the Rocky Mountain leg with the Mid-America pipeline, which was completed late last year.</p>
          <p>Despite being down or operating at reduced volumes for 66 days during the quarter due to repairs. Independence Hub and Trail contributed $12 million of gross operating margin this quarter. These strong operating results underscore the benefit of our geographic and business diversification, especially since gross operating margin this quarter was $52 million lower than it otherwise would have been due to lost opportunity from the downtime and repair expenses associated with the Independence Project and the Pioneer gas processing plant.</p>
          <p>About $43 million of this was related to Independence, which was taken out of service for repairs on April the 8th, and then returned to partial service on June the 3rd and full service on June 14th. Pioneer was out of service for 24 days in April for repairs. Nevertheless, this was our second consecutive quarter of both gross -- record gross operating margin and record net income, and our third consecutive quarter of record EBITDA.</p>
          <p>We had $534 million of gross operating margin and for the first time exceeded $500 million of quarterly EBITDA at $506 million. Adjusting for earnings and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, EBITDA was $515 million for the second quarter. Distributable cash flow totaled $375 million this quarter after excluding gains and losses associated with interest rate hedging activities.</p>
          <p>Even with a loss on these hedges, distributable cash flow produced 1.4 times coverage of the $0.515 per unit distribution we declared with respect to the second quarter of this year. We retained approximately $86 million or 25% of our distributable cash flow this quarter, while still increasing the quarterly distribution rate by 6.7% year-over-year. For the first six months of 2008, we've retained $212 million of distributable cash flow, which provides us flexibility to reinvest in growth capital projects and reduce debt and further reduces our need to access the capital markets. We believe this is very important for our limited partners given the current volatility in the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Business segment. Each of our core business segments recorded higher cost operating margin this quarter, compared with the same quarter of last year. Our NGL Pipelines and Services segment benefited from strong overall demand for NGLs from the petrochemical and refining industries, reporting a 52% increase in gross operating margin in the second quarter, to $318 million.</p>
          <p>Each of the businesses in this segment reported higher gross operating margin this quarter, compared with the same quarter of last year. NGL demand for petrochemical production was strong in the second quarter despite annual turnarounds at several ethane-cracking facilities. Ethylene steam crackers produced an annual rate of 54 billion pounds or an operating rate of approximately 88%, and in June the operating rate increased to 89%. This high operating rate coupled with natural gas currently priced at approximately 47% of crude oil on a Btu basis resulted in ethane, propane and butane continuing to be the preferred feedstocks.</p>
          <p>According to the Hodson Report, ethane feedstock consumption by the U.S. ethylene industry increased to the highest level this year averaging 812,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2008, compared to 749,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas processing business posted a 92% increase in gross operating margin of $196 million in the second quarter of 2008, as a result of strong processing margins and increased volumes. About 74 million of the increase was from the Meeker and Pioneer processing plants. If Pioneer had operated for the full quarter, gross operating margin would have been higher by approximately $9 million.</p>
          <p>This month, Meeker has been extracting an average of 30 to 31,000 barrels per day of NGLs on inlet gas volumes of about 600 million cubic feet a day, while Pioneer is averaging 29 to 30,000 barrels per day of NGLs on inlet volumes of about 650 million cubic feet a day. Construction is well underway on Meeker 2, which should double the inlet capacity of the Meeker complex to 1.5 billion cubic feet a day, and should increase the liquid extraction capability to approximately 70,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>We expect this expansion to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. Our processing business benefited from strong gas processing margins this quarter. We've taken steps to preserve the attractive margins we've had by hedging approximately 80% of the NGLs we expect to extract from our Rocky Mountains' plants during the remainder of this year. And about 58% of our expected 2009 NGL production from these plants.</p>
          <p>We also had increased gross operating margin this quarter from our South Texas and Chaco plants due to improved gas processing margins and higher volumes. Increased drilling activity in South Texas has resulted in more natural gas being processed by our plants in that region. We've completed several expansions during the process of expanding other plants in South Texas that in the aggregate will increase our gas processing capacity by about 15 % of what it was a year ago, adding an additional 250 million cubic feet a day of gas processing capacity.</p>
          <p>We've also renegotiated roughly a third of our contracts that extended the terms for approximately 550 million cubic feet a day with major producers through 2012 to 2014. Gross operating margin from our NGL pipelines and storage business increased $94 million in the second quarter of 2008 and that's a 42 % increase over the $66 million reported in the second quarter of last year. This increase was due primarily to a $29 million increase in gross operating margin from the Mid-America and Seminole Pipelines.</p>
          <p>Mid-America Pipeline benefited from 114,000 barrel per day increase in NGL volumes and higher revenues due to a system wide tariff increase. Gross operating margin from the NGL fractionation business was $27 million this quarter, compared with $21 million reported in the second quarter of last year. This business benefited from the addition of the Hobbs NGL fractionator, which began service in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines and Services business reported a 48% increase in gross operating margin to $123 million for the quarter, compared with $83 million for the second quarter of last year. Most of our natural gas pipelines reported improved results this year. Gross operating margin for the San Juan System increased $18 million this quarter, primarily due to higher transportation fees that are indexed to natural gas prices, as well as from NGL and condensate sales. The Texas Intrastate System was up $9 million due to increased volumes and higher average transportation and reservation fees.</p>
          <p>The Acadian Gas System in Louisiana reported a $5 million increase and our share of the Jonah Gas Gathering System was up almost $4 million. In addition, natural gas storage reported an increase of $2 million, primarily from new capacity and pipeline fees at Petal. Gross operating margin for the Offshore Pipelines and Services segment was $35 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with $31 million in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Independence contributed a net $12 million to gross operating margin this quarter consisting of about $19.5 million from the Hub platform, offset by a loss of $7.7 million from the pipeline, which includes $14 million of repair expense. As I mentioned earlier, the pipeline in the platform were out of service for about two months in the quarter for repairs. Gross operating margin from the oil pipeline was up $16 million quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to Enterprise's 50% ownership interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline, which benefited from a 119% increase in transportation volumes and the retirement of project debt in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our Petrochemical Services segment turned in another solid quarter with 16% increase in gross operating margin to $58 million. The butane isomerization business continued to perform well, benefiting from strong demands for high-purity isobutane and the increase value of by-products. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter, setting new operational and financial milestones, as well as retaining a significant amount of distributable cash flow to provide us with additional financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Our latest distribution increase was our 16th consecutive quarterly increase and the 25th increase we've had since our IPO 10 years ago. The outlook for the remainder of 2008 continues to look favorable with the Meeker Phase II expansion, the Sherman Extension still on schedule to be completed and to begin operations during the remainder of this year. We expect the Exxon central treating facility to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year and to begin operations in the first quarter of 2009 along with our Shenzi oil pipeline.</p>
          <p>We're also pursuing a number of other opportunities to develop additional growth projects that will be completed and begin operations in 2009, 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Randy Fowler for a financial review of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'll pick up where Mike stopped and briefly discuss the income statement items below gross operating margin. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $136 million in the third quarter of -- second quarter of 2008 from 121 million for the second quarter of 2007, primarily due to increased property, plant and equipment from the additions of Independence, Meeker, Hobbs, the Mapple expansion of Pioneer and the propylene fractionator that we put in service last year.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense decreased to $24 million this quarter from $31 million in the second quarter of last year. If you recall, G&amp;A expense for the second quarter of 2007 included approximately $10.5 million of executive severance costs. Interest expense, and looking at that we reported $96 million of interest expense this quarter, compared to 71 million for the second quarter of last year, basically on higher average debt balance, average debt outstanding, including 100% of our hybrid securities was 7.6 billion this quarter, compared to 5.9 billion for the second quarter of last year. At the same time, capitalized interest decreased $2.8 million this quarter, compared to last year due to a decrease in construction work in progress as these new projects have come online.</p>
          <p>The provision for income taxes was $7 million for the second quarter of 2008, versus a credit of $2 million for the second quarter of 2007. This increase was due to higher -- excess margin tax accruals and higher corporate taxes at for Dixie Pipeline Company.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital expenditures, we invested 425 million in growth capital projects and spent $44 million in sustaining capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2008. The majority of the capital spent during the second quarter of 2008 was attributable to the Sherman Extension pipeline, the Meeker II hygienic plant, the Exxon central treating facility, and the Shenzi oil pipeline. During the first six months of 2008, we've invested approximately $1 billion in growth capital expenditures and spent $69 million in maintenance capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Based on our current slate of projects, we're still on track to invest approximately 1.6 to $1.7 billion on growth capital projects this year, and between 175 and $200 million in maintenance capital for the year. At June 30, 2008, we had $7.7 billion of debt, including 100% of our $1.25 billion of junior subordinated hybrid securities and 208 million for DEP debt.  EPD had liquidity at June 30th of approximately $1.3 billion. Our floating interest rate exposure was approximately 15% at the end of the quarter, and the average life of our debt was 17 years with an effective average cost of debt of approximately 5.8%.</p>
          <p>A key credit metric for Enterprise is our consolidated leverage ratio of debt to last 12 months' EBITDA. Consolidated debt includes DEP's debt and is adjusted to exclude 58% of our hybrid debt principal to recognize the average equity content credit given by the rating agencies. At June 30, our consolidated debt was $7.12 billion, EBITDA for the last 12 months after adjusting for equity earnings and actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates was 1.77 billion resulting in a consolidated leverage ratio at June 30 of 4.0 times.</p>
          <p>We've improved this ratio from 4.3 times at the end of 2007 and from 4.5 times at its peak at September 30th of last year. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we expect for this ratio to continue to improve as we realize a full 12 months' of cash flow from our new major growth projects. Before I finish the call today, I'd like to turn it over to Hank Bachman, President and CEO of Duncan Energy Partners to briefly discuss DEP's second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Randy. Duncan Energy Partners had another quarter of solid operating results, reporting a 45% increase in net income to $6.6 million or $0.32 per common unit for the second quarter of 2008, compared to $4.5 million or $0.22 per common unit for the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow for the second quarter of 2008 increased 65% to a record $10.8 million, from $6.6 million in the second quarter of 2007. In recognition of DEP's improving businesses, the Board of Directors of DEP's general partner increased the quarterly cash distribution rate to $0.42 per common unit, a 5% increase from the $0.40 quarterly distribution rate per common unit paid for the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The $4.2 million increase in distributable cash flow was primarily a result of higher sales volumes and improved sales margins on the Acadian Natural Gas Pipeline system, including a decrease in losses from lost and unaccounted for gas, increased NGLs storage fees and volumes at our Mont Belvieu NGL storage facilities and lower sustaining capital expenditures. As we discussed in our annual report last year, in connection with pipeline integrity work on our Acadian pipeline system, we encountered significant losses arising from lost and unaccounted for gas, which had historically not been experienced by the pipeline system.</p>
          <p>As a result of a great deal of effort over the past year, we've been able to correct this situation and have alleviated these losses. This quarter the partnership recorded it highest net income and distributable cash flow since its initial public offering in February 2007. I believe we can continue to post solid results, given the attractive markets we serve, our efficient operating systems and our affiliation with Enterprise products and its comprehensive network of integrated assets. Randy?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Hank. Laurie , now we're ready to take questions both on Enterprise and Duncan Energy Partners.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. At this time we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Mark Reichman with Sanders Morris and Harris. You may ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning. Just a couple of clarifying items. With regard to the three large capital projects that will go into service in the second half, are all three of those slated to -- it looks to me like they're slated to go into service in the fourth quarter. Are you able to provide any guidance in terms of what the expected gross operating margin contribution should be in the fourth quarter, or address it in kind of a volumes context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, as typical for Enterprise, we haven't given guidance on the company in general. We don't give guidance on specific assets. We do talk about obviously the margins in the area, the volumes that are there. Jim, do you want to talk a little bit about volumes that you are seeing currently at Meeker or what you might see there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect within a couple of months with Meeker 2 coming up, we'll have a couple of 100 million a day in Meeker. We expect that we will improve our ethane recoveries by virtue of the fact that we'll be able to run both plants together in the interim at an optimum level. And we expect the volume to ramp up as we've got a number of projects within the Piceance Basin that's going to enhance the flow of gas to that Meeker plant. In terms of margins, if you look in the fourth quarter of '08 in the Rocky Mountain area, you'll see in margins in the Rockies on a composite perspective in the fourth quarter, in the -- anywhere from $0.75 to $0.95 a gallon gross processing spreads, so we expect pretty strong margins to continue through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got Jim Cisarik in to talk a little bit about the Sherman Extension, you might want to flip the microphone up, you want to just talk about a little bit about what you're seeing in the Barnett Shale and kind of what do you think the ramp-up might look like for Sherman?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Yeah, actually with the Sherman Extension, we are scheduled some time next week to put a portion of the Sherman Extension in service, so we'll put it in interim service and flow it back into our traditional Enterprise Texas pipeline.  As of this time, the full service, we are thinking it will be in late 4Q, when the Gulf Crossing project becomes in service as well. At that time, we're projecting that our capacity will be full and flowing approximately a Bcf or slightly more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, Mark, the Exxon central treating facility, we expect to have that completed by the end of the year, but volumes won't be ready to start flowing until the first quarter of '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the other question on the offshore natural gas pipeline business, I noted the -- there were some producers that had shut in wells for workovers.  What would the volumes have been at more normal levels, and do you expect that most of that activity is complete?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not sure we can speak to what volumes would have been on in more normal times, these aren't exactly normal times. We are seeing new production coming on, which is always a good thing, but there's always ups and downs out there. We've got Jim Lytal, do you want to talk a little bit about what -- any production downtimes that might have been offshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think most of the production downtimes that we see, Mike, in there are &#x2013; they're due strictly to maintenance that they've performed on their wells, and due to the current prices, I doubt that they'll, they'll go ahead and have any gas that they won't put on as quickly as they can, so a lot of the maintenance work's probably going to be curtailed until we see what happens in the winter months, or gas prices, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me ask -- This is Dan Duncan, let me ask a question to either one of the Jims. I thought that BP -- one of the BP fields is now flowing and it started in the first quarter, and it keep ramping up, either Atlantis or one of big BP fields out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Atlantis field for BP has ramped-up. They currently have, I think six wells flowing, which is currently what they anticipate flowing. And so we've seen that on the -- our oil volumes through Cameron Highway. And we're not seeing a great deal of gas, but they hadn't anticipated <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did that do it, Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wachovia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. One, can you just give us your outlook going forward for what the pet-chem market looks like in terms of demand, both I guess domestically and internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me let Jim Teague field that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think as you saw in, as you heard in Mike's comments as he was reporting on our second quarter earnings, you saw extremely strong petrochemical demand for natural gas liquids, in particular, for ethane. What we're seeing today is the products we produce overwhelmingly being preferred by petrochemical plants. If you look at cash cost to producing ethylene, producing ethylene on a cash cost basis from heavy liquids like naphtha and gas oil, you've lost money relative to the ethylene market price. The only products that you make money on from a cash cost perspective producing ethylene through the second quarter and continuing today is ethane, propane and normal butane. So we see not only strong demand from those crackers that have had the flexibility to consume our products, we see increasing demand from those crackers that have traditionally used very little NGLs, as they have, if you would tweaked their operations to use it and are making capital expenditures to increase their ability to use it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let me, Jim, ask you a question on that, and I think they can understand it better if you are dealing in cents per gallon other than cents per pound. The difference on Permian and Gertch &#x2013; I think it's Permian and Gertch that goes out every week and shows a differential between the heavy end of the market to gas oils in the Napa versus Limian is what someone at $0.20 a pound, 80 to $0.90 a gallon.  That's the number they would understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The difference is, you're in the -- that's my petrochemical background. I think pounds when I'm thinking ethylene, but to convert it to gallon, $0.02 per gallon, Dan's right. You're probably producing ethylene at about $0.80 a gallon, cheaper using ethane than you are naphtha or gas oil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I guess maybe the next step to that question is, has the overall production of ethylene stayed steady, or I guess what I'm trying to get at is, are you seeing any reduction in overall demand for the end product, given the slowdown in the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what you've seen in reality with the weak dollar is you've seen quite a lot of as I understand it, a pretty strong export market for ethylene derivative producers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, that's helpful. Just had one other question. You talked about the potential for a lot of additional growth CapEx projects for '09 to 2011, I wonder if you could just -- any way you can comment about that both in terms of the magnitude of capital you're looking at, what areas or what types of projects you're considering and I don't know if you've provided, what level of capital spending you think you could have in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Mike. We haven't laid out anything specific for 2009. But if you look at the capital spend for last several years, and we have stated publicly that we see $1.5 billion a year easily for the next three to five years. In terms of specific projects, we rarely roll out any projects until they're pretty firm. We are working on a number of pipeline projects in the US. We've got a number of opportunities that we're looking in the Gulf of Mexico. We've got, if you look at the production in the Rocky Mountains, you can see that there is plenty of opportunities left there for further expansion of our facilities, continue to work on our storage assets. Really it is across our entire value chain. There is no one specific area that we're overly concentrated in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. My first question is on the second Meeker plant, if memory serves correct, I thought that the initial expectation was for the completion date to be somewhere around the third quarter or the end of the third quarter, and now it looks like it's going to be in the fourth quarter, so could you give us an update as well in terms of the scale of the costs to complete that plant and if it is pushed back, is there any incremental costs associated with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jim, we had -- really to look at that as a third quarter project, but it was late third quarter now it's early fourth, so it slipped a little bit but not a heck of a lot. Jim, do you have anything to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow on question on something that you mentioned earlier Mike, when you were discussing natural gas storage, and you're looking at your asset footprint, can you give us a little bit more insight into the ultimate goal for your natural gas storage, the type of optionality or flexibility that it could provide and the cost associated with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously as we look at natural gas storage, we're also looking at the storage market itself, and we have some opportunities at Petal that we've worked on, we had considered converting some of our carriers at Mont Belvieu but the economics today just don't really make sense. It may be something we look at in the future. From a marketing standpoint, and I'll let Chris Skoog talk to that a little bit, he looks at storage assets whether we own them or not, where it makes sense for us. And Chris, you might want to speak to that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Mike. Yeah, we're looking at storage all over the country right now. We're starting to build this marketing company. We like the upper Midwest, we like being closer to the marketplace, we think there's going to be ample storage area and along the Gulf, and that's kind of why we've held off on the Mont Belvieu for right now. It looks like there's an overbuilt situation coming on. With imports of LNG in here, it looks like there could be constraints here to get the gas North and East out of the Gulf Coast. We're looking more in that direction upper Midwest.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate it. And then, just one final question, as it relates to Duncan, and you mentioned this in the prepared commentary discussing pipeline integrity issues on the Acadian line. When you're looking more broad-based throughout the entire NGL pipeline storage business, are there any integrity issues that you see could be popping up in the third quarter here that we should be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really haven't seen a lot of surprises as we've gone through this. It's been a multi-year program that we've been going through, and we've gotten smarter each quarter. But let me let Bill Ordemann talk to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't see any surprises coming up right now. In fact, everything this year seems to be going pretty well. We're right on track of what we thought we were going to spend or slightly below and really no surprises that we've come across at all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Chris, let me ask you a question about natural gas from the time that you came on with your business plan last year, and I know Jim Teague had talked about this when we made decision last year to buying experienced people onto the deal. And give us a quick update on the amount of -- the number of people you've bought into your group? Also how much total intrastate interstate marketing gas are we handling now, relative to the total United States? Do you have that off the top of your head?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the relative terms, Dan, we've built the marketing company up to handling about a billion cubic feet of gas a day, as Enterprise now up from where we were about five or 600 million cubic feet second half of last year. I don't have it in relative terms to the national market but if 58 Bcf annual supplies on a daily basis this time of year. We're in at 1 or 2%, but we're rapidly growing. We're focused on mostly working with producers and with the end-user direct, we're not in the trading business. We're in the physical merchant business of handling gas, handling it physically, putting it in out of storage and meeting the at-needs market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've added &#x2013; we're up to 32 people from May down to through all the scheduling and commercial folks, I think there's about eight commercial traders right now, four schedulers and then the rest for accounting and contract admin folks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, 8 to10 Bcf a day is what is between all of our gathering transmission, that does not include our processing, our gathering and transmission pipelines, I think, we're at 8 to 10 Bcf a day, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we quoted 8.5 --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm right in there. I think the main thing we brought this up, we are developing a natural gas, as planned type of a business unit just like we do the NGL business plants. We only market gas basically around our own facilities, we're not out taking positions or hedging gas other than expanding.  We do buy gas now, we sell it in December, but we are really what we call flat book on natural gas relative to same as we're on natural gas liquids. There's no gambles that we're taking, and I know that's a hot issue in Tulsa, Oklahoma right now. But we are staying clean, we're not having those type of problems or will not have those types of problems. And we are building the natural gas and Chris is doing a super job, coming in and moving the natural gas in the same type of format that Jim Teague has always done in the natural gas liquids. And we only trade or we build natural gas around our own assets, which also gives us more transportation volume through our pipelines. And that was one of the reasons Duncan Energy and their Acadian gas moved up this year. But he done a lot of business, not making actual large margins on his profits, but he was moving gas through that system. So that was the main reason that Acadia moved up this year, over and above last year. But he came in here, what, a year ago, Chris?</p>

          <p>I was just throwing those in for you to make sure you all understand where we're trying to go in natural gas. Now, we'll go to the next question.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Sharon Louis with Wachovia. You may ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. My questions relates to DEP. Acadian's results have been quite strong year-to-date, but I was wondering if you could just comment on the incentive margins that you guys received and whether this is sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, do you want to talk about Acadian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Jim Cisarik, the incentive margin on one of our contracts, that I think averaged to the last seven years is about 1.8 to $2 million a year of gross profit that's attributable to that, but with that it ranges from zero to perhaps 3.5 or 4.  This year that's accounting for a couple of million dollars or will by the end of the year. But again, we never really know until the end of the year for the next year if we're going to have any incentive margin, but this year that will attribute a couple of million dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim, at a pretty high level you might want to explain what gives rise to that incentive margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, what happens on that is under a long-term utility contract we have. We're basically graded each month during the year, and that grade is how our weighted average cost of gas is under that contract compared to certain postings in the marketplace. But with that, we do have a grade each month and those 12 grades are in that calendar year are weighted-averaged and that results in a computation of the incentive margin for the subsequent year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So is the benefit from the second quarter from these incentive margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the benefit in the second quarter compared to last year really includes three to four items, one of which Hank mentioned, the alleviation of the LAUF is a pretty significant item. Secondly, we've had opportunities for spot sales in the second quarter. We positioned ourselves in the gas supply area in order to make those sales to traditional customers that have needed more load during 2Q. And I think -- and actually, we're starting to see the full results of an initiative we started about 18 months ago, where the transportation and sales margins have been increasing about a year and a half ago. We really started initiating those increases, and I think you're seeing the full results for those now in 2Q as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim, you might want to touch just a little bit on the initiative you've had looking at your ability to expand Acadian in certain areas and to capture additional markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. We put a team together about eight months ago, and that team has initiated several projects, not only expansion in some of the other end users along our system but really even more geared to the expansion of acquisition of supply bases and throughputs through the system, we have initiated several new interconnects with some of the interstate pipelines and we're working on several end user locations now to which we're not connected and I think probably in the next six to seven months you'll see the results of those efforts as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I guess moving on to potential dropdowns, I was wondering if there's any update on your outlook for dropdowns to DEP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think from Enterprise's standpoint, we are kind of in an enviable position among MLPs, where the business is growing great, we've got a very solid balance sheet. As Randy showed you our financial ratios are in line and improving, we really don't have a need to go back to the capital markets, either debt or equity this year. But obviously, we continue to look at our assets as Hank looks at opportunities. No definite timeline in place but as we've stated before, there certainly wasn't -- the objective was not to do a one-off transaction when we took DEP public.  The plan was for DEP among other things to help facilitate the growth of Enterprise so while you may not see anything near term, certainly stay tuned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Terrific. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically under that particular deal, though, we're probably looking long range and this was our plan when we went into it, is probably 40 to 60% dropdown -- probably 40 to 60% including organic and actually buying assets from other types of companies in DEP. We're looking at several different directions for DEP to grow, even working with Tefco II.  We work in both Tefco, EDP, and DEP. so we feel long range, the business plan that we formed when we did DEP and we did the road-show on it, it is very much intact and we plan on staying with that business plan.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know at this point of view, if I say it's impacting our future capital expansion plans, we're constantly looking at the economics of these projects and if they're good projects, we're proceeding with them. The cost escalation right now has been a little volatile, we see steel prices go up, come back down, go back up again, so I think we've seen in my mind, maybe a moderation in what's going on. We understand some new capacity will be coming on in the steel markets. I think our general expectations is that the rate of increase, at least is going to slow if not flatten out on steel. Labor's been very regional, we've had a few areas where labor costs continuing to go up, where we don't see that happening and don't see any problem getting labor. So it's been kind of volatile, but I don't -- I guess overall I'd say right now I see it kind of moderating compared to what it's done for the last two years, say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, for better or worse, we did have a big slug of construction work in progress beginning probably late 2005 and just starting to go into commercial operation late 2007 so we are past that big slug. Our biggest areas of cost overruns were in the Rocky Mountains with Meeker 1 and Pioneer and the returns on those projects far exceeded what we ever thought we'd see. So kind of a good news -- bad news, we did have higher costs but the economics are much much better than we'd expected. And all that starting to show up now and the result that you've seen in the last several quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say from an industry as a whole we will not see the missed cost increases as we did in the -- from the late 2005-06 timeframe. I think now we're all up to speed on what our costs are. So I think from an industry as a whole right now we won't see those big misses that we've had for the last couple of years. So, I think, if anything we started in the past year, we've stayed on top of and we've not had cost increases in the last 15 months that we didn't anticipate. So we're not missed supplying that cost relative to the revenue going forward now, like everybody was for about a two-year timeframe there.</p>

          <p>It was &#x2013; bear with me &#x2013; it'll be paid -- at the beginning of August it's $36.6 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the second quarter payment, that was made --</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It hasn't been made yet. It'll be paid in August with respect to the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First quarter payment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the payment that was made in May was about 35 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. All right, thank you. Thanks very much. No further questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Xin Liu with J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In terms of your coverage, distribution coverage, can you give us your thoughts on how you decide how much cash to be returned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's no formula, but as we said before we do have a fair amount of capital to spend. This is not a time where you want to be going to the equity or debt capital markets if you don't need to. And so our view is that it makes a whole lot more sense for our unit holders and for our debt holders if we retain a certain portion of our cash flow to reinvest in the company rather than distributing it out and then having to go back out the next quarter and raise additional equity. So we think this is a smart thing not only for the debt but also for the equity we think it provides a better long-term return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if the capital markets get better we would see a step function in terms of your growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it is a combination of things as we get more comfortable with our new assets, as we see how they're going to perform longer-term over a longer cycle, as the capital markets get a little more favorable we probably wouldn't see a need to have a 1.4, 1.5 times distribution coverage but we also wouldn't go down to a 1.05 or 1.0 times. So, we take a lot of different factors into consideration in determining what the appropriate distribution increase is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also can you give us a update on the hedges for your cap exposure in Meeker's and Pioneer second half of this year and '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me flip that over to Jim Teague.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for the balance of the year I think in the Rockies, if I am not mistaken we are about 80% hedged and in 2009 in the Rockies we're between 55 and 60% hedged for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't understand you, price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the average price, price that you locked in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In 2009, we're in the neighborhood of 75 to $0.80 a gallon but that's driven by the fact that we primarily did our propane plus so the ethane we have done less of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You really can go out and look at the forward curve and kind of figure out what that spread ought to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not with -- I don't know that Enterprise's hedges directly to a cents to gallon type of deal. We hedge more to natural gas liquid relative to natural gas, so how much natural gas liquid we get out on natural gas? So we hedge on what we call the differential between natural gas itself and natural gas liquids and it doesn't really -- it doesn't come into play on cents per gallon of actual selling the natural gas liquids. And that's the only true hedge that we have figured out in the natural gas liquids world, where you're not doing what we call dirty hedges. I know I think all of us has in the past tried to hedge natural gas liquid with crude oil and we tried to hedge with motor gasoline. The only true hedge we've come up with is natural gas liquid relative to natural gas, which is your cost of oil and natural gas liquids. That's your base cost that you start off with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also a follow on the question, natural gas marketing, how much gross-margin contribution is from that -- from the gas marketing and which segment you reported the earning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We include that in our natural gas, our Onshore Natural Gas segment, we don't break it out separately, because frankly it's hard to do that, as Jim Cisarik mentioned, part of the reason that the Acadian system saw an improvement was because of some marketing effort around that system. They also do some things around our Texas system to improve the transportation volumes. So the marketing gets spread among a lot of different segments, so we don't try to recreate that in the aggregate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from John Edwards with Morgan, Keegan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nice quarter. Just going off the question Xin Liu was asking on the natural gas marketing segment, how are you doing -- would you say relative to the plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're ahead of plan but let me let Chris about that a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we're ahead of plan and like I said, we're focused -- and Dan and Mike both alluded to, we're focused about physically marketing around this system and make sure we increase throughput. This is a physical marketing shop, we physically handle the gas, we do supplement financial hedging with our storage when we don't buy and sell in the open market on a daily basis, we don't have a sale today, we put it in storage, if we need to make an extra sale today, we pull it from storage and we use the appropriate financial tools to make that work. This isn't a speculative shop, we currently have around 4 billion cubic feet of gas in the ground right now, out of a possible 6 Bcf of total capacity that we have leased right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say this to what Chris and what Jim Teague volume own for and Jim is obviously in that department. It's a value chain deal the same as we have in natural gas liquids. So most of Chris's margin that flowed back into the Enterprise family is through the value chain and it go back into the pipeline, so you have continuously -- the pipeline goods from all of our different assets, intrastate Texas, intrastate Louisiana, and also the interstate market that we're now getting involved in, that's where the value will show up, more so there -- than it is on his actual profit and loss as a marketing tool. He makes two ways, he makes a value chain to those assets and he also makes profits back in there because it's all blended into that value chain of natural gas, just like we do natural gas liquids.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Appreciate the background on that. And then any update you can provide on progress with Pathfinder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we had the open season, we're pretty pleased with the results we've seen in that, we're continuing to work on the proceeding agreements, but beyond that we don't have a whole lot that we're prepared to report on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then the last thing, on the since you've already met your goal for cash vis-&#xE0;-vis your target you're talking about 200 million by the end of the year and you're already above that. Do you have a revised goal now that you've already met the original budgeted target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but there's a constant state of revision so we will let you know next quarter what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, thanks. Nice quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The provision changes on it every time we look at Jim Teague or Chris or Jim Cisarik or Jim Cisarik or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The good news is that it continues to move up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, just for clarification, our objective this year was $200 million plus and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>200 million-plus, I'm sorry, okay. So you're already in -- you're into the plus part of the goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Louis Shamie of Zimmer Lucas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. Excellent quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Louis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I just wanted to drill a little bit more into the margin that you achieved on the Meeker and Pioneer plants in the second quarter, can you guys give me the hedged and unhedged margin per gallon that you saw there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't, Louis -- I think what we try to do is break it out in sufficient detail in our earnings release and in our Q, but we aren't prepared to go into a lot of long division on specific hedges, specific plants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But in terms of number that you throw about -- the 75 to $0.95 for Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the forward hedges, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the forward hedges, how does that compare to what you've realized in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably around 50 to 60 at ballpark on our hedges for second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Compares pretty well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And then in terms of hedging for '09 when you quote the 75 to $0.85 that you've lost in on 58% of the volumes, first off, do you guys, are you willing to provide what that volume number is that you use to come up with that 58%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, didn't think so, but in terms of I think you mentioned you hedged at a little bit less than the other NGLs --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously when we're looking to hedge, we're looking at the more liquid markets, we're looking at the ones where we think we can lock in the best rates. It's not to say that later in the year we might not do something more with that thing, Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the other thing is that thing is so backward-dated we just don't believe the backwardation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's fair. I guess, the question is when you're quoting 75 to $0.85, is that including the proportion of amount of ethane, compared to your production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have some of that hedged and I think what Jim is talking about is kind of -- in the aggregate, that's kind of the ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, well, thanks a lot and again congratulations on the quarter.</p>
