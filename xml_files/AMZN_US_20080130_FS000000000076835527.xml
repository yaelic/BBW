          <p>Thanks, Rob. This was another successful year for Amazon.com. Let me start by reviewing 2007 financial results. Free cash flow grew 143% to $1.18 billion. The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 435 million shares compared with 436 million shares. Return on invested capital was 55%, up from 28%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities over five quarter ends.</p>
          <p>Revenue grew 39% to 14.84 billion or 35% excluding the $399 million favorable impact from year over year changes in foreign exchange rates. This was our fastest annual growth rate since 2000. North America revenue grew 38% to $8.1 billion and international grew 39% to 6.74 billion, 31% year over year excluding the year over year changes in FX. Additionally, EGM [Electronics and other General Merchandise] revenue surpassed 3 billion in North America and 2 billion in international for the first time.</p>
          <p>Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 70% to $849 million or 64% excluding $29 million of favorable year over year impact from foreign exchange; and operating margin increased 105 basis points to 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 69% to $655 million or 4.4% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Now I'll discuss the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue grew 42% to $5.67 billion or 37% excluding the $195 million favorable impact from year over year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $3.33 billion, up 33% or 28% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.21 billion, up 58%, or 54% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 39% of worldwide sales, up from 35%.</p>
          <p>Worldwide unit growth was 33%. Active customer accounts exceeded 76 million, up 19%. Worldwide active seller accounts were approximately 1.3 million, up 15%. Seller units were 26% of total units versus 25%.</p>
          <p>Worldwide gross profit was $1.17 billion, up 38%. Gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 20.6%, primarily due to lowering prices for customers and change in product mix, partially offset by increases in our seller business.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, tech and content, and G&amp;A combined was $842 million or 14.8% of sales, an improvement of 75 basis points year over year. Tech and content was $190 million or 3.4% of revenue compared with 4.1%.</p>
          <p>Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we did not allocate to segments our stock based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 40% to $3.08 billion, outpacing last year's Q4 growth of 31%. Media revenue grew 31% to $1.64 billion, where we saw increases in all categories. EGM revenue grew 53% to $1.34 billion, representing 43% of North America revenues, up from 40%. We saw another quarter of strong sales in electronics, toys and baby, soft goods which includes jewelry, apparel, shoes, and sporting goods.</p>
          <p>North America gross profit grew 31% to $698 million and gross margin decreased 143 basis points to 22.6%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 25% to $153 million, a 5% operating margin.</p>
          <p>In the International segment, revenue grew 46% to $2.59 billion. Revenue growth was 35% adjusting for the $188 million year over year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 36% to $1.69 billion or 26% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 68% to $877 million or 55% excluding FX. This was the fastest growth rate for international EGM in more than two years. EGM now represents 34% of international revenues, up from 29%.</p>
          <p>International gross profit grew 48% to $472 million or grew 37% excluding foreign exchange rates while gross margin increased 32 basis points to 18.2%, reflecting an increase in sales of products by sellers partially offset by lower prices to customers including free shipping and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 65% to $175 million, a 6.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international operating income increased 49%.</p>
          <p>CSOI [Consolidated Segment Operating Income] grew 44% to $328 million or 5.8% of revenue, up 6 basis points. The year ago quarter included an $8 million insurance recovery benefit in G&amp;A. Excluding this benefit, CSOI for the quarter would have grown 49% and been up 26 basis points. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 38% to $271 million or 4.8% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expense was $74 million in Q4 or a 26% rate for the quarter, which includes a $4 million benefit adjusted to reflect our annual effective tax rate of 28%. In 2007, we paid $24 million in cash taxes. The majority of our tax expense is non-cash because we have current tax benefits and NOLs related to excess stock based compensation. We expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 30% and we estimate cash taxes paid to be less than 75 million. However, there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis, not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income was $207 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared with $98 million and $0.23 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased 1.2 billion to $3.31 billion. In Q1 '07, we repurchased $248 million of our common stock or 6 million shares. Inventory increased 37% to $1.2 billion, and inventory turns were flat at 12.7 even as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels across product categories and geographies, and introduced new product categories. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $86 million from a year ago to 543 million. Our 2007 capital expenditures were $224 million.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. However, there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance.</p>
          <p>As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking our euro-denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances in foreign currencies that settle among subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't record any additional intangibles, any further revisions to stock based compensation, or our restructuring-related estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.</p>
          <p>For Q1, we expect net sales of between 3.95 and $4.15 billion, a growth of between 31 to 38%. This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact to foreign exchange. GAAP operating income will be between 155 million and $200 million or between 7% growth and 38% growth. This includes approximately 55 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 210 million and $255 million or between 17% growth and 42% growth.</p>
          <p>For calendar 2008, we expect net sales of between $18.75 billion and $19.75 billion, a growth of between 26 and 33%. This guidance anticipates greater than 200 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income will be between 785 million and $985 million or between 20% growth and 50% growth. This includes approximately $240 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 1.025 billion and 1.225 billion or between 21% growth and 44% growth. We intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis.</p>
          <p>We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time, with some variability including some changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation.</p>
          <p>We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, to be approximately $300 million.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to strive for year over year annual growth of free cash flow and free cash flow per share while investing in long term opportunities. We are confident that if we continue to improve customer experience and execute efficiently, our value proposition as well as our free cash flow will expand.</p>
          <p>Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q &amp; A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I think the question on everyone's mind is how should we begin to conceptualize the 20 basis points of margin expansion that is at the midpoint of your guidance for 2008 despite a really significant year over year revenue increase. It would seem as if you should be able to drive somewhat better margins given this type of growth. What is driving this? Is it Prime, higher overall cost of shipping? Any additional color would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We have given in terms of the guidance that we have given for the total year, you have a range certainly in terms of implied operating margins. If you take the low end of the guidance from the CSOI perspective and the high end, it's a range of 5.5% to 6.2%. That compares to 5.7% in 2007. Again, that's a range.</p>
          <p>Certainly as you think about our business in 2008, we're going to do more of the same that we did in 2007. We're going to make sure that we focus on the customer experience, which includes making sure that we have great prices across all of our categories and geographies. You saw that reflected in our Q4 results. We're going to continue to make sure that we have increased selection, have great in-stock levels. So all of those things are included in the guidance that we have given. And we are going to obviously still continue to invest appropriately, which is reflected in the guidance.</p>
          <p>The other aspect that you see because you see an effect that's essentially flat operating margins in Q4; and certainly one of the bigger drivers of that is the gross margin year over year decline. And with the great growth rate that we saw in Q4, when that happens, good things happen to us. What I mean by that, there's an opportunity to go to and work with our supplier base, our vendors, to get even better prices. So, that's something that certainly is an opportunity for us, and with the broad breadth of growth that we had across categories in all of our geographies, it's clearly an opportunity for us.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Heath Terry with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. To follow up on what Brian was asking, how does this affect and to what extent does it affect the long-term margin guidance that you have given us of being able to get to 10% margins in the business? And as you continue to take the incremental profit dollars that you are getting and plow them back into top line to drive growth, at what point do you allow some of that margin or how do you think about timing the allowance of some of that margin to actually flow to the bottom line, or is this going to be an ongoing process and we see 6% forever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of our expectation, nothing has changed. What we have said in the past is we think that double-digit operating margins are possible, but what we are really focused on is driving free cash flow and free cash flow per share. You can see that evidenced in our 2007 results total year as well as Q4. And so again, nothing is changed.</p>
          <p>We have also said that we think that double digits is possible, but it's a high single digit operating margin is the right thing to drive free cash flow, that's what we'll do. If you look at our Q4 results and take a look, you saw very strong growth. You saw operating margins that were flat year over year but still strong operating profit growth; and then free cash flow was more than doubled year over year. So again, we're focused on driving free cash flow per share. It's certainly our intention to improve operating leverage during 2008 and over time, we think that we can improve our operating margins as well.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just on the same subject, but a little bit more detailed; the international gross margin in the quarter on a year over year basis was actually up, so the decline was in the domestic margin. There are a lot of moving parts in your gross margin numbers related to these volume/price trade-offs that you talk about, but also the product mix and the direct business and the benefit from third-party sales. I was just wondering if you could talk about whether third-party mix is becoming less relevant driver of gross margin in the domestic business, and so possibly pricing decisions and the mix shift towards EGM and the direct businesses is maybe what's pressuring the domestic gross margin. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our seller business globally is very strong. We are continuing to try to work on that experience for sellers to make it even better. Certainly, our goal is to have sellers increase their sales on our platform, so we continue to do a number of different things to make it easier for them to sell, including FBA [Fulfillment By Amazon]. Again, we're pleased with our    seller business and I don't know if that answers your question. Was there a second part to the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second part is I was just wondering how much the mix shift towards EGM, which I believe is lower margin than the historical BMV [Books, Music, Video] direct business, if that's driving the domestic margins down a bit, the mix shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would probably describe the margin structure more like this. We have &#x2013; and this is globally. We have entered into a lot of new categories over the past few years, and when we enter those new categories, we're pricing very competitively day one, making sure that we have great prices for customers. It takes us a while to get the scale on those individual categories in those geographies. So when that happens, certainly you should expect that very oftentimes when we have a newer category that those are lower gross margins. Then as we get the scale in those individual categories, good things happen. We get more traffic, which helps our third-party business. It also helps us get better prices with our suppliers.</p>
          <p>So that's one of the reasons why we're excited about what we have seen throughout the course of 2007 and in Q4 is that we have gotten great growth and now the opportunity that we have in front of us is how do we again work better with &#x2013; even more closely with suppliers to get better prices. That's something that's not a media thing. It's just something that evolves over time as we continue to grow. So it's a good opportunity for us.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, two questions, first a top line question. Are you seeing any signs of consumer softness in spending? You organically showed revenue growth acceleration. It seemed to fly in the face of what most in-store retailers are seeing. Obviously there's secular growth on the Internet. Are you seeing anything perhaps in the March quarter that indicates softness or maybe a mix shift to lower priced products? Secondly, a quick question for you, Jeff; last quarter, you said that you didn't think R&amp;D cycles going forward would have the same step function impact on margins that they had between '04 and '06. Is any of the '08 guidance &#x2013; is there an implication in there that there's another major R&amp;D cycle coming? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, in terms of the economic piece, as you can see from the results of our business, it's fine. So we really cannot add much in terms of the economic piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your second question, I think what you were referring to that we have said over the last year or so that we expect to grow into the fixed expense that we very deliberately built in 2005 and the first part of 2006. Our intention at this point is to continue to demonstrate to ourselves this business model. So as Tom said, we intend to continue to get operating leverage during 2008 with CSOI growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Along with that as it relates to technology and content, we certainly would expect the technology and content growth to be somewhat less than revenue growth for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we believe we can do that. With respect to the step function part of your question, we believe we can do that while continuing to make investments in our digital businesses, in Amazon Kindle, in new category expansion, continuing to invest in China as we're doing, Fulfillment by Amazon in our seller business. Our Amazon Web Services business is another area of investment for us. So, when we look at &#x2013; that's what we mean by not necessarily having to take the same kind of step function increase that you saw in 2005 and the first part of 2006.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from David Joseph with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my question. It seems that you saw active customers accelerate again and active revenue per customer accelerate as well as units accelerated again to 33% year over year. Our guess or ongoing assumption is a lot of this is coming through Amazon Prime, not only because that's where you have free shipping but that's also where one-click shopping is merchandised pretty effectively. I'm just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of where this incremental growth is coming from, where the acquisition, where the activity is coming from. Is it really coming through Amazon Prime mainly or is there something else we might be missing here? Also in terms of the Kindle, can you give us an idea of what we can be expecting from that in 2008. Not necessarily, I mean if you could provide any information in terms of units or revenue growth but also what can we expect in terms of the margin? Should we expect some pressure to Amazon's margins from the Kindle? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The growth that we're seeing is broad based. It's coming from different geographies, different categories, different service offerings; so it's not any one particular thing. Certainly, Amazon Prime is a component of it. It continues to be a successful program. One of the reasons that Fulfillment by Amazon is an important program for our seller customers is that it drives &#x2013; the number one thing that sellers want is sales, and Fulfillment by Amazon drives sales for sellers. So when a seller switches to Fulfillment by Amazon, their sales increase. One of the reasons for that is that those items, those third-party items immediately become eligible for Amazon Prime, so Prime members can use their Amazon Prime memberships to buy third-party items as soon as that seller joins Fulfillment by Amazon. We shipped 0.5 million items in the fourth quarter on behalf of third-party sellers through Fulfillment by Amazon. So we're very excited about that investment.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Yes, Kindle in terms of demand is outpacing our expectations, which is certainly something that we're very grateful for. It's also on the manufacturing side causing us to scramble. We're working very hard to increase the number of units that we can build and supply per week so that we can get back &#x2013; our goal is to get into a situation as quickly as we can where when you order a Kindle, we ship it immediately. That's the standard we want to hold ourselves to, and we're working very hard to get there, and we're super excited by the very strong demand.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, a couple of questions, guys. User and unit growth accelerated again. Can you just talk about how much of this improvement is being driven by I guess price elasticity that's utilizing on your retail business versus newer services such as third-party out there or initiatives such as Prime? And the second question on Kindle, it looks like there's a lot of internal components from a build standpoint and it seems to be quite rich from a feature set standpoint. Are there capabilities that have yet to be turned on beyond just the e-book reader and browser functionality inside the Kindle at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Kindle has a few experimental features, some of which are visible on the Kindle. It has something called Now Now, where you can type in any question and using the mechanical Turk in the background, which is one of our web services, that question gets answered, and the answer to the question gets displayed on the Kindle. There is an experimental web browser on the Kindle, which is, actually for a mobile device, a pretty good web browser. Of course, it has the Whispernet EVDO connectivity which gives you broadband wireless access to that web browser. So there are a number of experimental features, and we have put those on there and made them accessible to customers so that these early Kindle users can tell us what they think of those features, whether we should continue to invest in them, continue to work on them and make them part of the product.</p>
          <p>In terms of the first part of your question related to the growth in units, I had mentioned the third-party or the seller percentage grew year over year, so seller units were growing at a faster rate. That gets back to some of the comments Jeff just made a minute ago about what we're doing to improve the seller experience. Then on the retail side, it's a lot of the things that we have been talking about. Again, the focus areas are value proposition, making sure we have great prices for customers, selection, convenience, and in-stock levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it's actually the retail business and your pricing that's helping to accelerate the unit growth and user growth, or do you think it's more the third-party selection side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, both are very strong, and certainly pricing is a key, but there are a lot of other key factors including Prime where customers are getting an increased share of wallet, a number of different factors: the fact that when customers come to our website now, more is in stock than it was 12 months ago or 24 months ago. So when that happens, certainly there is benefit from doing that as well as a lot of the other things that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's selection expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Selection expansion, exactly. It's a lot of the things that we have been talking about. They varied over the past several years, but we have continued to be focused on them, and it's showing up in our top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If may ask just a quick follow up, I guess the longer term theme at Amazon has been that you would use price as a way to drive growth in the business, and the idea was that you could always lower price because of the cost advantages that you have and the efficiencies that you are getting from economies of scale. I guess are you at a point now vis-&#xE0;-vis retail that you can drive prices lower and it's helping to accelerate the growth and you can always use that lever to control the growth of your overall business as a whole, or do you think it's still going to take maybe a couple more years to have that type of capability relative to I guess the retail formula, which is prices will tend to go higher in general because of the inflationary aspects of retail and of real estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if this directly answers your question or not. I think it does. One of the things that's clearly the case, and we have observed it over a number of years now is that in certain categories, we are seeing less elasticity from price reductions. That's something that you would expect to see happen because price elasticity curves are not linear. There's kind of an elbow in the curve right around where competitive prices are. You see a lot of elasticity as you lower prices to meet competitive pricing, and you don't see very much elasticity if you go below competitive pricing.</p>
          <p>So our focus has always been to be extremely competitive, and to get really operationally great at that so that our pricing is very, very sharp, and we're always giving customers the best possible deal; and at the same time to &#x2013; because we have the scale to have a very efficient cost structure to be able to do that in a sustainable way that's healthy for the business. And you can have a very nice flywheel there where the scale of the company increases, which allows us to be more efficient, to make better use of both our fixed costs and to do more to drive down variable costs, including, as Tom mentioned in some of our newer categories where we have not been operating as long. We're still getting to know the vendors in those categories, getting to know our suppliers, figuring out how to work most efficiently with them and we'll continue to do that.</p>
          <p>There are big opportunities for us. The way we look at this is lowering prices is easy. Being able to afford to lower prices is what's difficult. We have been working on that for many, many years now, and we expect to continue to work on it for our entire corporate existence. We know of lots of opportunities to improve our fixed costs, to improve our variable costs, and to improve our COGS through working together with our supplier base. Those opportunities exist in even the categories that we have been doing business in the longest. We still have opportunities in there. In our newer categories, we have a lot of low hanging fruit. There are more obvious pieces just because they're newer and we haven't done as much in those areas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys; a quick question, two parts on guidance going forward. eBay made some announcements the other day regarding changes to its platform, which is hoping to bring back some of the third-party sellers. Is your current guidance right now accounting for any sort of impact by eBay or do you think there will be any impact by eBay? And then I have one follow up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a longstanding practice of not talking about any specific company, but as it relates to our business, we have been and continue to be in a very competitive environment, and that's both online and offline. That's not anything new. It's something that we have been operating in for quite some time, and the way we address that is we focus on the customer and we have a number of different customers. We have certainly our direct customer that we're always trying to make sure we improve their experience. We have our sellers, which we view as partners and customers and we trying to improve that experience as well; and Jeff gave some great examples of that, as well as our developers. So, we're heads down focused on improving customer experience, and that's what we have been doing and that's what we plan on doing going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you started to see an impact when you think about reducing your take rate for third-party sellers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just say that this is such an intensely competitive environment and it has been from the very beginning. And there are &#x2013; we have lots of competitors; so for us, the way we think about our seller business, since that's the business that you are asking about, is we think of our sellers as a customer set. We try to figure out what they want. We try to figure out how to give it to them. We know that the number one thing that sellers want is sales. We also know that the market that we operate in, and we're very grateful for this fact, is a very, very large one and in our view, and we have always said this and I don't think it's going to change, is that there's room for lots of winners. So, we have a strategy that we're very, very focused on. We're not changing it. We like our strategy. We're just going to stay heads down.</p>
          <p>One of the great examples I can give you for trying to drive sales for sellers is the combination of Fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime. I talked about this just a couple of minutes ago, but it's a very good combination for sellers. As sellers continue to sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon and as our buyer customers continue to sign up for Amazon Prime, that combination is going to be very good for our buyer customers and it's going to be very good for our seller customers as well, and we love that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Two questions; number one, I was trying to get a better sense about what kind of adoption you are seeing for Prime in the international market. Is it similar to US, better than US or weaker than US? Any color would be very helpful. Secondly, international gross profit margin is still substantially lower than the US gross profit margins. How should we think about that difference to narrow over time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, in terms of international Prime, we're very excited with what we are seeing in each of the countries. It's very early, but we like what we see, and we're going to continue to look at all of the associated metrics for that program, but we're very pleased to be able to offer it to customers, and we like what we see so far.</p>
          <p>In terms of the gross margins, you're right that our gross margins in international are less than North America. Keep in mind that certainly our International segment has a number of different countries; and again, there's nothing really structurally different between the two segments, if you will. And so there are really opportunities to improve those margins over time. But we have said in the past that certainly our seller business, if you will, we're pleased with globally, but we have certainly a bigger penetration in our North America segment than we do in international, so that's an opportunity for us. It's an opportunity in both segments, if you will, but certainly we're pleased with what we see there.</p>
          <p>Again, if you think about also in international, if you look back we have launched many new categories over the past year, over the past few years. It again goes back to some of my comments that started the call. As those categories get larger and we get more traffic to those categories, it helps the third-party business. It also helps from an opportunity to work closer with suppliers, to get better, to work better with them to improve those prices as well. So again, that's certainly what we're working on and that's what you are seeing in our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may ask a follow-up question about the category expansion, I think you talked about as you continue to grow faster than the broader market, you will have better power with suppliers in terms of improving your gross profit margins. As you continue to expand your categories &#x2013; I know some of the categories are lower margins than your core media business, do you think you can still maintain the margins that you had in 2007 or 2006?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a wide range of categories. When we enter a new category, we're focused on first is it something that we think we can serve customers well in, something that we can add a lot of value to customers; and also do we think we can generate a lot of free cash flow. We certainly do look at a lot of different characteristics of those categories before entering them. But there certainly are categories &#x2013; an example would be diamonds within the jewelry category. That's something where it's possible to have lower gross margins but have very high contribution profit per unit for example. So first, we're optimizing from the investor standpoint for free cash flow and free cash flow per share and the way we do that is by improving the customer experience. So again,    we'll have a mix of different categories, some of which will have higher gross margins and lower gross margins, but our goal is again to maximize free cash flow per share over the long term.</p>

          <p>Thank you; I have two questions. First, you can tell us what is driving your projected 34% increase in CapEx spending in 2008 and how should we think about your free cash flow growth specifically this year? Then secondly, looks like you added 1,200 employees during the fourth quarter. What's the delta there versus the 600 that you added in 4Q '06 in terms of the composition of employees? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the employee one first. We did increase our employee base. The largest portion of that was certainly in our operations and fulfillment area with the growth that we experienced throughout 2007 as well as what you are seeing in Q4. We certainly improved -increased the staffing level to support that.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, I think you should probably take a look at it versus the incremental revenue that you are seeing; and again, it's in support of our overall business as we grow. So, that's what we are looking at.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of questions about your outlook which I think most people are wondering about. First, it looks like revenues higher than a lot of people were thinking but maybe margins lower; do you anticipate any changes in the mix between third-party units and your own units? And then secondly, does your outlook give you room to accelerate either new category launches internationally next year or new countries or fulfillment centers? What kind of flexibility have you built in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of &#x2013; the guidance that we have for 2008 reflects our best view of what's going to happen in 2008. As we talked about earlier, we are still investing, going to continue to invest in the business as Jeff highlighted a number of key areas. But as part of that, we expect it to be appropriate growth in terms of technology and content.</p>
          <p>In terms of some of the other things that you mentioned, you should expect that we're going to expand capacity as we have over the past few years to fulfill the demand for the range of guidance that we have given. You should also expect us to launch new categories as well during 2008. So, those are the things that we are going to continue to focus on. In addition to launching new categories, you should expect us to increase selection in our existing categories in each of our geographies. Those are things that we'll continue to work on to make that experience better for customers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not giving guidance on what the mix will look like and ultimately &#x2013; and this is both in 2008 and really any year. We view that nothing has changed, and we have said this consistently. Ultimately, the customer will decide where that mix ends up. That's both in the current year and long term. What we're focused on is making sure that the experience is great for our various customer sets. When we do that, we think we have nice opportunities to grow both our seller business as well as our retail business along with our other customer set as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question, if I may; the other US revenues were up 30 million year over year. It looks like nice growth there. Is that a positive lever for margin driver &#x2013; gross margins and what is really driving that growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't split up the margins of other, but certainly we have got a number of things going into other, but our Amazon Enterprise Solutions business, as we have talked about in the past, we have launched a number of new merchants, which is certainly helpful; Web Services as well. So again, it's a number of different components of that. We also have various marketing arrangements. Sometimes it's higher or lower depending upon the period. So there are a number of different things that are going into that line item.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I have a couple of questions. First, marketing costs were up slightly on a year over year basis as a percentage of revenues. I just wanted to see if there's anything specific to that and then one follow up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The marketing has been over in the past several years actually in a pretty tight band as a percentage of revenue. We continue to try to make sure that we make that spend more efficient, so there's nothing &#x2013; I don't think there's anything unusual with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then in terms of maybe a question for Jeff. In terms of the expectation the digital media business, obviously a lot of the traditional media in terms of books, music, movies is going more towards a download basis and you're clearly getting prepared for that day when you see more of that shift happening. Any sense on when you really start to see more of that shift happening and you what think the impact will be on your business? I guess how much you can offset the lower traditional media sales with your increased digital sales would be the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Long term, we're very optimistic about that because when media are physical products, it makes a lot of sense for a large majority of those sales to happen in the physical world. But as media becomes digital and downloaded and sent around wirelessly, et cetera, et cetera, it doesn't make so much sense to buy those in the physical world. So, our relative advantage relative to where the bulk of the sales are today &#x2013; the bulk of the sales today of course are in the physical world. So our relative advantage over time should improve relative to the physical world. So we're very in sort of the long term very excited about it.</p>
