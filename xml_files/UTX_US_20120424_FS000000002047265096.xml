        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>As you saw in the press release this morning, first quarter earnings per share were up 24% year-over-year to $1.31. That includes $0.21 of gain in excess of restructuring. Excluding these items for both years, earnings per share grew 2% to $1.10 which is a little better than we expected back in March. Keep in mind, mind, these results include $0.13 per share of headwind from higher pension costs, higher A&amp;D and negative FX.</p>
          <p>Stronger sales in our U.S. residential HVAC business toward the end of the quarter drove better than expected operating profit at UTC Climate, Controls and Security. On the other hand, while we know the urbanization trend will drive continued long-term growth, as we said in March, our business is China is off to a slow start. Otis new equipment sales in China were down 9% at constant currency in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The ongoing government effort to bring housing prices down has negatively impacted the higher end of the residential sector, which represents about half of Otis' China sales. We've also seen some pricing pressure in China and a temporary impact as a result of the Beijing metro incident last year. We've addressed the root cause of the incident and we're confident it's been corrected.</p>
          <p>As we all know, the global economy remains uneven. We have seen some encouraging signs in the U.S. over the past few months with an increase in residential construction and an improvement in consumer confidence, however, with continued weakness in Europe and the short-term slow slowdown in construction activity in China, we'll continue to focus on what we control as we usually do.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we invested $111 million in restructuring and the businesses continue to find ways to reduce structural costs. As a result, we're taking up our estimate for restructuring for the year to $450 million including the Goodrich related restructuring actions. That's up $100 million from our expectations in March.</p>
          <p>We also continue the process of evaluating and reshaping the UTC portfolio to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. And just as we did through the 2008 and 2009 recession, we continue to invest in E&amp;D, spending an incremental $77 million or $0.06 a share in the first quarter over the prior year's as we continue to develop innovative technologies like GTF and S-97 RAIDER that will give us a sustainable competitive advantage and deliver real value to the customers.</p>
          <p>So despite the uneven economic outlook, we remain confident in the full-year expectations for earnings per share of $5.30 to $5.50, that's 0% to 4% growth on $61 billion to $62 billion. That guidance includes the sales impact and net $0.25 EPS dilution from the proposed Goodrich acquisition which we still expect to close at midyear.</p>
          <p>As you heard from the business unit presidents in March, much of the operating profit growth will come in the back half of the year. As the year progresses, we'll see more normal year-on-year comparisons across our businesses and we believe that the Chinese government will continue to pull back on some of the tightening measures which should lead to improvement in the high end residential construction market in China.</p>
          <p>Okay, turning to first quarter results on slide 2, total sales were down 2%. Organic sales growth was 1% and in line with our expectations after a strong 9% organic growth in the first quarter of last year. Hamilton Sundstrand led the way this quarter with 10% organic revenue growth on strength in both commercial and military aerospace. Sikorsky sales on the other hand were down 15% organically following 15% growth in the first quarter of last year due to the absence of international development aircraft as well as lower than expected shipments at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Total segment operating profit was down 2% driven by the commercial businesses. The slow start in China and ongoing weakness in the European markets drove Otis' operating profit down 6% on flat sales. UTC Climate Controls and Security operating profit was down 5%. In March, you'll recall, we expected CCS to be down 10% after 70% growth in the first quarter of last year, but a strong rebound in residential cooling orders at the end of the quarter provided some unexpected upside.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sundstrand had another strong quarter with 15% operating profit growth from solid conversion on organic sales growth. Segment operating margins were down 10 basis points. A continued focus on cost reduction and product nearly offset the $0.13 of headwind we talked about from E&amp;D, pension and FX and about half of that headwind is actually in Pratt's results for the quarter. As I mentioned, earnings per share were $1.31, that's up 24%. A $0.23 gain from the 2006 to 2008 tax settlements and a $0.16 gain from the sale of a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture was partially offset by $0.09 of restructuring, $0.08 of impairment on assets held for sale at CCS and an additional penny for the legal reserve for the previously disclosed export licensing compliance matters.</p>
          <p>Excluding restructuring and all these one-time items in both years, earnings per share grew 2%. As I said, FX had a negative impact of $0.02 in the quarter, on top of that, deal costs from the Goodrich acquisition was an additional $0.02 of headwind.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow in the quarter was 95% of net income. As you saw in the press release, net income also had the benefit of non-cash items. So once again, very strong free cash flow generation as you have come to expect.</p>
          <p>We spent $72 million on acquisitions in the quarter and there was no share re-purchase. You'll recall we decided to suspend share buyback last September as a result of the Goodrich transaction.</p>
          <p>With our domestic pension plan, 90% funded at a discount rate of 4.6%, there will be no additional contributions to the domestic pension plans in 2012.</p>
          <p>Slide 3 now, on orders, briefly, you see selected order trends. Pratt &amp; Whitney large commercial engine spare orders were actually down 3% following the 33% growth in last year's first quarter. Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spare orders were up 1% with strength from 787 initial provisioning and this follows 23% growth in the first quarter of 2011, obviously tough compares, but still confident in our outlook for the year.</p>
          <p>We're keeping a close eye on oil prices due to the impact on airline profitability. Of course, on the flip side of these higher oil prices, this just enhances the value of the GTF offering which will provide a 16% better fuel efficiency than current engine design.</p>
          <p>On CCS, North American residential HVAC orders were up 10%. That's obviously better than we expected with the robust activity late in the quarter. At Otis, new equipment orders were down 10% at constant currency. Otis' new equipment orders in China contracted 21% at constant currency after growing 7% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe in our emerging market strategies which allow us to leverage our worldwide scale, deliver innovative products in a cost efficient way and deliver real value to our customers from Mumbai to Chengdu to Sao Paulo. We continue to see strong but moderating growth in these emerging markets, consistent with our expectations and, of course, well ahead of the growth rates in the developed markets.</p>
          <p>Although China orders were down 15% in the quarter across UTC, we saw good traction in the other BRIC markets with Brazil, Russia and India each up over 20% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So the first quarter results were a little better than we expected from what we told you just a few weeks ago. I'll come back and talk about the year in a little bit more detail, but first, let me turn it over to Maria to take you through the business unit results</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 4, at Otis, operating profit was down 6% in the quarter on flat sales. Operating margin was 21.4%, 140 basis points lower than prior year. Foreign currency translation reduced both sales and profit growth by about one point. At constant currency, new equipment sales were flat as a 9% decline in China was offset by continued growth in other emerging markets. On the same basis, service sales were up led by growth in modernization and contractual maintenance.</p>
          <p>Pricing pressure in Europe, higher commodity costs and a slow start in China, more than offset the benefits of cost reduction actions in the quarter. At constant currency, new equipment orders were down 10% with China down 21%. Consistent with guidance from the March analyst meeting, we expect the new equipment market in China to be up low to mid-single digits for the year.</p>
          <p>Otis will aggressively pursue restructuring actions this year. Otis' full year guidance of $50 million to $75 million of profit growth on mid-single digit sales growth assumes savings from further cost reduction as well as improvement in the top line, especially in China, for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>On slide 5, UTC Climate, Controls and Security profit contracted 5% in the quarter on 6% lower sales resulting in margin of 11.4%, up 20 basis points from prior year. Organic sales were up 1% following 12% growth in the first quarter of last year. Mid-single digit organic growth in the Europe and automation and controls businesses was partially offset by modest contraction in Asia and Transicold as well as the impact of our Thailand factory which resumed operations in March.</p>
          <p>As Greg mentioned, better than expected profit performance was driven by strong U.S. residential HVAC orders in the second half of March. This drove low single digit growth in split systems unit shipments for the quarter as CCS benefited from warmer than normal temperatures across much of the U.S.</p>
          <p>About half of the $25 million year-over-year profit decline is driven by the absence of a gain on the sale of the U.K. guarding business last year. The balance is largely in the Americas business, primarily lower furnace volume. For the full year, CCS continues to expect operating profit growth of about $225 million on 4% organic sales growth. But given the recently announced portfolio transactions, reported sales will be down low single digits.</p>
          <p>Turning to aerospace on slide 6, at Pratt &amp; Whitney, sales were up 6% in the first quarter, including 1 point of unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Sales growth was driven by higher military and Pratt Canada engine sales and higher industrial volume at power systems and was partially offset by lower commercial aftermarket and engine deliveries. Large commercial spares were down 4% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the quarter was down 1%. Higher E&amp;D, pension costs and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada were partially offset by the benefit of net higher sales and restructuring savings as well as the benefit from a contract termination of about $0.02. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt &amp; Whitney operating profit to be down $25 million to $50 million on high single digit sales growth.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sundstrand posted a strong quarter with profit growth of 15% on 9% higher sales. Sales growth came from both OEM and aftermarket, each up high single digits. 787 provisioning sales drove the aftermarket growth. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by the benefits of increased aftermarket volume and lower E&amp;D. This was partially offset by higher pension costs. Operating margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 16.2%. For the full year, we continue to expect Hamilton Sundstrand operating profit to be up $75 million to $100 million and sales up high single digits.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sikorsky on slide 8, operating profit declined by 2% on 15% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 39 aircraft. 34 aircraft were based on military platforms and five commercial. Sales were lower driven by 19 fewer aircraft deliveries including the absence of international development aircraft and lower U.S. government deliveries. On profit, benefit from strong aftermarket performance and the absence of one Canadian maritime helicopter was offset by lower military aircraft deliveries and higher E&amp;D spend.</p>
          <p>Of note during the quarter, Sikorsky signed a contract with Bond Aviation Group for 16 firm S-92 helicopters, marking the largest one-time order of S-92 aircraft ever received. For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of approximately $50 million to $75 million on mid-single digit sales declines.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maria. Before we go to the full year, let me give you an update on some of the other activity that's going on at UTC, and there are a lot of things going on. The good news is they're all on track. Our two new organizations, CCS and PAS, are both in place and we're encouraged by the results so far.</p>
          <p>First at CCS, Climate Controls and Security, Geraud and the team are progressing well with the integration of our new organization and they've begun the portfolio transformation of the legacy fire and security business with the divestiture of the U.S. branch operations announced earlier this month. CCS also formed a joint venture with Watsco for distribution in Canada building on our successful partnership in the United States. All of this comes while CCS continues to innovate and produce the most efficient solutions for both our residential and commercial customers.</p>
          <p>On the aerospace side, Alain and the team at Propulsion and Aerospace Systems continue to make great progress on the Goodrich integration planning. We've also fine-tuned our financing plan, reducing the need for an equity issuance from $4 billion to only $1.5 billion and we've made good progress on the divestitures that we announced last month and we're on track to complete these divestitures before year end.</p>
          <p>Proceeds from these divestitures will help to finance the Goodrich acquisition and more importantly, allow us to focus on our core business of aerospace and commercial buildings. We expect to sign a contract shortly for Rocketdyne and initial bids show very strong interest for the industrial businesses.</p>
          <p>As you saw in the press release this morning, we recorded charges in the first quarter in discontinue operations, but we expect net gains for the full year as the sale of these businesses is completed.</p>
          <p>Okay. At Pratt Whitney in the quarter we secured an additional 156 firm orders for the A320 engine. The GTF engine continues to validate performance characteristics in testing with now over 2,100 hours complete and the first flight of the Mitsubishi regional jet engine is scheduled for later this month.</p>
          <p>So good progress on our new organization and we continue to execute on the transformational changes to the UTC portfolio. As for the outlook for 2012, we remain confident in our guidance of $5.30 to $5.50. That's 0 to 4% growth, as I said, on sales of $61 billion to $62 billion including Goodrich. Q1 was a little better than expected but as we told you, most of the operating profit growth will be in the back half. Sikorsky shipments are weighted toward the back half with about a third in the first half and two-thirds of the back half. CCS faces easier compares and will realize more benefit from the integration and portfolio transformation and Otis still expects improvement in the new equipment market as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>As for other elements of our guidance, we have visibilities on an additional $100 million of gains so we now expect $600 million for the full year and we expect the excess of $0.21 gain from the first quarter will be offset in the back half of the year with restructuring in both Goodrich and the core business.</p>
          <p>We expect engineering and development to increase by about $150 million primarily at Pratt Whitney and our first quarter operational tax rate came in right where we expected at 32% and we continue to expect an operational tax rate for the full year of 29.5%, although, of course, there's volatility across the quarters.</p>
          <p>On cash flow, we continue to expect free cash flow to equal or exceed net income for the full year. With our transformational deals, new organization, industry-leading franchises and a sustained focus on structural cost reduction, we are well positioned for long-term earnings growth. With that, let me stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greg, can you give us a little more color on where you're actually going after the additional restructuring with the gains that you're finding and some color on kind of resulting benefits from restructuring in 2012 and 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we did about $111 million of restructuring, I think in the first quarter. That really was spread out: with Otis there was about $28 million; CCS, about $35 million; Pratt, $37 million and a little bit at Sikorsky and Hamilton. I think you are going to continue to see spending in those three businesses primarily. Certainly as Geraud continues with the CCS portfolio transformation, you are going to see additional restructuring actions there. Otis, again, continues to look for ways to reduce some structural costs so I think you will see additional restructuring at Otis and the same at Pratt Whitney. So I think those three big businesses will probably get the bulk of it and also keep in mind there will probably be $150 million of restructuring associated with the Goodrich acquisition, so again, that's all back half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we expect those restructuring costs to pay back in similar dollars into 2013, or what's the payback look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The payback on the programs that we're looking at today are between one and two years. I think some of the Goodrich payback will be very quick. It will be SG&amp;A overhead as we eliminate some duplicative functions. Some of the bigger restructuring just as we're looking at capacity will take a little bit longer. Usually in one and two years is the average payback we're seeing. Some of the quicker SG&amp;A stuff like we did at CCS earlier this year, we're seeing that benefit this year. You'll recall that Geraud's roadmap to $225 had savings in there from restructuring in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the magnitude of price pressure at Otis and is there any way to kind of measure how significant kind of the fallout from the metro accident actually has been and, you know, are you confident that cloud is fully lifted at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's talk about pricing first, and then we can touch on the Beijing metro. Last year in July, we saw the spike in rare earth metals in China, and Otis, I think, reacted very quickly to try and raise prices. In fact, I think we raised prices about 5% last July. Unfortunately, that price increase did not get much traction in the market and in fact, resulted in some of the declines that we've seen in orders even into the first quarter of this year. One of the things that Pedro and team are doing right now is going back and relooking at pricing. Obviously, the headwind from the rare earths has abated so I think there's a good case to be made there to adjust pricing but it certainly hurt in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>You know, the Beijing metro incident, again, I think that's behind us. You know, again, that was a tragic accident. I think everybody is aware of an escalator incident in Beijing. Again, we're working with the Beijing government and hope that's behind us. It's one of these difficult things, obviously, when you have an accident that gets that kind of visibility but we're doing the right things in terms of working with the customers and working to make sure that the brand has not been damaged in any way.</p>
          <p>The other thing to keep in mind in terms of the Otis China situation in the quarter and even into the last year is the mix issue. Again, we are strongest in that the residential construction market and obviously where the growth is coming is primarily in the social side where we're not as strong. So been hurt by mix, we've been hurt by pricing and hurt a little bit by this Beijing metro. So, all of it's correctable and as the year progresses we expect to have better results in China. Plus, you're going to see some of the tightening measures loosen there to, again, hopefully improve the outlook to get back to kind of a more normal growth rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p>
          <p>Maria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is on drilling down into Otis. Just I want to drill down a little bit more into these margins which were a bit below our number and certainly below where they've been for a few years on a quarterly basis and sales were flat overall for the business and the mix from a service and OE standpoint even improved a little bit. I understand China is good margin on the OE side, but Greg, is there any way of maybe &#x2013; I don't know, explaining a little bit more clearly what's happening there and if you think maybe this is a blip this quarter or we should maybe expect margins to come off a little bit from what we've used to expecting here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Margins are still pretty good. I'll give you that, but they were down 103 basis points. I think there are really two big pieces here to the margin decline. First of all, we saw commodities and this is as we continue to bleed off the inventory some of this rare earth metals you saw about, what, 60 basis points, I think, of margin deterioration just from commodities in the quarter. So that's a big number. The other 40 basis points of contraction came from the pricing that we talked about. So that's really the biggest piece of this. We also are continuing to make investments around the world, we're continuing to build out the CLC in Shanghai and as well as to consolidate the factory down in South Carolina, so just some unusual expenses, so I'd expect, again, margins should get better, but certainly we're not really surprised that we were contracted in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the margin erosion was exclusively on the OE side and service margins were flat or up a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact, a little bit of that pricing that we talked about actually came on the service side and most of that came in Europe where we continue to see a little bit of pricing pressure on service. I think Pedro mentioned that back in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then switching over to CCS, I guess the reduction in the sales expectation is due to the divestiture you announced. What exactly is in there now for incremental divestitures over the remainder of year? And then, additionally, within the same segments, there was a nice surprise in, I guess in the second half of March. You got a nice surge of orders in U.S. residential. How much can we read through for the season and for Q2 specifically and how much might this continue?</p>

          <p>Let me take the second part of that question first which is the res market improvement. Obviously, we stood up in March and we talked about CCS being down about 10% in earnings after being up 70% last year and actually came in only down about 5% and that was really on the back of this surge in orders that we saw in the residential side and really on the cooling side. I think orders were down in the first two months of the quarter and then really came back and I think overall res orders were about &#x2013; up about 10% and we think cooling was up almost 19% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So again, all of that strength really came in the back half, you know, obviously there was no heating season so there's not much to talk about on the heating side. We picked up, you know, a little bit of share maybe in the quarter on really a strong rebound and I guess, it's not surprising that we did see pickup in the residential construction markets in the first quarter and with the warm weather, it was a pleasant surprise. As far as the year in terms of what's in, I don't know, Maria, do you have the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have &#x2013; the organic growth for CCS remains about 4%. So, yeah, 4% growth. FX, you know, probably account for about a 2% headwind and then the acquisitions net is, you know, probably about, you know, 5% to 6% on sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what do you have done right now in terms of the deals you've already announced? How much would that reduce sales at it point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The AFSS announcement was about $200 million for the rest of the year, divestiture impact and the Canadian distribution was about $100 million. That's about $300 million incrementally from what we would have had in the prior guidance and that's included in the 4% to 5% acquisition divestiture net.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we talked about $750 million of divestitures around this portfolio transformation. You know, we're getting towards that number, but we still have a little ways to go so there's probably another $250 million or so that might get divested. You just won't see a full year impact of that. We'll be out in front of that with you, Joe, as we get those deals done.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. A question back on &#x2013; clarification, I guess, on the CCS business. The divestiture lowered sales expectation for the year, you left EBIT intact. Was that having the resi upper in there or were the divestitures not really contributing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Divestitures weren't really contributing. We're still on track, I think for res in terms of sales up about 3% to 5% and you know, the guidance is still up $225. I would tell you, the res, although it was good for the end of March and into early April here, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves with the cooling season here. We saw this play out last year. We had a very strong first quarter and then a slowdown throughout the year.</p>
          <p>So right now, the $225 is still the guidance and there's still a task out there to hit even that number and Geraud has got a line of sight to do that through additional restructuring. If there is some upside related to the res business, we'll certainly see that in the next quarter here, but for right now, I don't think &#x2013; we're not anticipating any big upsurge beyond that 3% to 5% that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the other one was on Otis in terms of the full-year outlook for sales. Can you talk about what you're expecting for Otis versus the market, and if there's any share gain built into your expectation and kind of how were you in the first quarter? If you didn't have a share gain, what would that mean to kind of the EBIT outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the quarter, obviously, sales were flattish with earnings down 6% and we probably lost a little bit of share in China. Probably held share around the rest of the world. Clearly we're expecting to get a little bit of traction. I think we have new equipment up kind of mid-single digits from a guidance standpoint and that assumes, again, a little bit of improvement here in North America, flat in Europe and normal kind of growth rates around the rest of the world. So a little bit of share loss in the first quarter but again, we're expecting we'll get that back as the year progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more thing, just specifically on the China market, you know, we talked about the pressure that we're seeing on the high end residential side and we think that was sort of down, double digits in the quarter. We do think that that will likely with the pullback on some of the tightening measures with the China government, that will likely not be down as much for the year so that would help the overall market in China improve.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen &amp; Company, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. So could you give us some more color on the spares orders at Pratt and Hamilton Sundstrand, how &#x2013; were they at all impacted by pre-buying in the fourth quarter and maybe some color on what you're seeing here in the early days of April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, spares, Cai, as I said, we were down 3% at Pratt after being up 33% last year in the first quarter. So in my own view it is just a tough compare. We seem to be &#x2013; we're on track, we think, at Pratt for mid-single digit growth in spares for the year. I think we've got a line of sight to that based upon the shop visits that are scheduled and our talks and you know, dealings with the airlines. So again, first quarter was tough, you know, again. Part of this, again, you never know how much pre-buy goes on at the end of the year with price increases, so first quarter is sometimes light but I think we're pretty much on track at Pratt.</p>
          <p>At Hamilton, again, up 1% versus 23% last year in the first quarter, so again, a very tough compare. Repair inputs were actually down a little bit in the quarter more than expected, so that's just a timing issue. We still know that flight hours are way up. The RPMs are up, ASMs are up and capacity is up so the airlines are still making money despite the oil prices where they are so we're going to see the repairs come in at Hamilton and I think we've got up nearly 10% in the expectation for spares and part of that will be the benefit from additional 787 provisioning which continues to be robust as well as a recovery, I think, in this repair activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so some of that really looks like it was largely timing then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>R&amp;D, you know, was up year-over-year. I guess you're going at your annualized run-rate. Is there anything in terms of the timing there, you know, is that going to be flat throughout the year or how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you think about it, we were up $77 million in the quarter and a little more than $50 million of that was at Pratt and really Pratt is now on the run-rate that we expect for the rest of the year. You'll recall, we had a slow start to last year but eventually, they were up more than $225 million in E&amp;D, so this is really getting Pratt on the run-rate. So you'll see the increases slow down. Obviously, the $150 million expectation of increase, half of it was in the first quarter and so again, you'll see a little bit more increase in the second and then flatten out towards the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, the C series engine should be certified by the fourth quarter, so there will be a step-down in spending there, making good progress on the other engines as well. So again, this is the peak year for engineering spending at Pratt Whitney. I know Mr. Bellemare and Mr. Hess are keenly aware of the commitment to you all to make sure that this is the peak year and that still should be the case.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last quick one, Goodrich you said you still expect to close at mid-year and yet given that the EC has gone into phase II, is it maybe more likely than mid-year would be maybe late July or early August which is still near mid-year? Maybe you can update us there.</p>

          <p>I really can't comment, Cai, on where we are with the regulators. We're obviously working with the DOJ. We're working with the EU and we believe we're still on track and I said mid-year, you know, whether that's plus or minus a couple of weeks, I couldn't handicap it that closely, but I would tell you we're still highly confident that we're on track to close the deal.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple quick ones. One a sort of point of clarification on Joe's question relating to the Otis margins. So you called out 40 bps of headwind from pricing and 60 bps from the rare earth, you know, impact, but you know, given that they were down a little bit more sort of implies a profit differential in China versus the other emerging markets that you called out that were growing that would be pretty substantial. Is that right? How big should we be thinking the margin differential is between China and the rest of the BRIC countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The margins in China are probably, they're comparable to overall Otis margins. Again, it's mostly a new equipment business there. If you think about it, earnings in China were obviously adversely affected and hurt margin as we lost some sales there and sales were down 9% in the quarter. So that obviously had an impact. I wouldn't diminish the impact of what's going on in Europe either with a very slow start there on the service side. You know, it's really Europe and China I would say were the two pieces of the puzzle here in terms of where we saw the earnings decline and the margin decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and on Pratt, you called out a favorable contract termination. I presume that helped the margins in the quarter. Can you quantify how big that may have been in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one last quick one on the 787 initial provisioning for Hamilton, do you have a sense of how much that's contributing to your full-year growth guidance for spares at Hamilton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 787 provisioning, yeah, I think last year it contributed about, let's see, about $70 million of provisioning benefit last year from 787. We probably expect a similar amount this year. So it's a meaningful piece of the growth year-over-year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Greg, you can go through in terms of Otis for the rest of the year when you think about getting to your numbers, can you break it out a little bit between this high-end resi piece, the public housing piece and commercial and just give kind of a sense of what you expect for the different components?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we would expect, as we said, the social housing piece and we continue to see decent growth in that market in the first quarter. We would expect to see the residential pick up in the second quarter from what we saw in the first quarter and on the commercial side, it's really &#x2013; it's slowing growth but still growing. Really, this is really a story about the residential, the high end residential and the government there has started to ease and we have seen prices come down in the market, and we continue to expect again, that the growth will come during the back half of the year. Probably not going to see a lot of growth here in the second quarter, but again, as the year progresses, we should see good growth.</p>
          <p>And again, China it's a huge market, huge market for us. Obviously, most of the growth is starting to come now in the western part of the country in places like Chengdu and Chongqing and all of those. We've got good positions there. We've got the new Gen 2 low cost elevator at our factory in Chongqing that's going to be opening later this year, which should, again, provide some impetus for growth and should help us attack even more the low end social housing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the higher end resi piece, are you seeing any evidence of this, you know, loosening starting to feed through yet? And I guess if it doesn't &#x2013; if not, is there sort of a plan B?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would tell you, right now we have not seen much of an impact. Again we still see prices last month were down about 1%. You know, we think, you know, we saw the loosening start in the first quarter. We expect that's going to continue, but we really don't expect to see any significant movement in the market really until the second half. If that doesn't happen, obviously, there's, you know, there's a risk to Otis' guidance for the full year. Think about first quarter. We're down 6%. For the full year, we're talking up $50 million to $75 million so there's obviously some need for improvement as we go throughout the year. Overall, though, again all of the risk out there in Otis I think is more than covered by what we have in terms of contingency at the UTC level. We're still highly confident in the guidance and even if Otis China doesn't recover as fast as we expect, it still should not be an issue at the UTC level.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks, and maybe I missed it. Did you go through what commercial equipment and container actually did in the quarter, truck trailer, some of the subcomponents of Carrier?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. If you look at commercial HVAC orders for new equipment, overall they were up high single digits at constant currency with North America up about 20%. That continues to be strong. EMEA up low single digits and Asia, down mid-single digits, so that's commercial HVAC. You also asked about the other pieces.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Transicold, transport, refrigeration, as expected, that was down about 15%, mid-teens range as we had expected. Again, the weakness there was primarily in Europe truck-trailer as the European economy continues to sputter. I think one of the good news pieces on commercial refrigeration, we actually saw some decent kind of sales growth so up high teens organically, which was good news.</p>
          <p>Also on the ACS business, the automated controls business, that was up revenues kind of high single digit. You know, a little bit of weakness at Transicold as we had expected, pretty good on the commercial HVAC and strength in ACS and refrigeration.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Greg, CCS obviously outperformed a bit on the first quarter on the operating profit side down about 5, I think you said down 10 to 15. You had said &#x2013; you guys had talked about a flat first half. Is that what you're still looking at or is the second quarter a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had said a flat first half with first quarter down 10%, now with first quarter only down 5%. I think second quarter will continue as we had expected which means it will actually start growing earnings in the second quarter so a little bit better first half than what we had expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry to go back to Otis China, but I guess a couple questions. First of all, the down 9% on new equipment, how did that compare to your expectations for the first quarter? And then looking at comps, it looks like the comps are very difficult for China new equipment in the second and third quarter and then they ease in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's right. I think what we saw in the second and third quarter last year was 20 to 30% growth and then it slowed down to about 7% growth in orders in the fourth quarter of last year. As far as our expectation, obviously we came in a little light to expectations in the first quarter, down 9% on orders that were down 21%. We went into the year with a strong backlog, up about 20% year-over-year. But again, with the slowing measures out there what we have seen is the deferral and delay on some of the shipments from the factory to the jobsite so a little disappointing there from what we had originally expected, but again, it's only one quarter so I'm not going to get too excited about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So based on the tough Q2 comp, is it fair to assume that China new equipment would be down and your expectation is it's down again in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just based on the order rates that we saw in the first quarter and the comps that you have to last year, you'll probably going to see a tough compare. I don't know that we have a really solid estimate for second quarter in terms of the shipments, but I would think just from 50,000 feet, it's going to be tough with the order rates where they were in the first quarter.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Greg, Maria.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, maybe just a couple clarifications. When you're talking about commercial HVAC up high single digit, was that revenues or was that orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was actually both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For both, okay. And then on the back in the Pratt spares, are you expecting that to turn around in 2Q? I guess we're picking up a little bit of some European OEMs destocking. Maybe that has to do with cadence of other OEMs we're thinking of in that context in terms of their pricing and you're not seeing the same thing. But sounded like you hadn't changed your full-year forecast and just wondering what the confidence is behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the order rates, we look at them every week. Pratt probably looks at them every day. Continue and it's lumpy. First quarter, we started out strong in January and then slowed down a little bit. But overall, again, I think what you're going to see as the year progresses, the compares get a lot easier. I think we were up about 22% in the second quarter last year, 33% in the first and then it slowed down in the back half and so, I think what you are going to naturally see is as the year progresses, the comps get easier and we ought to be able to pretty easily hit that 5% growth rate in spares at Pratt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry to jump back to CCS here, I forgot one there, and that is just, do you have an organic all-in on the old &#x2013; on the old Carrier and old fire and security basis as we used to know it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't. I think we have given you most of the elements there. The one piece we probably didn't talk about is fire products. That was up globally about 5% in orders. The fire service in Europe that was actually down a little bit. Down mostly in Northern Europe and offset by a little bit of strength in Southern Europe, surprisingly. I think the business in the U.K. continues to stabilize. Still not fixed, but at least it's not continuing down. So again, I think pretty much on track with where we would expect it to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, Greg, anything else you'd want to highlight on 2Q either from the standpoint of Sikorsky shipments or tax rate, anything else you want to call out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think gains will equal restructuring here in the second quarter. We've got a line of sight to some additional gains. I think the tax rate will be about what we had forecast for the full year. You're not going to see like the first quarter where we had a higher rate and other than that, I think it's going to be a solid second quarter. Again, the trends that we saw in the first quarter at Sikorsky should get a little bit better. Keep in mind though, at Sikorsky, they will ship 90 helicopters in the first half and almost twice that in the second half of the year, so still a little bumpy down at Sikorsky in the second quarter. Otis, again, we should see a recovery and we talked about CCS reporting getting good traction and Pratt and Hamilton pretty much on track with what we saw in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry; one more in the weeds here, on the North America resi HVAC order strength, are you confident that pricing on that unit acceleration is at a level that is tracking in line of your profit expectations? I guess we're picking up a little &#x2013; in the channel, some price discounting going on at a number of OEMs on that volume lift in March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we did not see that. In fact, we took various prices last October in the res market and that price has pretty well stuck. We raised it on the back of commodity prices. We're actually seeing good pricing trends and look, the inventory of the channel was really low going into the year and so some of this is restocking, but we're also seeing some good sell-through from the distribution out to the field, so we have not seen much pricing pressure this year at Carrier.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Greg, talk about cash a little bit and where you're going. Could you kind of touch base on your line of sight to funding Goodrich? How do you feel today versus earlier in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really good, Howard. I think we have got line of sight on the financing. As I'm looking at rates today, you know, the 10-year Treasury less than two, it looks pretty attractive and I think the financing plan that we've laid out, we're not going to have any trouble in the marketplace absent some big macro event, but that's why you have the &#x2013; why you have the bridge in place just in case, but I think we feel really good about the ability to place the debt and the rate in which we're going to be able to place that debt. So I feel very good.</p>
          <p>Cash in the quarter was strong. If you think about it, we have these couple of noncash gains. You take those out, we're over 120% of free cash flow to net income so the business continues to generate solid cash. Without share buyback, of course, the business funding is really pretty robust. I don't see any issue at all going to market here in the second quarter ahead of the deal to place all this debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So have you brought the cash back from Europe yet or wherever to fund part of the transaction, or is that TBD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all the cash movement will happen as part of the deal or toward the end of the year. So we'll use some of the international cash, obviously, for the IAE transaction as well, which is also scheduled to close mid-year, but a lot of moving pieces. You know, you'll see us in the debt markets here shortly well, at least probably a few, three, four weeks ahead of whenever we think Goodrich is going to close. So I think that's all good news and international cash will &#x2013; we'll access what we need to throughout the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the other item, as I recall on the March 13 analyst day and Mr. Pino addressed the Canadian helicopter item as just a small software glitch and yet we're still not seeing deliveries of that helicopter. Could you bring us up to date on where you are with that program, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the CMH [Canadian Maritime Helicopter], I think we're going to deliver five helicopters this year. We've got a couple of the interim configuration to deliver yet and then we'll actually have final configuration helicopters towards the end of the year and of course, we'll deliver the bulk of those helicopters next year. The plan was always to deliver these things in the second half of the year. I think one may have slipped from June to July, but again, I think we're still on track on the interim version and then the final version, the final software configuration version, we're still working on that to get those out before the end of the year to meet the contractual commitment to the customer, so again, we're on track. We're working with the customer all the time. You know, the helicopter continues to perform well. It's a great helicopter. We're flight testing and no issues with the airframe. This really is about the mission equipment as Jeff talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just following on that, I mean, as you talk about readjusting the portfolio and you know, some cases, you'll sell things like Rocketdyne, but then you're investing money in Eclipse. Can you sort of explain how you're making some of these portfolio decisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I make it very clear that we're not investing any more money in Eclipse? We bought &#x2013; we did make a small investment, less than $25 million in Eclipse really to service the aftermarket of the aircraft. I think there's about 300 of those airplanes that have been delivered, but we are not in the light jet business, if you will. We're in the aftermarket business supporting the planes that are out there, but we're not in the manufacturing business for light jets. So, again, if that's &#x2013; if we haven't made that clear before...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about the additional restructuring and one-time items. You mentioned in Q2 that they're going to line up. Can you talk about how those progress through the year and if there's any other mismatches?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's really going to happen is the $0.21 of net good news that we saw in the first quarter, it will play out in the third and fourth quarter. A big chunk of that will be third quarter as we start to accrue some of the restructuring related to the Goodrich acquisition and the remainder will be in the fourth quarter. I can't give you an exact number today, quarter to quarter, third quarter versus fourth quarter, but as we get toward the end of the second quarter and we get to the close of Goodrich and we know what the restructuring dollars are, we'll lay all that out for everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on CCS, you talked about the container move and the euro. Has there been any improvement from this point forward? Just because I think that was the number for the year was about down 10% for container. Should we see growth in future quarters now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the compares will get easier as we go throughout the year on container. So we should see a little bit of improvement. I think we were down low single digits, I guess, in terms of actual shipments in the quarter but down mid-teens in terms of the orders, so again, we should see a little bit of an improvement as we go throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just on the Pratt aftermarket, how much of that 5% growth is from the IAE joint venture versus the organic side of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's actually &#x2013; that's all organic. It does not include the IAE transaction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I wanted to ask KONE had orders up 27% in the quarter versus you're down 10. Greg, you think that's all due to the mix issue you talked about in China or is something else going on or haven't you looked at their numbers yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just as we were coming down this morning, I saw the KONE report come across the board. I haven't really had a chance to study it and talk to the folk out at Otis, but I think it's really, it's to all those issues we talked about with China in terms of the pricing, the mix that we saw over there. So I think, again, we obviously lost a little bit of share. I think KONE had a pretty good quarter, it looks like, from an orders perspective in China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>

          <p>Hey, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Pratt and Hamilton, can you say what the spares did if you go sequentially from Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. Can we? Give us just a second. I think we can probably figure that out. Sequentially spares sales were down mid-single digits at Pratt. Down about 5% sequentially, and sequentially, I don't know that I have the &#x2013; I don't have the Hamilton numbers but we can get back to you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then if you just pull up, you said at the beginning that the results for the quarter were a little better than you expected but there's a lot going on here. If you were to pull out the two or three things that you thought were, you know, clearly better for the quarter when you look at the whole year and the two or three that you would say did not come out as well, what would you highlight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The things that you would highlight naturally and of course, CCS and the res business there was better than what we had expected. I think the Hamilton business also, again, a little bit better than what we had expected, really a strong start to the year. Really solid organic revenue growth and good conversion with 15% profit growth. So I think those were both pleasant surprises.</p>
          <p>I would also tell you, even in CCS, the traction that we're getting on the restructuring there and the consolidation of the F&amp;S business continued to pay dividends. So margins were strong at CCS. I think you're going to continue to see that throughout the year.</p>
          <p>On the downside, you know, there's just a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, China was a bit of a surprise. Although, it was really, we talked about it back in March. We knew it would be soft in China. Sikorsky, a little bit weaker than we expected but again, that's just timing. They missed five helicopters at the very end of the quarter due to a small supplier quality issue. Those helicopters have all shipped so not really any bad news at Sikorsky, and at Pratt, things continue on track. Development engineering is up, but it's up in line with expectations. We continue to make good progress there.</p>
          <p>So you know, it's a very atypical for UTC given all of the moving pieces here. We've got acquisitions. We've got divestitures, we've got markets that are a little bit choppy but I think long-term, we're doing the right things from a portfolio standpoint, aligning the portfolio with where we want to be with the growth markets and it's going to be a tough year this year but I think it will be a solid year and we're going to be able to deliver on the commitments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, when you look at China and both from an Otis standpoint and from a Carrier standpoint and you see shifts in expectations for commercial construction growth there, how do you approach that? In other words, what changes do you make to those businesses operationally when you're looking at different types of outlooks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question. In fact, one of the things that we've done in China is to actually realign the geographies from a leadership standpoint. China as part of Otis used to be part of the North Asia operation under Charles Vo. Charles is retired and we brought in Thomas Vining to take over China as a stand-alone region.</p>
          <p>And the reason we've done that is because the aftermarket opportunity remains the single biggest opportunity across the Otis business for future profit growth. It's only 7% of the business in China today. We think, you know, within a few years, it's going to get back up toward the more normal 50/50 kind of business and few years might be ten years and really the focus is going to be on growing the aftermarket when you see moderating growth as we see today on the commercial construction side.</p>
          <p>So the long-term focus there is to grow the aftermarket. I think Pedro talked about that in March and you're going to hear us continue to talk about that in the coming months in orders as the real focus of the business to grow the after. Quite frankly, that's where the beauty of Otis is. It's in that 1.8 million elevators that we service around the world every day. That annuity, it's a wonderful thing and we need to grow it in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it sounds like what you're saying is that when you see quarterly or six-month changes in outlooks for China, that doesn't cause you to react very much in terms of your China strategy and your operational approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, again, the focus is going to continue to be on China. We continue to do the right things for the long term. As I say, we're opening up this new factory in Chongqing with the low cost Gen2 elevator and continue to make investments in China and China is going to be a growth market for years to come. The urbanization trends, they aren't a one-time thing and we've seen this the thing play out before where you see quarter to quarter, you'll see ups and downs in China but a couple of quarters of China being down doesn't dissuade us from the opportunity that's there.</p>

I know we touched on this on Carrier residential, but the idea here is that you got those big surge of orders the last two weeks of March and a number of OEs have reported seeing the exact same thing, so it's really important if we could get some color regarding how that transitioned into April because that way we get a better sanction about is this real demand coming back or were these dealer incentives but any color regarding the demand you've seen so far in April would be helpful.</p>

          <p>I'm not going to give you weekly order trends. I don't think you need to look at this every week, but I will tell you the season's off to a very good start and the strength that we saw at the end of March has continued into April, a little bit slower rate than March but still pretty strong as we move into April here.</p>

          <p>Do you run any risk of component shortages because if you do get that perfect storm and you do get a resurgence in demand, supplies and inventories are really lean here including compressors. Is there an issue where you might get some inventory stock-outs, or is that, you don't expect that as a scenario?</p>

          <p>In fact, I asked Geraud that same question a week ago as we saw the surge in orders. Keep in mind this is a short cycle business and we see this all the time. I know that Geraud and the Carrier folks have been working with all the suppliers. I know that they've been working with Emerson to make sure there's adequate supply of compressors and we have not seen any shortages so far, although again, it's something that we keep an eye on if these trends continue. We've got the capacity in our factories to do the ramp-up pretty quickly and I believe most of the supply base does as well.</p>

          <p>And then the last one is within the resi orders that you received, has it been skewed toward the lower price point entry level, 13 SEER or has there been any step up in terms of the higher price points?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I haven't really seen any skew. Last year, we saw a big &#x2013; last couple of years, we've seen kind of down and dirty where everything is entry level SEER 13. Orders look to be pretty good in the quarter. We got a little bit better news there. Including some of the &#x2013; I think the R22A shipments were in line with the market still. So I don't see any big macro change there in terms of buying patterns.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much. All right, everyone, thanks. The start of the year is better than we expected. We're confident in our full-year outlook and of course we're positioning the company for earnings growth both this year and beyond as we continue our focus on cost reduction and the transformational changes to the portfolio as well as the continued investments in these game-changing technologies. Thanks for listening today and look forward to seeing you throughout the remainder of the year. Maria and team will be available for calls throughout the day. So thanks very much.</p>
