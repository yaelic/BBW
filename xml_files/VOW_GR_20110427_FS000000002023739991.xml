          <p>Good day and welcome to the Interim Report January-March 2011 of Volkswagen AG. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host today to Ms. Christine Ritz Head of Group Investor Relations, Volkswagen AG. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volkswagen's conference call on the results for the period January to March 2011 based on the outlook and interim report we published this morning. Joining me today are Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG responsible for Finance and Controlling and Christian Klingler, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG responsible for Group Sales and Marketing. As usual, to confirm over the webcast and download the chart from our website, www.volkswagenag.com/ir.</p>
          <p>Questions can be sent by email or called in. Following the presentation, we will first take questions from the analyst community by keeping time at the end for questions from journalists.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand you over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and allow me to add my warm welcome to those of you joining this call today. Over the first three months of 2011, the Volkswagen Group has continued to move strongly and steadily towards our long-term strategy 2018 goals. But we aim to be the most successful global automotive company, demonstrating sustainable leadership in both the economic and environmental spheres.</p>
          <p>And we are very pleased with our strategy to form an integrated automotive company with Porsche, achieved two important milestones with the acquisition on March the 1st of the trading activities of the Porsche Holding Salzburg Company. We are delighted to welcome this world-leading company to the Volkswagen family. And in a further notable step, Porsche SE has successfully concluded its rights issue raising a net &#x20AC;4.9 billion to be used to reduce its debt. The offer opened in March and closed in mid-April.</p>
          <p>Our brand continued to perform very successfully in the first three months of 2011. Deliveries to customers were up 14% at around 2 million units, and revenue improved by just over 30% to almost &#x20AC;37.5 billion. Thanks in particular to higher revenue and a firm hand on costs, operating profits more than tripled to &#x20AC;2.9 billion. Similarly, profit before tax was also up over 3 times at &#x20AC;2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, our continued efficient management of our CapEx and inventory, not to mention our high earnings momentum, helped to further improve our automotive net liquidity despite the outflow of around &#x20AC;3.3 billion for Porsche Holding Salzburg to &#x20AC;19.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me hand you over to Mr. Klingler to provide some further color to our excellent sales performance.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, as well from my side, welcome to the conference call. This first chart shows the development of the world car market by quarter in comparison to the same quarter of the previous year. The growth recorded last year was mainly due to a recovery of the economic environment on the one hand and government support measures in many markets on the other.</p>
          <p>In some markets, these measures expired during 2010, which explained the decline in growth rates. Therefore, on a quarter-by-quarter comparison, we see that the global market is losing some of its gross momentum as we move into 2011.</p>
          <p>The high gross figure recorded for the first quarter last year, that is for 2010, resulted from an exceptionally weak first quarter one year earlier. In absolute terms, the market is stabilizing now. To avoid being misled by this base effect, the comparison to the last normal year, we believe it's 2007, is appropriate.</p>
          <p>But what do you see on the next chart? The positive influences of the government support measures in many markets led to significant market rebound in the second half of 2009. As incentives in many European countries were phased out, the rebound continued in a slower pace throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>The first three quarters of 2010 were still slightly below the normal year of 2007. Favorable economic conditions in China and in India continued to make significant contribution to the global automotive market development. The strong fourth quarter 2010 were due to further improving conditions in major European markets plus a strong Chinese market in the final quarter as major sales incentives approached the end.</p>
          <p>The market performance in the first quarter 2011 remained robust, despite increasing risk from external factors as conflict in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the very dramatic situation in Japan. For 2011, our latest forecast suggests the global markets to remain above the pre-crisis level of 2007. However, we will continue to monitor the aforementioned risk factors and their impact on our business.</p>
          <p>In the year 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, our deliveries to customers have shown a positive year-on-year development. Volkswagen Group again outperformed the overall car market in the first quarter of 2011. We continued to gain global market share in the first quarter, supported mainly by the Group performance in China, in India, as well as in some of the major Western European countries such as France.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the market performances of the regions around the world in direct comparison to the performance of the Volkswagen Group in the first quarter of 2011. With the exception of Central and Eastern Europe as well as South America, the Volkswagen Group has outperformed the market in all other regions worldwide. In Central and Eastern Europe, we increased our market share in many markets.</p>
          <p>The remarkable growth of the Russian market led to a further increase of its relative importance within the region. We managed to keep our market share in Russia at nearly the same level. However, as our markets in Russia is below the Group's regional average, the overall markets in Central and Eastern Europe declined.</p>
          <p>In South America, the Brazilian market increased in relative terms more than our deliveries due to a tough competitive situation, new players in the market and the last cycle effect to some of our models.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, despite the market contraction of 2.5%, the Volkswagen Group recorded a positive result as we achieved an increase in our deliveries of 6.5%. As already mentioned, some of the major markets in the region still suffer declines fall in the end of support measures and general weak economies. In particular, the Spanish and Italian markets contracted heavily by 27.3% and 23.2% respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, we will take a look at the performance of the individual brands of the Group. In the first quarter of 2011, all our volume brands achieved an increase in terms of sales. And for the Group, total deliveries to customers exceeded last year's level by 14%. Volkswagen Passenger Car deliveries were up by an impressive 10.4% to more than 1.2 million cars, driven by strong demand in China and Russia and India.</p>
          <p>Audi deliveries rose by 18.4%, compared to last year, to 313,000 cars. Premium brands only marginally benefited from the stimulus programs in Europe and the United States. So as the world economy begins to recover, we anticipate increased potential across for this sector on the market.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda expanded deliveries up to 217,000 cars, mainly due to the strong demand in China and in Russia. SEAT as well as Bentley have also managed to expand deliveries. Both commercial vehicles and Scania have benefited from the recovery of the global economy and the closed, tight trucks segments.</p>
          <p>Let us now take a look at a few highlights and some of our new models, which will provide a good base for our sales performance in the coming months.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen US-Passat import sophisticated styling and German engineering at an accessible price. This flagship vehicle is made in America for America and is certain to transform the segment and spoil the American consumer. The US-Passat was shown at the Detroit Motor Show, and will hit the road in the next months to come.</p>
          <p>The Audi Q5 Hybrid is the most progressive hybrid concept in this segment, excellent in performance and efficiency. Introduction in the market is targeted for the end of the year. The Volkswagen multivan, BlueMotion is setting a new benchmark in fuel economy. The BlueMotion version of the popular multivan combines lowest fuel consumption in its class, high comfort level and excellent driving performance, and will be introduced in the market in the second quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Aventador LP 700-4 Lamborghini is redefining the very pinnacle of the world super sports car market. Power, outstanding lightweight engineering and phenomenal handling position are combined with the peerless design to deliver an unparalleled driving experience. Its market introduction will be next month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Klingler. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, can you now take us through the key elements of our financial performance in some more detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. In the first three months of 2011, sales revenue increased by 30.8% to &#x20AC;37.5 billion. Given the deliveries performance that Mr. Klingler just described, you will not be surprised that higher volume was the main driver of the revenue gain at &#x20AC;6.4 billion. Pricing discipline continues to be a positive factor at &#x20AC;0.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Mix, including both product and country mix, contributed &#x20AC;0.4 billion to our performance. Positive exchange rates contributed an additional &#x20AC;0.6 billion. The truck sector continues to enjoy a strong recovery as Scania reported a &#x20AC;0.7 billion improvement in revenue over the first quarter 2010. And finally, our Financial Services division also improved, up &#x20AC;0.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to operating profit, the increase in sales was again the major influence, and an improvement from &#x20AC;848 million to &#x20AC;2.9 billion versus the first three months of 2010. Volume, together with price and mix effects, came to a total positive of &#x20AC;2.2 billion. Currency was a net &#x20AC;0.2 billion headwind, mainly due to the U.S. dollar and the British pound.</p>
          <p>Despite headwinds from rising commodity prices, thanks to long contracts and our hedging operations, combined with our ongoing efficiency measures, product costs remain under firm control, and we were able to save &#x20AC;0.2 billion over the first quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Fixed costs and depreciation were a &#x20AC;0.4 billion drag on our overall performance as we continued to ramp up the additions to our production network and invest in our future through higher engineering costs. These measures are necessary to provide the right foundations for implementing key elements of our strategy 2018, including providing the right framework for the higher volume that we are already starting to see and expect to grow even further.</p>
          <p>Scania translated the rise in revenue to an increase in earnings of &#x20AC;0.2 billion. And finally, our Volkswagen Financial Services division added &#x20AC;0.2 billion. To sum up, our operating results increased more than three-fold to &#x20AC;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning now to cash flow in the automotive division, operating cash flow improved 68% to &#x20AC;5.1 billon. While we aim to increase our inventory through the year with the current tight supply chain constraints and our strong sales performance, it will be some time before our inventory levels normalize and tie up more cash in working capital.</p>
          <p>On the investment side, cash invested increased to &#x20AC;4.5 billion including purchase of the Porsche Holding Salzburg activities, as well our stake in SGL Carbon.</p>
          <p>On a like-for-like basis, focusing on just the investments in new products in our industrial facilities, investments came in flat at &#x20AC;1.3 billion. The low CapEx ratio of 2.8% reflects our strong revenue performance as well as the usual seasonality pattern. During the course of the year, we expect the ratio to climb closer to our 6% guidance.</p>
          <p>In total, even after considering the investment in Porsche Holding Salzburg, the net cash flow over the first three months for the automotive division came to a positive &#x20AC;0.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look now at net liquidity in the automotive division. We added a further &#x20AC;1 billion to the &#x20AC;18.6 billion we held at the end of 2010 to reach a new record high of &#x20AC;19.6 billion. This strong financial foundation supports our steps along the strategy 2018 path and ensures we have adequate liquidity to pursue the goal of an integrated automotive group with Porsche in combination with a strong financial rating.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial performance of our brands. Now just before we go into the detail, just a reminder that with effect from March 1st, we now include the activities of Porsche Holding Salzburg. These are reflected in the other line, also the net impact is minor, as we also have to include a PPA charge and in particular given that for this quarter only just the month of March is included.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Passenger Car brand posted earnings for the first three months of over &#x20AC;1 billion, up 2.5 times on the prior year period and perhaps more impressively at a margin of 4.6%. Strong product mix and disciplined pricing underpinned this impressive performance.</p>
          <p>Audi maintained a double-digit margin coming in at 10.6% for an operating profit of &#x20AC;1.1 billion, more than double of the first quarter of 2010. &#x160;koda almost doubled their earnings to &#x20AC;187 million with a very impressive margin of almost 7%. SEAT markedly narrowed its loss, and Bentley too. Good progress is being made at both brands to return to profitability.</p>
          <p>While the Volkswagen commercial vehicles reported a solid result with strong growth in Eastern Europe, especially Russia, as well as Brazil leading the way. Scania reported results up 76% on the first quarter 2010 at &#x20AC;376 million. The other line in the chart includes the elimination of intercompany sales as well as the ongoing purchase price accounting charge with regard to our consolidation of Scania and now, as mentioned earlier, also the result for Porsche Holding Salzburg.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Financial Services reported an improved result of &#x20AC;287 million, up over 70%, based on a higher number of contracts and an extension of activities. Combining the automotive and financial services division gives a total operating profit of &#x20AC;2.9 billion. The financial result, which includes the results from our equity accounted investments changes in the valuations of derivatives, as well as interest related costs, recorded a negative &#x20AC;688 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>I would like to take a few moments to delve a little deeper into the issues here. The company's we consolidate at equity recorded a clearly positive result reflecting the excellent performance of our Chinese joint ventures. It reported a proportional operating profit of &#x20AC;557 million, as well as our 49.9% holding in Porsche Zwischen Holding, which reported a positive net result for the first three months even after PPA.</p>
          <p>We value the respective put and call rights with regards to our plant integration with Porsche on a regular basis. You will recall that there was a substantial increase to a positive net &#x20AC;1.8 billion in our 2010 result to reflect the move to 50-50 likelihood of the merger taking place within the ambitious timetable of the comprehensive agreement.</p>
          <p>While our expectations with regard to the merger likely would have not changed the valuation as at the end of March moved to a net &#x20AC;1.4 billion, due mainly to the application of a higher discount sector in the valuation process relating to an increase in market interest rates. This therefore, led to a negative &#x20AC;400 million charge against the other financial result.</p>
          <p>Finally, the other financial result also includes a mark-to-market valuation of interest rate exposure in our currency hedging instruments. This effect amounts to approximately &#x20AC;600 million on a Group-wide basis and is a temporary non-cash effect due to the spot-to-spot hedge accounting method we apply in our currency hedging. This technical effect will reverse entirely before the expiration of the respective hedging contracts.</p>
          <p>Now this leads me to our 2011 outlook. Volkswagen Group's key competitive advantages are its unique brand portfolio, and it's continually growing presence in all key regions of the world. The modular tool kit system will have an increasingly positive effect on the Group's cost structure in 2011. The Volkswagen Group's nine brands will once again introduce a large number of fascinating new models to the market, this further expanding our strong position.</p>
          <p>We expect that the Group's deliveries, sales revenue and operating profit in 2011 will continue to perform positively. However, the continuing volatility in interest and exchange rate trends and commodity prices will weaken the positive volume effect.</p>
          <p>And here, I should mention that we continue to work intensively to ensure the continuity of key components affected by the tragedy in Japan. I can assure you that this has our full attention, and we are working both internally and with our suppliers to manage this situation. Disciplined cost and investment management and to continue with optimization of our processes remain core components of our strategy 2018.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, thank you very much. We will now begin with the questions and answer part of today's conference call, starting first with the questions of analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Jochen Gehrke from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three questions if I may. First of all, with regards to your cost structure in the first quarter, you had a &#x20AC;200 million impact of ForEx, as you alluded, and &#x20AC;200 million positive product cost. Could you just give us some guidance as to what we should expect for the remainder of the year? Is this ForEx negative impact growing all the rest of the year? Or should it be roughly the run rate?</p>
          <p>Then, secondly on the acquisition of Porsche Holding, I know you said that roughly we shouldn't be expecting a much of a contribution in the current year because of PPA. Now that it's in the Group, could you give us some clarity on how we should model this business both on the revenue as well as on a profit contribution side, excluding PPA consideration going forward?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, with regards to MAN and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:57) situation, I wonder whether you could provide an update. We're hearing a bit conflicting signs from you. I think you're still consistently saying that you would want to have the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:08) issue cleared before moving ahead with a Scania combination. MAN senior management seems to have a different view on that. I wonder whether you could just update us on the view that we should have on this situation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Jochen. You have three questions for us. The first was to reverse to our cost structure, if we can give guidance with regard to our product cost savings for the full year, also including currency impact. The second question refers to Porsche Holding Salzburg, if we can give you some more details with regards to the impact on revenues, and also the operating performance going forward excluding PPA. And the last question was if we can comment actually on the MAN Scania situation and if we can give you an update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to the first question, consistent with our forecast we had record negative impact coming from exchange rates in the first quarter. And as you are well aware, we are very well hedged for the remainder of the year. Nevertheless, of course as we enter into hedges in a rolling scheme, hedges might be less favorable than in the past year. So, we have to expect the impact coming out of exchange rates to worsen throughout the year, maybe not completely proportional to the effect recorded in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Then on the product cost side, we're happy to show further improvement in the first quarter. And of course, similar to the former years, we expect some further improvements going forward. Of course, here it needs to be taken into consideration that underlying effects like raw material prices, steel prices and the like doesn't make the business necessarily easier. But we are confident that we'll be able to improve the effect shown in the first quarter quite significantly.</p>
          <p>On the Porsche Holding Salzburg side, we included the major effects in our other line, and the result of course, if I may say this again, it's just one month, which is considered there. And you were asking for a full year effect; and there needs to be taken into consideration that, of course, it's to a large extent cars, which were invoiced before in the Volkswagen consolidation framework until then it further on gets invoiced again at the Porsche Holding Salzburg.</p>
          <p>That's why out of the gross revenue that might remain a piece of roughly &#x20AC;6 billion, which is to be added to the consolidated Group number for the Porsche Holding Salzburg. And if one applies for the EBIT margin roughly of 5% to that number, then it's about the conservative part of a range of earnings provided by the Porsche Holding Salzburg.</p>
          <p>On the truck situation, there is nothing really new to be added here. We always indicated that we are undertaking discussions, but that there were some legal and commercial items, which need to be resolved, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:19) just being one of these items, and that's still the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Horst Schneider from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. I have got a few questions. When I look in at your divisional results, it strikes me that particularly the mass-market brands had very good first quarter in terms of sales, but also in terms of earnings. I would like to know if the margin levels that we have seen, mainly at the Volkswagen brand but also at &#x160;koda, if that is sustainable for the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>And then, another question relates to the potential negative impact from Japan. We have heard from some companies that to which extent the impact could be negative. So maybe you could be a bit more specific to which extent that could hurt your production, eventually your sales and also your earnings.</p>
          <p>And then, the last question that I have relates to the cash outlook. So you had a very good cash flow in the first quarter. We saw some reduction in inventories. I would like to know to which extent we should expect working capital changes in the next few quarters. I presume that the run rate of the cash flow will come down. But maybe you could give some more precise outlook for the cash as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Horst. You have three questions for us. The first refers to the performance of the mass market, not only in the first quarter but overall, what can we expect then for the full year especially if the margin level we have seen at the Volkswagen passenger car and at &#x160;koda, if that is really sustainable, if we can expect that.</p>
          <p>The next question refers to Japan. If we see there any negative impact for the rest of the year, maybe hurting our sales production and earnings. And the last question, you are asking us for a more precise outlook with regard to cash flow development, working capital, if we can give you some more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the first question with regards to the margin situation of the volume brand specifically, Volkswagen Muscoda &#x2013; I think it's clear that we started into 2011 in a positive way. First quarter was quite strong. It's clearly a bit early to say something more detailed to the remainder of the year. But clearly, we think in comparison to 2010 we'll see a significant improvement. Of course, this always has to be seen relative to issues like raw material price increases, steel crisis. Of course, we also have to digest the tariff being effective then in the remainder of the year. But over and above, we are quite positive in this regard.</p>

          <p>...Japan, we have seen, of course, some shortcomings. But with a very big compliment to the people here in the logistics and the purchasing department, we were able to deal with these challenges so far. And I think we need to accept the situation that we can assume that we are okay for the next three weeks going forward.</p>
          <p>Of course, nobody can rule out that there are not some issues coming up to the later part of the second quarter or the third quarter. That's still something, which we have to see. So far, the effects were quite limited. Of course, we cannot rule out that in single cases the availability of cars, which are composed in an individual way is limited for the one and the other reason. But over and above, it didn't show any effect so far on both revenue and the operating profit line. And as far as one can judge from today's point of view, we think we are pretty well covered for the future also.</p>
          <p>In terms of inventory, as you might have picked by the numbers also, we are still suffering shortcomings in the supply chain. Delivery times are still a bit too long, which leads to the point that we still did not reach our ideal level of inventories. That's why if we could, we wanted to build some more inventory just to be able to deal with the market in a more appropriate way. But we should expect these kind of effects more in the second half of the year rather than in this quarter, for the simple reason that sales activities are running on a higher level. We have a record order backlog, and that's why of course first-hand, we have to deliver the cars to the final customers.</p>

          <p>May I hit another small question relating to your first part of your answer? I can understand that you cannot give more precise outlook for the full year, but when I look at my forecast, and normally Q2 is stronger than Q1 in terms of sales as well as in terms of earnings. Now considering also the impact from Japan, is it still valid to say also this year in Q2 the topline will be better than in Q1?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, we cannot rule this out, but of course, we're operating on a very higher level with a few limitations, as I already mentioned. So, we've got to see how we are able to perform then the next coming months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Thierry Huon speaking from Exane. Two questions, if I may. First one regarding the ramp-up cost. Could we consider that the peak of the ramp-up cost was in Q1 '11 and then that we should see some decrease for this going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to the Audi capacity. You just sold about 375,000 units in the first quarter. Is that a fair assumption to multiply this number by four for having an idea what you cold achieve for the full year, or do you have some capacity constraint there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Thierry. So you have two questions for us. The first is about our ramp-up cost, if we had seen in Q1 the peak, how should this develop, do we see any decrease this year. And the second question refers to the capacity of Audi, if we see there any constraints. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to the first question, ramp-up costs were clearly on a relatively higher level in the first quarter. Still we are in the middle of ramping up the plant in Chattanooga. That's why something also will be effective to next coming quarters there. And then, if you refer to the fixed costs part of our swing sector analysis, then let me just mention that a significant part of the negative swing factor there is related to engineering costs.</p>
          <p>And at that side, it complements with a relative low rate of activated R&amp;D costs in the balance sheet. It's just around 20%. And it's reflecting the situation that as we continue to invest heavily into future oriented technologies, for example, power trains, as in some of these areas we fall short to be able to define an economical business model from today's point of view, this is might change at some future point in time. But as long as this situation exists, we are taking these parts of our R&amp;D costs not to the balance sheet but fully to the P&amp;L. That's creating a significant part of this negative swing factor.</p>
          <p>And then to the question on the Audi capacities; of course, we are still in a process of ramping up production for new models. But we should also not forget that Audi required additional capacity by launching the Q3, the little SUV model, in Spain in Martorell. So, that's additional capacity for Audi, and that's why we feel pretty comfortable that we could increase sales in the next quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, I wondered, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, if you would just update us on the total PPA charge that you expect this year? I think the guide was &#x20AC;0.5 billion before PHS. And on the subject of PHS, could you just enlighten us as to the size of the PHS FinCo portfolio, which you brought in. Is that all your brands, or is it &#x2013; does it have a large number of third-party vehicles in it? And what kind of ROEs is that doing?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I know you talked about price and mix as being behind Volkswagen brands operating income delta. I just wondered if you could offer any regional color on what was happening there since it was such a big change? Is Germany looking particularly good for VW brand, or are we finally seeing some improvement in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, John. So you have three questions for us. The first we've sourced to our PPA, if we can give there an update or guidance what impact do we expect for the full year for this year. And the second question refers to PHS and the size of the FinCo portfolio, if we can give there some more details. And the third question was price and mix, if we can give here some regional color of what do we expect there, what developments do we see in Germany for the Volkswagen brand, or also in the U.S. do we see there any improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if you'll allow me, we'll come back first to the third question about price and mixes. Unfortunately, the situation is not so easy to be explained, so I will take some minutes. The first one is that we have a clear mix effect, and your question was essentially for the Volkswagen brand, due to several reasons. One is we do have a very strong demand on our Passat, which we have launched recently. We do have still a very strong demand on Touareg, very strong by the way. If you come to the other brands, we have a very strong demand on the A8; on the A7; on the A6; which is just about to be launched; and the <mark type="ph" /> third and the fourth (45:06). So that means, in general, the mix effect in the car lines is still very positive.</p>
          <p>Second, we see as well that the cars we are selling, due to our strategy, are getting more and more equipment on both. So we're getting richer cars into the market, and we have therefore pretty nice increases in perspective of turnover of car on the comparable level. Third, we do have as well due to the launch of our new products in countries where we have now production like, for example, for the new Jetta in the U.S., which in the Mexico, the production, we do have some improvements as well on the financial results on that.</p>
          <p>Then finally, we are in a mood and in a pretty good possibility to keep the prices in the market on a good level. So, if you take all these measures and all these points together, you have a mix effect and price effect, which seems to be positive and which seems to be on a good way.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So to the question related to the PPA charge, we were talking about a 12-month period. We were talking about &#x20AC;500 million. Now, if we include the Porsche Holding Salzburg, then this figure is going to move up to a bit more than &#x20AC;700 million. And this number, again, splits into roughly &#x20AC;500 million you will find in the operating result, and a bit more than &#x20AC;200 million you're going to find in the financial result.</p>
          <p>Then, on the second question related to the Porsche Holding Salzburg Finance Entity. So, this Entity holds a balance sheet of roughly and a bit more than &#x20AC;2 billion. We feel very comfortable in terms of the residual situation, and there is reasonably a low part of the financing of competitors' models.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, everyone. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. Two questions. Firstly on the at equity income line, you reported &#x20AC;585 million for the first quarter, which was a bit below Q3 and Q4 last year. Now, assuming that Porsche did better start of this year, also MAN, and you sold roughly 20% more cars in China than at least in the fourth quarter, what's the reason behind the decline of the at equity line? Is China or the profitability of the China business something that we should think of more carefully, or could you share your thoughts on the at equity line a bit more in detail?</p>
          <p>And also, following on from Horst's question on the free cash flow, just give us a feeling, will the free cash flow remain positive for the rest of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Arndt for your two questions. The first question refers to our at equity line where we have seen in the first quarter a figure of &#x20AC;585 million. And this is below Q3 or Q4, so there &#x2013; so you are asking what are the reasons behind that lower number assuming that Porsche China is doing well. So if we can give here an explanation. And the second question is we referred to free cash flow really to remain positive for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first of all on the at equity line, which we think is for first quarter a quite positive. And in fact, as we mentioned specifically, Porsche was very positive, also our Lisbon entity was performing quite well. Also our Chinese operations were operating on a very high level. Of course, if one compares the development in the first quarter with the fourth quarter, it's always the seasonal pattern which is creating the difference. But again, we are clearly continuing on a reasonably high level here. Nothing special which needs to be reported here.</p>
          <p>On the net cash flow, clearly we should not forget that just after the first quarter we need to pay out the dividends for the Volkswagen shareholders and for the Scania shareholders. And we are happy to do this, of course. And then looking a little bit further down the road towards the fourth quarter, we think and hopefully we can start building a little bit more inventory just to be able to deliver much more on time. So, this is also having some impact there. But to cut a long story short, we are not at all negative in terms of net cash flow development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I just follow-on on the first question on the at equity line, would you expect an ongoing quarterly increase of the at equity contribution for the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as it is difficult to project the business in operative terms from the standpoint of a first quarter, it's also always some &#x2013; a little bit risky to project the development for our participations which we consolidated equity. But from today's point of view, I would say, yes, it looks pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I also understood you correctly that leaving dividends aside or even including dividends, you would expect a positive free cash flow for the rest of the year combined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. A question again on the Volkswagen Passenger Car, the strong improvement in the margin. At the full year results conference, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch you pointed out that the passenger car side of the business was enduring some burdens relating to these costs of the factories; Chattanooga and also plants in India and Russia. So I think the indication was it might take a bit longer to see that improvement in the margin. So that was one of the key swing factors in your beat on your results for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>When these things are all up and running, and if you continue with the discipline that you say you've been mentioning on pricing and volume and the products that are flowing through, what do you &#x2013; does that give us another impetus then on the margin above the 4.6% levels, you think? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Stephen, another question refers to the Volkswagen Passenger Car business as the performance in the first quarter, if this margin is sustainable or if we can even expect higher margin or what can really be &#x2013; how can it be influenced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think to the question of margin development on the Volkswagen Passenger Car side, I think we've already given number of indicators which are important. One is, of course, the tariff increase, which has to be digested; raw material prices; foreign exchange; ramp-up costs. It's all what we were talking about in the last hour, and these are the more of course negative factors.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have a good record, and we'll continue on bringing the costs further down by our productivity measures by intelligent purchasing and a number of other reasons, not to forget about further effects coming out of our modular tool basis.</p>
          <p>And then, I think a big impact is to be seen by the further volume development. If we can continue with this volume development, clearly this will be a heavily supporting factor, which might take away part of the burden, which I mentioned in our press conference.</p>
          <p>And in fact, and to say this again, I was speaking about Volkswagen Passenger Cars as being the spearhead of both conquering new markets and conquering new technologies. And while this is not always readable in a single quarter, effect-wise this is the situation.</p>
          <p>But I would say looking a little bit to the past, first of all, we were proven right so far, and that's why we continue on with this concept. Nevertheless, it is important and absolutely doable that Volkswagen Passenger Car can operate on a higher margin level. And the first quarter is just a good sign that this is possible and doable.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I'm left with two questions. Firstly, on the CapEx, you gave guidance that you'll go towards 6%. I mean, it seems to have been a lot lower now for quite a lot of quarters. Obviously there's seasonality there, but with your acquisition of PHS, the CapEx on that is much lower. Is 6% really still a medium-term guidance that's realistic, or as you're getting such strong revenues is something more like a 5%? Given absolute terms, I think 6% is implying towards &#x20AC;8.5 billion of CapEx. Maybe give us a bit more feel for your absolute number as well.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the European dealer inventory side, maybe you could just comment a little bit about some of the models. Is it particularly shortfalls the Tiguan, the Passat, the Golf, the Touareg? Maybe just give us a little bit more granularity on that, where the shortfalls are in particular, which regions, just help us a little bit on what's going on there and potentially what are some of the sales you might be missing at this point. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. So, the first question refers to our CapEx guidance that we do expect that this will increase towards the 6% level, is that really realistic you are asking us, and can we give maybe you an absolute number on CapEx spending. And the next question is for Mr. Klingler I would say. It refers to the inventories on the European dealer side. Are there any shortfalls, are there any specific developments for different regions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all on the CapEx side, as I already mentioned, not totally surprising because we see this seasonality pattern since quite a while. We started out low in the first quarter, but it's very clear that the Volkswagen Group is looking at a step change of undertakings towards 2012 and '13 by the introduction of the new modular toolkit for the cars in the Group, which carry the engine in the transverse position.</p>
          <p>Now, this is of course related to huge investments, a few of them already sitting on the balance sheet, a few of them just under execution. But this is only to say that very clearly, we'll see investments coming up quite substantially throughout the remainder of the year. And this is positive because as we already pointed out, the introduction of this new modular toolkit will support another significant reduction of the product cost side in a few of the very volume cars of the Volkswagen, the Group, and will be one of the key parameters to support a sustainable improvement of profit generation. That's why it would be a little bit too early to put a question mark on a 6% CapEx target. We think it's, for the situation we're in, absolutely the right one.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned already, the Porsche Holding Salzburg adds only &#x20AC;6 million revenue to the whole piece, so that's not fundamentally changing the picture. And you can be rest assured that, of course, running our math, we exactly know that this is a trading company and we know how to deal with the equivalent in terms of revenue relative to our CapEx targets. We think we are very much okay.</p>
          <p>And I should only say at this point always with a compliment to the colleagues, it was possible so far and it will remain possible to execute a significant extension of the global footprint of the company, a significant extension of the product portfolio and still maintain our investment picture within this framework of CapEx to sales of 6% or even lower. And that's why we feel very comfortable with this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me now to answer to your second question about the stock level of European dealers, where are more issues or less issues. I suppose, the question is bit different, at least my interpretation what is the delays for the customers in the countries. First of all, I think it's very important to understand that even though we do have some models and some combinations, engines and gearbox combinations, some longer delays, the order intake remains very, very strong.</p>
          <p>So we're increasing our order intake, and this has been mentioned before by Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. We do have the highest order bank ever. This even though &#x2013; ever since at least 20 years we take it like this &#x2013; since even though we do have the delivery dates.</p>
          <p>The next thing is it's pretty complicated to say that there is one model in an issue, and one country in an issue. We steer, of course, our stocks and steer our demand by country. We have different situations, so like for example a Spanish situation is not comparable which might be the situation for example in France.</p>
          <p>And if you talk about these &#x2013; for example, engine and gearbox combinations, they have an impact. So you can't have the Polo for example, a pretty fast car, if you don't have a gearbox <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:40). But if you want to have a gearbox <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:42), can be some additional delay. So, that makes the thing a little bit more complicated. So we do not have one car which is more delayed or strongly more delayed than another. But we do have some combinations of equipments, which give us these delays in the different per car type. This is true for Volkswagen, this is true for Audi as well, and this is true for &#x160;koda.</p>
          <p>The positive thing is as I mentioned that the order intake remains very strong. The other impact is that our competitors do have a strong increase of lead-times now since several weeks, which is essentially due to some of the problems concerning the Japanese crisis. And so far, we have managed to be here on a very positive way and continued to be there. We see that for the customers, comparable, our lead times, which are sometimes too high, are going down.</p>
          <p>So, in general, to answer to your question, yes, there are some model combinations, engines, gearbox and so forth, which gives us delays which are too long. We cannot confirm that at general delays there are some that will be longer. We see that the majority of our customers are ready to keep on the delays, and we try to do our best to get them the cars as fast as possible and as professional as possible as we can. It's not always easy, but I think in general we are in a good way.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. One related to China. If I look at the profit that you made in your joint venture and just roughly gross it up for the total amount, it looks like you're generating about &#x20AC;2,200 per car in China versus &#x20AC;1,100 in the rest of the business. Just wondering what the differential is there. Am I missing something in terms of perhaps parts production to third parties? It looks like a 47% increase year-on-year, so strong performance there. Wondering what was behind it.</p>
          <p>The second question related to pricing, and the experience that you're having in terms of a positive impact seems to be in stark contrast to your European competitors. I'm wondering if that's a reflection of the increased option uptake that you spoke of. I'm wondering also how your pricing policy is set. Are you looking at cost plus margin? Are you actually looking simply at what's happening in the marketplace and positioning yourself accordingly? It just seems that your competitors are talking about a tough pricing environment, and you're not experiencing the same thing. Wondering what perhaps you can tell me on that front. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Michael, for your two questions. The first question refers to the China profit we have achieved there, and you want to understand the calculation per car, if you have done everything correctly. And the second refers to pricing, our experience, how is pricing set, what can we talk a little bit about the whole environment and what do we expect there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe allow me first to give some information about the Chinese market. The Chinese market in first quarter still was strong, even though some of the regimens which has been set have had the pacing impact. So, for example, the Beijing regulation, which means there has been a law in reducing the possibilities of customers to buy a car in Beijing, had a negative impact but it was largely offset by development in other regions of China.</p>
          <p>So basically, in China we're running very, very well. So, we have very strong demand. We do have stocks, which are very low. We have very well controlled commercial cost. We have a very much controlled incentive level. And we have a good cost base for the results what you see. So this is a situation, which we are now getting since several months, so more than 12. And we'll continue to be there as long as the market demand is so strong, and we don't know &#x2013; do not see a strong sign that the market demand would decline.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we have to be prudent in China, as you know. There are inflation risks. There are measures now in economic way, that have been percentage, which means, for example, increase of interests to a certain extent, and as well a regulation concerning the amount of credit to be given. This will reduce to a certain extent the high growth rate, but still we believe that for the full year we talk about probably a small double-digit growth rate for the Chinese market. So, we are on a very good level, and have a very good business model in China.</p>
          <p>If you go then to the pricing issue, it is true that the pricing environment is not easy, but competition is never easy. What we see is that with the very positive effect of our new models, we do have a very good chance to bring to our customers a value price proposition, which takes step on the positive way. But we cannot confirm what is said by some of the competitors that there is huge pressure today in our margins by the way you have seen it through the results.</p>
          <p>This is probably due to several items. One is we do have products which are getting superior feedback from our customers. Second, we are working strongly on our earnings per car, turnover per car and margins per car levels. Thirdly, we working strong on all the other items around it &#x2013; like for example, spare parts business and so fourth &#x2013; then, we are trying to keep the best in the plant and plant definition and plant working is to sometimes &#x2013; some things to be improved. But we're on a good level. And we continue to believe that the value of a brand is as well shown in the price premium what we get.</p>
          <p>So today, we see us on a good way. We defend it positively. Will it last eternally? We don't know, but at least we will try to do our best to keep it under good way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So maybe only a little remark on the mess, as you put it, the mess on China is more or less correct. It's a little bit more complex in the remainder of the Group because we've got situations where profitability runs higher than in China, areas where profitability is significantly lower than in China. In China, as Mr. Klingler pointed out, it's so far hopefully &#x2013; it remains that way a perfect world. And we're trying to make the best out of it.</p>

          <p>We take our next question from Fraser Hill from BOA. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on your distribution expenses and perhaps tying this back into the VW Passenger margin. That obviously grew in absolute numbers, but the mark &#x2013; but the percentage of sales came down from about 9.3% I think it was &#x2013; or even 9.5% in 2010 in the first quarter and about 9.5% on average for the full year. And we were down at about 8.3% in Q1. So, sort of why has that come down? How sustainable is that at that level? And how much of that relates to the passenger car margin, with some context going forward, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Fraser. One question. It refers to the distribution costs, if we can give there an outlook and how much is that &#x2013; and in which relation is that to the folks in the passenger car business. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, concerning the distribution costs we have seen that there has been a good tendency 2009 to 2010, and now we have a good tendency from 2010 to 2011. So you come up to these reduction distribution costs from 9.5% to 8.3%, which you just mentioned. I tried to explain before that a big part of this is due to the high acceptance of our cars and of our new products and to the very good mix as well as we are selling cars with a higher turnover than last year or the year before by the way you have seen a better increase of turnover in general.</p>
          <p>How sustainable it will be, it's very difficult to say. What we see is that we are having a pretty good control on this cost level. Of course, we try to keep it on a good controlled level. On the other side, we know that we have to be flexible and that we need to be as well always in level with the competition. So, in general, we believe that the actual decrease of the distribution costs are first due to our level of cost control, but as well second, due to the turnover per car increase. And second, we have a clear orientation to keep our sales distribution costs on a reasonable level by keeping the other side as well as much flexibility as needed to get the revenues into the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you're referring to our swing factor. Now, let's just &#x2013; well, we are showing an effect of &#x20AC;2.2 billion for volume mix and price effect. And of course the ballpark of that is volume related with a decent part of mix effects are both product mix and regional mix, and also a little price effect, which under the circumstances is a very positive sign. On the mix side, we should mention that the cars sold in the C and D segment did improve further on, which normally is positive for the margin side of the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. I have one question to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. In the 2011 outlook, you're saying that the modular toolkit will increasingly have a positive impact on cost. Is it right assume that is mainly or only MLB, that MQB will probably rather have a negative impact in '11 and will then have a much larger positive impact in 2012 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Daniel, for your question. It refers to the modular toolkit and the impact and improvement of our cost structure, if it refers to only to the MLB or also to MQB, which is introduced in the year 2012. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Very clearly, we &#x2013; just going through used a few months ago one of the most important for cars on the MLB, the modular toolkit with the longitudinal position of the engine. This was the Audi A6, very much volume car, which was extremely positively appreciated by the market now, customers. And this means that we have a significant portfolio sitting now on the MLB modular toolkits.</p>
          <p>So, that's if you want to put that way, the basis which we are moving into 2011 second half and 2012 and '13 of course. And I was trying to elaborate a little bit on the additional implementation of a brand new modular toolkit, which we call MQB. Again, that's the toolkit, which carries the engine in a transverse position. We will start introducing this toolkit 2012. And this, of course, relates to a number of the very volume cars of the Volkswagen Group, and will consecutively have a very significant affect on the cost side of the business and, of course, also consequently on the profit side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Aleksej Wunrau from BHF-Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Aleksej Wunrau, BHF-Bank. Very briefly on the negative financial result, which strike me a little bit as I did not expect it in such magnitude and which was motivated by higher interests by the company. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we've already seen higher interest at the long end of the curve, and still hedging instruments or the contribution from hedging instruments was positive. Now there has been a very moderate increase in short-term yields and hedging instruments are down. So, I wonder whether you could briefly elaborate on that and indicate what further corrections would need to be anticipated for the remainder of the year if upward pressure on the interest rate side persisted? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So your question refers to our negative other financial result. If we can give you some more explanations, and if we can give indications for the further development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe a few more details on our hedge accounting just to avoid misunderstanding here. First of all, I possibly should mention that as you well aware, we do run our hedging strategy on a very conservative basis, which means we do hedge our underlying business to a very large extent. That's why we factor in our hedges in terms of the cash flow hedges against our equity position. So if you look at the balance sheet, you will find in other comprehensive income a quite significant effect coming out of the revaluation of the cash flow hedges.</p>
          <p>Now, just recently in the first quarter, the revaluation contributed in the magnitude of roughly &#x20AC;2.4 billion to our equity on that side. Now, what we do split away and reflect this in our P&amp;L, and this is the component you would find in our financial result, is the impact coming out of interest. And as you are well aware, in the last few months the interest levels, for example, between dollar and euro, shifted away quite significantly, which led to the effect stated with roughly &#x20AC;600 million in our financial result in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So, to argue on how this is going to develop further means entering into some speculation on interest rates always with regard to two or three currencies against each other. As we do not want to get there, again let me clearly say, this is a non-cash effect. And it is also important to recognize that this technical effect will reverse entirely before the expiration of the respective hedging contracts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I will be quick. I just want to understand, could you quantify <mark type="indiscernible" /> (84:15) what is happening in the U.S. in terms of a swing in profitability? There is a nice swing in Volkswagen earnings, the brand earnings. How much of that is happening in the U.S., or another way, are you still losing money in the U.S. and are you planning to be profitable and EBIT level in the U.S. this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Philippe. So one question refers to the U.S. business, if we can quantify any improvement in the operating performance or if we can give here some more details, if we are still losing money there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the U.S. side, to cut long story short, as you're well aware, we have been losing money on a Group level, and in order to avoid misunderstanding here, Group level means that we in a proportional way allocate the respective fixed costs to that business relative to revenue. So, this is clearly still the situation that we are in the red, nevertheless, and in the past years, the situation has improved quite significantly.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, we're doing the best we can to as quick as possible enter into a black figure, we will get &#x2013; try to get there in 2013 at the latest. And the most actual situation looks very promising because after the introduction of the new Jetta model, the first design pictures on the U.S. Passat and the just recent introduction of the new Beetle. We have got a portfolio of models in our hand, which is produced to a large extent in America, and that's making our lives there much more easier.</p>
          <p>In a complementary way, on the side of the marketing and distribution network, the dealer network, some very significant changes have been made leading to a much more robust situation going forward. And that's why we feel extremely comfortable with our U.S. strategy. So, in one sentence, situation much improved, still some way to go. We'll get there in 2013 at the latest.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As you know we have in our Mark '18 strategy four clear targets. Three of them are qualitative and only one is quantitative. On the qualitative goals, one is clearly we're going to become the top performing customer satisfaction. The second is we want to have the best team on board. That means we need to have the most satisfied people here through it. We want to make a decent results. I think that has been often as well published. And finally, we talk about the volumes.</p>
          <p>It is clear that Toyota actually suffering due to the problems in Japan. We are looking at that with a lot of respect, a lot of thinking to them because this could happen as well to Germany. So it's an accident. This could have an impact for their sales numbers in the year 2011. But our goal is not looking for passing Toyota because of an accident, but going forward long-term perspective.</p>
          <p>So we have our Mark '18 strategy. We keep on going with the Mark '18 strategy. Maybe we're earlier, maybe we're late. But we want to make all four goals at the same time. So, three of them qualitative and one of them qualitative and one of them quantitative. And by the way, we are not sure that the speculation about this theme has <mark type="indiscernible" /> (90:16) value for our strategy.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just &#x2013; could you just give us an idea in terms of quantifying the impact of the disaster in Japan on the supply chain? I didn't quite get some of the answers you gave to the analysts as to how much if any production stoppages you have had as a result, and what you foresee coming over the next few quarters.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Actually, we have answered that question already about the impact coming from Japan on our supply chain or production, but I'm sure we are happy to give you a short answer.</p>

          <p>To get started with this, there are currently no adverse effects in production. Our task force is achieving improvements in the supply chain situation on a daily basis. There is, however, uncertainty throughout the industry with regards to the availability of specific components. And as a result we cannot rule out the possibility that in individual cases, the configurations cannot for the time being be ordered or will be subject to longer delivery times. However, the top priority is to keep our customers fully informed.</p>
