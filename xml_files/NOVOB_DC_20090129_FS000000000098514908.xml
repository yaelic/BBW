          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Full Year 2008 Results Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our results for 2008 which was released earlier today. I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, CEO of Novo Nordisk. With me I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer, and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our home page, novonordisk.com, along with the slide that we'll be using for this conference call. The conference call is, as usual, scheduled to last approximately one hour and I'd like to start the presentation by the outlines on slide number one. The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 30 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number two. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation. Also note that this conference call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on Novo Nordisk's website after the conference.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number three. We're satisfied with sales performance for 2008 with the sales growth of 12% reported and 9% in local currencies. The performance is driven by continuous, steady and durable penetration of our modern insulins in all key markets. 2008, the modern insulins exceeded sales growth of 28% in local currencies driven by growth in North America and Europe. Biopharmaceutical franchise showed solid double-digit growth rate measured in local currencies driven by NovoSeven and Norditropin.</p>
          <p>Turning to financials, operating profit grew 38% as reported and by more than 25% adjusted for the impact from currencies and cost related to the closure of pulmonary diabetes projects. An important factor in achieving this has been a continuous solid improvement of our productivity in manufacturing. These improvements are mainly related to increased efficiency in insulin pump manufacturing and insulin filling activities.</p>
          <p>The results and significantly improved cash generation have led us to propose and increase the dividends per share from DKK 4.5 to DKK 6 at the General Assembly in 2009.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the current share repurchase program has been expanded by DKK 1 billion to 18.5 billion leaving shares at a cash value of DKK 6 billion to be repurchased in 2009. Novo Nordisk in 2008 reached all four long-term financial targets as outlined in 2006. The full ratios used are still considered appropriate measures to ensure value creation and several targets have now been increased. Brandgaard will provide more insights into this later in this conference call.</p>
          <p>For 2009, operating profit growth is expected to be 10% in local currencies which is in line with the preliminary plans provided in connection with the financial release for the first nine months of 2008. Operating profit as reported is expected to be around nine percentage points higher than the growth rate in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four for review highlights within our research and development activities in 2008. 2008 liraglutide was verified in Europe, United States on May 23 and in Japan 53 days later. To our knowledge this is the fastest regulatory filing ever in the three major markets of a pharmaceutical product. Liraglutide's strong clinical profile was during 2008 further enforced in the LEAD 6 studies compared liraglutide treatment with glimepiride.</p>
          <p>The study confirmed the significant clinical advantage of once-daily treatment with human GLP-1 liraglutide compared to glimepiride, the only GLP-1 product on the market today. In addition, we recently received two-year data from the LEAD 3 trial. Results of the one-year extension largely confirmed the positive results for the initial 52 weeks of treatment in the LEAD 3 study.</p>
          <p>We believe the third generation of modern insulin can be operated once more with the new generation of insulins. We've now completed the Phase 2 program and achieved clinical-proven concept for two new generation insulins. Longer-acting insulin analogue with the potential duration of action of more than 24 hours and unusual soluble dual-acting insulin analogue preparation also with the potential duration of action of more than 24 hours. Based on encouraging results of Phase 2, these are now expected to start Phase 3 in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we decided to discontinue all research and development activities within pulmonary insulin following findings of primary lung cancer in patients using the only existing pulmonary insulin product available in the market at that time. Instead, we took further steps in the development of non-invasive deliveries of both insulin and GLP-1. With a number of projects in the research phases, our long-term aspiration remains to develop orally administered insulin and GLP1 products for treatment of diabetes.</p>
          <p>Activella and NovoSeven was further strengthened in 2008, with a launch of a room temperature stable version of NovoSeven. And within human growth hormone, we initiated a Phase 2 study with a longer acting version of growth hormone intended for administration once weekly.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, we had to terminate two Phase 3 trials in '08 &#x2013; the NovoSeven trauma study and the growth hormone study in dialysis patients with low serum albumin levels.</p>
          <p>The latter was discontinued due to very slow recruitment, where the trauma study was terminated as the pre-plan internal analysis showed low probability of achieving a statistically significant result of the study was completed with a planned population.</p>
          <p>Finally, our long-term strategy to develop a new therapeutic area within territory diseases was further strengthened with the first two projects moving into Phase 1 clinical development and with the establishment of a new research site in Seattle in United States.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five for an update on the sales development for 2008. In 2008, the diabetes care segment grew by 13% measured in local currencies. The portfolio of modern insulin was the main growth driver, which accounted for 77% total sales growth. Our pharmaceuticals grew 11% measured in local currencies. And sales of NovoSeven increased 14%. Consumer growth for hormone franchise grew 12% both measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Sales of HRT increased to 1% measured in local currency despite the impact from generic competition of Activella in United States since March of 2008.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. On the next three slides, we illustrate the dynamics within the global insulin market by progressing on three of our key markets &#x2013; Europe, United States and China.</p>
          <p>European insulin market is the largest of the three measured by volume. During the last five years, it's been growing at compound and annual growth rate of above 5% in terms of volume and almost 10% in terms of value. The higher value growth has been driven by semi penetration of modern insulins which in the third quarter of 2008 reached 58% returns of volume compared to 53% same time the year before.</p>
          <p>In the modern insulin segment, Novo Nordisk remains market leader with the volume margin of 51%. Novo Nordisk's increased market share in the modern insulin segment is driven by market share gains for all of our pre-modern insulins, NovoRapid, NovoMix, and Levemir.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number seven for an update on the U.S. diabetes sales performance. The U.S. insulin market had during the last five years been growing at a compound growth rate of 5% again in volume plus 14% in value.</p>
          <p>Recent value growth in the U.S. market has been generated by consistent penetration of modern insulin which now is above 56% measured in volume compared to 61% a year ago. In the modern insulin market, Novo Nordisk now owns a market share of 33% measured in volume.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk has consistently been increasing its market share in all three segments of the market. In the short-acting and the premix insulin segment NovoLog and NovoLog Mix expanding their leadership positions. Further Novo Nordisk is expanding its market share in the long-acting segment with the continued penetration of Levemir.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number eight for an update on Chinese market performance. During the last five years to Chinese insulin market has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of more than 25% measured in volume and about 30% measured in value.</p>
          <p>This rapid expansion has been driven by a significant growth in the number of people with diabetes due to lifestyle changes and increased healthcare coverage of the European population. Compared to Europe and United States, predominance of the premix segment comprises about 60% of the volume market is worth noting.</p>
          <p>Large premix segments are common to Asian markets reflecting different treatment patterns, then applies to that of the U.S. and those markets in Europe. Conversion of insulin, of modern insulins in China are still in an early stage with modern insulins comprising almost 15% of the market measure in volume compared to 8% in the third quarter of the year before.</p>
          <p>In order to obtain a leading and fairly stable market share of 61% measure in volume. I'd just like to <mark type="inaudible" /> for an update of the NovoSeven sales. NovoSeven sales increased 14% local currencies and 9% as reported in '08. Sales growth of NovoSeven was primarily realized in North America and International Operations.</p>
          <p>Sales growth primarily reflects increase suggest within the congenital bleeding disorder segments when Novo Nordisk is the global leader and was supported by the launch of the room temperature-stable in '07 in the U.S. and key market in Europe.</p>
          <p>Treatment of spontaneous bleeds for congenital inhibitor patients remains the largest area of use. In the fourth quarter of '08, NovoSeven sales in the U.S. were positively impacted by wholesalers stock buying. Further more sales of NovoSeven International Operations in '08 were positively impacted by timing of tender sales compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 10, this provides you an update on our human performance franchise.  Novo Nordisk is maintaining the segment position globally with a room temperature-stable formulation of growth hormone called Norditropin. Norditropin sales increased 12% in local currencies and 10% reported, thereby continuing the solid growth momentum of the growth hormone franchise.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk's &#x2013; Norditropin sales growth was primarily realized in North America and in Europe with more than 73% share growth in 2008. However, all regions contributed to growth in local currencies. Novo Nordisk's global volume market share is now 23% and 19% in United States.</p>
          <p>In November 2008, the FDA approved Norditropin for the treatment of children with short stature, born small for gestational age with no catch-up growth by the age of two to four years. The approval is part of Novo Nordisk's strategy to pursue label expansion for our growth hormone products.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to hand over to Mads to give an update on the development of our pipeline.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to slide 11 for an update on our diabetes care pipeline. Let me first give you an update on the regulatory process for liraglutide in Europe, Japan and the U.S. Novo Nordisk has an ongoing constructive dialogue with the regulatory agencies in all BT markets. And we believe that we are making good progress with all agencies.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Novo Nordisk has submitted answers to questions from the European Medicines Agency, EMEA and is moving towards the regulatory decision from the European Commission by mid-2009.</p>
          <p>In Japan, the regulatory process is also progressing as planned and Novo Nordisk has answered questions from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, PMDA. Novo Nordisk expects a regulatory decision in 2010 in Japan in line with the average drug approval timelines in this country.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. and as announced in November 2008, the planned FDA Advisory Committee Meeting for liraglutide will take place on the 2nd of April, 2009. As you may be aware, FDA Advisory Committees are panels of independent experts, who advise the FDA in the process of making regulatory decisions. These meetings are open to the public and are common for major pharmaceutical drugs under review.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk is looking forward to the panel meeting and to discussing the expert assessment of the benefit risk ratio, which is based on the efficacy and safety data from the entire clinical development program. The primary phase 3 endpoint HbA1c is expected to be an important driver of patient benefits. Thus, liraglutide was shown to lower HbA1c effectively when either supplementing or replacing existing anti-diabetic therapy. The comparative drugs in phase 3 included sulfonylurea, basel insulin and TCD and the trials review of the liraglutide treatment lowered hemoglobin A1c significantly more than these agents.</p>
          <p>In addition these have brought a greater percentage of subjects to the ADA target of less than 7% without the occurrence of hypoglycemia compared to the above-mentioned active comparative treatments. The Advisory Committee will also focus the safety profile of liraglutide &#x2013; on the safety profile of liraglutide extensively and in this regard a key topic is expected to be the cardiovascular risk assessment of liraglutide in light of the new FDA guidance document published in December last year. This so called guidance to industry on assessment of cardiovascular risk for anti-diabetic therapies makes recommendations about how to demonstrate that a new anti-diabetic therapy to treat type 2 diabetes is not associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Of relevant to this assessment liraglutide treatment was across the number of long-term phase 3 trials associated with significant reductions in both body weight and systolic blood pressure. This combined with the hemoglobin A1c and aggregated cardiovascular event data lead us to conclude that liraglutide is at the least not associated with an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile.</p>
          <p>As an integral part of the process, Novo Nordisk will submit a briefing book to the FDA and the Advisory Committee summarizing the data that will talk the basis for the liraglutide benefit risk assessment at the hearing on the 2nd of April. The briefing book will be made public at the FDA's website shortly before the meeting, until then Novo Nordisk would only elaborate on data that has been published in scientific journals or at scientific conferences as just customary when the company is engaged in a regulatory approval process.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Novo Nordisk remains convince that liraglutide is associated with important benefits in the treatment of diabetes and that the drug has a favorable benefit risk profile when used in mono or combination therapy. Novo Nordisk still expects some regulatory decisions from the FDA around mid-2009.</p>
          <p>In addition to Europe, U.S. and Japan, liraglutide is currently also undergoing review in the number of other countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland and Turkey.</p>
          <p>Staying with liraglutide Novo Nordisk has obtained headline data from the one year extension of the LEAD 3 study. The LEAD 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of two different daily doses of liraglutide compared to the sulfonylurea glimepiride in the treatment of type 2 diabetes for one year. The results from the initial year after study were published in September last year.</p>
          <p>It's over 321 patients out of the 440 patients completing the LEAD 3 one year study entered into an open-label extension in which they were to continue the treatment for four more years. The one year extension data showed that two years of liraglutide monotherapy therapy led to significant and sustained improvements in glycaemic control and weight loss compared to</p>
          <p>once-daily glimepiride monotherapy.</p>
          <p>At the 1.8 milligram dose, liraglutide lowered hemoglobin A1c by 1.1 percentage points versus 0.6 for glimepiride in the entire completed population. The difference which was statistically significant and in line with the results from the initial one year of the study.</p>
          <p>From an HbA1c baseline of slightly above 8% around 60% of the patients treated with 1.8 milligram liraglutide achieved the ADA target of an AIc [HbA1c] below 7% following two years therapy. With regard to body weight, the two year data showed a difference between patients treated with liraglutide and glimepiride up between three and four kilograms in favor of liraglutide.</p>
          <p>The safety profile of liraglutide was confirmed in the study. Specific as regard hypoglycemia in the two-year result update, there was a six times lower risk of hypoglycemia for patients treated with liraglutide compared to glimepiride.</p>
          <p>In October 2008, Novo Nordisk initiated the first of the three trials in the phase 3 program for the liraglutide in obesity and all patients have now been recruited. The trial investigates the ability of liraglutide to support patients in maintaining weight loss achieved by low calorie diet.</p>
          <p>One-year data sets from all three studies in the phase 3 program for obesity are now expected to be available before the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>In January 2009, PrandiMet was launched on the U.S. market. PrandiMet is a fixed-dose combination of the fast-acting insulin secretagogue repaglinide and metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. PrandiMet has been approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes who already treated with a meglitinide such as Prandin and metformin or who have inadequate glycaemic control on monotherapy with meglitinide or metformin.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the biopharmaceuticals pipeline. As mentioned by Lars, the FDA has recently approved Norditropin for the treatment of children that are born small for gestational age also known as SGA. These kids have a short stature because they failed to exhibit sufficient catch- up growth during the first years of the lives.</p>
          <p>The submission and approval of this indication has been part of Novo Nordisk's lab expansion strategy for growth hormone product Norditropin. Novo Nordisk has recently strengthened its efforts within the area of inflammation with the establishment of a research site in Seattle, U.S.</p>
          <p>In addition, and as announced in December last year, Novo Nordisk has entered the into a collaboration agreement with VLST Corporation, a Seattle-based biotechnology company, to develop therapeutic targets utilizing VLST's technology platform in the fields of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Under this agreement, Novo Nordisk and VLST will jointly undertake a research program to identify targets and develop protein-based product candidates.</p>
          <p>With that over to Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. We are satisfied with the financial results for 2008, which overall are in line with the provided guidance. The total sales growth in 2008 was 12% measured in the local currencies and 9% as reported. Sales growth was realized in all regions measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>The main contributors to the growth were North America and International Operations providing nearly 50 and 30% respectively of the total sales growth. Europe contributed around 20%, and Japan &amp; Oceania 2% of the sales growth, measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Local margin improved by 1.7 percentage point &#x2013; sorry, gross margin improved by 1.7 percentage point in local currencies, and by 1.2 percentage points in Danish kroner to 77.8 in 2008. The key drivers behind this improvement is still improved production efficiency in both upstream and downstream manufacturing and higher average selling prices primarily in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Total non-production related costs amounted to 23.4 billion in 2008, which is comparable to the 2007 levels. The development reflects lower costs related to research and development, primarily reflecting the non-recurring costs related to the discontinuation of AERx in 2007, and the discontinuation of the AERx projects and pulmonary diabetes projects in 2008.</p>
          <p>Sales and distribution costs increased at a lower level than sales. This primarily reflects a return of a deposit related to an antidumping case in Brazil, countered by higher costs related to the expanded sales force in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, costs in relation to the general employee share programme amounting to 171 million were expensed in 2008. In addition, Novo Nordisk expensed costs in relation to share-based long-term incentive programmes for the 29 executives in its Senior Management Board and 550 other senior employees in total amounting to DKK160 million.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in 2008 increased by 38% to 12.4 billion compared to 2007 and is above the previously communicated expectations of growth in operating profit of 32 to 35% as reported. Adjusting for the impact from the reversal of the permission related to an antidumping case in Brazil, operating profit was realized slightly above the previously communicated expectations for growth in operating profit.</p>
          <p>Net financials showed a net income of 322 million in 2008 compared to a net income of 2,029 million in 2007, where a non-recurring and tax exempt income of 1.5 billion from the divestment of the ownership of Dako's business activities was recovered.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange result was an income of 159 million compared to an income of 910 million in 2007. This development reflect gains on foreign exchange hedging activities, especially in U.S. dollar, partly offset by losses on commercial balances in non-hedged currencies, primarily related to emerging markets. Foreign exchange hedging losses of 864 million have been deferred for future income or loss recognition, primarily in 2009.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate in 2008 was 24%, which is inline with previous guidance. This represents an increase from last year, where the tax rate was impacted by the tax exempt income from the divestment of the ownership of Dako's business activities, as well as a non-recurring effect linked to the re-evaluation of the company's deferred tax liabilities as a consequence of the reduction in the Danish corporation tax rate implemented in 2007. Net profit for 2008 ended at 9.6 billion which represents an increased of 13% compared to 2007</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide, for an update on our long-term financial target. Despite the challenging currency environment, Novo Nordisk has now, by 2008, reached our four long-term financial targets announced in 2006, and as shown on slide 14.</p>
          <p>Focusing on growth, profitability, financial return and generation of cash, Novo Nordisk introduced the four long-term targets in 1996 to balance short and long-term considerations. The ratios and targets have been revised and updated in 2001 and again in 2006. Even the achievement of the targets documented in our financial statements for 2008, Novo Nordisk has now decided to revise the targets again.</p>
          <p>In a highly volatile world economy, I would like to stress that the revision is based on an assumption of a continuation of the current business environment for Novo Nordisk's main therapeutic areas, and are also given the current scope of business. The targets have been prepared assuming that currency exchange rates remain at the current level on a five-year horizon.</p>
          <p>The target level for operating profit remains at 15% on average. The target still allows for deviation in individual years if necessitated by business opportunities, market conditions, or exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>The target level for operating margin is increased from 25% to 30%. The key enabling factors are expected to be further productivity improvements in manufacturing and administrative areas, while at the same time, ensuring investments for both, research and development, as well as sales and marketing.</p>
          <p>The target level for return on invested capital measured post tax is increased from 30% to 50%. The raised target reflects the expectations of continued lower growth in invested capital, relative to operating profit, as well as a stable recurring effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>The target level for the cash to earnings ratio is increased from 70 to 80%, reflecting improved cash conversion ability. As previously, this target will be pursued looking at the average, over a three-year period. Performance on this ratio maybe impacted in individual years, by significant acquisitions, investments, or licensing activities.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 15 for an update on our plans for returning cash to the shareholders. Novo Nordisk will continue to return cash to its shareholders through a combination of dividend payouts and share repurchases. At the Annual General Meeting on 18 of May, 2009, the Board of Directors will propose a 33% increase in dividend to now DKK 6.00 per share corresponding to a payout ratio of 38% compared to 35% for the financial year 2007, well-adjusted for the impact from Dako and the AERx discontinuation in 2007.</p>
          <p>No dividend will be paid on the company's holding of treasury B shares. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has approved an increase of 1 billion in the ongoing 17.5 billion share repurchase program bringing the total share repurchase program to 18.5 billion. Novo Nordisk still expects to finalize the share repurchase program before the end of 2009. As a consequence, Novo Nordisk expects to repurchase shares equal to a cash value of 6 billion in 2009.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial guidance for 2009. In line with the preliminary expectations provided in connection with the financial release for the first nine months of 2008, Novo Nordisk expects sales growth at the level of 10%, measured in local currencies for 2009. In reported terms, it now corresponds to an expected reported sales growth around 5 percentage points higher. This is based on expectations of continued market penetration from Novo Nordisk's key strategic products within Diabetes care and Biopharmaceuticals, as well as expectations of continued intense competition during 2009.</p>
          <p>Operating profit growth is expected to be 10% in local currencies, which also is in line with the preliminary plans provided in connection with the nine months results. This reflects a slightly higher absolute level for operating profit in 2009 than previously expected given the slightly better than expected reported operating profit for 2008. As reported, operating profit growth is expected to be around 9 percentage points higher due to the positive currency impact.</p>
          <p>The forecast for 2009 reflects a continued improvement of the gross margin, and increased spending for sales and distribution, relative to sales, due to an expected high level of sales and marketing activities, primarily reflected through the expected approval and launch of liraglutide and continued global market penetration for the portfolio of modern insulins.</p>
          <p>For 2009, Novo Nordisk expects a net financial expense of 1.6 billion, reflecting significant foreign exchange hedging losses, primarily related to the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, as well as expected losses related to non-hedged currencies. The effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be around 24%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is expected to be around 3 billion in 2009. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are around 2.6 billion, and free cash flow is expected to be at least 9 billion.</p>
          <p>All of these expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic downturn will not significantly deteriorate the business environment for Novo Nordisk during 2009. In addition, the expectations are based on the currently prevailing exchange rate, as outlined in Appendix 7 of the Company Announcement.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen will now moderate the Q&amp;A session that will last until 2 o'clock. Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual, with the objectives of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions, two questions. One, could you give us a little bit more detail on your longer-term targets? Over what sort of timeframes should we think about these being achievable? I think you mentioned the currency looking over five years, but if you could give an idea when we could think of the full targets being reached? Secondly, still on the long-term targets. Could you give us an idea of your sales growth assumptions underlying the unchanged growth in operating profits? And second question, how should we think of your dividend and share buyback policy in the future, given this year the very large 33% increase in the dividend and the buyback program coming to an end for the current program in &#x2013; at the end of 2009? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien here. About, first just to comment on the timeframe, we usually talk about our long-term financial targets in a timeframe of about five years. You will see that, we've reached the targets that were set in connection with the start of 2006 by now. So, this was slightly earlier than previously anticipated. But you should think about it in a timeframe of around five years. But Jesper perhaps you would comment a little bit on some of the individuals going into those long-term targets and also talk about the dividend and the buyback program please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The requirement for &#x2013; to deliver 50% operating profit is that we have a stable double-digit growth in our topline. So, we are assuming in these targets that we can continue to deliver double-digit growth primarily being fueled by our diabetes care franchise. So, that is a key assumption going into this. In terms of the dividend and the share repurchase program, you've seen uplift  the payout ratio in 2008 to a level of around 38% and that is a reflection of our size and we'll close to where we see the pharma peer group, which we see around the 40%. So, we're still fine to have a payout ratio, which resembles the peer group. In terms of the share repurchase program, we basically have decided to end the current program as we have stated for the last two years by the end of 2009. And that will still be the case, if we when we reach the end of that program, still have excess cash, it is our expectation that whatever cash generation we have over and above the dividend return  and what we need in terms of having a appropriate liquidity reserve on our balance sheet that would then be returned to shareholders in terms of repurchase program. So, I would anticipate that you would see us launch a new repurchase program in 2010 unless our operating conditions or investments have necessitated anything else.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Henrik Simonsen, <mark type="inaudible" />. Good afternoon gentlemen. To continue these long-term targets there, yes could you provide a little bit of guidance with the &#x2013; very significant luminous you are seeing on the return on invested capital from 30 to 50%, what kind of underlying assumptions do you have for CapEx to sell there longer-term and a question to Mads on liraglutide, when are you expecting to announce the extension of the LEAD 2 trial and second to that will you be allowed to present the two year extension of the LEAD 3 trial in that briefing book you're presenting to the advisor committee?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Henrik. Lars Rebien here. First, I would like to address the question raised to &#x2013; based upon the long-term target in particular on the return on invested capital and CapEx assumptions behind that have been &#x2013; Mads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When do we have extension results of LEAD 2 and will be allowed to include the LEAD 3 extension data in the book to the FDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; clearly the CapEx to sale that we recorded in 2008 was unusually low <mark type="inaudible" />, I think the level below 4% is not to be anticipated going forward. We have as you are aware initiated a large new investment in the pilling plant in China. We've also geared our investments for additional devices that will drive our investment level; on the 3 year horizon should be in the ballpark of 6% to sales. So, I think that is a stable assumption to use for your models around 6% of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  And for Mads license results for B2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well for those who don't recall it, the situation was that we had two extension programs. One in B2 which is the mid &#x2013; mid form in add on trial, which went for six months and here the extension was 1.5 year &#x2013; an 18 months extension creating a total exposure of two years in that population. And the other extension program, we've been running in the LEAD 1 to 5 trials has been B3. Well, as we have been discussing today it was a one year study with a total of four years extension providing aggregate five-year exposure to these patients in mono-therapy. Now since it is kind of one-and-half year ago that we released the B2 data. It is true that we are getting very close to having the one and half year extension data from that specific program. And we will of course update appropriately during the course of our routine quarterly updates on that one.</p>
          <p>In regard to what will be presented at the advisory committee on April 2nd, it is actually sure that this briefing book, which is a rather sizable document, rests on a very, very large and elaborate amount of both analysis and meta-analysis and that such the meta-analysis that are done across the entire trial populations has got to have a cut-off date that makes it realistic to have &#x2013; meet the April 2nd hearing date. That means that if there are serious events for instance going on in this trial, which I can say, it does not seem to be the case then of course that will be part of the hearing but the meta-analysis element, which for instance is of relevance to the cardiovascular risk assessment is something that is a very lengthy exercise, and which will not necessarily include the one year follow up on LEAD 3. But we have, at this point, rather sizable amount of exposure for the discussion already at the April 2nd meeting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mads, I take it's up to you what you will presenting at in that briefing book. It's not up to FDA to design.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's not it's a negotiation with the agency about exactly what amount of data you are able to squeeze-in before the AdCom meeting. That is a question of how much analysis, do you have time and ability to do in due time for compiling the briefing book of high quality. So, there will be a lot of extension data and so on. But not necessarily in the meta-analysis; the one year on the extension on the LEAD 3.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question now from Andrew Baum of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So &#x2013; two parts, so firstly, could you comment on whether you've seen sufficient cardiovascular vents in the match analysis of the LEAD trials, the ones that have been published at conferences, as you alluded to, in order to satisfy the FDA's criteria for pre-approval? That would be my first question. And then my second question, actually I'll stop there if I could come back and just have a quick second question after...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as you go right here. Well, first of all obviously the LEAD program, even though we now have a very high degree of exposure with all the extensions studies and the size of the program taken into account. The LEAD program has not as such been enriched with New York Heart Association cast three and four patients which are the severe cardiac patients. That has not been done by any company either too. Yet, we do obviously have the numbers of the civilians and when we look at it the situation is looking favorable. But we will not go at this point into more detail, and our analysis of the situation is that with what we have, in terms of clinical exposure and clinical data, the situation will be that we will be asked to do a post-approval cardiovascular risk study that we will discuss at the April 2nd meeting with the advisory committee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second part was just on the outlook for M&amp;A, obviously in an environment where there are several interesting assets remained to be depletive from cash. You have indicated over the last 12 months, Lars Rebien, the idea of an acquisition up to $20 billion in magnitude, could you just give us the parameters that you would look for in identifying the target either qualitative or financial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Andrew. Just a slight correction here, I mean, I've never announced an acquisition of up to 20 billion. I think, I have been asked in the past of what our financing capacity might be, but that's a completely different matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize for misquoting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. It's quite all right. You're not the only one that has read this into some of the statements. So it's my apologies for having not been clear enough. What I can say is, that it is of course correct &#x2013; correctly observed that there are assets out there for cataract companies that might be available. We are currently not looking at major acquisitions. We have made technology acquisitions recently which are strengthening our diabetes franchise in particular in the area of formulations <mark type="inaudible" /> will allow for new generation of orally available compounds to treat both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. And we are looking for projects in &#x2013; within the area of information we announced a deal with <mark type="inaudible" />. On the west coast of the U.S. we might be looking at buying smaller companies. But this is comparatively to the consolidation that is going on in the industry, very, very small acquisitions.</p>
          <p>We believe fundamentally that we have strong growth opportunities in our core franchises. As you can see, if we just look at the insulin business as such, 80% of the growth over the next 10 years for the company are expected to be in the area of insulin and modern insulins and next generation insulins. So very, very strong growth indeed and hence we think it's prudent of us to concentrate on realizing that potential rather than expanding too broadly. But a nice look that we could buy additional products to strengthen and accelerate our portfolio in insulation. Where we have to admit we have an earning, although exciting pipeline, but where we can see that the break even from a P&amp;L perspective is up 10 years <mark type="inaudible" />. So, therefore, there are some hopes there that we could feel, but it's not anywhere near the numbers that you have envisaged.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Novod of Handelsbanken. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Michael Novod from Handelsbanken. A question on your gross margin in Q4, could you try to give us a bit of spilt of how much was improvements and how much was currency effect? And then a second question is how much is the <mark type="inaudible" /> part of the long-term targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Jesper, if you would comment on the gross margin in Q4, then I'll perhaps say a few words about the <mark type="inaudible" /> in the long-term target. We have of course, assumed that we are getting an approval, both in United States, Europe and Japan, and hence are able to launch mid this year in United States, Q3 in Europe and in 2010 in Japan. But short-term, it's going to be relatively modest. It is upon us to build the GLP-1 segment. We have noticed the fact that by ADA has gone flat and reached annulized sales of between 700 and $800 million. So this is going to be a market buildup revitalization of the interest in the GLP-1 segment. We have taken some numbers in but we have been relatively cautious and I was trying to allude to it by my statement before that in the 10-year projection for Novo Nordisk, 80% of the growth that we are projecting, of course, which are consistent with the long-term financial target are coming from the current and the next generation of modern insulins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you in the mean time been able to seek the Q4 growth margin <mark type="inaudible" /> final numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, as your aware, we are not to keen on discussing the gross margin per individual quarters, individual events can have a tendency to kind of have a significant impact on the individual quarter, but not necessarily have some recurring impact on the long-term. That I recall that we last year in 2007 the final quarter had some impairment charges, which effected that quarter and hence a direct comparison is maybe a little bit missing. But you do spot a quite significant event <mark type="inaudible" /> the top line in terms of a positive currency effect on sales in Q4 compared to a negative effect in the first three quarters of the year.</p>
          <p>And hence also on gross margin, we actually have a positive, around 30 basis point positive currency effect on gross margin in the final quarter of this year compared to last year. If we look at the full year development in our gross margin, you see around 150 basis point improvements coming from basically higher productivity and that's roughly evenly distributed between more efficient production of our proteins and roughly half of it related to more efficient selling of the insulins. And in terms of other &#x2013; the rest of the improvement is net positive from pricing in the U.S. and that's been for the full year offset by a negative 50 basis points reflecting the negative impact we had the first three quarters of the year.</p>

It seems that your EBIT margin is declining to 28% in Q4 comparing to above 40% in the three-yearly quarters of this year. Could you give us any sort of info on why this very weak EBIT margin in biopharmaceuticals has happened in Q4?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of, well spotted, business of course is linked to the decision to discontinue the low serum albumin project within human growth hormones and that was actually charged to the P&amp;L in the fourth quarter of this year.

        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, just one additional question to Mads, regarding the LEAD three year extension study. Have you seen an additional weight loss in the liraglutide group compared to the glimepiride group in the second year of the treatment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the most &#x2013; we just stated is that what the liraglutide does is that and we've seen the same &#x2013; you can see in obesity study is that it causes a very nice decline in body weight over the first half year or so. And then in spite of the excellent glucose control being maintained over extended periods and in spite of the natural propensity for human individual above the age of 40 to put on one pound of body weight year-over-year, we are actively able to maintain the weight reduction that was achieved in the first half of year therapy. So, the absolute numbers are about the same.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question now from Brian Modoff of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. It's Brian Modoff of Deutsche Bank calling from London. Two questions please. First relating to your long-term targets and second relating to liraglutide outcome studies post approval. Firstly on your long-term targets, you've given us your point estimate or certainly your point target. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit around the risks for those particularly on the pricing environment in the U.S. given the possibility of U.S. healthcare reform or some changes there? And the second question is relating to the liraglutide outcome studies, you've mentioned that you will likely do outcome studies post approval. And I was just wondering if you could talk about the motivations for those studies, whether you believe you'll be asked to do them by FDA whether you are voluntarily doing them, because you think its &#x2013; it will enhance the commercial potential of the drug? And I think there were some comments in the Danish press yesterday about cost and how long these might take. Any color on that would be greatly appreciated? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien. I will comment on the long-term financial targets and then Mads will discuss your question on the lirag situation. In regards to the setting of the long-term target, we have obviously &#x2013; we had to make certain assumptions on the future pricing environment. And what we have &#x2013; and this has been consistent with our perspective. In recent years we have factored into our models and pricing environment in the U.S. where the abilities to raise prices have been significantly reduced.</p>
          <p>However, what we also mentioned in the risk factors, influencing the long-term financial targets are that significant radical changes in our business environment would, of course, impact our ability to achieve these like significant radical changes in currencies as well. And so one can, of course, speculate what the situation will be in the future in United States. It's been politically stated by the new administration before the election that healthcare reform is an important political objective, and so we have to assume that some kind of new regulation will be put into place.</p>
          <p>We have, of course, internally discussed greatly to what extent that will influence Novo Nordisk. We think if you look back long-term on this, being a leader in diabetes care the possibility of American exclusive diabetes achieving better treatment &#x2013; it's got to be positive for a company like ours. The question is how quickly these reforms are being put in place. One can speculate that more targeted reforms could be an easier target to execute from the administration's perspective rather than all comprehensive plans. And in both cases we have to assume that there will be a wish from the government to have the best possible prices for products, which are being extended to correct the <mark type="inaudible" /> individual.</p>
          <p>So in short, there maybe a slight negative price impact initially. Longer-term, we are expecting there will be a volume expansion of business opportunities for ourselves and others competing in this space. And we expect that this in, short of very, very radical reforms; let me put it that way. I hope that answers at least or at least gives you some kind of guidance as to how we are thinking <mark type="inaudible" />. Mads, will you comment on the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Yes, I will indeed, and in regard to the cardiovascular situation, it's my firm belief that based on the guidance document that was put into circulation by FDA, recently that, <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; is including the retro type going forward will pending what they see in aggregated Phase 2 and 3 meta-analysis. Be asked to do post approval, trial commitments in relation to the fact that in the Phase 2 and 3 trial, you typically &#x2013; simply do not have enough cardiovascular events because of the duration of the studies not being multi-years. So that you will have to study this in more detail, post approval. And our assessment there is that we will be needing anywhere from five up to a maximum of around 10,000 patients in this study period, of up to around five years. Have to say that, even though we have worked with the leading experts in this field for quite some time, and have trials synopsis and so on that are kind of, you can say ready to fly. It's our belief that these will form the basis for discussions that we will have at the Advisory Committee meeting on April 2nd. And only thereafter will we nail down the exact statistics and the composition of the patient population in the trial, which will then be kicked off as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

          <p>Hey, good afternoon gentleman, and just two quick questions if I may. Firstly, it relates to the long-term targets, but I just was curious, if liraglutide for whatever reason was materially delayed, how would those long-term targets on a five-year view alter, if at all? And then secondly, I'm just trying to square the circle as it were in terms of the guidance around the <mark type="inaudible" /> improvement as in &#x2013; and as it relates to improving your cash conversion. I guess you're a very cash generative company as it stands already. You're going to look to improve that cash flow even more. Would that not have some affect in terms of reducing the return on invested capital? And I guess what do you plan therefore to do with the excess cash to prevent that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Okay Jesper you are on here, the first question to address is what impact a non-approval of  by liraglutide or delay, a significant delay of liraglutide would have on our ability to achieve the five year long-term, the financial target, and taking any comments on the return on invested capital, implications of our cash liquidity situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the development in the approval process for liraglutide, if we look at the 2009 numbers, we are actually anticipating that we will be looking at a selling and distributing ratio around 31% compared to around 28. So, it's 3% upping &#x2013; and you can see from those numbers that it's actually in the near-term clearly a drag on our performance. The investment we've put into liraglutide and that will, of course, in delay of that be somewhat deferred. An element of that have already been incurred as we have expanded the U.S. sales force and that will then be dedicated to our portfolio of modern insulin. But of course, the significant element of these expectations of the higher level of SNB costs are related to launch costs. So, they would just defer. So we won't do anything materially in the near-term horizon.</p>
          <p>In terms of looking longer out, I think it's &#x2013; everything else being equal, it's going to be more challenging for us on eleven and beyond there to deliver a double-digit top line. And that, of course, regarding that we are very dedicated in the marketing of our portfolio of modern insulins, and then, of course, also that we will be successful with the launch of the new generation modern insulin. So, it lifts the bar slightly in that area. In terms of return on invested capital to know that the way we measure return on invested capital, we measure it ex any financial assets. So, the level of CapEx that we have on the balance sheet is so to speak unaffected, <mark type="inaudible" /> will remain unaffected by the level of cash on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the cash conversion ability, you could say that lifting of it from 70 to 80 percentage is somewhat modest when we &#x2013; currently operating at a level probably low on a free average in the 90% level. Of course, the investment level has been relative low the last couple of years and as I said I expect those to be at the level of around 6%, and that would then cater for a cash-to-earning ratio in the ballpark of 80%. And as I mentioned previously, we expect to return that cash to our shareholders if there are no interesting acquisition opportunities in our core therapeutic areas as alluded to by Lars Rebien earlier in the presentation.</p>

          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, this ended up being the last question. Just before I close off, just to throw one more complicating factor in the discussion about a potential non-approval of liraglutide is, of course, more complex depending on what's the cause of this is? If it's the cause is that the total GLP-1 class is under suspension and therefore not approvable and then of course that will generate momentum under the modern insulins where Novo Nordisk's very well placed. So it all depends on whether it's product specific, class specific or what the concerns might be. But nonetheless, we are, of course, looking forward to getting an approval and make the necessary investment to make a success out of the chosen.</p>
          <p>So, we are sorry that we are closing now. We have another commitment that we have to honor as well. We thank you very much for your interest in Novo Nordisk and we look forward to coming back and reporting to you at the Q1 numbers and whenever matured information presents itself that we think we should share with you. Thank you very much.</p>
