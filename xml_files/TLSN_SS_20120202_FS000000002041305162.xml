          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome back to TeliaSonera and the result presentation for our Fourth Quarter and the Full Year of 2011. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m. I'm the Head of Investor Relations. With me, as usual, I have our President and CEO, Mr. Lars Nyberg, and our CFO, Mr. Per-Arne Blomquist. We will start with the presentation from Lars and a review of the financials by Per-Arne, and then we would go for Q&amp;A, as usual.</p>
          <p>For you in the audience, we have a special topic. We will illustrate and demonstrate with our help of <mark type="ph" /> Michael (0:34) here, our 4G services, both when it comes to dongle, tablets. And we will also demonstrate our new handsets that we will launch in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, welcome, everyone, and I leave the floor to Lars.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Welcome. Look at the numbers, we took at the top line a little bit shy of 3%, we used 2.6% for the full year. I have to admit that when we went into the fourth quarter, I was a little bit concerned about the macro situation in many markets. And I was very relieved to see that the Swedish market, for instance, continues to be extremely strong.</p>
          <p>We grew more than 9% in our mobile business in Sweden, which is fantastic. But also in markets where the macroeconomic situation isn't worse, like Spain, we managed to get more than 20% growth. We had a double-digit growth in Eurasia, maybe somewhat lower than I had hoped for, but &#x2013; so I'm not unhappy with the growth, although we did miss the 3%.</p>
          <p>I'll come back on the EBITDA, because that's a very positive part. But I would like to say a few words about the earnings per share. The earnings per share on the slide shows that we have lost SEK0.50. I think it's important to realize how that happened.</p>
          <p>Because of the EBITDA improvement, which I will talk about in a minute, we actually improved the earnings per share by SEK0.18, which was totally offset by currency and contributions from our associated companies. You know we have two associated companies, Turkcell and Megafon. And Turkcell has halved its income contribution to us in last year compared to the year before. If you take away the currency, it's reduced by 40%. So the decline is totally the result of strong development of the Swedish krona and weak performance of particularly Turkcell, somewhat of Megafon.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about the business we manage every day. And of course, this is the picture we have shown and talked about for the past three years. Because the fact that we've been able to increase the EBITDA margin again, I think it's the 13th consecutive quarter and the third year that we are improving the margin, this is a result of hard work, a lot of cost savings.</p>
          <p>And you might remember, I think about two years ago we had finished the big restructuring program, and you were asking me whether we should have a new one. And I said I hope not, but it will be dependent on the management ability to manage cost on a daily basis, every day, every week. And I'm very pleased to conclude that now, two years later, we seem to have a management that is able to control cost.</p>
          <p>If you look at the ratio between the growth of the top line and the growth of OpEx, it has been very healthy in 2011. And that is, for me, the proof. And do realize that after three years and having reached 35.4% EBITDA margin, TeliaSonera, compared to other European operators, if you exclude the one country kind of operator, if you take operators that are in many countries, we have absolutely one of the highest margins in Europe after three years of hard work.</p>
          <p>I'd like to talk about some specific that I think are interesting for you and certainly for us. TeliaSonera was very early in saying that the data roaming prices are not good. They are not good for our customers, because they refuse to use our services, and therefore it's not good for us. And telecommunication is a volume business. It's all about volume. So we decided, in connection with the rebranding in May, to significantly reduce the data roaming cost in the Nordic and the Baltic. This is the Nordic and the Baltic.</p>
          <p>And you can see that the customer has responded very favorably to this decision. They have increased the traffic, the usage to surf when you are in Finland or in Estonia. It's now natural compared to before, when you heard in the airport you haven't forgotten to turn off your roaming, right?</p>
          <p>And we would like our customers to be able to use our services wherever they are. And you can see that we have dropped some revenue. I am convinced that the revenue will be back on the old levels within maybe 12 or 18 months. And after that, I think the revenue will continue to grow and I think we'll make more money out of this, because we have significantly higher volumes.</p>
          <p>We also did this in October for Europe, and in December we did it for a number of countries where our customers go for vacation, like Thailand and Turkey. And I think they &#x2013; it's a bit early, but I think those decisions show the same kind of result and will show the same kind of result as this one does. So I'm convinced, the customers are very happy about this and we will make more money ultimately by doing this.</p>
          <p>This picture is maybe even more important than the previous one. This picture talks about our ability to monetize on mobile data growth. It has been a question for many analysts and journalists, can you make money when the traffic in the network explodes with 100%. This is going to ruin you. You're going to have to spend so much more CapEx and your OpEx is going to go up and your income is going to go down, because you won't be able to monetize it.</p>
          <p>I think we've been arguing as long as one of the first operator again saying, well, one of the pre-conditions is that we don't have flat fee. You can't have flat fee in mobile data. You have to pay a little bit more if you use significantly more data, and we introduced that about year and a half, two years ago, and many operators have followed, not everybody. There are people who miss logic sometimes.</p>
          <p>And the picture on the right-hand side from your side shows the relationship between the growth of the traffic and the growth of the revenue, and this is only sort of 18 months. We don't have all the statistics, but I feel comfortable if we can have a growth of traffic, and half of that growth rate is the growth rate for revenue. So what I mean is if the traffic grows 100%, the revenue rose by 50%. That is a very healthy model. We can certainly live with that model. And that is exactly what this picture shows. This is Sweden, obviously very early adopt &#x2013; country that adopts technology, and therefore it's a good guidance for other markets for us.</p>
          <p>Fascinating also in Sweden is that the voice business, that's on your left-hand side, the bottom of those bars, is the voice business. It's stable or actually even increasing a little bit. That is not the case in all markets. What we have seen in some of the European markets, the other operators, we don't see that pattern, at least not yet. Even messaging is stable or actually growing somewhat. And as you can see, data is growing significantly, and that's exactly what the right-hand picture shows you.</p>
          <p>This is very encouraging, because I've said for a long time that our business where 80% of the traffic is data and 80% of the revenue is voice services, it has to change. We will have to reduce the portion for voice and increase the portion for data. Otherwise, the business model will not work for the operators. And this is for me the indication that that is now happening.</p>
          <p>The expansion of the 4G coverage continues. Yes, we were very early to start the 4G, partly because we wanted to be perceived as a leading &#x2013; also in technology, a leading operating. We are now covering quite a bit of the population in several countries, not only in Sweden. And the good news is the pads came in the fourth quarter, and in the first quarter we will have telephones, 4G telephones. And that I think, of course, is the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:50) for getting growth in this business. It's not only important to get growth in 4G for the investment in 4G, but I think it will also ease the pressure on our 3G networks.</p>
          <p>The really heavy users, I'm sure, are going to go up to the 4G, because they get a 10 times higher speed. And as Andreas said, we are demonstrating both the phones on the pads here and you can try it yourself. If you get 10 times higher speed compared to 3G and a lot of users, heavy users like me, will go to the 4G. That will ease the pressure on the 3G and it will provide a better customer experience for the people who go to 4G. So I'm pretty excited about this.</p>
          <p>Very important, the declining part of our business is, of course, broadband, and particularly Broadband Sweden is so important because Broadband Sweden is like 75% of the whole broadband business. And over time, the ADSL/voice service will decline, or continue to decline, and we have been explaining many times to you that we think &#x2013; I think the fixed network is very important from a technology standpoint.</p>
          <p>If you want a 100-megabit per second or a gigabit per second, the technology to give you that is fiber; it's not mobile. It might be wireless the last 100 meters or the last 10 meters, but it will be fiber all the way up to the place where you either live or you work.</p>
          <p>So we are rolling out fiber in several countries, among others in this country. I'll come back on some remarks about Broadband Sweden, but I'm not happy with the efficiency that we are rolling those fiber out. I don't think we are giving our customers a good experience, which is one of the three priorities that we have in this company, and I'll be saying maybe the most important one.</p>
          <p>You remember the quality of the networks, managing the costs; well, we do that pretty good. Customer experience, world class customer experience, that is not what our fiber customers in Sweden have experienced in the fall of last year, and it has to be corrected. Nevertheless, we are growing quite substantially the fiber connections. And we started with the TV business 2007, and we have now more than 500,000 TV customers in this country.</p>
          <p>This is, I think, another extremely exciting opportunity for us. Now finally we have 3G in all countries in Eurasia. Coming back to mobile data; mobile data has proven to be of real interest to our customers in this part of the world. I showed you that we can even monetize on it. Let me tell you, I think mobile data in this part of the world is going to be even hotter. Why? What's the alternative? What's the alternative? If you are &#x2013; maybe if you are in Almaty, you can have a fixed line connection somewhere. But I guarantee you, if you are outside Almaty, there are no fixed line connections.</p>
          <p>So if the people of Kazakhstan want to do Internet, surf on the Internet, how are they going to do that? They're going to do that over mobile and 3G. I believe &#x2013; I can be wrong &#x2013; I believe we will see 4G in this place within a year or two. Technology is available, and I think the demand for that kind of speed is also going to be there. 35 million subscribers in this &#x2013; in our business here; it's not bad.</p>
          <p>Well, the favorite son, Yoigo. You remember that we had a success in the fourth quarter only &#x2013; not last year, but the year before that, because then we became EBITDA positive. And then we said we will be EBIT positive by the end of 2011, and we reached that. We were EBIT positive in the fourth quarter and we were actually also cash neutral.</p>
          <p>We have now 3 million subscribers in Spain. And I used to say &#x2013; after the fourth quarter of 2010 I said, these people have done a good job. They should be allowed to play the second half of the game, and I think they started the second half pretty good.</p>
          <p>The Board of Directors decided to increase our ordinary dividend by a small amount, SEK0.10. I think it's a sign of confidence in our business, it's a sign of having a strong balance sheet, and I'm pretty happy with it.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we believe that the sales growth will be around 1% or 2%. It's not easy to predict whether it's going to be 1.6% or 2.2% or whatever. But we say between 1% and 2%. And you know we have different businesses. We have things going down like broadband; we have things growing, like mobile Sweden and Spain and Eurasia. That's the best number we can give you.</p>
          <p>Now we come to EBITDA margin, and I know there were some expectations or discussions that we should further improve. But, first of all, I said it before, if you exclude the operator that's sort of an incumbent in one country, you exclude them, you take companies like us who operate in 10 or 15 or 20 countries, we have already one of the highest EBITDA margin in Europe. Of course, we will continue to try to improve the EBITDA margin by cost cutting, but also looking at cost of goods sold, not only OpEx anymore.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA margin, when we started, it was always under pressure, because prices and interconnection prices or whatever have you, but that's normal. But I want to have a little bit of flexibility here, and that's why I'm saying this. I believe that one of the three priorities, world-class customer experience we have not been as successful with in the last three years and certainly not last year as we have been with the other two.</p>
          <p>I believe that the customer service in Sweden Broadband last year is way below what is expected. And I believe that part of the solution is maybe investing some money in that organization, not only money, also other things. But we need to hire more people and that costs money, and I think it's a very wise investment than to try to squeeze out another half point out of the EBITDA margin, because I believe the customer experience is a unique relationship we have with our customer and that will defend us more than anything else, maybe quality of network, and that relationship is the foundation for us to maintain our customers.</p>
          <p>There are lot of people who would like to take over our customers. Not only the other telecom operator. There are people like Google and Apple. And in the end, I think the quality of the network and the customer experience is absolutely determining whether customer stays with Telia or they go somewhere else. So I think it's a wise thing to invest money in the customer support organization, even if it means we cannot further improve an already high EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>CapEx stays the same. All those worries three, four years ago that the data explosion will drive CapEx like 10%, 20%, is not true. We will continue on the same sort of level as we have been doing before. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So starting with our outlook for 2011; Lars had touched upon this already, but I would like to make some more comments about the outcome. We were slightly below the 3%, and it was sort of a long discussion in the last quarter what around 3% means, 2.6%, 2.7% or 2.8%. What, I think, is important to say, with net sales roughly of SEK105 billion, we are talking about perhaps SEK100 million, SEK150 million more or less in this area. So I think we came pretty close to our outlook anyway.</p>
          <p>More important is that we kept the balance between the top line growth and the cost. Second half of 2011 was much better when it comes to the cost side. We actually took down the cost substantially compared to the second half in 2010. And given that, we actually managed to increase the EBITDA margin with close to 1% unit. And we kept also our CapEx-to-sales ratio excluding the licenses at 14%.</p>
          <p>I will come back to the CapEx later on, and also comment upon sort of the margin development during the year. The fourth quarter, I think, definitely was a decent quarter. We had a growth of 2.1% at top line. We managed to take down the cost with close to 5%, which meant that we increased our EBITDA margin once again.</p>
          <p>You can also see that EPS was slightly down. We have currency effects. We have effects from the associates here. And if you also look at the free cash flow, it's substantially down, and I will come back to comment more in detail on this. But for me, the fourth quarter was sort of a decent quarter anyway.</p>
          <p>If you look at the different business areas, I think it's amazing to see how we continue to grow the business in mobility, especially in Sweden and also in Spain. We had, in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 9% top line. This is the 20th consecutive quarter of growth in this business area.</p>
          <p>Continue to see the same trend. Mobile data is growing with 29%. We actually haven't yet seen any hit on the messaging side. We actually increased SMS messaging with 1%. Voice is also going up in Sweden with roughly 1%. Same trends that we have discussed many times, and that is supporting the growth. At the same time, we had also in Sweden high sales of equipment in the fourth quarter, but despite that fact, they kept a margin of about 42%, which I think is fantastic.</p>
          <p>Spain continues to deliver growth, somewhat lower in the fourth quarter, close to 23%. For the whole year it's close to 32%. They had an EBITDA margin of close to 11% in this quarter. So they are sort of moving in the right directions.</p>
          <p>We still have challenges in countries like Norway and Denmark. We see pressure on the ARPUs in these countries. Meanwhile, the ARPUs are more stable in Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, and also Latvia, but strong development within Mobility Services in general.</p>
          <p>Broadband, as Lars mentioned, has also taken some steps forward, very much Sweden. And if you look at the underlying business here, we have seen small steps in the positive direction. First of all, if you look at the net sales, it was minus 3%, which I think is an improvement compared to the previous quarters. They managed to increase the margins up to 36% compared to 33% in Sweden during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the decline on the fixed business, continues to be at roughly 12%. Meanwhile, we're adding both in VoIP when it comes to TV customers and also broadband customers, something between 10,000 up to &#x2013; I would say, 10,000 to 25,000 customers in the quarter. It's not big numbers, but it's actually a step, I would say, in the right direction, which I think is encouraging.</p>
          <p>Eurasia continued to delivered growth also in this quarter about 50%. You can see that the growth rates are somewhat lower, and we have seen hit on the top line growth in Kazakhstan. We have seen also lower growth in Uzbekistan, and also somewhat in Nepal. When we talk about lower growth in Nepal, we still are at the level of close to 70%, and they have a very, very good margin, which is then about 50% on EBITDA level. So I think that's a very strong sign of that business.</p>
          <p>I would also repeat what actually Lars said that, we have today close to 35 million customers in Eurasia, and I can't remember Lars, that when he started, I think they had 3 million or 4 million something. So they have made a fantastic journey now with up to 35 million customers, which means that for our whole company we are now close to 170 million subscribers. So Eurasia is doing very well, and on an annual basis they actually achieved 70% in growth on top line with a margin about 51%.</p>
          <p>I mentioned the balance between the revenues in the quarter, and we had a concern after the first half year where we didn't get the top line growth as we had anticipated. At the same time, the cost was actually increasing. We have managed now to have a lower cost base in the second half year, which, of course, helps us to improve the margin. And this is a combination of taken out personnel, especially in broadband, but also within mobility. We have done that in Sweden, Finland. We have done activities in Denmark. So we are trying to attack the <mark type="ph" /> structural (24:02) cost base, not just taking the easy things, like decreasing marketing. That is not what is behind this. We have decreased the number of employees during this year with roughly 500 people.</p>
          <p>So that means that we continue to improve the margins, and I think what is the strength is that this improvement on an annual basis comes from all the business areas. Mobility has grown from slightly above 29% up to close to 31% in EBITDA margin. We have seen an improvement in broadband, not that big, but from 32.7% up to 32.9%. I think it's good to keep that margin given the decline on top line. And Eurasia has increased slightly from 50.7% up of the 51.1%. So all the different business areas are actually contributing to this EBITDA margin development.</p>
          <p>That is sort of the good part of the story, that we are generating result in our majority steered and controlled companies. However, when it comes to the associates, as Lars had mentioned, we have lost out in 2011. If we take Megafon, they have a drop from SEK5 billion down to SEK4.4 billion, where roughly SEK300 million of that is currency effects. The rest is actually lower sort of operating &#x2013; operate and generate results.</p>
          <p>The same goes for Turkcell, dropping from SEK2.6 billion down to SEK1.3 billion, where SEK200 million is actually currency effects. The rest is pressure on the whole market. We have write-downs in Belarus and also impairment in Belarus that has sort of hit the result, which means that when you look at the EPS that Lars mentioned, SEK0.70 on the whole year basis is coming from the FX effect and also associated companies. Worth to mention here is also that our financial net is also somewhat lower due to the fact that we have increased our gross debt. We still have, I would say, a sound interest rate cost, 3.9% for the whole portfolio, I think, is very, very good. But given the increase of size, we will, of course, have a negative impact on the EPS.</p>
          <p>We talked about CapEx. We have spent quite a lot of money also this year, SEK17.2 billion. SEK2.6 billion of that has been licenses and frequencies, and I expect that amount to be slightly lower during 2012. We spent quite a lot of CapEx on licenses in the fourth quarter, as you see, on the capital as well, more than SEK1 billion was paid out for licenses. I think this is one of the most important things we have to pay for; sometimes it's higher cost for this, but we need the licenses to be able to operate our business. So we will continue to make sure that we have the right licenses and structures in our business.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have continued to invest in the 4G, as Lars mentioned. We continue to invest in fiber, and so for the last quarter we were close to SEK6 billion. If you take away the cost for licenses, spectrum, the amount was actually a bit lower in this fourth quarter than it was in the fourth quarter in 2010.</p>
          <p>Cash flow underlying, I would say is still strong. The big difference compared to 2010 was that we didn't receive the dividend, which was sort of our &#x2013; one of our own choices, from Turkcell. And if you take back SEK1.2 billion, I think we are well aligned with last year. We are waiting for roughly SEK1.9 billion to come from Turkcell to TeliaSonera, and that will hopefully come during this year, which means that our cash flow will be much stronger in 2012 compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>You might have seen that we have now closed the deal with Kcell and we have bought the 49% -- the remaining 49% of Kcell for an amount of roughly US$1.5 billion. We have initiated the IPO process and we'll work with that during the spring. That means that our leverage will increase. It was closer to 2 for a while before we go for the IPO, and you would expect us to, I would say, deleverage off this during the coming 12 to 18 months. And one of the reasons for this is that if you look at the debt maturity schedule, we have in 2013, 2014 and 2015, roughly SEK24 billion to refund, which is not a big amount for a company our size.</p>
          <p>So to look at the last quarter, continue to have good growth in Eurasia, Spain and Mobility Sweden. Yoigo was EBIT positive and cash flow breakeven. We saw Ncell to take the lead in Nepal. We had a 3G license awarded in Azerbaijan. And as I have mentioned, we have increased our ownership in Kcell.</p>
          <p>And I will not comment more on the outlook for 2012. Lars did that earlier. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Sweden, could you &#x2013; you have a quite high subscriber intake. Where do you &#x2013; what kind of subscribers are these, and if you can, divide the growth of the close to 10% on mobile data and handsets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:20) is actually postpaid customers. That's been the major intake. So we're gaining there. But on a kind of &#x2013; sort of on a more detailed base, I don't really know. I don't know whether you know that, but it's the postpaid customers that are actually increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the growth, distribution, handsets versus mobile data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that out of the &#x2013; I would say 50% or 52% is mobile data, 44% is equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But out of the reported growth in Swedish Mobile on 9% -- 9.2%, I think it was, to be correct, the service revenue growth was 5.7%, I think. So the delta there is the equipment sales. And of the 5.7% then, almost all of it is data growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're increasing with 29% on the data in Sweden.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take the next question from Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Stefan Gauffin, Nordea. I would like to focus a little bit on Kazakhstan. This quarter you had a very, very solid subscriber intake, best since Q3 2007. Looking on a sequential basis, minutes of use is up 30% and ARPU is down 9% in local currency year-over-year. This signals that you've been pretty aggressive in terms of campaigning, offering a lot of free minutes of use. Should we expect a return to a more normal situation going forward, or have you been more aggressive to meet competition from Tele2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, we have had a market with two operators and we have now three, and we know Tele2 fairly well. They are a very aggressive, competent operator. They want to get into the market, which is natural. We have a leading market position for many years in Kazakhstan. We have a very healthy EBITDA margin.</p>
          <p>I think we have to be aggressive, and I think the real opportunity in Kazakhstan for us is actually the mobile data. But &#x2013; because if you want to have a lot of mobile data customers in a country, you need a very capable network and we have a very capable network. So I think that's sort of the, one of the priorities that we have.</p>
          <p>And as I said before, I think even if we have got the 3G license half a year ago, I'm going to start arguing with the authorities that we need a 4G license, because, as I said, I believe Internet access, high-speed is going to be key in these countries, because they don't have an alternative.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we are not going to sit there and just wait, and we're going to fight back. And we certainly have the margins to do that and we have the management to do that and we have the brand name to do it. So we'll see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But have the campaign continued into Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I don't run the campaigns, Stefan. But I do talk to the management in Kazakhstan saying we are number one. We defend our positions, moved to mobile data, developed this market, and of course it costs some money sometimes, and then so be it then. It costs some money &#x2013; if you're going to improve the customer service in Broadband Sweden, it's going to cost some money. It's strategically the right thing to do, so we will do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question related to Broadband Sweden. I had actually expected the Q3 numbers on the top line to improve somewhat. Now we saw better growth situation in Q4, and it's the broadband and IP-based services that take a jump in terms of growth. Can you comment on that and what should we expect from this going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, I mean, we have seen sort of the normal decline of 12% on the fixed line, but then we have had something between 10,000 to, well, 25,000 increase in customers. It's small steps for the VoIP business, for the TV business and for the broadband business, but it's actually increasing. And hopefully I mean what we could see here is a combination of the new VDSL program has been rolled out and also the fiber rollout has started to yield. But I will say that it's still a very, very small change, but at least it's sort of a positive change we started here now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you look &#x2013; if I may add a few things on Broadband Sweden. Actually let's talk about business-to-business for once. We always talk about broadband in terms of consumers. We are working very hard now since 12, 15, maybe even 18 months back on what is the product offering going to be business-to-business. Telia in Sweden Broadband should have a product portfolio second to  none. I wouldn't say we have that yet and we intend to have that. And I think that's going to be a positive thing for Broadband top line and bottom line going forward. It will take a couple of years, but we'll get there and we'll get there partly this year already.</p>
          <p>Now moving to consumers. You either believe that the fixed network is strategically important or you don't. We happen to believe it's very important, but only if you can provide speeds at least at 100-megabit per second, preferably more, which means fiber.</p>
          <p>The rollout of fiber in this past year, in practice, has not been as successful as I wanted. Our customers have been waiting. They didn't get an answer when they could get it. Finally it worked. That's not the way Telia should operate and be perceived in the marketplace. That has to now improve.</p>
          <p>And then finally, the customer operations is -- we've had too long waiting times, not enough of clear answers. I am convinced that we can fix this and we will fix it now. And all of this will cost some money, and I'm saying so be it then. By the end of the day, it is the value the customer perceives of Telia, and we have not delivered on what we promised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And an anecdote, I must say, in the fourth quarter we had a positive subscriber intake in the consumer business for the first time in a long time. So the customers that we lose on the PSTN side, we compensate by adding VoIP subscribers, broadband subscribers and TV subscribers, so positive customer intake in the broadband consumer business in Sweden. Next question before we go to the conference call. Lena?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lena &#xD6;sterberg, Carnegie. Yes, the first question is on Turkcell and what, the proceedings that you've taken to maybe get hold of the shares in British Virgin Islands. If you can update us on how far you've got along on that process and also what you expect to happen, dispute in Turkcell next? And I also understand that you have managed to change the articles of association in Turkcell, and what has sort of come out of that?</p>
          <p>And then the second question then on the fiber side, you said that you had long waiting time for the rollout. So when you hire people, do you intend to have your own rollout organization that digs and puts the fiber into the ground, or will that still be outsourced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what we should do with our own people is to manage it. We might use &#x2013; we will use subcontractor to actually do the digging, but we should control the process and ensure quality from first to the last step. And the shortcomings is totally internal here. And if some of the subcontractors had not performed, it's our fault that we haven't managed them properly. So this is the issue.</p>
          <p>Turkcell, I think some positive things have occurred, let's say, in the last 10, eight months. Obviously, the fact that Altimo won second round in BVI, as you are aware of, it's now going to the Privy Council in London &#x2013; we don't know &#x2013; towards the end of this year we think. That's very positive. We got the damage award, which is very positive, because it's a good tool in this whole debate.</p>
          <p>Another very positive sign is that the authorities in Turkey who have been insisting actually for several years to have more independent board directors in the major companies, not only in Turkcell, but in the major companies in Turkey, they have come out with a decree saying you have to do that before June. Now, there are a few things in that decree that we sort of have question marks around. One is that they insist that all these so-called independent directors got to be resident in Turkey. It's a little bit difficult if you want to have truly knowledgeable telecom people on a global base if they all have to be resident in Turkey. Hopefully they can change that a bit. There's a debate going on on what it should be.</p>
          <p>But fundamentally, to have a free float of 38%, like Turkcell has, to have them being represented by a number of independent directors, we are very supportive of. We've been supportive of that for a long time. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:23) &#xC7;ukurova, they don't like that for obvious reasons. So I think it's all moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>And with regard to the legal cases, I feel pretty good that we are winning them, because the way the second round was described in the court was very sort of obvious this is the answer. And I will be surprised if the Privy Council will come to another conclusion. But you never know and I'm not a legal guy. But I feel confident that we are making progress in Turkey.</p>
          <p>Now, the problem in Turkey is that we have a deadlocked board and we have a company not performing. This is a real issue for me. We lost half of the profitability contribution from them last year compared to the year before. That's unacceptable. We work our butts off here to improve our TeliaSonera operation and we improve the operations year-on-year-on-year, and then it gets wiped out by currency. I can't blame currency, but I can certainly be a bit upset about the performance in Turkcell, which I am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to clarify, you said you expect the decision of the Privy Council to be towards the year-end? Because earlier you've indicated maybe the first quarter, beginning of second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think &#x2013; I'm guessing. It's not our legal discussion. It's a conflict between Altimo and &#xC7;ukurova, so we're not directly involved. I'm just referring to what I have been told. Maybe the Privy Council will take it up in the middle, maybe at the end of the year, but certainly before the end of the year that's what they think. That's not the only thing. There are a number of other discussions and potential actions earlier than that that could make a difference.</p>
          <p>You referred to changing the articles of association, that's the internal Turkcell things. We can't do that until we actually know what we have to change it to, because the decree from the authorities is not firm and finalized totally we understand. So we better wait until we understand what it is and then we'll change the articles of association. I'm pretty sure we will actually.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Lena. My colleague says there are a number of questions on the conference call. So please, operator, can we have the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question comes from Peter Kurt Nielsen. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux. A couple of questions for Lars and one for Per-Arne please. Firstly, Lars, on the move from &#x2013; to one common network operation center in the Nordic Baltic countries, which was supposed to be completed by yearend, has that been completed, and would you say it's been a successful move? What has been the early sort of experiences from that? And secondly, where are we on the joint venture &#x2013; network sharing joint venture in Denmark, and when will this sort of be implemented in earnest?</p>
          <p>And a question for Per-Arne please. For this year, for 2011, you'll obviously be paying out more in dividends that you've generated in free cash flow. And your comments about deleveraging for the next 12, 18 months would indicate that you do not see a similar scenario for 2012. Would you say that the license payments and associated dividends are the sort of main swing factors in terms of free cash flow and potentially dividends for 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Peter, I have to say I'm not totally sure if we shut down all the other centrals. We have done a lot of work towards the end of the year to centralize that to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:10) I can't remember. But anyway, the multi-market operation thing is not only and certainly much more important things than the supervision center, it's about products.</p>
          <p>We have so many versions of every product, and I have said internally that I think that 2012, this year, we will have substantial steps forward, concrete steps forward in terms of, for instance, end-of-life of a lot of products, harmonizing product, having the same product and maybe slight versions, but very well managed. Otherwise, I think some of the cost ambitions that we have in the plan for 2012 will not be realized. We have assumed in the plan that some of these multi-market actions will be executed in 2012. And clearly, mobility is leading it. Broadband is doing the same, but they are lagging, because broadband has other issues and priorities right now I think that are equally important. So I feel pretty good about it.</p>
          <p>Now, the Danish situation, yes, we are talking and planning and discussing on technical level. And I haven't heard any more details than that. And we will have to see, because we have to get into the details and how we're going to do this and who's going to be the suppliers, how the civil work's going to look like, what sites are we going to use, that kind of work has to be done. It has to be done by the technical people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the cash flow, you are completely right, Peter Kurt. First of all, I will say that even though we are increasing the dividend per share, the amount that we pay out is the same. But it's still more than what actually <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:56).</p>
          <p>What will happen is that, first of all, we have the dividends from Turkcell, and then also I would expect to pay out less on frequencies and licenses. We paid out SEK2.6 billion in 2011, and I expect that what we know today is the sort of in the pipeline will mean less for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Three questions, if I may. Firstly, in any of your markets, are you seeing any significant fall in SMS volumes mainly driven by the new iPhone operating system, and is this putting any pressure on revenues in these markets?</p>
          <p>Secondly in Q4, other EBITDA that was significantly lower. I just want to check what was the reason for this, because it seems quite a break in the trend? And then lastly, just a more general question on Megafon. In general, would you be happy to be in the future to be a co-shareholder alongside the Russian government, or that is not an option? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there are 53 different possibilities and I'm not going to speculate on any of them. We have a partner together with Altimo and we would &#x2013; I would like to see a resolution together with Mr. Usmanov, Alisher Usmanov, where we could join somehow. But we have also said, we want to focus on Turkey first, and I think we are making real progress in Turkey together with Altimo. And when we are sort of down there at least made significant progress, then we will focus on Russia.</p>

Actually it went up a little bit. But the most important thing is that the data revenue tracks the data volume in traffic. That's the most important thing.

          <p>When it comes to other, you know that that tends to be quite volatile that line. But in this quarter you see that we have some higher cost for IT this quarter and you also have lower contribution from holding.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I was wondering about Swedish mobile and Swedish fixed in some more detail. In Swedish mobile in particular, in the fourth quarter, I think you highlighted already you had very, very strong device sales sort of contributing to the revenue strength. On the other hand, of course, you surprised us all with very good margin in Sweden overall. So I'm just wondering what this should mean into 2012, because I would assume that maybe the device sales, which tend to be margin dilutive, are not going to be quite as high, which ultimately means that you would then see margin expansion in Sweden quite materially. I'm just wondering whether that's sort of the right sort of thinking. I know you don't guide on a divisional level, but is that the right sort of thinking? And then where the margin dilution comes from when you guide for flat margin at the Group level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we start with the growth threat, as I said before, roughly 40%, 44% was &#x2013; of the growth is connected to equipment sales, and that, of course, hits the margin in a negative way. What has actually offset this is the sort of good cost control and the OpEx come down pretty much in the fourth quarter. I don't see that. I mean, we've taken certain actions and we take sort of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:06) cost base. But to think about expanding the margin further in Mobile Swedish, I think that's unrealistic, given that we have equipment sales and we might have sort of some kind of price pressure. So just to remain at this level that they are today, I think they are &#x2013; on an annual basis 44% will be achievement as such.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A question on Eurasia firstly. You've seen slightly higher competition in many of the markets. If it remains the case, do you think that that can be offset by 3G-driven data growth to allay revenue pressure? And if not, do you have enough cost flexibility to offset that revenue pressure going forward and maintain a 50% margin overall in Eurasia over the next year to 18 months?</p>
          <p>Secondly, Spain, you've met your profitability expectations successfully there. So do you see an opportunity to go after subscriber share more aggressively in 2012? And then thirdly &#x2013; sorry for the third question &#x2013; but in last year's guidance, you said it was in line with internal management targets. Is that the same this year with guidance, or are there some differences between guidance and your internal targets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. What do you think? Do you think we have the same &#x2013; exactly the same targets that we tell the market? Well, of course, basically they are. But, I mean, of course there is a buffer here and there. But talking about Spain, I think we should continue to be as aggressive as we have been. I don't think we should become more aggressive. We already have an extremely good brand name. The proposition seems to work. I mean, when you grow more than 20% and you have 3 million subscribers after a number of years, I think you have done a pretty darn good job. And why changing again in concept? I just think they should be allowed to play the rest of the second half.</p>
          <p>Eurasia, I think is a very interesting question you are asking. First of all, I think you made a little bit too heavy statement. We don't see an increase in competition in Eurasia. We &#x2013; yes, we do recognize that Tele2 has come into Kazakhstan, which is one of the markets. If you take Nepal, for instance, we've become the number one in Nepal, and we have 7 million subscribers in Nepal.</p>
          <p>Now, we have a very high EBITDA margin and I think that's typically for an emerging market. When the market matures, the margin only goes down. And Tero Kivisaari, who runs Eurasia, he has stood here on Capital Markets Day saying, over time as the market matures the margin will have to come down. Now, we have a discussion currently about should we try to speed up the mobile data into the 3G. Can that compensate? Yes, absolutely. I think it's a great opportunity and even 4G will be an opportunity.</p>
          <p>Now, there's a question of behavior. These people &#x2013; this market normally don't buy that many smartphones. They buy normal feature phones. Should we push smartphone a little bit more, it's a discussion that we have. And I don't know yet the answer on it. But clearly we will benefit from, I think, the explosion of mobile data in Eurasia in the coming, let's say, five years.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Maurice from Barclays. On the data volume growth and revenue growth chart that you showed, Lars, in the past you've talked about the unlimited demand bandwidth, and of course you're managing that by the peer pricing. Can you give us a bit of a sense of how much of that growth in traffic is driven by smartphones and how much is more by the USB modems, so we get a sense of which bits are growing the fastest and how you're managing them? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I don't know exactly the numbers, but it's mostly handsets or phones. And that's good news for us, because the phone consumes less traffic volumes than a dongle on a PC. So &#x2013; do you have the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's 80/20 in the favor of smartphones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, I mean, do you want to talk about this idea of sort of where will LTE as a substitute of fixed line. You've obviously stressed the need of fiber, which presumably is more urban than rural. What's your take on the idea of mobile taking away fixed line in rural areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the mobile can certainly take away the voice. I mean, we've seen that for many years. And the mobile, if you have 4G, can theoretically give you about 100-megabit per second. But if you have a big house with many people in it and all want to use it, I don't think in practice you get 100-megabit per second. You won't get five, but you'll get something in between. And if the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited, if you really want to watch TV in HD format, five or 10 or 20 won't be enough.</p>
          <p>And I think a lot of people are going to demand that. And therefore, I believe the fixed network is going to be important if you have a fixed network. We have no intention to go build a fixed network in Kazakhstan. But in Sweden we have the ducts, although we found that we're little bit old when we were trying to blow fibers through them and we have some problems with that but, we have ducts and we have copper. But of course we're not going to have fiber to every home in Sweden like we did once a long time ago on copper. We're going to do it in urban areas, like Stockholm and G&#xF6;teborg and Malm&#xF6;, and we'll do it in the medium-sized cities, et cetera.</p>
          <p>In the end, I think the customers won't really care how they get their service, and I'm not sure we're going to care that much. I think we have to manage both the mobile network and a fixed network. And I think which network we use to serve you will be determined on what demand you have. If you don't want anything more than voice, I'm sure it's going to be mobile. If you want TV HD, I know I only have one chance to do it, and that's over fiber. So then you better live in a place where I can draw fiber to lots of people. Otherwise, it won't work. So -</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thomas Heath with Handelsbanken. Two questions, if I may. On data growth in Sweden and the Nordics in general, I presume quite a lot of people trading up to smartphones. Do you have any sense of where sort of smartphone penetration is and what the rate of change is there in the Nordics base?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well, basically every phone we sell is a smartphone. So it's accelerating a little bit. So it's a question of a couple of years and we will have a base out there basically smartphones all of it. I'm making a bit black and white. I'm sure Andreas can make it more gray.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my second question on Denmark, you say that you'll &#x2013; some actions taken there, sort of more concretely, what's in your hands, what can you do with profitability there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, we did the very obvious one during the fall, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:16) mobility and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:19) mobility in Denmark, it took the cost down. But I don't think that's enough. I think we have to think a little bit about what our position is in that market, what's the profile. And it's difficult for us, because we don't used to be number three. We think like we are number one in every market. And then in Denmark we are number three and we better realize it. So what does that mean?</p>
          <p>So therefore, I think this cooperation of network together with Telenor is a good step in the right direction, and I hope it's going to work out. But I don't think that &#x2013; even that is going to be enough. I think there are other things, and that's the debate we're having and that is an internal debate. And when we come to some conclusion that we are willing to communicate, we will do that. But having an 8% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, it's just unacceptable. So something has to break.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a follow-up question here from Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Stefan Gauffin again, from Nordea. Maybe a little bit of a theoretical question. But &#x2013; I know that for Sweden you still managed to hold up voice and SMS, maybe it's not the same situation in the other Nordic countries, but still you don't have the same problems as some other European operators. But I noticed that AT&amp;T, they have actually raised prices on data plans with between 10% and 30% now in January. And I wonder is that something that you are considering for your markets and you believe it would even be possible to accomplish a price increase on data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the big accomplishment we have done on pricing for data is really, Stefan, the fact that everybody, or nearly everybody understands that you can't have flat fees. I think that's way more important than the actual price level.</p>
          <p>This is a highly competitive market and I think there will be competition, price competition on data as well. I'm not so &#x2013; of course, I'm worried about it, but as long as everybody understands that there got to be a relationship between how much you consume in a network and what you pay, then I think we'll be fine. I think we have a track record of being smart in bucketing services, tier pricing. In the end, it's the perceived value of the customer who decides what they're going to pay.</p>
          <p>And then I come back to my two priorities. What's the quality of the network? And we've had some challenges, all of us, in the 3G network in the last year. And I think customers don't like dropped calls. I don't think customers like when it's slow to get onto one of the Internet sites, whatever they are. And so we need to fix the quality of the network or further improve it.</p>
          <p>But ultimately, it is the customer relationship and the customer experience. And I think those things are more important actually than being SEK5 cheaper or SEK5 more expensive. We will always try to be careful about prices. We are the leader in this market and the leader has a special responsibility, I think. And I think we have a value proposition better than our competition that justifies a somewhat higher price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may, I can just underline that. It's not so much about the price increases, having the right buckets, because I mean if we should keep this factor of 0.5, you really have to make sure that you have the right offering for the customers.</p>
          <p>I'll just go back to your question also about the voice business growing in Sweden. We should be aware of that. We have partly different situation in Sweden than we have in Finland. We have a transition on voice from fixed to mobile, which helps us, and we have &#x2013; today I would guess 65% all traffic is now in the mobile network, meanwhile we have in Finland 80%, and that's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:01:09) we will have to see a growth on the -</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two questions, one on fixed, one on mobile. On the fixed side I think the trends are quite encouraging. Just wondering how the pricing environment is developing. Any signs of price inflection as we move from copper to fiber yet? And on the demand for fiber on the wholesale side, does any of your competitors use your fiber-to-the-home or fiber-to-the-building wholesale product yet?</p>
          <p>And then on the mobile side, a follow-up on Sweden versus Denmark and Norway, just on a more conceptional level, any new thoughts on why the trends are so different from &#x2013; maybe from a game theory point of view? Why do players behave so differently in what actually structurally are fairly similar markets, any new thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the last one is a difficult one, because we can't really talk to anybody except &#x2013; we can talk to you about it, but we can't talk to the other players and we don't. I don't know the answer. I'm also a bit surprised over how some players act. But we have to accept that as a fact and act accordingly. I don't think it's &#x2013; I can add anything more that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the fiber, yes, we have what we call an open fiber, so it's open for other operator now who's in the business. How much that is today I can't really answer, but that's an open fiber. And we're also the only one that's actually regulated in market, have that &#x2013; actually have an open fiber.</p>
          <p>I can't really say that we have seen any kind of price pressure. So far it's still very early stage and people are actually paying us for installing the fiber to the houses, and I think that's good. But then generally speaking I don't see that we have the sort of big price we're at now on the service provider side. I don't know, what do you say, Andreas?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Firstly, can I ask around cost? You managed to reduce your addressable cost by more than 4% in Q4, which is a big step forward from the previous quarters. Can you just clarify, why margins didn't expand a bit more in the fourth quarter? Is it simply because of the commercial cost of selling smartphones? And do you expect to be able to keep reducing addressable costs in 2012?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on Spain, can I just ask where you think margins can get to at Yoigo once the final whistle is approaching??</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I then start with the cost in Sweden &#x2013; or the cost overall. I think that the gross volume went down due to the fact that we had quite a lot of equipment sales, so that sort of hits the margin. When it comes to look at the rest of the cost base, yes, we will continue to do that going forward. But one of the reasons why we actually took away the outlook for addressable cost base is that we are now working with all the costs. We're working with the cost of goods sold and we are working with the &#x2013; what we call the OpEx, and that process is complete some. And that will be something that we continuously work with, but as Lars had pinpointed, we will not avoid making the right investments for quality reasons. And that's why we're now sort of working with the whole cost base and try to just keep up the margin at this level.</p>

          <p>Well, then we have a question on Spain, and I don't want to give you any forecast. But I think you are all experienced to know that it's going to be beyond 10 and the question is how much beyond 10. Two digits, between 10 and 99, right? That's a good number.</p>

          <p>Hello, Keval? We can't end it this way. We take another question then, operator.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Jakob Bluestone. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lucky me there. Just a quick question on deleveraging, just want to make sure I understand the math correctly. So for 2011 you had SEK10 billion of free cash flow and your dividend payment is about SEK12 billion. For 2012, you get an extra SEK2 billion of Turkcell dividend hopefully, and then you expect to pay less than the sort of SEK2.5 billion in spectrum fees that you paid last year, plus you have a bit of organic growth. That doesn't leave you a huge amount of free cash flow for deleveraging organically.</p>
          <p>So my question is, do you think you might need to make some disposals of non-core assets to speed up the deleveraging process? Or do you think I'm sort of underestimating the amount of organic free cash flow that you can generate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I'll also take into account is the IPO in Kcell. So that will also help us to deleverage, so it's not only question about free cash flow, but also the disposal of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you think you need anything beyond that, or is that more kind of case by case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think you might need any further disposals beyond that, or is that &#x2013; there's not sort of anything  that you feel this is obviously sticking out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's more case by case. If we think that it's not the part of our core business, then we'll look at it and then dispose it at some point in time. But the major thing here is the Kcell indeed.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe missed one thing, Jakob, as well. I mean, we have SEK1.9 billion in dividend from Turkcell for this fiscal year in addition, that comes hopefully to the ordinary dividend for next fiscal year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we will have a double dividend hopefully for Turkcell in 2012.</p>
