          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS Nine Months 2011 Results Release conference call. Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your question. This call is planned to last about one hour. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation. It is also webcast. To access on our homepage, we've set a special banner for Nine Months 2011. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service.</p>
          <p>The supporting information package was emailed to you this early morning with slides, which we will now walk through and financial statements. Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contained a Safe Harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now, to Hans Peter Ring.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nathalie, and good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us for this Q3 conference call today.</p>
          <p>To frame our discussion, I would like to reiterate my confidence in the growth of the commercial aircraft business and its concerns about how EADS is adjusting to continuing European financial instability.</p>
          <p>We have heard legitimate concerns over current trends in European banking and government debt and the possible impact of European governments to cut necessary defense expenditures. Obviously, we are closely monitoring this as well as the commercial customer financing environment, but as of today, none of these sectors impact the health of EADS.</p>
          <p>Our business is globally balanced with much of our revenues coming from regions unaffected by the current financial distress facing Europe. We also have a robust backlog that is at an historic high. These factors, we believe, will allow us to continue our earnings growth throughout this decade.</p>
          <p>Let's look more closely at these sectors and how we will maintain momentum. Despite concerns coming from the macroeconomic environment, we continue to see growth in the worldwide passenger traffic. Overall global demand for aircraft remained strong. The economies of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America show no signs of deterioration. This gives us confidence in our record commercial aircraft backlog, which represents more than seven years' production at current levels. Single Aisle ramp up to Rate 44 per month is still under investigation.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to the declining European defense budgets and recent comments emerging from Germany that there may be further cuts to come. Let me remind you that EADS has been moving preemptively to adjust its business for a climate of pressure in European defense budgets. We had already factored into our plans possible changes to future procurement in programs such as Eurofighter.</p>
          <p>Recent announcements confirm the overall German procurement budget, but a potential reallocation of resources. Based on current contractual commitments, we will be open for discussions with the customer. Overall, including our commercial prospects, we do not see any change to our outlook.</p>
          <p>Our major programs &#x2013; and I'm now on page four with the highlights &#x2013; our major programs continue to roll out well despite seasonal fluctuations in demand. As you know, we have been very close &#x2013; very successful in our efforts to anticipate and avert program risks. It remains our policy to be transparent to our communication with &#x2013; in our communication with you, with investors, on the evolution of these important programs.</p>
          <p>In the case of A380 and A400M, the risk profile has improved. New programs, especially the A350 XWB, are closely monitored for cost and for timelines. We don't want to compromise maturity in order to meet deadlines, but rather to ensure that aircraft sections are trouble free when delivered to the Final Assembly line.</p>
          <p>We are in constant dialogue with our customers on the time schedule for the A350 to avert any scheduling surprises and address any priority needs. We have learned a lot from the experience of the A380 and are determined to prioritize maturity of the main components at Final start and the A350 Entry-into-Service is now scheduled for H1 2014.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, we have re-phased deliveries of some aircraft during Q3, however, our Q3 numbers are good despite a low level of deliveries leading us to increase guidance based on the same annual delivery number. Our operational performance is just starting to improve. The Q3 delivery fluctuations do not impact our excellent liquidity position either. Cash flow is still very strong. Our net cash position continues to be exceptional and has enabled us to expand in services.</p>
          <p>So, our main message I will repeat is that EADS is stable. We were already well prepared for the constraints in the European defense market. We continue to anticipate earnings growth throughout the decade and we are well buffered against the macroeconomic events playing out in the Eurozone.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to our financial highlights of the first nine months on page five. The nine months' numbers show a revenue increase of 4% driven by Airbus Commercial, Eurocopter, and Astrium. Deliveries remained at a high level. Defense revenues are slightly below the 2010 level. The EBIT, before one-offs, stands at around &#x20AC;1.07 billion for EADS and around &#x20AC;380 million for Airbus Commercial. The increase compared to last year is mainly driven by operational improvement at Eurocopter and Airbus Commercial activities and some favorable phasing at Airbus Headquarters.</p>
          <p>Strong ongoing commercial momentum led to order intake of &#x20AC;93.9 billion for the nine months 2011 period, up 63% compared to one year ago. Our order book of more than &#x20AC;500 billion stands at a record level and underpins our top line growth into the future. The Airbus Commercial backlog has been reduced by a negative revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;2.7 billion due to the slight deterioration of the US dollar closing spot rates since the year-end 2010. Actually, it's around 1.5 cents.</p>
          <p>On slide six, we can look at the underlying performance of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin is at 3.3% at group level. It benefited from good performance in Airbus legacy programs and in Eurocopter commercial activities. At Airbus Commercial, some operational improvement, including better pricing and favorable phasing, more than compensated hedge rate deterioration and higher R&amp;D. This quarter, with the Entry-into-Service now scheduled for H1 2014, Airbus Commercial booked a charge of &#x20AC;200 million for the A350 program. A positive one-off due to the termination of the A340 program of &#x20AC;192 million was also booked.</p>
          <p>The US dollar mismatch and balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our EBIT result of around &#x20AC;50 million at the end of September. In the first nine months, Eurocopter booked a net charge of around &#x20AC;120 million mainly related to governmental programs and SHAPE, which is the transformation program and cost improvement program of Eurocopter. A complete EBIT before one-off view by division is provided for you in the appendix on slide 21.</p>
          <p>If we go to slide seven, R&amp;D expenditure increased compared to last year driven mainly by the A350 XWB development at Airbus. The interest result has improved compared to nine months 2010. The 2011 interest result benefited from a positive one-time release of interest of &#x20AC;120 million due to the termination of the A340 program. Furthermore, the 2011 average net cash position is higher than the 2010 level.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the other financial result is negative by around &#x20AC;200 million. This line includes among others a negative revaluation of our options for around &#x20AC;60 million and the unwinding of discounted provisions for a negative &#x20AC;110 million. The tax rate for the year is expected to be around 32% and is unchanged.</p>
          <p>In our H1 release, we introduced a net income before one-off stripping out EBIT one-offs and the revaluation of US dollar and British pound assets as well as the revaluation of our options. In addition, it includes the positive one-off due to the termination of the A340 program of &#x20AC;120 million. The nine months 2011 EPS, before one-off, stands at &#x20AC;0.7.</p>
          <p>You can see the material improvement of the underlying performance compared to last year. We have provided the detail of this driver for you in the appendix slide number 23. On to the hedging portfolio on slide eight. During the third quarter, we were able to benefit from the recent strengthening of the US dollar and continued to hedge at a healthy pace. However, to protect flexibility and hedging capacity with banks in a volatile foreign exchange market, we want to limit the size of our forward portfolio to roughly the current level and further diversify our portfolio with ForEx options.</p>
          <p>We have therefore roughly replenished the maturing hedges with new forward contracts at the same rate of $1.38 per euro and in addition have implemented more than $1 billion worth of options maturing in 2013. Our hedge book increased from $70.2 billion at the end of 2010 to $71.8 billion at the end of September 2011.</p>
          <p>At the end of September, the mark-to-market value of our hedge portfolio was negative at around &#x20AC;1.6 billion before tax compared to a negative &#x20AC;1.9 billion at the end of December. This movement is driven by the evolution of the closing spot rate from $1.34 per euro in December 2010 to $1.35 for the end of September 2011. In addition to our traditional hedging activity, contracting with several airlines in euro is progressing. We've talked about that before and we can confirm now that we are moving into the right direction here.</p>
          <p>Up to cash flow now on slide seven. Free cash flow for the nine months was robust benefiting from good operational performance and commercial order intake. Gross cash flow from operations reflects the improvement in the underlying profitability compared to one year ago. Before acquisitions, the free cash flow for the nine months was positive at &#x20AC;587 million, a bit lower than last year mainly due to the deterioration of the working capital.</p>
          <p>Working capital at the end of September includes an inventory ramp-up at Airbus due to the re-phasing of some deliveries in the third quarter as already mentioned and the progressive ramp-up to rate 38 on the Single Aisle production, which has now been achieved. This negative inventory effect on the cash flow should decrease in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the ramp-up in inventories was partially mitigated by higher advance payments at Airbus and Astrium.</p>
          <p>Customer financing generated cash of around &#x20AC;180 million through the end of September as the lessor and global banking market continues to be active despite recent concerns. The level of capital expenditure is in line with the 2010 level; however, we expect this to increase by the year-end. The net cash position also reflects a cash contribution to pension assets of &#x20AC;300 million and a cash purchase of minority shares for Dornier/DADC from the Daimler AG.</p>
          <p>Now, we will look at our divisions in more detail and as usual it starts with Airbus on page 11. At the end of September, Airbus Commercial registered 1,038 net orders and had delivered 374 commercial aircraft, thereof 16 A380.</p>
          <p>The backlog at the end of September stands at record &#x20AC;436.4 billion. The third quarter was marked with key commitments from customers worldwide. Air France-KLM signed up for up to 60 A350 XWB and Lufthansa placed aircraft orders and commitments including 30 A320neo and two A380s.</p>
          <p>Qantas and Airbus sealed the biggest order in Australian aviation history in October for 110 A320 Family aircraft. Airbus confirmed its services strategy in the third &#x2013; in the quarter and the completion of the acquisitions of Denmark-based Satair A/S as well as US based Metron Aviation, a provider of advanced Air Traffic Management Solutions.</p>
          <p>The A350 XWB program is advancing. Manufacturing and pre-assembly of the A350-900 are progressing across all pre final-assembly sites. The start of the Final Assembly Line is now scheduled for Q1 2012 and enter into &#x2013; Entry-into-Service now scheduled for H1 2014 leading to an EBIT charge of &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military delivered 12 aircraft, including two MRTT to the Australian Air Force, these are the tankers. The A400M has passed further key flight tests as progress continues towards certification. The cause of the engine problems encountered earlier in the year has been identified and substantial progress has been made towards solving these problems.</p>
          <p>Flight testing continues at maximum capacity for timely achievement of certification. Furthermore, the FSTA is in the flight test, this is the British tanker. So, it's in the flight test phase towards introduction into service after civil and military certifications have been achieved in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 12, where we have a closer look at the segment numbers. Compared to nine months 2010, Airbus Commercial revenues benefited from favorable pricing effects based on the same number of deliveries qualifying for revenue recognition as last year. Two Long-Range operating leases were sold down in the third quarter triggering revenue and margin recognition. As many of you know, we have re-phased deliveries of some aircraft during Q3. However, our annualized expectations on deliveries remain the same.</p>
          <p>Airbus Commercial EBIT before one-off benefited from some operational improvement, including a favorable pricing effect net of escalation as well as some favorable phasing. The improvement year-on-year is partially reduced by hedge rate deterioration of around &#x20AC;220 million and higher R&amp;D expenses, particularly for the A350 XWB program. Airbus Commercial R&amp;D for the full year should be around &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>At Airbus Military, revenue growth of 13% is driven by higher revenue recognition for A400M and tankers. Airbus Military EBIT and EBIT before one-off improved. Nine months 2010 results were impacted by some negative A400M costs.</p>
          <p>Up to Eurocopter on slide 13. Eurocopter is seeing a civil sector recovery in light and medium helicopters, driven by the US and Eastern Europe. Overall, the net order trend during the first nine months improved compared to the same period last year, led by renewed strength of oil and gas markets. 67 helicopters were booked in the third quarter, thereof 43 Ecureuil.</p>
          <p>An important additional order for 20 EC225s from Canada's CHC Helicopter was signed in September 2011, but is not yet reflected in the order book. Revenue and EBIT increases compared to a year ago are due to a favorable mix of commercial deliveries and support activities and better operational performance. Revenues also include &#x20AC;96 million from the impact of the Vector Aerospace acquisition.</p>
          <p>A net charge of around &#x20AC;120 million was booked in the nine months, thereof &#x20AC;60 million in the third quarter. The charges mainly relate to governmental programs as well as SHAPE. The 2010 figure included a net charge of &#x20AC;70 million. Eurocopter reached an important new milestone in its innovation drive initiating flight tests of an AS350 hybrid helicopter demonstrator.</p>
          <p>Up to Astrium now on slide 14. Astrium order intake reached &#x20AC;2.3 billion in the first nine months. Third quarter orders included the Eutelsat 3B telecommunications satellite. Revenues increased by 7% compared to last year driven by higher satellite and launcher activity, but lower volume in services.</p>
          <p>Four Astrium Telecom satellites were delivered in the third quarter. EBIT increased by 4% year-on-year as higher volume and productivity across the business linked to the AGILE transformation program were reduced by the decline in services activity.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, Ariane 5 recorded its 46th consecutive successful launch, once more underlining the system's strong reliability. The European Space Agency technically accepted the first two Galileo IOV satellites built under Astrium lead representing a major milestone. Following successful launch, both satellites are currently working nominally. Qualification is foreseen in the next weeks.</p>
          <p>Astrium entered into an agreement to acquire Vizada as you know in July for US$960 million to boost its services business. Regulatory approvals are expected to be granted in the coming months. Astrium continues to work on AGILE. It's already triggering &#x2013; it is already triggering higher R&amp;D cost and should trigger some non-recurring costs in the third quarter and as I said, AGILE is the transformation program of Astrium, and it should lead to an increase efficiency and competitiveness.</p>
          <p>Up to Cassidian on slide 15. As you are aware, the division is facing an evolving business environment; however, the outlook remains unchanged since the H1. The new Cassidian organization has been launched and implementation of the transformation program has begun. Related non-recurring costs are expected to be booked in the fourth quarter. Revenues and EBIT at the end of September are in line with expectations with the usual seasonality pattern, which brings a lot of activity in the fourth quarter. Order intake at the end of September was around &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Cassidian continues to progress in Unmanned Aerial Systems. In mid-October, Cassidian acquired the UAV company, SurveyCopter, to further address the tactical UAS market segment. The first EuroHawk Unmanned Aerial System, a joint program between Cassidian and Northrop Grumman, conducted its ferry flight to Germany where the signal intelligence mission system for the country's Air Force will be integrated and flight testing will be performed. Meanwhile, the Eurofighter India and Switzerland campaigns are ongoing.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our other businesses on slide 16. Revenues were up 3% compared to one year ago. EADS North America increased thanks to ramp up in LUH and US Coast Guard deliveries. At Sogerma, rate increases and higher cabin activity offset the perimeter adjustment following the acquisition of Vector Aerospace by Eurocopter. Revenue increases were partially reduced by lower deliveries in ATR, which already picked up in the third quarter as planned.</p>
          <p>The nine months 2011 EBIT for Other Businesses included increases at ATR and Sogerma as well as a gain from the divestiture of Defense Security and Systems Solutions (DS3) in EADS North America that was completed in May. ATR has achieved a new annual order intake record. At the end of September, it recorded 145 firm orders, more than twice the 2010 level, and an additional 72 options. These firm orders represent over 80% of all regional aircraft orders in the range of 50 to 90 seats since the beginning of the year. The backlog stands now at 274 aircraft.</p>
          <p>In August, EADS North America passed the halfway mark in deliveries of the US Army's UH-72A Lakota helicopter. More than half of the planned 345 Lakotas have now been handed over to the customer with perfect on-time and on-budget performance.</p>
          <p>Now I will comment on our guidance on slide 18. EADS increases its latest guidance for Airbus orders, revenues, EBIT before one-off, and free cash flow given in July. In 2011, Airbus should deliver 520 to 530 commercial aircraft and its gross orders should be around 1,500. EADS 2011 revenue should increase more than 4% compared to &#x20AC;45.8 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>EADS now expects 2011 EADS EBIT before one-off to increase compared to the 2010 level at around &#x20AC;1.45 billion thanks to better than expected underlying commercial performance. EADS expects 2011 EPS before one-off to be around &#x20AC;0.90, above the 2010 level which was &#x20AC;0.86. Going forward, reported EBIT and EPS performance of EADS will be dependent on the Group's ability to execute on the A400M, A380, and A350 XWB programs in line with the commitments made to its customers. Reported EBIT and EPS also depend on exchange rate fluctuations. As previously communicated, at &#x20AC;1 equals $1.35, the 2011 EPS should be above the 2010 level of &#x20AC;0.68. And at $1.45, it may change, it may be below.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow before acquisitions is now expected to be significantly above &#x20AC;1 billion. Latest reviews confirm that in 2012, the Group expects a significant improvement in its EBIT before one-off thanks to higher volume, better pricing, and improvement of A380 performance at Airbus.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm interested in your comment about that you're seeing better than expected underlying commercial performance. So, my first question is can you talk a little bit in specifics about what is going better and is this something that you see continuing into the next year? And then as a second question, could you talk about the A320neo and are you seeing any movement of customers from current generation A320s to the neo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to your last question is very short. It is no, we have not seen a lot of activity here so we continue to stick to our order backlog on the standard 320s. And I think that was the question whether there is a conversion discussion, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. I would actually say on that, are you encouraging any conversions in later years when you get out to 2016 or 2017?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, it's &#x2013; would be speculating today. Obviously, we will try to stick to the backlog as it is. I think it obviously will depend on the traffic needs and if they are, I would say I would not expect that there is a big risk. All the more that the neo positions are, with more than 1,000 commitments and contracts already, largely committed for the first years of production. So insofar, I wouldn't see a big risk.</p>
          <p>On your first question about underlying commercial performance and here I was talking about the first nine months. Yes, we have improved on the Eurocopter side and on the Airbus side. In Eurocopter, particularly in the commercial side of the business, not in the military side as you have seen.</p>
          <p>And Airbus is improving on pricing and has also some &#x2013; I mean a bit better operational performance. The numbers have not changed dramatically. I would say we moved up from 1.3 to 1.45. Whether this will have now an impact on next year, we have to see that. We are in planning discussions currently so I'm not changing anything for 2012, yet. And we also have to be sensitive as we go into the future on R&amp;D and on some issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of overall production performance on Airbus A330s, A320s, it sounds like things are &#x2013; and A380, it sounds like things are a little bit ahead of your expectations from a quarter or so ago. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is probably right. We are improving indeed. We have on the other hand a little bit of A350 headwind, more than we probably had expected. But globally, yes, it has stabilized I would say and even more than stabilized, it has improved.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe Campbell and Christian. We have two questions. The first was could you give us a little more color on precisely what's happening with the A350 that caused you to kind of get ahead of things and recognize that you needed this go slow and fix cause you to flip your activity in the final and your first delivery?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just back to the A380, you mentioned and Doug mentioned seems to be going a little better. As I recall, the guidance was that the period losses in 2011 would be similar to those in 2010 and I wondered if that had now changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not changed Joe. The program is moving as planned so we are exactly in line with deliveries. We will deliver around the 25 airplanes we have forecasted. So on the A380, I would say it is stable, which is good news on that program I think and we are confident and more confident that we can achieve what we have planned for the next years, which is a recovery or some recovery of the negative impact we are seeing in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>On A350, I mean we have talked about that before. Our main priority is really to have a stable and mature ramp-up and start of the Final Assembly Line. This is the number one priority and we went through the milestone reviews. It was the maturity milestone where we checked whether we are ready for Final Assembly of the prototypes or the flight test aircraft and the early production aircraft. We've seen a lot of good progress, but we have also seen that activities &#x2013; some activities on the supply of the key components were a bit later than expected.</p>
          <p>We've also seen some shortages of detailed parts in time for the pre fire and since we do not want to jam the fire with outstanding work, which would be a possibility theoretically, so have tried to recover in the Final Assembly Line. We always said we are not compromising on maturities so we do not go into fire with lack of sufficient maturity. So, that was the assessment.</p>
          <p>And as I said, we are progressing on a lot of fronts in a very positive way. If I would just mention for example the systems maturity, it's quite &#x2013; it's very good. All testing means are for Airbus and for the system suppliers are deployed. The Iron Bird is working and other simulation tools for other equipment. So, we are progressing on the timeline, but as I said, some issues lead us to say let's rather fix the current issues where they should be fixed. So, the stop and fix policy is applied very strictly, I would say.</p>
          <p>&lt; &lt;Q &#x2013; [004QW1-M]Joe Campbell &#x2013; Barclays Capital&gt;: Hans Peter, just on this question of stop and fix, this means for example that major structural items are being held at the other Airbus facilities; Nordenham, [indiscernible] (36:08), and so on; where the maturity of the pieces scheduled to be fixed wasn't what you want it to be so you've held these pieces in other Airbus locations pending their completion as they should be, is that the idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the idea and that's correct, yes, absolutely.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And suppliers you mentioned, are you &#x2013; I mean is there, it's not just the work in the Airbus facilities, but some suppliers are holding you up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not pinpoint now to suppliers or even to several &#x2013; to specific suppliers. I think the whole system is under pressure. Airbus has deployed teams to help suppliers wherever necessary so that's &#x2013; there's a very &#x2013; it seems there is a very good working relationship between the teams on the supplier side and on our side currently.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everybody. Just two questions, Hans Peter. One just around your comment on the kind of euro contracting if you like, I mean you've talked about this before a little bit. When is this likely to really take place? Are we going to see in the very near future airlines start to actually buy planes in euros or is that already happening now? I mean what's the status there and how much could we see take place rather in dollars, if you like?</p>
          <p>And then second question is around orders. I know you haven't given any specific guidance for 2012 yet, but can you just give us some idea and a bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of orders for next year? Is there still quite a lot out there that could be done? I mean Boeing have talked quite positively actually about orders for next year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Orders for next year, to be completely transparent with you, I don't have a recent update from Jean. We will have our final discussions on the plan for next year in the very near future. I would not expect currently that there is a big problem, but again I cannot give you a new update here.</p>
          <p>On euro contracting, I can be a little bit more clear if that was not clear enough. I talked about &#x2013; I mean we've talked about it before as you rightly said and I've mentioned it here because it has happened now. So we have several contracts with airlines in euros and we will whenever &#x2013; I mean the number is big enough, we will communicate on it, but it is the number which is starting to become significant.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello there. Firstly a question on the Eurocopter charges and you said some governmental programs. I know before there was charges on the NH90 so whether NH96 and it's a different program or whether it's still NH90? Could you tell us what that was that happened in Eurocopter. And then the other divisions where you're saying you might take some charges in the fourth quarter in Cassidian and Astrium, just whether you have any feeling at this point whether it's just one quarter of charges for those or whether it's something like Eurocopter where it would kind of roll on over a number of quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Eurocopter and on NH90, even though that this is a very complex program, we have I think 14 different customers or contracts and we have I think 23 versions or more of this helicopter. So, it's very difficult to manage.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; due to that, we are in some delays as we have said before, this leads to &#x2013; also to negotiation with customers and I don't name them here. And this has led us to review I would say some of those contracts in the third quarter and this led to the provision you can see here. We obviously &#x2013; I mean we have made improvement steps on the program as well, particularly here for our core nations with achieving acceptance for some &#x2013; for the TTH version.</p>
          <p>So there is some good progress, but as it is as complex as I've mentioned from time to time, there are still ongoing discussions. We hope that this will somewhere stop in the future, but given the complexity again, I mean we will have to follow that also in the future.</p>
          <p>On the other question with the charges in the different divisions, which are expected, so it's Cassidian and Astrium indeed and it's related to the transformation programs. It's &#x2013; I mean it's not program related. I mean customer programs so, it's really related to transformation programs. It's not going to be big numbers. I would say &#x2013; I mean it's obviously open because we have to have the figures and the assessment and how many people concerned, but you should expect something in the &#x20AC;20 million or &#x20AC;30 million each.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick questions. The first is on the re-phasing of deliveries at Airbus from Q3 to Q4. Can you talk about why that is and does it have anything to do with financing? The second is on the A340 termination. Can you talk a little bit about why we had a &#x20AC;192 million positive impact and then what happens with the residual launch aid balance? Or could you talk about if there is any other balance sheet issues related to that we need to worry about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To start with your wording, the launch aid balance actually its retail launch investments as we call them. I mean it's indeed that we are, I would say, adapting ourself to reality. We have not sold 340s since almost I think two years now after we had announced that we would build aircraft to order. So we were extremely successful as you know on the 330 and on the 350, but 380 was not selling and that means that there is a liability in the balance sheet, which is released if you like with this assessment. And that's the reason why it has a positive impact on the P&amp;L, in EBIT and in net income, as you've heard.</p>
          <p>On the re-phasing of the deliveries, I think there are &#x2013; there's one major issue and probably a few smaller ones. The bigger issue was simply that you have probably seen some press or probably not in the US or in the UK about labor discussion in Germany where we had for some weeks of difficulties to find an agreement, which led the unions to refuse us over time and a certain amount of weekend work, which we had needed to really deliver the airplanes which were supposed to be delivered. So there was some kind of shift, if you like. We are recovering from that in October, November, December so it should not be a big problem. It is not linked to financing to be clear. So there was no aircraft A320 sitting on grounds because aircraft financing was not in place. I think that's an important message and thank you for your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Hans Peter and Nathalie. I have two questions. First one on the 350 again. How can you make sure that you won't announce other delays on this program? In other terms, what is the root cause of the delay? You mentioned it before, but I'm not sure I got the exact point about it. Second on the 350, the provision of &#x20AC;200 million, what do they correspond to? Are there penalties to be paid or &#x2013; to fix the problem or both? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is on long range operating leases that were sold down in the third quarter, you mentioned them. What is the exact impact on the EBIT of the third quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What &#x2013; was this related to A340 or what was the last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operating leases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operating leases, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Operating leases sold down in the third quarter triggering margin recognition as you said so what is the exact impact on EBIT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm afraid I don't have the scientific number for you so it's a small one, anyway. So you should not &#x2013; by the way, there were A340 leases which were sold down and this is not &#x2013; unfortunately, they're not &#x2013; it was not the most profitable program of Airbus.</p>
          <p>So insofar , you shouldn't expect a big number here. On 350, I mean I tried to explain the root causes before. It was &#x2013; it is linked to maturity as I said before. The penalties question &#x2013; I mean we had to assess given now that we have shifted into the Final or the start of the Final to Q1 and the entry into service to the first half so we had to assess the costs obviously on the different contracts and on the different &#x2013; based on the discussions with the customers. And indeed, there is an important element of liquidated damages, which plays a role in the assessment of these costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you have the metric, do you think it's &#x2013; how can you make sure that your maturity will be reached in Q1 '12 for the first assembly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a constant, I would say, yeah. It's likely to look at suppliers at our own facilities, the deployment of people there to fully understand where we are. So I think Airbus has never had a program where we had so good transparency throughout the supply chain and pushing them I mean and trying to get a feeling what they can do and what they can achieve and based on this, we have to make our assessment and that's the new plan now. I mean your question of a potential new delay, I mean I can just say this is the plan. We try hard to stick to it. We will continue with the policy I have mentioned before. So, if we don't see the right level of maturity, we probably stop delivering pre-final assemblies. So we try to stick to the policy we have communicated.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, the first one on suppliers and the supply chain and the financing of it. Do you have trouble on this issue? And what visibility do you actually have on tier 2, tier 3 suppliers and the risk for production ramp up?</p>
          <p>And the second question I have is on A350. The first engine should have flown in September, if I'm right. It is now on the A380 for flight test, but it hasn't flown yet. Is it an issue with the engine or is it an issue with the maturity of the ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last one, you're right, it's mounted to the A380 wing. There is the final checks, which have to be done by Rolls-Royce. They discovered some smaller issues as I understand, but it's not a big issue because I mean it's not a critical part item on the timeline. So, we might fly within, I mean, the next few days or at least two weeks so it's not a principally big problem at this point.</p>
          <p>On the suppliers, the concern we mentioned and particularly Louis was talking about that is coming more from the macro environment today, then &#x2013; that we would now know that all of the suppliers are in big difficulties.</p>
          <p>And the macro environment is very simple. The banks are doing what they call deleveraging. It's rather difficult for companies which have a, I would say, medium size to get access to funding to roll over credit lines and debt they have with the banks. And it's a concern I think where we have to be very vigilant throughout our supply chain.</p>
          <p>We have seen first suppliers being in difficulties indeed. And one of them, just to name it because it's public, it's PFW, where we are, I would say, taking over the company in the next few weeks. So we've seen it and the macro environment and the banking environment is a concern, which we have to follow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have already helped some of them with, I would say, buying their non-recurring investments in some cases and by just reducing the recurring cost. So this is a possibility where you can help if there is really an emergency. So it has happened in some cases and so far, we have a very close look on them.</p>
          <p>And we have &#x2013; we are doing the same, we are doing on the customer side where we as you know have a customer rating of each and every airline. We are also looking with the same methodology on all of our suppliers to try to understand where they are with their financial health and probably then be proactive in terms of addressing an issue if it's coming.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. The first question that I had was just a little bit more if we could on 2012 and your confidence for the uplifted margin and EBIT at Airbus. I wondered if you could help us scale anyway what sort of range of upside do you see in that Airbus margin. I think consensus expectations is somewhere in the sort of 3.5% to 4% level, whether that's something you feel increasingly comfortable with or increasingly uncomfortable with?</p>
          <p>The second question was just on A350, sorry for another one on that. Why was the delay so cheap for what is basically a six-month pushout in the program? &#x20AC;200 million of charge seems a surprisingly low number and also I wondered what...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...what buffer you now have built in to the program as a result of this latest push out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'm not talking about buffers here, Ben, but what I can say on the delay and why it's so cheap. We are &#x2013; I mean we are trying already since sometime as we have certainly discussed in previous meetings, we are trying to de-risk the program on let me say the cost side, but also on the customer side so in terms of delivery provisions. And that I think explains that we were able to contain the provision within a limited amount. We are not at the edge with the &#x20AC;200 million. That's what I can say, but I cannot say more in terms of buffer also. On the 2012 question, I think globally I wouldn't say anything has changed. But what has changed I mean on what we've told you before, the shape of the curve is unchanged. But what has changed in a way is that we are becoming more confident that what we've told you now since one year is likely to happen.</p>

          <p>Morning. Just one question for clarity on what you were saying on pricing. You mentioned the improvement. I was wondering if you could give a little more detail in terms of deliveries and orders, how the narrow body and wide body pricing is spanning out over Q4 and 2012, how that's looking going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No change, I would say on pricing. So, it is stable. We've achieved our pricing targets on the neo contracts, which I think was a big achievement and it was a challenging target at the beginning. So insofar, there is no change on the pricing environment side I would see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And no difference between narrow body and wide body, just no change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, no big difference. No, I wouldn't say that. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. This is therefore our last question. Thank you for the call. If you have any further question, please email Philipp and I, Julie and Oliver, your outstanding list of questions and good day to all of you. Thank you.</p>
