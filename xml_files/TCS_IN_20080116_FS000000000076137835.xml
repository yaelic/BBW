          <p>Ram and I will begin with a brief overview of the company's performance followed by a Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, TCS does not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Furthermore anything said in this call, which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be viewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. These risks are outlined on the second page of our results presentation.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and I just wanted to make some opening remarks. One is we have crossed $4 billion in terms of revenues in the first three quarters, which was achieved over four quarters in the last financial year. The whole diversified business model of TCS continues to drive growth at a fairly accelerated base despite challenging external circumstances. We grew year-on-year for the three quarters 41% in terms of dollar terms and 24.32% in rupee terms, and that too on an increasing base.</p>
          <p>For the nine months period all the major geographies have shown growth. Latin America grew at 60.9, North America at 35.4, APAC at 54.6, Europe at <mark type="inaudible" /> and India at 39.94. We earned in this quarter namely quarter three as a first Indian IT company to reach $1.5 billion in terms of revenues, which in terms of dollar terms is a 37% growth year-on-year. We are confident of our robust business model which is agile and at the same time innovative and able to cope with the challenges.</p>
          <p>In terms of geographies, the established markets like the US has crossed $2 billion in nine months and UK has also being growing in terms of absolute terms driven by our full services offerings and multiple services to the large customers. This quarter North America grew at 2.2%, UK at 4.9 and Europe at 24.2%, and the growth in emerging markets, Latin America, APAC and India, of course, were above the company average. We have currently 5500 plus people in Latin America and 1100 plus people in China and 400 plus in Hungary. So, we have grown across domains and services, BFSI continues to be strong and have grown above company rates sequentially, travel utilities are the other sectors which have shown growth above the company growth rates, and emerging services continue to grow like enterprise solutions, PCP and BPO.</p>
          <p>We did announce a number of large deal wins during the last few months, examples being The Nielsen Company, IMSS in Mexico, and BSNL in India. Overall, announced several deals of over $50 million, and they have grown across geographies and service lines like I said. Customers are migrating to the higher revenue bands, including the number of $100 million customers increasing to seven.</p>
          <p>In terms of profits over the nine-month period, its $941 million, and the operating margins have improved despite the 2.3% appreciation in the rupee against the dollar in this quarter. We remain cautiously confident about the future. One is our investment in the full services play in the global network delivery model helping us to diversify our revenue base. Big wins coming from across geographies, good qualified pipeline across sectors and markets, large deal wins during the quarter. We added 28,000 people to date in the three quarters, which is well ahead of the full year target, and we'll continue to add to 32,500 overall for the year in terms of hiring. And we have also made [inaudbile] campus offers for the year FY '09.</p>
          <p>We have shown through deals already one that we have the resilience to move beyond BFSI and other sectors, which are growing. But there are some reasons, we need to be cautious, where some of the sectors in the US are going through some turmoil and as we have seen in some of the results. The jury is still out on whether it's a recession or how long it would last. We focus and continue to be close to the market and appreciate the issues customers are facing and are well-positioned to work with them on transformation projects or on utilizing their budgets most efficiently.</p>
          <p>Large customer budgets are already set in the economic slowdown impact on planned business increases, it maybe revisited. I believe in summary, TCS is demonstrating all-round leadership even through difficult times. We recently made an investment of 10 crores that TCS has made into the NASSCOM ICICI Innovation Fund. Current environment of course necessitates caution as we have had all-round growth in spite of this.</p>
          <p>Our new and emerging market strategy is working. Diversified portfolio is a necessity in these times and the intention is not to rely or to be dependent on anyone sector, geography or anyone service. The GNDM or the Global Network Delivery proposition is helping us not just to enable our customer run their business but is helping them to transform their business and also ability to support across global location. The results demonstrate our ability to think and perform with agility in response to the environment. And I will hand it over to my CFO, Maha to give you the detail. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ram, and as Ram has indicated we are pleased with our performance during this quarter. We have achieved growth across geographies, verticals and service lines, and also as you can see improved our profitability. Overall, the revenue grew 5% quarter-on-quarter in rupee terms and 6.2% in US dollar terms. Year-over-year revenue grew 21.9% in rupee terms and approximately 36.8% in US dollar terms.</p>
          <p>As Ram has already talked about the various geographies, we have seen strong growth across Europe and our emerging markets of Latin America, Asia Pacific and India as our strategy of aggressively expanding globally and thus diversifying our geographical base. And this is continuing to pick up traction. In North America, our largest market, our share now stands at 49.5%. The share has reduced slightly as we continue to expand our offshore leverage for North American customers.</p>
          <p>I want to give you a overall breakdown of our revenue growth quarter-over-quarter that is compared to the previous quarter, the growth is like this. Volume it is 5.31%, pricing it is 53 basis points, effort mix is 81 basis points, foreign exchange has negatively impacted us to the extent of 1.61%, and therefore we get to 5.04%. So just repeating it, volume has given us an increase of 5.31%, pricing 0.53%, effort mix that is more onsite, slightly higher onsite share that has given us an increase in revenue of 0.81%, and foreign exchange negatively impacting us to the extent of 1.61%, total 5.04%.</p>
          <p>Second, let us look at what is driving our improved profitability of 33 basis points over Q3 &#x2013; in Q3 over Q2. Q2 operating margin was 23.83%, pricing, productivity, SG&amp;A was given a positive kicker of 1.25%. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 92 basis points, and therefore there was an impact of &#x2013; there was a positive 0.33% resulting in a Q3 operating margin of 24.15%. Repeating it, Q2 operating margin was 23.83%; pricing, productivity, SG&amp;A gave us a positive 1.25%, foreign exchange impact &#x2013; negatively impacted us to the extent of 92 basis points, and therefore overall there was a 33 basis points improvement resulting in 24.16% as the operating margin for Q3.</p>
          <p>As you can see there was a very negligible impact to the decrease in offshore percentage during Q3 in the margins. I would like to discuss the impact of our foreign exchange hedging program, which I believe is a key differentiating factor for TCS. Since we qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we are able to effectively watch the gains of our rupee hedge program to offset the negative impact of an appreciating rupee. As you know a certain portion of our gains and losses are recognized in revenue and a certain portion are recognized in other income.</p>
          <p>At Q3 end, we have a total outstanding foreign exchange contract portfolio of US$3.1 billion. During the quarter, exchange rate movements negatively impacted operating profit by 467.8 million rupees, you know, this is the economic impact that as we translated the revenue at a lower rate, we of course gained as far as expenses incurred in our overseas currencies. And the negative impact totally was 457.8 million. This was more or less offset by a gain from hedging of 450 million rupees, which was recorded in revenue.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had a foreign exchange hedge gain of 847.7 million recorded in the other income line. We also more than offset the net loss of 181.3 million from translation, collection and remittances. Therefore, the net foreign exchange gain in the other income line was 650.6 million, 650.6 million rupees was the net foreign exchange gain in the other income line.</p>
          <p>We have a mature, proactive and comprehensive foreign exchange management program, which has allowed TCS to maintain profitability, comparable with prior year in spite of approximately 12% appreciation of the rupee over this timeframe. And we have done it prudently, we do not get into any complex structures as far as foreign exchange is concerned. We have largely relied on options and we have only hedged our US dollars, pound sterling, and euro.</p>
          <p>As I have spoken about numerous times over the year to gain a better understanding of the profitability of our operation, the foreign exchange and other gains should be added back to operating margin. I have always said that because this has been a conscious effort from us. And if we did that, that is adding the incremental ForEx gains for Q3, operating margin increases from 24.16% to 25.59%. Adding the incremental ForEx gains for Q3 YTD, year to-date, the operating margin would be 25.42%. I don't want to illustrate it. To show that, we are in line certainly with all our actions in terms of maintaining the margins.</p>
          <p>This is essentially in line with our full operating margin target of achieving approximately 25%, this ability to sustain our profitability is also reflected in the net income for the quarter compared with the year ago in Q3, Q3 2008, FY '08 net income was 22.46%. Q3 FY '07 net income was 22.74.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would like to emphasize our confident in our financial model and in our ability to continue to effectively manage cost, so that we will be able to sustain our strong levels of profitability. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Rochelle, we'd like to open the floor for questions at this time.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you just walk back through the currency numbers, the operator jumped on line, so I'm sorry I missed the revenue contribution and the other income component from foreign exchange?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Julio, what I had essentially talked about is that we have an economic impact of 457.8 million rupees, because we lost in the revenue translation, we gained in the overseas expense translation. The net effect was 457.8 million. And in our revenue line, we have 450 million rupees recorded as a gain from hedging. That is appearing in the revenue line. In addition to that we have recorded in other income gains of 660.6 million rupees. So these are the two gains that we have recorded, 450 million in revenue line, 660.6 million rupees in other income line. Together say they give us 1.111 billion rupees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. And also just I wanted to go through the other component in revenues that showed an uptick this quarter, the product side. Can you talk a little bit about the product side and also does that &#x2013; is that most of that coming form India because I'm just noticing on a sequential basis a big jump in your India revenues, and I'm assuming that some of that is tied to the increase in the product contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have got some large systems integration contract in India. And we have already started delivering on that and some part of it certainly has come. That is why there has been a big increase as far as the product and equipment line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay got it. And just normally one thing you've mentioned about the large client budgets being in place, but also subject to review down the road, can you just characterize relatively to maybe last year with the budgets that are in place? What's your sense in terms of the pace of growth of those budgets overall? And then the opportunity for you guys to grow within those budgets as potentially there is more opportunity for offshore work? Can you just kind of characterize the budget that you have seen how much they've grown and then the opportunity that you guys have within those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even if you look at &#x2013; this is Chandra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chandra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the budget, we have met with key customers, and then we are in the process of finalizing our execution plans for the next fiscal year. And what we have seen is that the customers are sticking to the growth plans at this point in time. We have not received any special warning from any customer in the budget point of view. And also if you really see a deal pipeline that they announced during the past, the number of deals that we are pursuing is significantly larger compared to the same time last year. The only caution that we want to exercise is because still we are hearing lot of negative news from some of the financial services firms in the US, so we just wanted to be cautious and keep observing it in the coming months. Apart from that, we think that the plans are in tact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then at this point just relative to your expectations, are you seeing anything on the lines of project deferrals, project cancellations, anything that clients coming back to you and say we need to reassess plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Quinteros. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead, Mr. Foresi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. Just wanted to ask a question sort of on how you are looking at the business again compared to where we were last year? Have you adjusted any of your plans based on this cautious tone for spending your financial services in the US? And if you have made adjustments what are they?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first if you look at the financial services business, again the share of the financial services revenue had gone up this quarter compared to the previous quarter and the growth is very healthy. And if you look at the business from multiple dimensions, from a geographic perspective we are well spread, we are growing in all the emerging markets. As you would have seen in the results the rate of growth in the emerging markets is significantly higher because of the smaller size. So we are going to continue to focus on these emerging markets, be it Latin America, be it Middle East or Asia-Pacific or even India for that matter.</p>
          <p>Then coming to the industry segment, the deals that we have pursued is again well spread across multiple industries, even in the deals that we announced this quarter, the deals in the retail sector, media, couple of deals in the automotive sector and manufacturing sector. So it's kind of well spread. Even when I see the deal pipeline that we are pursuing it is spread across multiple industries as well as geographies. I would say that of the top 25 deals we are pursuing, maybe one-third is in the US and one-third in the UK and Europe, and one-third in the rest of the world, that's the way it's spreading itself. And from overall business model perspective, I think we are staying focused on full services, all over individual services lines, whether it is the infrastructure business or the BPO business or the engineering business are all growing. We want to bring those services together more and more in a more integrated fashion to be able to be able to offer a strong value proposition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as of right now there hasn't been any significant change in the way you approach the business, and I know you talked about where the deals are coming from, is that changed on an annual basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it has.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we never used to see, there are so many opportunities in the emerging markets, primarily because these are also very small in those market, now they are getting to a typical size, so we are able to pursue those markets. The second one is that Europe is accelerating, as you can see this quarter it's upwards of 20% growth on a sequential basis in Europe. So, Europe is accelerating. That gives us the ability to take larger deals in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's more of an effect of the acceleration of the emerging markets than an effect of a slowdown in the Americas, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not say a strong yes to that statement because the Q3 is typically a slow quarter in the US because of the Thanksgiving and Christmas and the related effects. So, the Q3 growth always has been slow in the US. We need to really see how the Q4 passes out in the US, then after that we can probably make some judgmental comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, would you say, and this is my last question, would you say that you would have full visibility on growth for next year within the next month or two, and is that any different than it was last year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this time we have a good visibility for the key customer relationships we have and also the fresh deals that we are pursuing at this point. The only thing I would again add even though you have said it many times, that we are cautiously looking at all the general happenings in the marketplace, especially in the US, both on the financial services sector also as a general US slowdown. And any corrections we have to make because of that, if any picture emerges during this quarter, we will come back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

Just again, looking at the outlook for 2008, just trying to get a sense in terms of, since you mentioned that the clients have come back to you with their spending plans for the year, if you could give us a bit more color in terms of how budget priorities maybe changing given that there certainly is an uncertain economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, what we are expecting is that there will be more offshoring of the maintenance and application development related business. The thing that we need to get a better handle on is about the translation program. If customers are going to look at their spending on new systems development in the same way as before, is something that we need to carefully watch. But in terms of the application maintenance in the ADM business or even for the other services and infrastructure or BPO et cetera, we think that the offshoring is going to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in terms of kind of a spending on the different services, are you seeing any change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, on the ADM side and the infrastructure or the BPO and assurance and these kind of services, the spending is going to continue. The only area that we need to carefully watch is the new programs, large scale programs, transformation programs, those are the budget spends that we need to carefully look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yes please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm saying in terms of the pricing discussions that you may have had more recently, what are you hearing from some of your large customers? Is there other customers looking for may be volume discounts or any kind of trends that you're going to share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the monthly services contract renewals, we did not have many renewals during the October, November, December. We typically &#x2013; that's not a quarter in which the contracts start. So, we don't have many renewals in that quarter. But in the coming quarter and in the Q1 we expect more contracts to come for renewal as well as planning. And we continue to expect an upward revision in pricing, both in the renewals and as well as in new contracts, but whether it is going to be 3 to 5% and 5 to 8% as we have said before is something that we want to wait. But at this point in time definitely we are expecting a positive uptick, but we can't give you a specific percentage at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally if I may have &#x2013; may just ask one question to Paddy in terms of the hiring for the quarter, was that a little bit lower than what you had planned initially? And is that basically a reflection of caution on the environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Mitali, you should look at the first nine months total hiring, for the first nine months we have made a gross of over 28,000 appointees into the company. Yes, in the third quarter, we had initially talked about 9000, but they've met all our business requirements with a gross hiring of about 1000 clients. And we are well in-line to achieve the overall total hiring of about 32,500 plus.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Gosh. Next question comes from the line of Ms. Julie Santoriello from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just looking for little historical perspective here, and many economists now are calling for all-round recession here in the US, and last time we had one was back in 2001, and I'm just wondering if you could share with us some of your experiences back at that time, how did business unfold for TCS back in 2001 as the economy here in the US began to slow. Are you taken by surprise by pullback in discretionary spending? Did you see customers pausing it all or postponing things? And did that end up as you think ultimately accelerating the offshoring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we looked at 2001, the offshoring really took off, because in an environment where budgets are &#x2013; they want to encash the maximum amount out of the budgets, then they would move offshore because offshore made a lot of viable spends and the growth across organizations within the industry grew really from an offshore perspective, and then India perspective. What good processes and systems we have built over the years is to deliver the same kind of efficiency, not just sort of India, but also other emerging locations, a case in point being Uruguay, or Brazil, or Hungary, or China.</p>
          <p>So, to us if story like 2001 is going to be repeated offshoring is certainly a big possibility at more so offshoring across the various global delivery locations we have. So, cost reductions and efficiencies would be very necessary to run the business. And then whatever we can release out of that can be used for transformation businesses. We would believe that there can be an offshore uptake if the situation warrants it from a budget freeze or budget reduction point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you recall seeing a lag generally in terms of, when we the business began to slow in the US? And that point to when customers began to set up their offshoring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there'll always be a certain delay with regard to budget allocations and how they are going to be shifting. But, the fact of the matter is geographies like Europe or Latin America or India or APAC region is presently growing and growing at a much faster speed. So, the balance is between how much of the budgets we can pull from running the business in markets like US, and how much of growth we can target for in growth markets like emerging markets than there would be. So, I think the lag will always be there, but then we don't see any budget cuts as we speak or budget reductions. So with the result hopefully the fourth quarter should show a continuing performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Santoriello. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Sandeep Shah from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead Mr. Shah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the earlier remarks what we said is we have met some of the key clients and they are sticking to the growth plans, and after that we said that we have to look in terms of the projecting for their discretionary spending or the transformational spending. So in terms of the key clients when you met, are the growth plans are only been stuck for the ADM business or is it also been confirm in terms of the new transformational deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandeep, this is Chandra. For all the key clients and there we have definitive plans for the next year. We have a pretty good idea about areas that we are going to work on, in terms of both the ADM business as well as the programs that they're currently working on which are transformation in nature. There we have not had any cancellations, that's the point I was making. Then the other point I was making was any economic slowdown or more things happening related to the subprime issue have always have a possible effect on the spend on transformation budgets. And so that budget either we know in some cases, in some cases we don't know, we have to be very, very cautious about factoring that in our growth plans and with other plans. That's the only point I was making, otherwise we pretty much have our plans done for this year for our key clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at an uncertain macro situation, do you believe that the budget plans on the transformational deals or discretionary spending may not be released in the first half, it may take time from the client in terms of the budget plans on these budgets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very likely, very likely, and that is why we are repeatedly mentioning this word "caution", because everyone is asking about this subprime issue as well as the slowdown. The only thing that we would say is that on this transformation projects we have got to be very cautious, whether the projects will get kick-off on time or there can be delays et cetera. So we are factoring impact for that in our plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second, sir, in the CNBC you've said that the volume growth is close to around 5.3%. Can you give us the idea in terms of the volume growth in the international business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The international business the volume growth was 3.98% close to 4%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it seems a little low, is it just because of the North America, because of the holiday season or there are some unexpected &#x2013; is it the quarterly aberration or unexpected delay from some of the international plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, there are two things, one is, definitely we need to factor in the US geography, definitely because on that scale, every percentage point matters, and third quarter is not the best quarter for the US geography. You definitely have to factor that, but otherwise if you really look at it in dollar terms, I think the overall revenue growth has been pretty satisfactory.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. I've realized that we don't, you guys don't give guidance on a forward basis, but given what you are seeing out there, do you think that the March quarter is going to be any different from a typical March quarter for TCS, at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what is that &#x2013; what is the typical, if you can describe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Typical means &#x2013; well, typically means that, as you know, the March quarter is probably the weakest quarter in &#x2013; throughout the year. We do have some sequential growth, but again on a relative basis, it's weaker than other quarters. So, again you don't have to give guidance, but is there anything you think that's going to be not within that scenario of being a typical quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very difficult question to answer, because we don't give guidance, and anything I say can be construed. But all I can tell you is that we have given you enough wins this quarter, okay. If you really see the number of deals which are 50 million, 100 million, 200 million, 1.2 billion, et cetera, so we expect that some of those deals will start ramping up, sometime in the quarter, all of them may not start on January 1st, some will start during the quarter.</p>
          <p>And then we've also given you a very healthy pipeline, I mean, we have said that 25 deals or 50 million plus is what we are pursuing. That should give you enough indication about the health of the business, and I am pleased to look at that from an annual perspective. On a nine months basis, we have grown 41% in telecoms on our scale. So, these are all the indicators that we will give you to say that we are quite positive, but very difficult to quantify how much will do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate the clarification. Is there anything in terms of project ramp so far during the January &#x2013; during the month of January that will indicate any areas of concern and any vertical? Or is there anything that you &#x2013; so far you feel has been kind of unusual in terms of project ramp of those new deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then finally obviously as we got along until we get to the end of the March quarter, I guess, maybe we will get some better clarification in terms of clients, IT spending plans and visibility. I mean, in your point of view is there a specific timeframe that's going to be kind of beyond that you're going to say, hey we are kind of safe, we're feeling a bit better, we're going to drop this cautionary comment about our outlook going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

I think from our point of view there is a reasonable amount of, what we say, clarity at those times, yeah unless something very drastic happens, this can happen any time of the year at various point of time.

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, congrats for the great results. My question was regarding the hiring outlook that you had talked about, that is 32,500. If you look at the first nine months you've already done, around 28,000 gross additions. My math indicates that this would imply a volume growth of around 4% or 3, 3.5% or so for the next quarter, which seems to be pretty much more than what we have seen in the last two years. So, would you like to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Paddy here. See, the 32,500 is an indication of the revenue pattern the whole year. It is important to note that in every quarter you have to keep track of three factors, the gross addition, the utilization and the attrition. From that perspective, I can say we are well in line to reach the target and go up. This doesn't have to exactly stop with 32,500.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to add a couple of comments to what Paddy said. See on our base of over 105,000 associates, growth from 8,000 associates we have lot of flexibility in the utilization. Though we are operating at 77 to 79% that's the range we have been operating, we've got some cushion there to pull it up. So, we will balance it along with the hiring plan and the attrition. So, we will keep looking at this number and we'll balance it nicely. And also it is not only about just hiring the number of people, it's also what skill sets we are hiring and what mix also we are carefully looking at. On going forward we are also trying to see more revenue coming out of some of the non &#x2013; which are not directly related to the people deployed <mark type="inaudible" /> et cetera. So it's not for the immediate quarter or something like that, it's most for longer term. So, all these things will play as we go forward hiring numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">

          <p>In the campuses we have already made 22,000 plus offers for the FY '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I may ask another question, one more question, basically our top line this quarter is grown by around 4.7% in dollar terms. while top six to say ten clients have grown very strongly at around 32%, so could you pour some color on what is happening on the non-top five clients here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, if you look at the client concentration, I think we are very, very happy with it, because the growth pattern is pretty nice, both the top one clients, top five clients, top 10 clients all of them are growing either at the company average or slightly better which is a good position to be in. And obviously the top five to ten clients are smaller than the top one to five clients. So their propensity is to grow faster is higher. So that's reflected in the numbers. So we're happy with that.</p>
          <p>And the other thing we're very happy about is the migration of clients to the different revenue ranges, that is 100 million, 50 million, 20 million, 10 million or 1 million customers, there is significant addition in every band. So I think that's very healthy, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one last question, if I may. This was regarding the margins in the Europe geography which has moved considerably this quarter. It was around 28% last quarter and this quarter it's around 32%. So could you throw some light as to what has happened there? In fact, US margins have dipped, but Europe has seen very good improvements in margins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. My first question is actually, looking at your international revenue sequential growth, this quarter it was only about 6.3%. You compare that with the September quarter, it was about 11.2%. Now, even looking at the historical trend, TCS typically has a strong growth in the September and the December quarters. So can you help us understand what happened this December quarter, and did you have any negative surprises?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't know why this pattern is being attributed to us, first of all. There is no pattern that the second and third quarters are superior for TCS. That's firstly. The second thing is in the December quarter in the US time and material revenues tend to be lower. Okay. If at all you want to say one pattern, in the December quarter time and material revenue growth in the US geography tends to be lower. But that's the only trend I can give you. But apart from that, I think the growth in all other markets has been pretty good. In the US also it has grown from last quarter to this quarter. U.K. has also grown. So we're pretty happy with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then a follow-up question I guess, looking at the revenue from U.K., looking at the September quarter and the December quarter, if you look at the sequential revenue growth rate that's below the Company average growth rate. Can you help us understand what exactly is happening in U.K.? I do see that you're growing significantly in the rest of Europe, but not so much in U.K.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kanchana, this is Maha here. New contracts have also come into U.K. I think, basically, looking purely at one quarter, one shouldn't really be coming to conclusions. U.K. continues to be a very, very good geography. It's just that, as far as this quarter is concerned, there is a slightly lower growth but not indicative of any issue or trend around so on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

          <p>Also, I would say that the pipeline in U.K. remains healthy. Hopefully, we will be announcing some wins in the U.K. geography shortly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one final question, I guess with respect to North America, the low sequential growth, is that mainly due to the low number of billing days in the December quarter? Could you just attribute it to that, or was there anything else?</p>

          <p>And also there is an offshore shift that's moderate. That while the on-site offshore &#x2013; I also want to make a comment on this on-site offshore shift. While the shift of India is about 1.6 less, but you increase the GDC leverage by 60 basis points and 100 basis points on-site. That 100 basis point movement on-site has happened outside of the US To that extent, there is a hit in the US growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. There is some talk or anecdotal evidence that large financial services clients are saying to the vendors that you should reduce prices to grow volume in the traditional ADM kind of business. Have you come across this kind of situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, the answer to that question is a no. And all I would say is that the &#x2013; I don't want to comment on specific clients, but we have not in that type of situation</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you think this is a real possibility as things may worsen a little?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Gandhi. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Steinerman from Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Andrew Steinerman. I didn't catch the end of that last response about pricing. Could you just repeat what's always a possibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What I was saying is that, in general, it's a hypothetical question whether it is possible that we will be asked for the price discounts. That is always a possibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only the renewal of contracts come up in any of these discussions. For the existing contracts, we're not seeing any comments about volume increases because of the pricing reductions or pricing discounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not had that pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I could ask the question in a different fashion. If we were in a more difficult volume environment whenever it might occur, this year, next year, whenever, what's the philosophy of TCS? Would you want to try to increase volume at the sacrifice of price, or would pricing be more a gating factor for volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, in general, we keep the price as a priority, and margins are pretty important for us. But one can't make a generic statement because each situation is different, and how is the deal structured, you are talking about on-site pricing, offshore pricing, fixed price contract, some situations we may go in for a fixed price contract where we have a complete control over the execution. In some situations there are transformational opportunities by combining IT and infrastructure and BPO.</p>
          <p>So there are different possibilities, but by and large our focus is to keep the pricing as an important item, especially when there is the demand, when there is a demand environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, this is Maha here. I just want to add one more to that. Given our very good geographical strength, you've seen the investments that we've made in various geographies to increase our selling and marketing capability and so on, whether it is in emerging countries, geographies or in some of the geographies that we are essentially creating a bigger push and so on. I think there are lots of alternatives for us if the situation were to develop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That sounds very reasonable. Thank you so much.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Steinerman. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Ajay Mathrani from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening and thanks. My question related to competitors. Have you seen any behavioral changes in key competitors in terms of pricing or looking at markets or clients that they were not so keen on earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only you should tell us. I think, the competition situation has become very broad-based now, because in different markets there are many competitors now. All the global players are very much participating in every deal. But in general, I don't think that it is a price war. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think we are able to get the right price as long as we articulate the value proposition. That's the situation. And I think that competitors are doing the same thing. I'm not seeing anyone dumping price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Can I just slip in one more? In terms of the deal pipeline, you've been mentioning 20 previous quarter, 25 this quarter. What has been the average win rate like and the average sales cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We announced nine large deals this quarter in Q3, and some of the deals that were in the pipeline in last quarter still continue to be in the pipeline. So that should give you a fairly good idea about our win rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sales cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales cycle varies anywhere from four, six months, sometimes even longer, but it depends on the size of the deal and the complexity of the deal. If it is a pure ADM contract, it may be shorter but whereas if it's a full services contract and multi-geography contract it takes longer. Sometimes the companies do it by themselves or sometimes they partner with a third party advisory firm. So there's quite a bit of variations there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Mathrani. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Suveer Chainani from Macquarie. Please go ahead, Mr. Chainani.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Good evening. My question is that I understand that your client profile is changing what they were last year and what it is this year, which is good that you're diversifying beyond the US But when you talk to your top clients, when you were speaking to them this quarter, in terms of how their demand is on your services vis-&#xE0;-vis when you were speaking to your top clients last quarter in terms of demand for your services, what are the changes and nuances in terms of, are you speaking more bullish, bearish or similar, taking into account that clearly your &#x2013; the base effect is coming in? In terms of what I'm trying to gauge is that is the growth rate from your top clients similar or poorer from last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the last four, five quarters, and if you look at our customer metrics, and you see at least between the top one, five and 10 customers, you can clearly see the growth rates. All those customers have been nicely growing. And also in the million large clients, we have been migrating clients pretty nicely. On a last 12 months basis, there has been a significant migration of clients into higher revenue bands. So obviously, it indicates the propensity for growth with these client segments.</p>
          <p>But if you really ask what are the trends, clients now recognize us more as a full services player. Clients definitely want to engage TCS on our infrastructure capability, operations capability, assurance capability and also in consulting capability. And you see that in the growth of these particular service offerings.</p>
          <p>And the other thing that is playing out, especially with the case of customers who are global is our global network delivery model. Customers are interested in leveraging TCS, for example, in Latin America and India together at the same time, because they have an operation, which requires both those two locations, and India and China at the same time. There is a client who is operating between India and China, clients who operates between India and Latin America, and in the future probably India, Latin America and China all together. So these kind of trends are emerging.</p>
          <p>So as long as we are able to ramp up our delivery capability in this market, and build the portfolio of offerings that we have here in those centers, and are able to execute it with the same operational efficiency for us and for them. For us from the margin point of view, for them from the quality point of view, I expect that there is opportunity for growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would just like you to quantify that, in terms of growth in their budgets for your kind of services, how has it changed from last year to this year? Growth in the budgets of your kind of services, how has that changed from last year to this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is going up, primarily because, again if you look at --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The growth rate is going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The growth rate is going up are you saying? So if last year they were saying --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I can't generalize. There are clients where their size is very large and their growth rate will be smaller, but in absolute terms they are growing. And they're adding &#x2013; using TCS for more services, but if they're already spending with us 150, $200 million, then the growth rate is going to be definitely smaller in those clients.</p>
          <p>But if you typically take clients in the range of 20 to 40, 50 million, obviously in those cases the opportunity for &#x2013; or the growth rate of what they spend with us is growing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks, and all the best.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Chainani. The last question for today is from the line of Mr. Nimish Joshi from CLSA. Please go ahead, Mr. Joshi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What would be the realized rate in US dollar INR rate for this quarter? And what was it last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as this quarter is concerned, it is 39.52, as far as US dollar goes. And last quarter was 40.45.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Joshi. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. David Nelson and the management for their final remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rochelle. And I'll turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai for concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for all your questions. Hopefully, we've answered and addressed all of them.</p>
          <p>All I wanted to summarize was the diversified portfolio of TCS, and with the spread and focus across geographies, verticals and services, and delivery to your global network delivery model is working and is playing out very, very effectively.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on operational efficiencies and push all the levers for a full services play. Overall, the pipelines of deals which we articulated, 25 deals we are working on large, plus the deals which we won during the quarter would definitely ramp up. We are pleased with the results. We have hired 28,000 to date and going to be hiring 32,500 which we are committed at the beginning of the year. We have already made offers of 22,000 for the next year. And the margin improvements will also be focused on.</p>
          <p>Overall, the robust results demonstrate our ability to think and perform with agility and the cautionary statement, which we issued is from the environment perspective more so rather than any clients slowing down or the clients wanting to reduce the work.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you so much and we look forward to meeting you again at the end of quarter four.</p>
