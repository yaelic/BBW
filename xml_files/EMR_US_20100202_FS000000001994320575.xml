      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Damien . I am joined today by David Farr and Walter Galvin. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2010 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate Web site. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the Web site after the call for the next three months.</p>
          <p>I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation. First-quarter sales were down 7% to 5 billion. Underlying sales declined 13%. We did see growth resume in the quarter in our Climate Technologies segment. Emerging markets were down 4% and mature markets declined 18%. Gross profit margin of 38% up 110 basis points despite a decline in sales. Operating profit margin was even with the prior year at 14.8%. Earnings per share of $0.56, down 7% compared to $0.60 in the prior-year quarter. Operating cash flow was very strong at 687 million, up 115%. Good asset management in the quarter with trade working capital as a percent of sales improving to 18% from 19.9% in the prior-year quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide three, the P&amp;L, sales in the quarter of 5.011 billion, again down 7%. Underlying sales were down 13% and currency and acquisitions each added three points. Operating profit margin was equal to the prior year at 14.8%. Our aggressive cost reduction efforts and restructuring actions are working. Earnings from continuing ops in the quarter were 422 million. Diluted average shares outstanding of 755.5 million. No shares were repurchased in the first quarter 2010, which leaves you with an EPS of $0.56.</p>
          <p>Next slide, underlying sales by geography. In Q1 sales in the U.S. declined 12%. Total international was down 15%, with Europe down 27%, Middle East/Africa down 20% and Latin America down 13%. Asia was up 4% in the quarter which includes China, which was up 14% in the quarter. Again, the total underlying sales declined 13%, with currency and acquisition each adding three points, which gets you to a consolidated sales down 7%.</p>
          <p>Next slide, more income statement detail. Gross profit of 1.903 billion or 38% of sales. The improvement driven by cost reductions, rationalization benefits and materials cost containment. SG&amp;A was 23.2% of sales, getting you to operating profit of 742 million or 14.8% of sales which was flat to the prior-year period. Other deductions of 93 million which includes a $12 million increase in amortization expense from recent acquisitions. Interest expense of 65 million, this gets you to the pre-tax line of 584 million or 11.7% of sales. Taxes in the quarter were 150 million for a tax rate of 25.7%. We had a tax benefit in the quarter from the reorganization of foreign subsidiaries. The full year tax rate is still expected to be approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Slide six, the cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow, strong at up 115% in the quarter to 687 million. Capital expenditures of 89 million gets you to a free cash flow of 598 million up 219%. Our free cash flow conversion was 141% in Q1. The trade working capital balances are at the bottom of the chart. Trade working capital as a percent to sales, again were 18% in the quarter, a nice improvement from the prior-year quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide seven the business segment P&amp;L. Business segment EBIT of 731 million or 14.2% of sales, a 70 basis point improvement from prior year. We saw benefits from cost reductions, restructuring initiatives and effective price/cost management. Difference in accounting methods of 46 million, corporate and other of 128 million, an increase of 54 million. We had higher incentive comp of 38 million due to the overlap of the two incentive plans which we've talked about and the increase in the stock price.</p>
          <p>We also had Avocent transaction cost and purchase accounting charges of 22 million in the quarter. Interest expense of 65 million, the increase driven by our change in debt mix. We did issue 1.85 billion in long term debt in the last 12 months as well as lower interest income. Gets you to the pre-tax earnings of 584 million.</p>
          <p>Next we'll go through the individual businesses, starting with Process Management. Sales in the quarter of 1.382 billion, down 9%. Underlying sales were down 17%, acquisitions added five points and currency added three points. By region the U.S. was down 17%, Asia was down 11%, Europe down 19% and Middle East/Africa down 7%. We've seen broad declines across the segment offset by growth in the Power and Water business.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 216 million or 15.6% of sales. Margin was negatively impacted by volume deleverage and product mix. We did realize significant cost reduction and restructuring benefits in the quarter. The underlying order trends excluding currency for Process Management have started to modestly improve and our industry leadership continues as evidenced by our 31 first place awards by Control Magazine. Emerson Process Management had three times more number one products than the nearest competitor.</p>
          <p>Slide nine, Industrial Automation, sales in the quarter of 876 million, down 21%. Underlying sales declined 28%, currency added four points and acquisitions added three points. By region the U.S. was down 30%, Europe down 29% and Asia was down 14%. While broad-based weakness continued in the segment we did see modest growth in the drives business.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 85 million or 9.8% of sales impacted by volume deleverage and increased restructuring of 15 million which was partially offset by cost reduction. Orders have bottomed for Industrial Automation and we continue our aggressive restructuring to improve our competitive positioning. We completed the acquisition of SSB Wind Systems, a leading global supplier of electrical pitch control for wind turbines which further strengthens Emerson's position in the global wind turbine market.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, Network Power, sales in the quarter of sales of 1.381 billion, down 5%. Underlying sales were down 10%, currency added three points and acquisitions added two points. By region, the U.S. was down 10%, Asia was up 7% and Europe was down 33%. We continue to see datacenter and telecom strength in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>EBIT performance in the quarter was strong. EBIT dollars of 206 million or 14.9% of sales, up 35%, positively impacted by cost reductions and restructuring benefits, materials cost containment and lower restructuring of 13 million. Our aggressive restructuring in '09 provides a strong global cost position for Network Power. The Avocent acquisition was completed in the quarter on December 11, 2009. This acquisition positions Emerson to provide unique and comprehensive datacenter infrastructure solutions.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide 11 Climate Technologies, sales in the quarter of 784 million, up 13%. Underlying sales were up 7% and currency and acquisitions each added three points. By region, the U.S. was up 7%, Europe declined 33% and Asia was up 52%. We saw growth across all businesses in the quarter. The China stimulus programs and R-410A conversion in the U.S. benefited sales.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 113 million or 14.5% of sales, a nice improvement from the prior year driven by volume leverage, cost reduction savings, lower restructuring and materials cost containment. Global responsible energy regulation will continue to drive opportunity for Climate Technologies, and we see this business segment having positive sales growth in fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 Appliance and Tools, sales here of 731 million, down 5%, underlying sales declined 7% and currency and acquisitions each added one point. By region the U.S. was down 6%, Europe was down 12% and Asia was up 1%.</p>
          <p>EBIT of 111 million or 15.2% of sales. We had nice margin improvement driven by cost reductions and materials cost containment which is partially offset by volume deleverage and lower prices. We've seen improvement in some of our earlier cycle residential businesses however customers continue to maintain low inventory and production levels given the uncertainty in the U.S. economy.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the summary and outlook. A good start for the year for Emerson. The underlying sales declines are moderating and we've seen improving underlying order trends across all of our businesses. Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter and we are realizing margin improvement driven by our aggressive best cost restructuring and permanent cost reduction effort.</p>
          <p>Based on that we expect full year underlying sales to decline three to 6%, and reported sales to be flat to up 3%. We expect operating margin flat to up 50 basis points, to 15.1% to 15.6%, and full year earnings per share in the range of 2.20 to 2.40 which includes approximately $0.06 dilution from the Avocent acquisition. Avocent's LANDesk business is classified as discontinued operations and is expected to be sold within six months. We expect full year operating cash flow of 2.7 to 3 billion and as a reminder, we will review or 2010 expectations and long term growth initiatives at Emerson's Annual Investor Conference on February 5.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lynne. First of all I want to welcome everybody here today and thank you for joining us. I am looking forward to meeting and being with the investors and the shareholders this coming Friday, in New York as we have our annual session. We've had two days of board meetings. We've had some great discussion here as we look at what's going on around the world. We had an excellent shareholders meeting lasting 27 minutes today. Everyone got reelected. The board and the shareholders have actually decided to keep me for 12 extra months which is good for me. I'm pleased to hear that. But we had a good session today with the board and the shareholders.</p>
          <p>As you can see it's clear to me that in September/October, this time period we reached bottom. We bottomed out and now we're pivoting. We're pivoting for growth. We're going to start growing within the next three to four months. That will be the theme of what we talk about on Friday.</p>
          <p>Clearly with what's gone underway for the last 18 months there's been a lot of restructuring. A major investment in our repositioning around the world, major investment in new product innovation, the launches are happening. We have done a lot of restructuring of our facilities from the standpoint of just cost but also inventory and we've had an excellent management in the price/cost area for the last 12 to 18 months and we are in good position.</p>
          <p>I want to thank the business leaders and the employees &#x2013; the corporate employees, the divisional people around the world for all the work undertaken the last 18 months. It's not been easy. As a global company we had seen significant down draft in sales. At times we were losing $1 billion a quarter. And there's a lot of thing that happen to you when you lose $1 billion a quarter when you're a $25 billion company. And I want to thank the business leaders and the presidents and all the people around the world and the corporate people here getting the job done and making some very difficult issues.</p>
          <p>As I see it, we've bottomed. Unemployment level, we've reached bottom, we are actually hiring people these days around the world. And it will be I think a very slow, gradual recovery. And we'll talk more about that on Friday but clearly it's going to be a mix recovery, but it's happening and we are in very good shape.</p>
          <p>Again I want to thank the people for making these things happen and executing. The quarter shows that. The quality of the earnings, the quality of the margins both at the gross profit line, the operating line, the net line, the quality of the cash flow, the strategic acquisitions we brought on board late in last year's fiscal year and again this first fiscal quarter. These things are really challenging to do and at the same time, we're delivering improved margins and improved cash flow so I'm extremely pleased about that.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of Avocent which we got done in the second week of December is going well. I want to thank the Avocent organization for all that they're doing right now. As they're quickly learning, Emerson is a very detailed, hands on, engaging company, and I know that they're engaged right now working with us around the world with Avocent trying to understand what we could do together and to ready integrate within our whole network Power and Infrastructure business. And it's going well and I'm very pleased and I want to thank the employees at Avocent for what they've been doing with us. And hopefully they'll tolerate all our attention and probing that we do for a little bit longer as we learn about their business.</p>
          <p>You also will see today that we have made the decision to sell the LANDesk business within Avocent. It will be sold within six months, hopefully. We're engaged right now. We're in the process and it's going well and it's not strategic to us and it wasn't from day one and that was always our desire to do this. And so we'll get that done within this fiscal year and hopefully sooner.</p>
          <p>But as I look at where we are right now, we're &#x2013; the organization's engaged for growth. We're engaged to launch our new products. We are engaged to take it to the marketplace. As you know I talk about this constantly. I look at the first 18 months of a recovery as the time you make the most hay, the time you get the most difference, the time you get the horses running and we're running. And it's a time we get things going our way and we create that new momentum from where we were going backwards to reversing it.</p>
          <p>The company's in great shape from a cost standpoint. We have some more restructuring we have to get done this year. It's not significant compared to what we did the last 18 months, but it still needs to get done and we will get it done. I look at our facilities right now, the inventory's in great shape from the standpoint there was very little inventory added this quarter other than what was added through the acquisitions. And from my perspective we are going to keep that inventory really tight until I see the strength of this recovery. It is recovering but I don't know what the pace will look like.</p>
          <p>As I look at it today, executing in all the areas, within four to five months our underlying sales will start to be positive. The growth, the orders are coming. You saw that in the most recent report that came out today. The December underlying orders were slightly positive for that month &#x2013; for the month and as you can see in the chart you'll see in this Friday chart you'll see that underlying trends for all the businesses are turning up. And they'll take their time as you go forward and go positive. But Climate has definitely gone positive and will continue to stay positive for the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>Across the company, on behalf of the OCE and the board I want to thank the organization for the work they got done the last 18 months. Again, that was not easy. We took some very permanent actions. We took the restructuring necessary to strengthen this company. We shut down our facilities to get the inventory out and with that today, the company is far better shape to go forward, and I feel very good at where we are today and I want to thank everybody for that.</p>
          <p>As you saw from the forecast that we put out both in the press release and what Lynne reviewed here a few minutes ago. I think we're going to have a very exciting session on Friday. As we get into more interesting deals, I'll be presenting myself along with Ed Monser along with Charlie Peters. And then we're going to have four of the business leaders talk about what's going on in their companies and talking about the growth in innovation that we're driving because you're going to need to do that to get growth versus what we saw the last five or six years.</p>
          <p>So with that I'll leave it &#x2013; open the lines for Q&amp;A, and again I want to thank everyone for joining today. I'm looking forward to seeing everybody on Friday and I hope you will come and join us live in New York. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, you sound substantially more encouraged if not downright bullish on this call versus last. I mean I think for obvious reasons. But can we just narrow down in Process a little bit, at one point I think you were concerned that Process may not turn up until as late as 2012. I mean what's your view kind of now on when Process is going to turn up for real?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll see that I'm still -- in the forecast, you'll see on Friday is still negative for this year. Underlying sales will still be negative. I think the orders will continue to trend upwards. The question is when will they go positive. My gut tells me orders will probably go positive late in 2010. My current feel on that, and I think it'll be into early to mid-2011 before you see underlying sales, I mean obviously comps have been a little bit easier but the momentum kicking back in I don't think will be until the mid of 2011. But it's going the right way. The trend line's not surprising to me right now. It's probably trending a little bit stronger than I thought originally. So, that's the way the world is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so pull forward a bit but not &#x2013; still not till mid-2011. I get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My follow-up question is on China. It turned up is nicely for you this quarter, and the data coming out of China is pretty encouraging for sure. But last quarter you had a tougher quarter in China. What changed quarter-to-quarter for your specific businesses there, was it just timing issues or something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple things happened. I think that their stimulus program really kicked in and particularly in our markets. It was very targeted. It was actually going into something that built something rather than transfer payments that we saw in this country. And so I think that we saw some of that stimulus kicking in from the government. We saw some of the consumers starting to spend and the company spending so that's what we saw and it's starting to happen.</p>
          <p>think we'll have a very good year in China. We'll have a good year in Asia too. And we had a little bit of inventory build in China relative to the Climate Technology. I don't expect that to continue but even that the markets have continued to be pretty good for the last 30 days too. <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey just as a quick question, the $0.06 of dilution from Avocent, does that include the LANDesk disposition and expected proceeds thereof and if -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a zero effect. We're going to buy LANDesk this year and we're going to sell LANDesk. There'll be &#x2013; we're not going to be any impact in the total year, might have a little bit of impact in the &#x2013; a quarter because we'll have the interest expense of it but we're assuming that we're going to sell LANDesk and it's not included in that $0.06. There's not going to be any gain or loss from selling LANDesk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the 22 million that was in the corporate and other, that's about $0.02. Is that part of the 0.06 so you take basically 0.04 and spread it like a penny each of the four quarters &#x2013; or three quarters?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the rules for acquisitions have changed. We only report one number. I don't give you guys acquisitions, not GAAP. A lot of guys love to do that, oh, it's accretive if you exclude this, this, this and 20 things later it becomes accretive. We charge off what we pay for. So you have inventory, you have amortization, we have interest cost, we have deal costs. There's only one number at Emerson; it's called GAAP, okay?</p>

          <p>No, no, I get it. Let me ask you, last call Dave talked sort of five to 600 million more in M&amp;A, I think outside of Avocent, what's your thoughts still there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Five or 600 more.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming over the next three quarters, you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that we want to do some more this year. We've done 1.3 billion and we'll do probably five or 600 million more and as Walter reminds me net, so it could be a little bit higher than that because we're going to get some proceeds from LANDesk too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just lastly, how did Network Power do a 14.9 margin? Had you ever done a fourth quarter especially with still the core down, have you ever done a margin that high in your first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a &#x2013; first of all my hat's off to the embedded power and computing guys. They did an enormous restructuring last year and that's really paying off from the standpoint of now starting to make some money on lower sales. And clearly we had a strong quarter in China, and we have never done a margin that high before. We've talked about getting up to 15%. I fundamentally believe that we're going to have a pretty good margin in this sector.</p>
          <p>The one thing that will hurt us this year is you'll see this in New York is that now Avocent is coming in and then we'll be having the amortization of the intangibles. So our margin will be impacted by that but we'll still have a nice margin improvement in the whole sector. It won't be as good as this first quarter. You got to keep that in mind.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I can only hope to solicit as great a response as the last one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends what kind of question you ask us, Steve. He accused me of not reporting GAAP numbers or something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, on such a strong quarter, one of the things that obviously comes out is trying to understand restocking versus underlying demand. And I'm sure you're going to get into it more on Friday but just as you look at it now by business unit can you give us just more color for what you're seeing in the channels and your customers and a sense for replenishment versus them in fact ordering for their own customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; I think what we're seeing is the same thing you saw in the GDP numbers that reported last week. If you look at Emerson, we've stopped the destocking and so that has an impact. We saw customers continue to work throughout the month of December, our end customers. So you saw &#x2013; you have been seeing that in the reported sales and quarters coming out of your &#x2013; other people in this industry.</p>
          <p>So we saw our customers continue to buy. I am not seeing a whole lot of inventory going in. We saw a little bit in Climate both in China as they got ready for the season in China and the new higher efficiency product. And then we also saw a little bit of the R-22 refrigerant transition at Copeland in North America. So there's a little bit of that. But there's not a whole lot of what I would say restocking. I think you're seeing stopping and you're seeing underlying demand now which is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if you look at your pricing/cost gap, in terms of how that's played out and to what extent you're in green, can you give us some more color around how that &#x2013; those dynamics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think right now as I look at our net material inflation and our pricing we are slightly green at this point in time. Our net material inflation is negative which is good news. As things came down last year we were able to get &#x2013; work some contracts and get our material cost down. I think that will reverse as the year goes on and you're going to start seeing inflation start increasing and our net material inflation will be coming less and less negative and move towards that zero line.</p>
          <p>Our pricing right now is slightly negative, just slightly negative. And I think it will stay slightly negative for the next couple quarters and then turn back up to positive. So right now we're in balance, we're slightly green as you referred to it and as we refer to it but it's not a big swing. Our price/cost relationship right now is in pretty good shape. And it's a dynamic thing, we'll talk a little bit about it Friday because we're going to go from a period of negative net material inflation into I think as the year proceeds to less negative and the pricing will follow right behind it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, again, I'm not trying steal Friday's thunder, but just the seasonality assumptions you're making for the year, as I look at the numbers on the quarter which are very strong, I mean, how were you guys thinking about it as you played out the rest of the year, just at a high level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the highest level typically as I told the board today it was very difficult for us to understand as we dropped, how far the bottom was going to be. Now it's equally more challenging for us as we come back up. But typically in a recovery mode, each quarter in a recovery will be on a top line basis will be slightly better, slightly higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sequentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we would expect our sales to be slightly higher in the second quarter, slightly higher in the third quarter, slightly higher in the fourth quarter. Would you agree with that, Walter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And therefore, we think our margin will improve as we go along. The timing issue relative to the quarter, as you know, I don't give quarterly forecasts, but you got to watch out because we may have more restructuring in the second quarter. We may have more things flow in the second quarter but typically our quarters now will sequentially get better as the year proceeds.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question in Industrial Automation and the SSB Wind System acquisition, it's interesting that there's a niche within pitch control. How is &#x2013; are there other applications where you can get bigger in this market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, within wind, pitch, that is their niche. I don't see us at this point &#x2013; again we haven't had it that long, I can't think of anything. I mean, it's a big market because wind's going to continue to grow, and there are three blades on a windmill, and you have to have a pitch control for every blade. So the market's quite large, and the blades &#x2013; and the pitch controls are going from mechanical/pneumatic type of things to electronic. And we are involved in electronic. So from my perspective we have a pretty strong package.</p>
          <p>We'll talk about this on Friday but we're going to be creating a package of sales that's going to be approaching $0.5 billion here in the next five or six years, so. And it's going to be a good market for a while. Is wind the ultimate answer? No, but wind has a niche in the energy needs of the world for quite some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And within Industrial Automation you called out electronic drives as having modest growth. What would have been the end markets that those would have been going into?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, boy, off the top of my head, I would say you're starting to see China pick back up in drives. And therefore you would start seeing elevators. You'd start seeing buildings, and you'd start seeing some industrial. I would say that would be the key place for us to see drives at this point in time. I didn't -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not a market specific. It's very broad applications?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our drives business is very broad. It's not one market. If you look at &#x2013; we're very, very broad. We're also involved in HVAC. So if HVAC recovers you'll see our drive business recover in that space, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a last one, if I could, for Walter. On CapEx, just the year-over-year it looks like that was a decline that &#x2013; was there a reason that came up short or is it &#x2013; what's the plan for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The plan for the year I think we've indicated something between 500 million and 550 million for the year. Initially we wanted to be closer to the 500. Obviously there's a little more strength in the quarter and a little more strength in the year than what we had first thought. So therefore you're going to have slightly higher capital expenditures but still down from what it was a couple of years ago and probably approximately the same level as last year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's nothing huge or big that is worth, you still have some restructuring going on, you have some shared services going on, I mean it's nothing of a huge basis that it's a new plan in a new city or a new country. So nothing major.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple quick ones here. First just on the idea of the sequential pattern moving out, even if we kind of took up the tax rate in Q1, though, what you're saying for the year, if you stay anywhere near the normal convention of Q1 being roughly 20% of the year, you're in the 270 range or better pretty easily. I think it may go Dave if you could, you did make a comment about things flowing back in, that's been an issue for a few companies, is there -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's no 401(k) or merits or other things like that that are coming back on you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've built in our plan, the only thing we have this year &#x2013; I mean we take permanent actions. I mean this &#x2013; I look at things we have to do to change the cost structure of the company and I do not cancel 401(k)s because we're having a tough year. If we were going to go bankrupt I might do something like that but I don't cancel 401(k)s. I mean I think that's a ludicrous thing to do, that's my opinion. But you got a couple of things, we're doubling up this year we had an overlap as we've talked about on our performance share plan so we've got an overlap on that this year so that's going on each quarter so there'll be this quarter the number was around $30 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>38.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$38 million, I would expect that number to be around $38 million. So restructuring is going to kick up. We did not say what I would say a strong start. Walter and I are planning on 150 to $175 million of restructuring. I would say the first quarter disappointed that we didn't get it done, and the &#x2013; I mean we just had a very good mix and the other thing you have going on with you right now we only had Avocent for -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For 20 days, that's a good 20 days to own them and that will start hurting us a little bit as the year progresses. So we have three quarters and we're going to have $0.05 more of dilution. I think our range is still pretty good at this point in time. I wouldn't get carried away. We'll have improved profitability but I wouldn't get carried away like you're trying &#x2013; what you just said there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to be clear maybe Walter just the $22 million of purchase accounting that's in OIOD does that somehow flow through the Network Power margin or that's outside of what we're seeing in the headline margin at Network Power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be in corporate, what it's referring to is the two components. You had a change in accounting rules this year, so merger fees must be expensed when incurred. So we had all the merger fees that we used to capitalize on the balance sheet and amortize or not amortize, they went into goodwill. That was expensed in the first quarter. That was about, say, $8 million. You also had within the first quarter about &#x2013; you write up &#x2013; because of accounting rules &#x2013; you write up inventory to 'fair market value'. And then you amortize it over one inventory turn. Because they turn relatively fast, they shipped a lot out in those 20 days we owned them. We absorbed at corporate another roughly $14 million in that component in inventory write up in the first quarter. That's the 22.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I'll say to you Jeff is that when I ran the Process business, did I ever have a 20% Op margin?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean &#x2013; people &#x2013; we can restructure companies to improve profitability. We told you we thought we could get that business up. It will come back down, I'll say it again because Avocent will be in there now, we'll be starting to amortize the intangibles of Avocent and that will pull the margin down. We will have a nice margin improvement in that segment this year but we work to try to figure out how to improve the businesses and that cycle and those guys have done a great job getting the cost out.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's impressive. And then just finally on Climate in the U.S., I assume that's mostly resi and transport, or is there something else going on?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>There are a couple of things going our way right now. There's the MRO that we didn't see last year is starting to flow in North America which is good news and we are &#x2013; continued to have very good progress with our wireless programs and some of our new innovation so that business could be volatile. We'll see what happens here, but they've had a very good start to the year and they're doing better than I thought they would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of these questions have been asked but the SG&amp;A line was a little higher than I might have thought in terms of percent of sales. You kept a strong gross profit margin but the SG&amp;A was a little higher than I would have thought for Emerson. I mean is there &#x2013; what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you're going to see us continue to mix in some of the businesses that are growing that have higher GP margins and higher SG&amp;As. I mean that's what happens when you shift into some of the higher technology businesses, we have more R&amp;D and stuff like that so &#x2013; and the other thing is Walt has pointed out incentive comp we've got that double up on incentive comp this year too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our stock is doing well and we obviously &#x2013; the incentive comp doubled up this year as we overlapped. The final year, the last one's this year and the new one started at the beginning of the year, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The final question for me the implication from all of the comments around margins and various other businesses is for higher peak margins when we get out a couple of years, I mean what's your thought about that in terms of peak margins on sales and returns on capital, return on equity?</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Just, Dave, could you comment on the suppliers &#x2013; your suppliers right now, and with a pickup in demand, are you seeing any incremental cost or any incremental working capital in terms of supporting the suppliers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing we're seeing right now would be, I would say there's some shortage in the electronic world. You're seeing a pretty good surge in electronic business. You're seeing a lot of new products coming out in the electronic word. The capacity had been taken offline very rapidly and shifting around and some of the changes so that's the only place we see right now from the standpoint and you would see a little bit of expediting type of stuff, some premiums there, but nothing major.</p>
          <p>I mean our overall price/cost structure is in very good shape right now, we're in a good window where our net material inflation will be laid in and the negative downside is coming through and our pricing's fairly stable but we do know what's coming &#x2013; inflation is coming back up as the year progresses and we have to be very careful there. So I don't think there's any big issues right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great and just following up on Process, how do you think pricing plays out, what are you seeing right now and how do you see that progresses from a competitive standpoint for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from the standpoint of our instrumentation and technology base, pricing is very good. Our cost position is obviously very good in those things too because of our best cost actions and getting our capacity in the right places. On the global large projects we're going after because there is fewer of them right now because the market is a little bit slower and down, the pricing is definitely tougher and we would expect our whole systems and solutions profitability be challenged this year as we go through that but at the same time I think the investments we've been making in the other area will more than offset that. So I think we can deal with it and be within that 16 to 16.5% EBIT margin I'm talking about so I feel pretty comfortable there will definitely be aggressive pricing on the large projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what percentage of Process does that really make up, roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the pie chart I want to say it's around 25% of our sales are systems and solutions. The large projects aren't &#x2013; only a part of that because we have other parts of the business which you don't have a lot of bidding going on. But in the large projects you won't even see the pricing come into play for this year's P&amp;L. It will be more like 2011 P&amp;L because those are projects that will be out in the future. So it's not a big issue to me. I'm not trying to &#x2013; it's not a scapegoat for me, It's not an issue that we can't deal, we always deal with it, and we manage it and from my perspective I expect my team to manage it and we do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to ask about Climate. Can you just talk about what you're hearing on the market outlook for next year? I think there's kind of a range of expectations. Some guys are calling for 5% plus, others are calling for high teens, what's your latest and greatest on the U.S. resi market in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're going to be saying it's going to be in the five to 10. We'll talk about that Friday. I think it's five to 10. It's definitely turned. There's a little bit of R-22 but there's not much, inventories were low as you know in the channel. I think this one's turned and there will be a pretty reasonable level of growth this year and just like us, it's hard to call how the shape of that turn as you well know, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, when you look at price/cost in Climate, can you just maybe talk about price/cost throughout the various businesses. Are there some guys that are going to be a little bit red, some guys are going to be a little bit green or is it all around the neutral area for the year in price/cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Price/cost we're pretty neutral and we're in pretty good shape.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Across the board. We put Charlie, focusing on working the pricing here along we have a procurement organization that works the cost issue, Ed, Walter, work extremely hard every month. This is not something that sneaks up on us. We are well in tune with what's going on and we know what's going to happen. We know what's going to happen as the year progresses so I feel very comfortable. And this is &#x2013; it's not an issue for us this year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So just on that last point Dave, you've gone down on record saying that the growth in the next cycle could be materially lower than previous cycles. Are you seeing anything in the last three months or so that's making you maybe think that this cycle could be just like the last one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's worse. I think the last couple months were worse. I just saw &#x2013; I think I just saw an administration, I just saw the President on TV here a second ago, he's on every day. I think the last time I saw his budget, he's talking about running a deficit of 1.6 trillion, talking about running a deficit for the next 10 years, he's talking about taking our debt to over $25 trillion in the United States. I think the UK, Europe is the same as well, Japan. I think the growth rate is going to be lower. We'll talk about it Friday. I haven't seen anything that makes me feel better.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. I just wanted a couple of points of clarification. First on Avocent, the dilution at $0.06, we're at I think 0.10 before, and that's just pulling LANDesk out, or underneath the core Avocent business you've got a little bit more positive view of either synergies or the end markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely on synergies, definitely end markets, there's only so much you could do in the preliminary work relative to what we saw there. Our interest cost, we are a little bit lower because we got to borrow the money at a lower level and the company and the cycle is going well and it's going to improve well and we've got an extra month on it so I think that this underlying business is a little bit better. It had nothing do with LANDesk because we assumed in our plans that we were going to get rid of LANDesk anyway. And so that's why I made the comments I did about the organization, the integration is going well and I feel very good about this acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then on just make sure we get sort of the message synthesized on the improvement, in your base organic growth outlook versus November, it sounds like a little bit from everywhere with an extra helping of Climate is that the short version?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that's a very accurate version.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, the commercial markets, non-res overall, can you calibrate us on your latest view there? Is that an area you're still concerned about from a downside perspective or do you like the trends, in terms of finding a bottom there, particularly in Climate but in other areas of your business as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's forming the bottom right now. I expect &#x2013; I think I'll show the U.S. non-res &#x2013; my non-res forecast on Friday. I still think it will be negative for the year but it's less negative. And so the bottom is forming right now and we'll start coming up and we'll start &#x2013; the wind will turn to our back sometime in mid-2010.</p>

We have a very unique technology and you leverage it with our whole PlantWeb structure, we have a unique offering versus anyone else we compete against. So be it Asia, I was just in the Middle East and there is a huge project going on there that hopefully we're going to win here. There is a lot going on in the United States.

          <p>I can't &#x2013; Mike, let me look over the next couple of days and tell you Friday. My gut tells me right now our orders have been still pretty good in what I refer to the old Westinghouse business and so &#x2013; it's called PWS, Lynne is pointing out to me, one second there, so it has started to weaken here so it's off the backlog, so it has started to weaken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>She's pointing out to me. We're working off backlog right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the margins in process of 15.6. I don't know, Walter maybe if you're able to quantify just how much under absorption is impacting that right now because of the inventory reductions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very difficult in this quarter. We had a long discussion a couple of calls ago on that subject. And rather than get into that level of detail again, the basic issue is not the underlying absorption but just the volume decline and you see what the underlying decline was in the segment. It's not an inventory absorption issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe put differently just as to what's coming up, do you expect inventory levels and underproduction levels to continue in Process or are you now at the inventory levels you're targeting within Process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in Process. Process has continued room to decline and inventories are getting closer. But they still have inventories they have to get down. I would say Industrial Automation continues to have to get inventories down, and so the two late cycle guys still have to get their inventories down, the other guys have got their inventories in great shape and actually are starting to add a little bit of inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact on Industrial, Dave, the alternator customers, what's your sense of their inventory levels globally, because they have been behind the curve generally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're in good shape right now. I think &#x2013; I mean my gut tells me that we're going to start seeing that business turn back on and as we move into the March, April, May timeframe I think you'll see our order pace pick back up because they shut it pretty hard and those inventories are being flushed out of the system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and final question on Climate, R-410A, did I hear you correctly, you said there really wasn't much boost in the quarter so the 7% growth in the U.S. is primarily just the core HVAC business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was some pull-up in R-22, from the standpoint of R-22 is the old refrigerant product that was being made. It was not, I don't think, significant from my scheme of things, you may be talking 20, $25 million. It's extremely hard to measure that in a marketplace as large as we are in North America. It wasn't anywhere close to the level of the pull-up that we saw when we went to the 13 SEER. There was some, and I think the inventories are extremely low out there already. So I still think that as I look at North America the five to 10 is a good number for a growth rate for North America.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. See you Friday.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Eli.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say a couple of follow-ups on that in Climate. The implication of not much pull-up is that the 14.4 margin is sustainable and then getting better in that business for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that in my gut there was a little bit of pull-up, I'll say it again, a little bit of pull-up. It wasn't the whole level of growth and I think the growth for Climate will be in that five to 10% for the year. The profitability of Climate is what we'll talk about on Friday will improve and will be I think in very good levels. And from my perspective the restructuring and the mix is going our way right now and we feel pretty good about where we are relative to climate. I would say the second quarter growth rate might be a tad lower because of it, the pull-up but not significant. It's not going to go from seven to minus five type stuff.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about the same thing for appliances, I mean Whirlpool is out there saying wildly bullish today regarding the outlook. You had big margins in that business too, and the demand looks like it's a little bit stronger than people have expected on the appliance side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I look at our Appliance business, I think the recovery after many years of being down so far will start coming back in the second half of the year. I would expect the Appliance Tool segment to be the next segment that goes positive in the top line. Wouldn't be surprised if that doesn't happen here in the quarter we just started right now. I would not be saying bullish on the Appliance components business. That's not something I would ever use with that phrase -- that business. It's been down for so long so I would expect a recovery. You think about how far housing has come down and how far consumer spending is coming down, but I don't think the consumer is ready to go spend a lot of money. They've got a lot of debt out there and they don't have jobs the last time I looked.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we expect more profitability to hold at these levels is the question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean at the Appliance component segment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>15.4, I think it was.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll be in that range. Could be a tad lower, it's going to be in that range, it's going to be around 15%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my final question any share buyback plans this year at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Minimal. We reviewed that with the board today. I would expect us to probably do as we forecasted, somewhere between 50 and $100 million this year to offset any potential dilution from the standpoint but not a lot this year and depending on what we do in acquisitions that number may change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and of course the dividend will go up at some point, right?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just increased it November for the 53rd year, and we approved it again this quarter so we're working on 53 and a half years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome Eli.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ms. Maxeiner, I show there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What I want to do is first I want to thank everybody. I appreciate everyone joining us today. I'm looking forward to see everyone Friday. As you can tell I'm in pretty good spirits. I'm in a fighting mood. And being somewhat of an aggressive type person as you all know I enjoy it and I'm also very opinionated in the way I think about things.</p>
          <p>One thing I would like to recognize right now is the board decided today and made the decision that Walter will relinquish his CFO title. Walter is 63 now, and Walter will be staying around and working with us as the Vice Chairman, as we promoted him back in I think November to Vice Chairman and Frank Dellaquila, who many of you may know, Frank's been with us quite some time, will become our CFO. That will be announced formally this evening. It will be going out over the wire. Frank is with us today sitting here listening to me and probably listening to the BS I put out there at times. But I want to thank Walter for everything he's done over the years for me. I've known Walt for 30 years and he and I worked a lot together. He's not going away, he's going to be working here but as he points out to me he will not be signing the financial statements no longer. And so Frank and I will be doing that.</p>
          <p>But you'll see Walter on Friday so you may want to go up and give him a high five or a kick or whatever you want to do about him and keep asking him about inventory and absorption. Because he knows a lot about it.</p>
          <p>Again, Walt, thank you very much for everything.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>And Frank is here. Frank, I'm looking forward to working with you and training another CFO about financials.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="17">
        <plist>
