        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dominik. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Also from my side a warm welcome to our six months results conference call. I open my presentation with a quick glance at the highlights on page three of the book.</p>
          <p>Linde's positive business performance in 2010 has continued throughout the first half year of 2011. Our Group sales increased by 11% to &#x20AC;6.8 billion while the gross operating profit was plus 11.7% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion has gained again revenue growth for the first half year.</p>
          <p>As a result of this performance, earnings per share increased by 26.2% to &#x20AC;3.32. Adjusted by the allocation of the purchase price of BOC, the earnings per share increased by 20.3% to &#x20AC;3.79. The operating cash flow continued the growth track and increased by 8.3% to &#x20AC;977 million.</p>
          <p>This performance was driven by a solid growth in all regions. We have seen an ongoing strong growth momentum in the growth markets and growth acceleration in the mature markets. The later was supported by an acceleration of growth in the late-cycle cylinder business as you will see in more detail later on. The operating margin in the Gas Division was at a solid level of 27.3% in the reporting period.</p>
          <p>Based on the performance just outlined and based on the continuation of the current macro economic environment, we are confident to reinforce our outlook of growth in sales and operating profit compared to the record year 2010. We also reconfirm our full commitment to our HPO approach, which will result in &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings for the year 2009 through 2012. Our guidance for 2011 are gross cost savings of around &#x20AC;150 million to &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>To begin with our deep dive, we will have a look at the Group sales on slide four. Gases sales increased by 10.2% to &#x20AC;5.4 billion. On a comparable basis, sales grew by 8.5%, which clearly shows the strong underlying growth momentum. It shall be mentioned that the comparable sales growth in the full year 2010 was at 5.7%.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Engineering Division increased by 12% and was, as expected, above the level of the last year. The order intake was driven in particular by a higher demand for air separation plants, hydrogen, and syngas plants as well as in natural gas plants. The order backlog remains strong with around &#x20AC;3.8 billion and gives a good visibility for the next 18 months.</p>
          <p>The increase in sales was accompanied by an over proportionate growth of the Group operating profit as you will see it now on slide number five. With an increase of 11.7%, the Group operating profit further continues its positive development. The development was again driven by both divisions. The Gases Division contributed with an increase of the operating profit by 10.9% and therewith remained on the double-digit growth track.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, the operating margin stayed with 27.3% on a solid level in the reporting period supported by the implementation of HPO. The Engineering Division again achieved a strong operating profit. We saw an increase of 14.6%. Also, the operating margin in the Engineering Division remained with 11.5% on a very high level. This strong profitability has been driven in particular by the successful execution of a number of individual projects.</p>
          <p>With the sales bridge for our Gases Division on page six, you will gain more insight in our Gases performance. As mentioned earlier, the underlying price and volume effect excluding acquisition for the six months period reached 8.5%. Despite the negative currency impact in the second quarter, the currency effects remained with 1% slightly supportive on a six months basis.</p>
          <p>Please be reminded that in the full year 2010, we had a positive contribution of 7.6%. The sales impact from the pass through of air natural gas prices as well as from consolidation was slightly positive.</p>
          <p>I turn now to slide seven with the overview of operating segment if I start with EMEA. The economy in the EMEA region continued to strengthen in the second quarter of 2011, which lead to growth in sales of 8.1% and 5.9% on a comparative basis in the first six months. The growth was well balanced across all countries within this operating segment. It is worth to draw your attention to the fact that the recovery in the cylinder business in Eastern Europe has further accelerated in the reporting period. But also in Western Europe we have seen further recovery.</p>
          <p>In Sweden, the company's first terminal for LNG was in operation in the second quarter. Later, I will come back to this milestone in our LNG business.</p>
          <p>In Switzerland, we have built a new air separation plant near Basel with a total investment volume of CHF68 million. With the new merchant plant, we will further strengthen our position in the merchant business in France, Switzerland and Germany.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we have announced in the second quarter of 2011, our cooperation with Daimler to make further progress on establishing an infrastructure for fuel-cell vehicles. Together, we will build 20 more hydrogen filling stations in Germany over the next three years, thereby ensuring the supply of hydrogen exclusively from renewable resources.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Asia-Pac, we achieved a high growth rate boosted by continued economic dynamism in Asia and bolstered by our leading position in these markets. In the first six months of 2011, sales grew 17.5%, and on a comparable basis 11.2%. Within the Asia-Pacific operating segment, we achieved the fastest business expansion in the Greater China region. Also, South and East Asia continued the growth rate.</p>
          <p>With our integrated business model, we have benefited in China from ever rising demand in the market for liquefied and cylinder gases. Additionally, the strong growth in the tonnage segment shall be mentioned. Here the development of the business was also driven by the startup of several new plants.</p>
          <p>For example, our joint venture with Sinopec in Chongqing, which has been signed in the middle of the crisis in 2009 as you remember this has started production. We supply industrial gases for the use in production at Sinopec Sichuan Vinylon Works. In Beijing, we supply high purity liquefied gases to BOE Display Technology.</p>
          <p>In the first half year, South and East Asia continued its growth track. In the second quarter in 2011, we had also entered into a long-term on-site agreement with the steel company, Krakatau POSCO in Indonesia. Under the agreement, we will build the largest ASU plant in the country on the Cilegon site. The total investment volume is around &#x20AC;88 million. This investment further strengthens our position in one of the fastest growing economies in South and East Asia.</p>
          <p>I move on to the operating segment Americas. In this operating segment, sales in the first half of 2011 grew 7.1%, and on a comparable basis 11.8%. In North America, the improvement in the general economic situation also resulted in higher demand for industrial gases. We were able to achieve growth in all product areas. Tonnage was the main driver with the start up of a new plant.</p>
          <p>For example, an on-site plant for the steel company AK Steel in Butler, Pennsylvania came on-stream during the reporting period. In the region South America, the economy grew again at a faster rate than in North America. Against this background, we achieved double-digit growth rate here in the first six months of 2011.</p>
          <p>The profitability of all our operating segments is outlined on the next page. Again, I'll start with EMEA. With an increase of 9.5%, the operating profit grew significant. The rigorous implementation of the various productivity improvement and process standardization initiatives under the HPO umbrella made a positive contribution. The margin increased by 40 basis points to 28.6%.</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific, we saw the highest increase in operating profit. The operating profit rose by 15.3%. With a steady profitability we are continuing here too with the implementation of our HPO concept. The operating margin in this segment was 27.6% for the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>For comparisons with the first half of 2010, factors to be taken into account are the pass-through of increased natural gas prices and the upfront investment required for building up the infrastructure and the hiring of new staff in this new dynamic Asian market. On a full-year basis, our expectation is that the region will be on 2010 level for Asia-Pac.</p>
          <p>The segment Americas saw an increase of the operating profit by 8.9% and the margin improvement by 40 basis points to 23%. The positive impact from higher volumes, the one-off effect in the first quarter of 2011 as well as the implementation of HPO contributed to this increase in earnings.</p>
          <p>On slide number nine you can see the comparable growth. As you know, comparable growth excludes currency effect, natural gas price, consolidation effect and all M&amp;A activities. As already highlighted in the beginning, the comparable growth in the first six months was 8.5%.</p>
          <p>The performance of the product areas reflects the overall positive trends in the Gases Division. The healthcare product area again saw steady growth achieving an increase of 5.4% compared to the first half of 2010. With the comparable growth of 11.4%, the highest rate of sales growth was in the tonnage business. This growth is in particular the result of the continuous ramp up of plants, which came on stream in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, as well as the start up of new plants.</p>
          <p>The upward trend accelerated in the merchant business, which consists of bulk and cylinder. Bulk accelerated to 7.8% and cylinder gas sales further accelerated to 8%. On the next slide, we will see the development of the product area over the last 10 quarters.</p>
          <p>With 5.8% comparable growth in the healthcare business in the first quarter of 2011 and 5% in the second quarter, we see a return to the expected organic growth rate of 5% to 6% as already mentioned in our last conference call.</p>
          <p>In the tonnage segment, sales on comparable basis for the first quarter were up 12.1% against the strong quarter in the previous year, and then the second quarter sales rose by 10.7% against an even basis in the previous year's quarter.</p>
          <p>In the bulk business, we have seen a comparable growth of 7.3% in quarter one and an increase of 8.4% in quarter two against the very high base in the last year where we have seen a restocking effect on the side of our gas customers.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we have also already seen growth in the cylinder business. This growth was continued to further accelerate now in the second quarter of this year against an increasingly higher basis in the last year. Let me turn now to the project pipeline in the Gases Division on page 11.</p>
          <p>On this slide you can see the total project amount of plants above &#x20AC;10 million, which will go on stream in the respective year. The total investment among our project pipeline for the years 2009 to 2012 is &#x20AC;2.8 billion of which 70% are allocated to growth markets. In the first six months of this year, we have been able to increase the project pipeline by additionally &#x20AC;150 million. With this addition, we have increased the project pipeline for the year 2012 to a high level of &#x20AC;700 million.</p>
          <p>In respect to the amount of project opportunities this quarter again, we have provided already an indication with the presentation of our full-year results. It's worth mentioning that a large portion of the project opportunity portfolio is, as expected, in the emerging &#x2013; in the growth markets.</p>
          <p>I would like to give you two examples of project opportunities that we have realized year-to-date in the gross market Greater China. First, the Joint Enterprise with Chongqing Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Holding Company where we will build and operate a large hydrogen and syngas plant. In the Chongqing Chemical park in Western China we signed our joint venture with Sinopec from 2014 onwards the new on-site plant will supply products to BASF and CCPHC production plants.</p>
          <p>The contract for this joint enterprise, which has an investment value of around &#x20AC;200 million, was signed in April. The new plant will be supplied by Linde's Engineering Division. This project reinforces Linde's position also in Western China as the leading gases and engineering company.</p>
          <p>Second, the project you see on this slide, yesterday we signed a long-term on-site supply contract with Wanhua in China. Wanhua is already our customer in Ningbo in China and also in Hungary in Kazincbarcika. For this new supply contract, we will build two large gas separation units in Yantai in China with an investment volume of around &#x20AC;130 million. In line with our integrated approach, we have included capacity for the merchant business. The plant is expected to go on stream end of 2013 or early 2014.</p>
          <p>Also in the mega-trend energy and environment, we achieved an important milestone in the first half of 2011, which you will see on the next slide, which is page 12. In May, we have inaugurated our first LNG import terminal in Nyn&#xE4;shamn, which is located 60 kilometers South-East of Stockholm. This is also the first LNG terminal in the Baltics region. Since there is no natural gas pipeline grid on the Swedish East coast, it is an excellent opportunity for us to supply liquefied natural gas as an additional product to our existing industrial gases customer base as well as to new customers in the geographic markets where we traditionally have the high market share.</p>
          <p>The LNG distributed through the terminal is mainly sourced from a plant of Skangassin, Norway. With the replacement of light and heavy fuel oils by LNG, for example, at municipalities and or ferry boats, emissions will be reduced. With this terminal, we support our existing customer base in the progress of their CO2 agendas. This terminal, once again, shows the synergies between our Engineering and our Gases Division.</p>
          <p>The know-how of the Gases Division in sales, operation and distribution of liquefied gases will guarantee the success in our LNG business. Whereas the LNG plant of our LNG supplier Skangass was built by our by Engineering Division as well as our LNG terminal and the distribution technology for the LNG itself.</p>
          <p>This brings me now to The Engineering Division on page 13. The international large scale engineering market continued to stabilize in the first half of 2011, which is also reflected by an increase of the order intake by 19.4% in the first six months of 2011.</p>
          <p>Geographically, the order intake was driven mainly by Asia Pac and in respect to product, in particular, by the order of ASUs, air separation units, also for our Gases Division. Also, the order backlog remains strong with around &#x20AC;3.8 billion. Sales increased by 12% and the operating profit by 14.6%.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, the margin increased to 11.5% in the first half of 2011 due to the very successful project execution of individual projects. Based on this performance and our visibility for the next quarters, our expectation for the margin in the Engineering Division in 2011 is at least 10% operating margin.</p>
          <p>I would also like to draw your attention to our activities in the area of floating LNG. During the reporting period, we entered together with SBM Offshore into a cooperation agreement with the Thai National Oil Company, PTT, to develop a floating natural gas liquefaction plant in the Timor Sea. The project will involve the conversion of natural gas from three gas fields into LNG. If the gas reserves meet expectations, the project will move into the FEED, the front-end engineering and design phase by end of 2011. The final investment decision would be made at the end of next year 2012 and commercial production would be expected to commence at the end of 2016.</p>
          <p>I want to round up my presentation also with a look at our cash flow statement and our refinancing activities on the next two slides. On slide 14, you'll see the cash flow development. Despite the build up of working capital our operating cash flow increased by 8.3%, from &#x20AC;902 million to &#x20AC;977 million. This is mainly due to the significant increase in our operating profit by 11.7%.</p>
          <p>The payments for investments in tangible and intangible assets increased from &#x20AC;503 million to &#x20AC;547 million. For the full year, we expect investments in the Gases Division to be around &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Comparable to the previous year development, we expect a strong ramp-up of investments until the end of this year.</p>
          <p>We have increased our free cash flow before financing by 5.6% to &#x20AC;492 million in the first half year 2011. The majority of the free cash flow before financing was used for the full year dividend payment of around &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>On page 15, you'll find the development of the net debt. The net debt figure decreased in the first six months by &#x20AC;79 million to &#x20AC;5.4 billion. This was positively influenced also by exchange rate effects. The net debt to EBITDA ratio fell from 1.9, end of 2010 to 1.8, end of June 2011.</p>
          <p>Linde is financed on a long-term basis and we continuously optimize the maturity profile. In line with approach, we have repurchase of around &#x20AC;360 million of bonds maturing in 2012 and 2013. We have issued a new &#x20AC;600 million bond under our debt issuance program in May. This new 10-year bond has a fixed interest coupon of 3.875%. The spread was 60 basis points. The proceeds of the successful transaction were primarily used to finance the abovementioned repurchase of bonds.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to our outlook on page 16. On Group level, we expect in 2011 faster growth of sales and operating profit. Furthermore, we reconfirm the target range of &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;900 million gross cost savings of our HPO initiatives in the years 2009 to 2012.</p>
          <p>In the Gases Division, we expect an increase in sales. We aim to achieve an over-proportionate operating profit increase. In Engineering Division, we expect 2011 sales to reach at least 2010 level and, as mentioned, an operating margin of at least 10% in 2011.</p>
          <p>Please let me also highlight our mid-term targets, which we have published together with our Annual Report in March. In 2014, we want to achieve on a Group level an operating profit of at least &#x20AC;4 billion and want to further grow the return on capital employed to 14% or higher. For the Gases Division, the average CapEx-sales ratio target is 13% plus and as you remember plus stands for the large scale energy projects, which can happen within the planning period. As you can imagine, our ambition is to outperform the market with our revenue increase.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize my key observations over the successful first six months on slide 17. In the first half of 2011, we have seen double-digit sales and earnings increase. The comparable growth in Gases accelerated to 8.5%. On the cash flow side, we proved once again the strong and sustainable cash flow generation. The implementation of our HPO is fully on track and the project pipeline in the Gases Division was further increased. In the Engineering Division, we have seen a continuation of the strong project execution.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for 2011 has been reinforced. Beyond this, I would like to highlight that there are strong mega-trends offering structural growth potential in our core businesses. And we have the right setup for each mega-trends: emerging markets, energy and environment as well as healthcare. We already mentioned floating LNG business is an example where we can leverage our engineering expertise in a first step.</p>
          <p>With our latest projects in China and Indonesia, we have seen an acceleration of project wins and an acceleration of decision-making process in the markets. Overall, the synergies resulting from our Engineering and Gases Division, we are very well positioned to embrace growth opportunities in all mega-trends.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. We will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, please. Katherine?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Jean De Watteville. Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Hi, Jean De Watteville from Nomura. Thanks for taking the question. First question on sales guidance on Engineering. You have a strong start of the year, sales plus 12%, backlog is up and yet you haven't changed your guidance for full year sales in Engineering to be flat versus last year. And I'm just &#x2013; I would like to understand whether it's just your lack of visibility and you want to be conservative or we should be aware of some timing of the milestones at present that are completion, which will lead sales in the second half to be down. So just a clarification on that would be useful.</p>
          <p>Second question, it's on margins on Engineering. If I understand correctly, not only the reported operating margin was high but you also ensure the &#x20AC;35 million charge because of a litigation, which means if I adjust for that your margins in Q2 would have been 18%, which is a spectacular figure compared to the history of Linde Engineering.</p>
          <p>I just would like to understand; I mean, you said, it's good execution. I just would like to understand the accounting mechanism that is behind that. Is it just because you delivered plans earlier and you got premium payment and that generates that strong margin? Is it a question of mix or there is a question of phasing of cost recognition versus revenue recognition, an explanation on that volatility would be very useful.</p>
          <p>And then the last question, obviously, going forward you always said &#x2013; those &#x2013; since the crisis, your Engineering margins are on the high side that we should consider that long-term your Engineering margin would be in the region of 8%, which is the historic average. Do you maintain that and something structural in your mix has evolved and therefore you are more optimistic about long-term margins? These are my questions for the time being. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, John for your questions. First of all, on sales in Engineering that was really our conservative attitude as we always have it to communicate to you. I think this is what today expects as the minimum and that is how we phrase that is minimum last year's level.</p>
          <p>On the project execution and the results including taking into account the &#x20AC;35 million payment, it's really the timing wise a perfect solution because in the quarter, we were executing some of the bigger projects, which we gained at the end of the peak of 2008 right before the crisis when we had really overall a very tough inflationary environment and now through a perfect execution with very strong procurement success we gained better momentum. So from an accounting perspective, you only can say it's perfect timing and it's an accident that we can cover that at the same moment in time.</p>
          <p>On the long term margin expectation for Engineering, we continue to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:30) as on the sale side, so we know definitely that the 10% figure for this year, which our expectation, is a bold number from an mid-term perspective we do not want to change today our long term target of 8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you, Georg, for this answer. So just to be very clear, what's your benefit from the raw material price over the contract price assuming that contracts back two or three years ago were higher than what you paid effectively and so you enjoy a clearly favorable spread that going forward that should tail off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is one part of that but, it's also very good execution where you then don't use contingencies, which you have operate in your calculations and the third item is of course you have in some clauses as you said, a positive treatment from the customer if you exceed expectations, all of that is the mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, all of individual projects.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Laurent Favre from Merrill Lynch. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:53) but I am going back to this question on Engineering margin. You have been talking about how exceptional execution and also the favorable pricing versus raw material lag had been having a positive impact on your margin for a few quarters now. Given that you are so confident now and you do have some visibility for I believe two quarters, is there any reduction that you will not have I guess a quarter as exceptional as the second quarter in second half in terms of margin, i.e., that 18% margin?</p>
          <p>And second question is also on merchant, you talked about one merchant, could you talk about the pricing dynamics in a different region especially on EMEA could you talk about the difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Laurent, for your questions. I think on the first one on Engineering, the 10% is very conservative as we do all other communication. So our cost &#x2013; it's a minimum 10% for this year and average was as to what we want to communicate at this stage.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Gases Division, and to your question about the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:20) recovery of cost, which is really impressive when you compare that from a stronger dimension and this is strongly supported by Eastern Europe, but it's also supported all countries in Western Europe, so that's the reasons for the strong recovery. Price rise also supported by pricing in all the regions more or less where we have strong cylinder footprint, we have some strong pricing process because of the uptick in demand.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. JPMorgan. I just had two quick questions on margins. And you gave some explanation with regard to some of the reasons for the margin decline in Asia being the investment in fixed cost. I wonder if you could perhaps expand on that slightly and looking forward over the next 18 to 24 months the extent to which you expect fixed cost there and elsewhere to rise and then perhaps therefore what net benefit you might see from the HPO obviously both of those factors into account.</p>
          <p>And also specifically I suppose a quick question on the margin in the Americas, which also sequentially declined, is that principally just because of the Gas pass-through is more significant in the region? I wondered quickly could you just remind me where we are with the LPG pricing issue that's related to your comparable growth number for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:33) while last year?</p>
          <p>And then on the tonnage growth rates, with regards to startup schedule that you had on one of your slides, should we anticipate the comparable growth within the tonnage business for the remainder of this year to be broadly similar to the second quarter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:00) level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neil, for your questions. A full set of questions. Related to the margin development in Asia I really would like to speak what we see today and that is the expectation for the yearend as we &#x2013; that we can achieve what we have in the previous year,   so there is no 24 months guidance on the margin. Overall, structurally. I only can reconfirm that we do HPO to further improve operating margin. This is the intention of the program and this is driven by structural changes when we talk about harmonization of processes against the footprint of the different geographies.</p>
          <p>When we then talk about the margin in North America, it's mainly here a decline, which is related to a maintenance issue in our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:04) facility in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:09), Mexico. That is main reason why you saw that one.</p>
          <p>And on the tonnage development the continuation of the third and fourth quarter, as I said already in the last quarter, it's a little bit softer for me for the end of the year, that is mainly driven by the question of when do startups moving in, when do we have regular shutdowns, which we always <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:40) there is a very strong continuation of demand. So we saw also in this quarter a strong demand, which is above the expectation. So that is what I would like to say related to the tonnage development.</p>
          <p>And then there was a third one and can you repeat, what the fourth one, can you repeat your fourth one &#x2013; was it LPG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was just that going back a few quarters there was &#x2013; your growth numbers were, I guess, just a negative, you know, I suppose I just call it pass-through of LPG prices and I just wondered where we were for the year-on-year and whether there is any impact of that issue remaining within the comparable growth numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's one of the factors nothing specific which is in way worth to be mentioned. The only issue is growth and we talk about South Pacific that it has an impact in the first half year through the natural disasters last which was impacting of the performance of South Pacific a little bit negatively, that is overall true for South Pacific. And you do see a strong winter in South Pacific in these days which is good for the especially <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:08) business, which we have in Australia.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. Two questions please. First of all, I'm wondering if you've seen any evidence of destocking from your customers perhaps reduced your already strong volumes in the second quarter? And then second, could one of you give us some estimates for the Gases project pipeline like for 2013, I recognize that the new project work is on the edge of that I was wondering if you could perhaps describe what 2013 is looking like so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, the Gas business from an overall perspective is a late cycle business. Whenever you have the effects we will have a hit late in the cycle from the perspective we have not seen impact out of de-stocking activities from the customer end. Related to the pipeline of 2013, I think we take that for the next communication for our overall across this last recent successes we are very confident and we have already achieved a number, which would be &#x2013; where we would be in a position to communicate it. But at that point in time I think we would like to go one quarter and then surprise you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Norbert Barth. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Norbert Barth, WestLB. First question although regarding a little bit looking generally forward and chemical companies already mentioned a little bit of slow down especially some as mentioned before de-stocking effect in China and so on. If you have any &#x2013; have you any feeling there is to come a little bit where to be worried in second part in general about that do you see any signs of that?</p>
          <p>Second question regarding cylinder business, you said the recovery was really strong and I confirm that are you thinking now we have reached all these for a level comparing especially with the size before the crisis or is there still some upside on the cylinder recovery? And third question perhaps regarding Engineering, this week there was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:50) the reporting this big project with Saudi Aramco in the next years do you expect some business from that or do you have already contact with them, if you elaborate a little bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Norbert, right? I will hand over your last question regarding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:14) project. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is a big announcement by Dow and Aramco is definitely not a surprise. This project has been in gestation now for more than a year. And yes, I think the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:31) are also are both engaged in the bidding space there are two big packages first and tendered this year actually in the third quarter. Of course it will take some time for the customer to evaluate these bid packages and we expect awards in the Q1 of next year. We have one position <mark type="ph" /> and we're working very hard on it. (47:57)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we come back to your other questions, I think on the cylinder recovery level that's a very good question I answered that or I gave an indication already last quarter. We believe, of course, this is already a high level, but nevertheless if you now want to hear downside I cannot tell you because I don't know. The recovery is definitely better than we expected it, but we believe that the 7% level definitely is something that should continue from our visibility, but we were very positive and, as I said earlier, I mean in significant type of customer base has increased there all the backlog, which is normally for good for us.</p>
          <p>So we were suffering in Eastern Europe, as an example, significantly because all the shipyards were closing down and they took awhile until they loading their order backlog. Now the order backlog is filled and we are executing again for our customers. So I don't see it really negative and that is also the situation for your first question about China. I mean you know that we are really normally super conservative and probably also when we talk about on the chemical footprint, our footprint is also more in steel, when you want to have it waiting steel activities are still very strong in China. So we don't see what you were asking for now and I cannot argue that we will see it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Peter Clark, SocGen. Good afternoon and thank you. In terms of the bulk business in Europe, I mean you obviously certainly it is still going very strongly. Just wondering what's happening with the bulk particularly in terms of pricing because the estimation saw the pricing inflation coming through on the cylinders but they were making it clear that the bulk business was under some pressure. I was just wondering what's happening in your bulk pricing?</p>
          <p>And then the second thing is on the CapEx guidance you have given us for the full year, some of your peers were kind enough to sort of <mark type="ph" /> give us an indication based on their backlogs (50:25) what they expect to happen going into next year with another substantial jump. I think Praxair were pointing at a 20% increase into 2012 given sort of the projects they are looking at, just wondering if that sort of profile will be similar to what you're seeing at the moment, judging by your backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter for the questions. The first one on the bulk business I think, yes, a little bit more positive on the bulk side, also when it comes to pricing. Of course, it's a little bit weaker than it is in cylinder, but as you remember last year in UK, for example, we had then a decrease in energy price and therefore the decrease in sales. Now we have an increase, so we also see here a stronger pass-through, which is also related to our bulk business because more than 50% of our contracts are fixed. So, also we have here some support, so, overall, it's little bit more stressful, but it looks positive what we see here today.</p>
          <p>When we talk about the pipeline 2012 related to CapEx and investments, I think we are not prepared to give a guidance, but, definitely as I mentioned it in the closing remarks, we see an acceleration of projects and we have gained strong momentum from our project opportunity pipeline and if this all would come through, then definitely that would be the pattern that we see a further increase in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just ask one quick follow up? EMAE was flattish on a year-on-year growth Q2 on Q1. Just wondering Europe seems to be ahead. It is coming up was this drag again the World Cup effect and et cetera. Is that right or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are talking about South Africa now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am talking about the underlying Gases growth Q2 on Q1 very similar in EMAE I am just wondering if therefore South Africa was dragging because you sort of alluded to the fact Europe looks to be ahead and accelerating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think all really happened in trend, but this case is more positive than it was in the previous years and the Continental Northern Europe activity gained momentum because of the recovery of the economy and also Africa is from a volume perspective of course stronger, when we talk about sales. Inflation is nevertheless an issue, but also pricing looks quite strong.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Peter Mackey, please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks very much. It's Peter Mackey at Morgan Stanley. Four questions if I can, one just a very quick clarification and going back into the debate about Engineering margins. Given your indication about this strong underlying margin in Q2 being the execution of individual projects, should we sensibly assume that Q3 and Q4 margins are in line with your full year guidance sort of 10% or 11%? That's question one.</p>
          <p>Question two, Praxair talked about strong pricing power in the Chinese emerging markets, so I wonder if you could sort of talk about your experience in those markets in China? And thirdly, I just wonder, I believe the ADNOC joint venture is now just starting to go onstream and ramp up, and I'm assuming that is &#x2013; that's a joint venture, and that's why we can see the softening as you indicated in the growth rate in tonnage on a fully consolidated basis. Can you tell us how long it's going to take ADNOC to get up to your full capacity in your view?</p>
          <p>And then finally, going back to Engineering, you announced some sort of link up with Bechtel in the U.S. ethylene market for an ethylene project. Should we see that as a sort of change in your view in competitiveness in that area and if so, are you likely to sort of pursue that or expand that joint venture outside the U.S. or is it just &#x2013; just sort of incremental improvement. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Peter, I think, again Dr. Belloni can start with answering your questions on the Engineering business and on ADNOC and then Bechtel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the JV with Bechtel actually is a <mark type="ph" /> recertification (55:28) of something, which we did already 10 years ago, that had a focus both in America and the Middle East. This time just America. This JV is a response to the increased activity in North America, U.S., Canada, for petrochemical investments due to the shale gas <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:54) position improvement. So there is no intention to work outside of that territory and of course, Bechtel is a possible EPC contractor in North America, so it takes a lot of industrial logic to join, we know each other and that's why we have revived this collaboration with them. We have big expectations. We have worked already on three to four for shale gas <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:27) based crackers in North America.</p>
          <p>On ADNOC JV, we've just positions in the two plants, but no of course we are in the process of ramping up those. Don't forget the application is a particular one. It is for enhanced recovery of condensate from spills, oil spills, and, therefore, there is a ramp up also on the customer side, and you don't see dilutions because this is, as you say, it's a non-consolidated business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the two other questions. I think on Engineering I said <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:00), Peter. It's clear. On China merchant, as I just said in my speech, we have seen really a very strong merchant market overall in China and of course we see then an okay pricing related to that and of course its driven by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:30) which are sky rocketing here. But we have seen also very good pricing in all the other regions. So it's really then if you go the product level our own <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:44) see explicit demand and then explicit pricing move on so we can confirm this is what Praxair was probably talking about.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a follow-up question from the line of Jean De Watteville. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jean De Watteville, again. And I just want a clarification, you talked about softness in tonnage in on-site at the end of the year. When we look at what you reported last year Q4, 2010 was actually pretty weak because you were impacted by shut downs on your customer side. So, I would have expected actually Q3 to be a little better because the base effect is less challenging. So can you clarify what's the impact here?</p>
          <p>And second question, I'm wondering, I think you shared that with us in the past, can you go through your cylinder business region by region and tell us where is your volume compared to the pre-crises peak? I think that would be very useful for us to understand where we are in the recovery cycle.</p>
          <p>And then the third question is on your &#x20AC;4 billion EBITDA in joint ventures guidance for 2014. I just wanted a clarification, can you go there with 13% CapEx from sales and no bolt-on acquisition or you need to get some &#x2013; an appropriate mix of some bolt-on acquisitions to achieve this target? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jean, you are looking for the negative effects in that one year. I think tonnage is important I want to make this &#x2013; it's not clear when you talk about volume related portion, which was very positive in the first half year that you ultimately say this continues, so this is my point. So it's more cautionary ultimately. It could happen that Q3 will be the strongest when you compare Q4 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:50) advantage then the last year and it remain a bit stronger, so more or less there was the answer in a polite description. I think we will be in the range, it could be slightly below 10%, but it could be also at 10% depending on the volume question, which was very strong one in the first half. So that's the answer on that one.</p>
          <p>On the cylinder business, I think overall this is a question that we see still in Western Europe and cylinder business which is below the peak of the year 2008. I think that we will remain on the level of growing, but we will not peak in 2008. It's also a question of inflation from the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:00:38) perspective <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:00:41) continuous growth, which we saw on our &#x2013; in the quarters.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe is coming back now, very strong and it was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:00:54) very significant, but it's also not back to the pre-crisis level when we take all together. When we talk about the market we also have storms in the business like South Pacific, that's why I said earlier, we were suffering from a margin perspective because of the floods in the first half year, we hope that this will go away in the second half year and till now South Pacific was not so much impacted by the crisis.</p>
          <p>So, it's a region, which is not comparable. So, overall, let's say, I will say- we are not above 90% when we talk about volumes. We brought this below 90% and we just guided 80% &#x2013; 90% we were talking about 80% the last time roughly but we didn't talk about 90 that is a goal I would give to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:01:50) integration.</p>

          <p>When we talk about the &#x20AC;4 billion target, it's &#x20AC;4 billion target as you know, which we defined as easy to remember 2014 the past &#x20AC;4 billion EBITDA including our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:02:02) activity. So, obviously, a big energy project normally take any way longer than 24 months from an executional perspective, so definitely not fully included because we would have to give &#x2013; win that very, very soon when we talk about these big schemes and if this really is in joint ventures or not it's a separate traction, so from that perspective in our plan not included.</p>
          <p>When you talk about acquisitions, of course it is favorable to have some smaller acquisitions included to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:02:48) basis, so it was more an organically better planned, and of course we plan always on small execution of M&amp;A activities especially when we talk about healthcare <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:03:00) acquisition then we would describe it as for the &#x20AC;4 billion let's say it that way.</p>

          <p>If the, I think, even if there is always <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:03:11). It depends also on the currency development 2014, now that's clear let's not be certain. No one knows where the rest of the currencies are moving when we talk about 2014. The target of 13, when we communicated at the beginning of...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically, 13% CapEx <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:03:31) which is your normalized CapEx and sales guidance lead you &#x20AC;4 billion plus in 2014 at any given point?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are talking about inventory basis, joint venture activities for mega projects. I think we do see net of this overall in uptake of activities and we talk about investments and, definitely I think we are achieving revenue &#x2013; as we look into our opportunity, within all the business, we also can exceed 13%, so that would be organic, that would be favorable to the growth, but it's not all mega, it's all the number of projects. I mean you see the size of project when you talk about Chongqing, their best project 200 plus, then you now see the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:04:24) project &#x20AC;110 million, then you see the Indonesian project closer to &#x20AC;100 million, so these are all projects, which are gaining momentum and which are supported as we talk about 13%. The guidance was 13, but I would say from today's momentum, we are a little above the13% CapEx sales ratio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. So, to grow to 14%, you will be above 13% CapEx on sales ratio. I'm just trying to add the revised value of guidance, your target of &#x20AC;4 billion to the CapEx on sales you will have to invest to achieve that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think when you asked that question then 13% is the right answer. That was related to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:05:05) that is the point, so the 13% is fixed to <mark type="ph" /> the floor (01:05:09).</p>

          <p>Hello, J&#xFC;rgen Reck from Macquarie Securities. Two questions, if I may. First question regarding comparable growth rate in the second quarter, according to my current calculation should be around 8.9%. Can you elaborate a little bit on the volume and price component within this 8.9%?</p>
          <p>And second question, regarding depreciation in the Gases Division, according to my calculation depreciation including PPA has risen from &#x20AC;245 million in the third quarter to around about &#x20AC;258 million in the second quarter, can you give us flavor regarding the run rate in the second half of this year? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very detailed question on the depreciation. Are you talking about PPA, in fact I think one in which we have to consider is that we have included in the last quarter now an effect out of the harmonization of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:06:26), you want to go with same trend. In markets over a longer period of time can be decided that this will be depreciated over a period of around 12 years, I think about 10. So that is increasing a little bit the PPA compared to previous year, I don't know if you were mentioning that. Overall, I think, of course, we will see a further increase of depreciation because of the stronger investment profile.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>According to my calculation, depreciation excluding PPA could have gone up in from Q1 to Q2, from &#x20AC;245 million in Q1 to &#x20AC;258 million in second quarter and &#x2013; might this be the run rate also for the second half of this year, that's my question?</p>

          <p>Sorry, but of course, I think the ramp-up is not unreasonable especially when you take into consideration that we will have ramp of CapEx also until the end of the year.

          <p>Good afternoon. Annett Weber from BHF-Bank. Coming back on to bulk growth rates I am still struggling with the 8% growth rate in Q2 compared to the very ambitious base of 10% in Q2 2010, can you probably provide us with the breakdown of the volume and pricing components of this 8.4% in this quarter and possibly also with regard to the Q2 2010 number? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I always ask myself <mark type="ph" /> what is (01:08:33) with all this stuff, and you are asking me this question. The main driver from the bulk is definitely here when we talk about volume it's Continental Northern Europe, which has a strong growth overall, so that was very positive from a volume perspective. The fastest growing region was of course Greater China region, there is no surprise, so here we have seen double digit growth and I think that is followed by the usual suspect, so these are the emerging market. South America was also growing strong. And Africa, as I mentioned was growing strong and then followed by some good development and especially at the end also South Pacific were a little bit better in the end of the second quarter. UK was let's say okay, but volume wise not grew too strong, price wise a little bit stronger.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And given the comparison &#x2013; comparable rate in the next two quarters will be much easier for you, is that obviously even higher growth rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think what you have to understand this &#x2013; what's happened in quarter two 2010 and in fact in quarter two 2010 was this destocking impact from an overall perspective and the 9.9% look a little bit artificially higher say it that way, plus I would say the stress from an comparison quarter-by-quarter will not change significantly only because previous quarter look like &#x2013; I think that's something, which was really related to the special effect in quarter two 2010, which was related to destocking.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>MainFirst <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:10:45) good afternoon, gentlemen. I still have three questions. Firstly, I would like to come back to the cylinder and bulk volume development in Europe. Your competitor product made some strange corrections &#x2013; strange statements on the competition here, saying that they have lost volumes to European competitors. You seem to have quite nice volume development in Q2 exactly in this region. My question is, is the risk that going into Q3, there will be more competition in Europe and there might be some downside volumes especially in this region. Maybe you could just give us a flavor what was going on here in terms of competition.</p>
          <p>The second question is providing an elsewhere product change that especially in Europe prices were not fully recovering increasing input costs. My question here would be, do you still have price initiatives outstanding, which are being implemented having in effect in Q3? And there was a question before on the seasonality in margins in Gases, I would like to come back to that. Over the last three years, you have a slightly negative margin development in Q3, which was often explained by the low margins from the heating gas LPG trading margins in the southern hemisphere. My question here is do you expect decreasing margins in Q3 because of the increased LPG sales in this quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, a very detailed type of question, I think it's very difficult to comment on competitor statements, I was not participating on it, of course read the script. But I cannot really comment on that, I mean I only can comment on our performance and our performance is driven by customer demand, and, of course, there is competition and some are more successful, the others are not so successful and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:13:17), so from that perspective I wouldn't see that there is any extraordinary or specific situation in the current market situation in quarter two or in quarter three or quarter four, I mean, this is the ongoing situation. We were talking about since the long period. So from that perspective, really nothing special and of course when you then talk about the positioning them in some areas, it would be one player is stronger than the other that goes hand in hand with wins and losses, so I wouldn't make an issue of that one.</p>
          <p>If the quarter is too hard, I think I understand that quarter three LPG volumes, I don't know the temperature in South Pacific at the current movement, I don't know how August and September will really be, these are the strong months depending on the temperatures, then people are using LPG, that is the KPI really here. So, overall I would say, if LPG is growing up, the end margins are some plants going down, also depending on the input cost development and these days, I wouldn't expect an extraordinary effect in Q3 and I do not want to forecast that. So I have no plan for that one. I take it as it comes and overall from a Group perspective, it's not that significant?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Still Merrill Lynch. Just one question actually regarding the executive board. I think this week there was the announcement that Kent Masters was joining Foster Wheeler as CEO. There was a reshuffling of the responsibilities as you referenced for the segments with in Gases. So, I am just wondering, if you could tell us what's going to be the plan, i.e., re- shuffle again responsibilities or maybe appoint somebody else that's really on succession plan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is very simple, no reshuffling. We were reshuffling because of the advantage of the time zones and the acceleration of our growth plan in the respective areas that we are more in one time horizon, so there is no change. And, of course, there will be a successor for Kent who we really can congratulate that he became CEO of such a great company like Foster Wheeler. Thank you.</p>
