          <p>Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session during today's call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Erin, and welcome to the Kinder Morgan Conference Call. As usual, we'll be talking about Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which is one of the largest MLPs in America, and about Kinder Morgan, Inc., which I'll refer to as KMI, which is the general partner of KMP.</p>
          <p>Also, as usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I'll give an overview of the results and accomplishments for 2011 and for the fourth quarter and an outlook for 2012, and Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer, will give you the financial details for 2011. Then we'll open up for questions and Park Shaper, our President; Steve Kean; and I will be available to answer any and all questions that you might have.</p>
          <p>Let me just start with KMI. It's a simple and very positive story. Back when we did the IPO, we anticipated that we would have cash available to pay dividends for the year 2011 of $820 million and that we would use that to pay $1.16 in dividends. Point of fact, on a paid basis, we had $835 million in cash available for dividends and we paid $1.18. Now if you move to a declared basis, we are declaring for this quarter $0.31, but that means that actually our declared basis for 2011, we will have paid $1.20. And that $0.31 is obviously a $0.01 increase since last quarter and is up 7% from the dividend that we declared &#x2013; that we anticipated when we did the IPO back in February of 2011.</p>
          <p>As usual, the results at KMI are driven by KMP. And we have already previously stated that for 2012, on a declared basis, we expect KMI to pay dividends &#x2013; to declare dividends of $1.35 a share. That's a 13% increase over the 2011 declared dividend of $1.20.</p>
          <p>And note that while we previously have presented dividends on a paid basis, from now forward they're going to be on a declared basis. If you look at it on a paid basis, our dividend, anticipated dividend for 2012 would be $1.30, which is 12% above the 2011 budgeted amount. If that doesn't confuse you, I don't know what will. But at any rate, very positive story and exceeded what we promised you in the IPO about 10 months ago or 11 months ago.</p>
          <p>So, obviously, let me turn now to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which is the driving force in the Kinder Morgan story. As you know, about 98% to 99% of the cash generated at KMI comes as a result of distributions that come up from KMP.</p>
          <p>And at KMP really the story has been, is, always will be about just two things. The first thing is the current cash that we generate, which determines the current dividends; and secondly, it's about the future growth of the operations, which leads to increased cash flow in future years and therefore increased dividends. So, I think it's the right way to look at 2011 is to look at it through those two perspectives, and if you do that, I think anyway you cut it 2011 was a very good year. 2012 looks like it's going to be an even better year.</p>
          <p>Let me start from the vantage point of the current performance, and Kim will give you a lot more details, but we will have distributed $4.61 for 2011 at KMP. That's up almost 5% from the $4.40 we distributed for 2010. All five of our business segments produced earnings before DD&amp;A in excess of what they produced in 2010, and our total segment earnings before DD&amp;A was up 10% for the full year of 2011 when compared to full-year 2010.</p>
          <p>In terms of distributable cash flow before certain items, we were up 16% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. And if you look at it on a per unit basis, distributable cash flow per unit, which we think is the best way to judge our performance, we were at $4.68 for 2011 versus $4.43 in 2010; that's an increase of 5.6%. Another way of looking at it, of course, markets are what they are, but we had very good returns for our unitholders and shareholders in 2011.</p>
          <p>KMP produced an all-in return of 29%; KMR 26%; and KMI 11% on an annualized basis. So that's looking at it from a current performance perspective. If you look at it from a future growth perspective, during 2011 we put $2.6 billion into expansion, JVs, and acquisitions. And this is the lifeblood for growing the company in the future. I think we have tremendous opportunities for future growth in our set of businesses and that that opportunity is really pretty diverse in nature. It relates to the continued emergence of natural gas shale plays together with their associated liquids production. It relates to growth in CO2 demand in the Permian Basin; I'll talk about that later.</p>
          <p>We've seen an acceleration of that demand over the last several quarters. It relates to the increasing demand for export coal in our Terminals group, and it further mandates for the use of renewable fuels in both our Terminals and Products group. It also results from the opportunity to serve customers who want to export refined products, primarily diesel on the Gulf Coast, from U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast, and to import gasoline into the northeastern United States, as we've had a closure of several refineries in that area as all of you know. In fact, I would say that this is the most diverse set of opportunities at any time in Kinder Morgan's 15-year history.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk about each business segment, and, again, looking at it through these twin perspectives of both present performance and future growth. In our Products Pipeline segment, for full-year 2011 we had good results on our Cochin pipeline and on Plantation and on our West Coast terminals. This was offset somewhat by lower volumes and revenues on our Pacific system and on Central Florida and our CALNEV pipelines.</p>
          <p>To put that in perspective, for the fourth quarter refined product volumes were down 2.5% compared to fourth quarter of 2010. For the full-year 2011, the volumes were relatively flat to 2010. We always like to compare that with the EIA numbers on a national basis, and those EIA numbers showed a decline of 1.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.3% for the full year.</p>
          <p>So getting to the point, our pipelines were a little worse than the EIA average in the fourth quarter, a little bit better for the full year. If you look at the full year on our pipelines and break it out by commodity, diesel was actually up 0.4%; jet fuel was up 4.1%, pretty positive year; and gasoline was off 1.4%.</p>
          <p>Now still in the Products segment, if you look ahead through the perspective of future growth, we've got a number of important projects in this segment. One of the most important is our new Eagle Ford crude and condensate line, which will connect the Eagle Ford Shale play with the Houston Ship Channel. That's about a $220 million project. We're under construction; we expect to be in service by July of this year. Connected to that project, we have now announced a $130 million project to build a condensate processing facility, or a splitter, at our Galena Park facility on the Houston Ship Channel, which will be connected to this new Eagle Ford condensate line.</p>
          <p>We already have 25,000 barrels per day of capacity being supported by contract with a major oil customer. The operation is expandable to 100,000 barrels. We're actually now filing for the environmental permits at the 50,000 barrel level, which we think is very doable from a demand standpoint. And that would turn this $130 million project into roughly a $160 million project, and ultimately, as I said, the whole thing is expandable to 100,000 barrels per day. We expect this project to be in service around June of 2014.</p>
          <p>We also have a new pipeline also costing about $220 million and that's the Parkway Pipeline. This is 136 miles of 16-inch pipe, and it will run from Norco, Louisiana up to Collins, Mississippi to connect to a storage hub on our Plantation system. We do own 50% of that; Valero owns the other 50%. The initial capacity is 110,000 barrels per day, and again, it's also expandable, in this case up to 200,000 barrels per day, and we expect to be in service in mid-2013.</p>
          <p>Another project that hasn't received a lot of attention, but which is imminent, is our Cochin-EP project. We're spending about $30 million to upgrade existing pipelines in order to facilitate the transportation of EP mix from Conway to Sarnia, Ontario, and this is providing service to our customer NOVA. We expect to be in service on April 1 of this year.</p>
          <p>And then we have two projects on the West Coast that are fairly significant. One is our Carson 7 project; that's a $77 million project building seven new tanks at our Carson, California, terminal. That's on schedule and budget. We've brought the first two tanks online; the remaining five tanks will come online late in 2012 and early 2013. And then our final project is our Travis Air Force Base storage and pipeline project, a little short of $50 million in terms of CapEx, and we expect to finish that project this quarter, the first quarter of 2012. So that's it on our Products Pipeline segment.</p>
          <p>In our Natural Gas Pipeline segment, of course, 2011 was a good year for us. Our transportation volumes were up 13%. That's largely a result of our Fayetteville Express project coming online and strong volumes from the Eagle Ford on our Texas intrastates. Our sales volumes were up 1% for the year. We had strong performance as a result of the KinderHawk and EagleHawk acquisitions, and as a result of FEP and Eagle Ford Gathering and the processing spreads on our Casper-Douglas facility in Wyoming. And we also had increased volumes on Red Cedar. Those positive results were offset in part by weaker performance on our Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission and Trailblazer systems.</p>
          <p>Now when you look to the future of natural gas &#x2013; and let me just say that all the projects I'm talking about today and the all the numbers we're talking about today do not account for any impact from the El Paso acquisition at all. And obviously, that's very relevant to the natural gas segment, because when we complete the El Paso acquisition, that segment will increase dramatically in size. But without any impact of El Paso and looking to the future at our natural gas facilities, we have a number of important projects.</p>
          <p>First of all, our Eagle Ford Gathering joint venture with Copano continues to perform very well. We're signing new contracts. We're increasing deliveries as the Eagle Ford production ramps up. Including our 50% equity interest in this Eagle Ford Gathering joint venture and our 25% interest in EagleHawk Field Services, but excluding the crude and condensate line I referred to earlier, this segment, our Natural Gas segment, has committed approximately $400 million to expansion projects in the Eagle Ford alone. In the Haynesville, on our gathering system there, we signed a new third-party contract and we've added new interconnects and trading services. We ended the year averaging about 1 Bcf a day as we anticipated we would for 2011.</p>
          <p>The third important project during the quarter in the year was we closed on an acquisition of SouthTex Treaters for $155 million on November 30. SouthTex designs and manufactures natural gas treating plants that remove both CO2 and H2S from the gas system. That's now part of our Kinder Morgan Treating operations, and that will allow us to offer our customers the option of owning or leasing this equipment. We think that broadens our earnings capability and broadens the service we can provide to our customers.</p>
          <p>Turning to our CO2 operations for 2011, we had a record year. We were right on plan for earnings before DD&amp;A and slightly above plan if you look at it on a DCF basis. Now we benefited from higher oil and NGL prices; they ran about $6 higher than we had in our plan. And we also benefited from growing production at the Katz Field and from some pretty successful efforts to manage and reduce our costs across all of our operations. And that management effort that reduced costs more than offset an overall decline in SACROC and Yates production. We also set an annual production record, just barely, in our CO2 source fields in southwest Colorado.</p>
          <p>Now the major disappointment was that our cash volumes did not live up to what we predicted; that's our new field, which we began flooding in early 2011. Put that in perspective for you, for the full-year 2011 we averaged about 500 barrels a day; for the fourth quarter we averaged about 1,000 barrels a day. And so far this quarter, we're running at about 1,300 barrels per day. So what we believe is that our response was delayed by about 8 months to 12 months beyond what we thought we would get when we originally projected our 2011 budget.</p>
          <p>But it is now behaving on a ramped-up basis as we thought; it's just coming on later. And when you come to our investor conference later this month, you'll see that we're projecting around 2,300 barrels, just a little over 2,300 barrels of production on average per day for 2012. So we intend to see or expect to see a nice ramp-up during 2012.</p>
          <p>The big opportunity, though, on CO2 for the future is satisfying what's really turning out to be very strong demand from our customers in the Permian Basin for more CO2. On previous calls, I've talked about an opportunity size that would involve adding 200 million cubic feet to 300 million cubic feet a day of production from the source fields and would involve investing, I've said, $1 billion to $1.3 billion of additional capital at good returns. We now think the opportunity's probably a little bigger than that. It may be as much as 400 million cubic feet to 600 million cubic feet a day of additional need for CO2 in the Permian Basin. That would translate an opportunity into opportunities to spend anywhere from $1 billion on the low side of this to $2 billion on the upside in accessing more production from our source fields, and then moving that to market in the Permian Basin.</p>
          <p>Now as we always say at Kinder Morgan, we're only going to do this if we are backed &#x2013; if that demand is backed by solid contracts from credit-worthy companies over extended periods of time. And right now that's looking very good. Tim Bradley will have more to say about that at our investor conference next week, but today our board did approve part, an important first step, in generating this additional CO2. We approved a $255 million project in our Doe Canyon field in southwest Colorado, which will take production there up from 105 million cubic feet a day, today, to 170 million cubic feet a day. That $255 million will be spent over the next several years and will involve both compression and additional wells. So a lot of opportunity here for real growth at very attractive returns backed by long-term contracts.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Terminals operation, in 2011 we continued to generate strong earnings before DD&amp;A and DCF. I think it's important to note that about 70% of that growth, or about $40 million, was attributable to organic sources as opposed to acquisitions. And I know when we talk about, gee, we think we've got 2%, maybe a little better, in growth from organic sources in Kinder Morgan, people wonder where does that come from? 2% off of 2011 numbers would be $60 million to $70 million, and here we had $40 million of growth in the Terminals group alone from organic sources.</p>
          <p>Now where did that growth come from? We had strong growth in coal volumes handled. We've been talking about that export coal story now for several quarters. We were up 33% in terms of coal volumes handled in the fourth quarter. More importantly, for the full year we were up 20% versus 2010. And our Pier IX facility in Newport News, Virginia, set a record. In that one terminal we handled almost 13 million tons of coal. Our steel volumes were also positive for the year, up 18% in the fourth quarter, up 10% for the year. On the liquids Terminal side, we had good performance at both our enormous Pasadena terminal here on the Houston Ship Channel and at our Carteret facility in New York Harbor.</p>
          <p>We also handled 16 million barrels of ethanol in the fourth quarter. That was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our ethanol volumes were up 5%. If you look at Kinder Morgan including the Products segment, we still are handling about 30% of all the ethanol used in the United States.</p>
          <p>Now in our Terminals group, we had an unusually large number of new commercial contracts signed, which will lead over the next few years to some pretty important new projects. Our capital budget there for expansion CapEx is over $400 million for 2012. And in fact we have, based on commercial contracts signed specifically in 2011, we now have budgeted over $850 million in CapEx in the Terminals projects over the next couple of years, 2012 and 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 to be specific, on projects that were locked in pursuant to contracts that were done during 2011. So coming back to this perspective of looking at what did we accomplish from a future growth standpoint, Terminals had a tremendous year in 2011.</p>
          <p>First of all, the BOSTCO project was probably the largest single project that we entered into. In December, we purchased TransMontaigne's 50% interest, so we now own 90% &#x2013; 98% &#x2013; of this $430 million project on the Houston Ship Channel. And now let me remind you that, as we've previously said and TransMontaigne has previously said, we have made that purchase. They do have certain rights to repurchase for a one-year period, so between now and January of next year. But right now we own 98% of the project. This first phase of that project will involve 52 storage tanks with a capacity of 6.6 million barrels for handling residual fuel, distillates, and other black oils.</p>
          <p>We have terminal service contracts, or LOIs, for all of that capacity. Eventually, we see this terminal, because of its location and the draft adjacent to this terminal, we see this as an important cog in the ability of Houston Ship Channel refiners to export refined products, given the advantageous location and depth of water. The construction on this project started in December of 2011.</p>
          <p>Another major project that we announced during 2011 was the Edmonton South Terminal. This is roughly a $210 million project in Edmonton, Alberta. It involves building 2.4 million barrels of capacity for storage of crude oil and condensate. It's at our Trans Mountain terminal, has access right into our Trans Mountain pipeline that runs across the Rockies and down into Vancouver in Washington State. We'll start construction on this in early this year, and we expect to have it in service late in 2013.</p>
          <p>Now this is another project that we anticipate will be scaled up over the next few years. We could eventually, on that site, build up to 6 million barrels in two additional phases. What this does for our customers, who are primarily oil sands producers and marketers, is it gives them additional optionality to use the oil sands production and that production expands, and as crude oil pricing and differentials continue to remain extremely volatile, as they have over the past several months.</p>
          <p>We also will continue to expand our capacity for export coal at both IMT on the Mississippi River, in Houston, and eventually on &#x2013; at some of our terminals on the East Coast. So a lot of opportunities for upside in our Terminals group over the next few years.</p>
          <p>At Kinder Morgan Canada, we had a good year in 2011 as refiners in Washington State wanted access to cheap oil sands production, and the oil sands producers wanted to move more barrels over our dock in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
          <p>We expect that demand growth to continue. For that reason we're in the midst of an open season on an expansion of Trans Mountain. At the customers' request we extended that open season until mid-February, and again, we will proceed only if we have adequate binding commitments from customers to go forward. But we do see this as a tremendous opportunity in the future.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we think we had a very good 2011. We built this set of tremendous opportunities for 2012 and beyond. We expect to declare $4.98 in distribution for 2012 and to have excess coverage on top of that of about $70 million. In addition, I'll remind you that we said before the El Paso merger was announced that we thought for the next several years we can grow KMP at 5%, which would lead to 10% growth at KMI. Post El Paso, we believe that we can grow at 7% at KMP and about 12% at KMI.</p>
          <p>But it's important to note that all the numbers I've given you, again, are pre El Paso, and we well exceeded the 5% and 10% growth numbers that we talked about previously for growth at KMP and KMI, respectively. So we have good direct strong cash flow, very good growth opportunities for the future, and with that I'll turn it over to Kim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rich. If you turn to the first page of numbers, it's titled the Consolidated Statement of Income. I'm not going to spend much time on this page, but just looking down, about 80% down the page, there's declared distribution per unit. We're declaring a distribution today at KMP of $1.16 per unit; that compares to $1.13 last year, and that's up $0.03 quarter-to-quarter or about 3% growth. For the year, we have declared $4.61. That compares to 2010 of $4.40; that's $0.21 per unit increase or almost a 5% increase. The $4.61 is also $0.01 above our 2011 budget.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn to the second page of numbers called the Contribution by Business Segments. Looking four lines from the bottom, the DCF before certain items, for the fourth quarter 2011, $425 million of DCF before certain items. That compares to 2010 of $366 million; that's $59 million increase or about 16%. For the year, $1.525 billion; that compares to $1.36 billion in 2010. That's a $165 million increase or about 12% versus our budget, the $1.525 billion. We are up about $11 million versus our budget.</p>
          <p>If you look at what that translates into in terms of DCF per unit, that's a $1.27 per unit, which is about 8.5% growth versus last year for the quarter; and for the year, $4.68 per unit, which is growth of almost 6%.</p>
          <p>Our coverage, that reports an excess coverage for the quarter of about $37 million; for the year about $21 million; and versus our budget, we're about $17 million below our budget with respect to coverage. But let me just give you an overall view versus our budget. The segments ended up largely in line with their budgets. Interest was favorable, about a little over $25 million. Sustaining CapEx was positive versus our budget, about $13 million. The total DCF available for distribution to our limited partners and our general partner were up about $38 million versus our budget.</p>
          <p>Our GP, we paid our GP about $27 million more than we budgeted; that was a function of incremental units that we issued during the year, about $5 million primarily associated with KinderHawk and the $0.01 that we increased the distribution. So that leaves us with LP DCF versus our budget, about $11 million above our budget. Then we also paid our limited partners about $26 million more, again, because we increased the distribution above our budget and also because we had incremental units outstanding. And so that leaves us at about $16 million of lower coverage than what we budgeted.</p>
          <p>Now, if you adjust for a Canadian tax refund that we expected to receive in 2011, that we did not receive in 2011, but we have received notification that we will receive in 2012 and is not included in our 2012 budget that we'll go through next week. You add back that $6 million and you adjust for the incremental $0.01 that was not in our budget, that's another roughly $6 million and you're within a few million dollars of our budget on coverage.</p>
          <p>With that, looking back up at that the lines above the DCF before certain items, if you look at book cash taxes net, $7.9 million in the quarter, $5 million last year, up $2.9 million. For the year, $27 million versus $26 million last year, so up about $1 million. For the year, versus our budget, down about $10.9 million, but I think the key here is and what's important is really the cash taxes, because all we're doing is adding back the book taxes. So the book taxes have no impact, and then subtracting out the cash taxes. Absent the Canadian tax refund, the cash taxes were on budget for the year.</p>
          <p>Express, Endeavor, and Eagle Ford contributions, these are adjustments that we make for investments that we have where the cash that we received doesn't track net income plus JV DD&amp;A less our share of sustaining CapEx; $7 million in the quarter, $2 million last year, up $5 million. For the 12 months, $15 million versus $5 million last year, so up $10 million and up about $8 million over our budget. We received incremental distributions from all three of these investments versus our budget.</p>
          <p>Looking at sustaining CapEx, $72 million for the quarter, $58 million in the fourth quarter last year; that's about $14 million increase in sustaining CapEx. $212 million for the year; that compares to $179 million last year, so up about $33 million versus last year, but actually about $13 million positive versus our budget. The $13 million versus our budget really breaks down into two pieces; $5 million is really lower capitalized overhead. Basically our capitalized overhead rate is based on our total spending, our total expansion and sustaining capital.</p>
          <p>Our expansion capital increased significantly so that rate came down, but our sustaining capital was flat, so it's &#x2013; a lot of it is a function of capitalized overhead versus any changes in the segment spending. $8 million is associated with the segment spending, and that's really at CO2. About half of that, we didn't have to do a power plant &#x2013; overhaul of the turbines at a power plant in CO2. And the other half is some non-safety, non-integrity deferral.</p>
          <p>Now looking up at the segments and seeing what drove the growth, Products Pipeline, $161 million in the quarter versus $171 million last year, or about $10 million down this year. That compares to $694 million for the full year versus $688 million last year; that's up about $7 million. Products came in about $36 million lower than its budget, or about 5%. And if you cut through it all, it is primarily SFPP. We had some ups and downs on the different assets within the segment. And SFPP was largely associated with three things: with the FERC rate cases and the lower rates that we implemented there; with a adverse decision with respect to UPR right-of-way costs, so increased right-of-way costs; and then lower volumes than what we budgeted.</p>
          <p>Natural Gas, in the fourth quarter, $290 million versus $243 million a year ago; that's up $47 million or 19%. For the 12 months, $951 million versus $836 million a year ago, up $115 million or 14%. Natural Gas was about 5% above its budget, and that is largely a function of the KinderHawk acquisition. Actually, the KinderHawk acquisition contributed more than what they were &#x2013; above their budget. And then we had some offsets primarily with some higher integrity spending on the Texas intrastates and lower fuel charges or collections in KMI and Trailblazer. Upstream was also up nicely for the year from higher processing margins and higher gathering volumes.</p>
          <p>CO2 in the quarter, $281 million versus $242 million a year ago, up $39 million or 16%. For the year, $1.093 billion; that compares to $960 million a year ago, or up $133 million or 14%. CO2 was really on its budget. In reality, it was slightly below its budget on earnings before DD&amp;A, and slightly above its budget on a DCF basis. That primarily was driven by &#x2013; SACROC was above its budget, as a result of higher price and lower OpEx, and that was offset somewhat by lower volumes than what we budgeted. And then Katz and Eastern Shelf had lower volumes than what we budgeted; Yates and S&amp;T were on their budgets.</p>
          <p>Terminals segment, $184 million in the third quarter &#x2013; I mean the fourth quarter &#x2013; $173 million a year ago, up $12 million or 7%. For the year, $701 million versus $647 million a year ago, up $55 million or 8%. Terminals was about 2% below its budget. That was a function of higher fuel costs, timing on acquisitions versus our budget. Some of the acquisitions that we did happened later in the year than what we had originally thought. It is lower transload volumes, primarily ethanol in our materials handling business, primarily as it lost some market share to unit trains. And then we had a steel mill that we served that was down for an extended period of time.</p>
          <p>Kinder Morgan Canada, for the quarter, $51 million versus $49 million a year ago, up $2 million or 4%. For the year, $199 million versus $182 million a year ago, up 17% &#x2013; or 9%. For the year, Kinder Morgan Canada was about 3% above its budget, and that was a function of FX, the implementation of a new toll settlement, and then higher domestic volumes on our Express-Platte Pipeline.</p>
          <p>Dropping down about halfway down the page to the G&amp;A, which you'll see below the segment earnings contribution, G&amp;A for the quarter, $86 million versus $87 million a year ago, so about $1 million decrease. For the year, $388 million versus $375 million a year ago, so up about $13 million versus a year ago. The full-year number is up versus last year primarily due to higher benefits, but it is right on top of our budget.</p>
          <p>Interest expense, which is the next line, $137 million in the quarter, $132 million a year ago. That is increased expense of about $5 million year-to-year &#x2013; quarter-to-quarter. For the year, it's up about $25 million, and versus our budget, as I mentioned earlier, it's about $28 million above our budget.</p>
          <p>Now dropping down from the certain items, there're a couple that I'll mention to you, most of them are relatively small this quarter. Total certain items in the quarter about $12.5 million. $3.8 million is associated with some higher environmental reserves that we took during the quarter. $5.2 million is associated with mark-to-market on our CO2 hedges. Again, as you can see in the footnote down there, we continued to recognize those in the quarter as we settle those hedges and don't mark them to market in the fourth &#x2013; during the &#x2013; prior to that time up in the segment.</p>
          <p>Insurance deductable, casualty losses, and reimbursement, that's associated with a small fire that we had on our Total petcoke facility. For the year, certain items $491 million. Three, the largest certain items, $82 million associated with allocated non-cash compensation. This is a $100 million pool that was paid by our shareholders, but GAAP requires us to allocate these costs to KMP. We've talked about this in a prior quarter.</p>
          <p>KMP has not and will not pay anything associated with this funds program. Rate case reserves, $235 million, and we've discussed those in prior quarters. And the KinderHawk mark-to-market &#x2013; or sorry &#x2013; asset write-off of $167 million that we've also discussed in prior quarters.</p>
          <p>So with that I will move to the balance sheet. Just two items to note on the balance sheet. You can see, on cash and cash equivalents, were up about $280 million from year-end 2010 to year-end 2011. A reasonable portion of that is associated with dock premiums that we receive on our Canadian Westridge Dock, and this is shippers on our Trans Mountain pipelines who pay a premium in order to get access to that dock. And then we actually refund those amounts over a three- to five-year timeframe.</p>
          <p>The other thing I'll point out is on notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt. The $2.138 billion at 12/31 of 2011 includes $500 million of 9% put bond. The timeframe with respect to the bondholder's right to put those to us has expired, and so only $50,000 worth of these bonds were put. In our K, we will move that, the balance of that, to long-term.</p>
          <p>Looking down at the debt balance, $12.4 billion at the end of the year; that compares to about $11.4 billion at the end of last year. So $979 million increase for the year and about $153 million increase in the quarter. For the quarter, we had uses of a little over $600 million; that was about $290 million in CapEx, about $250 million in acquisitions. The larger acquisitions were SouthTex for $155 million; Watco for $50 million; and then our purchase of TransMontaigne's interest in the BOSTCO terminal, $30 million. Contributions to equity investments was about $75 million primarily associated with our joint venture in the Eagle Ford with Copano, and with our 25% interest in the Eagle Ford with BHP.</p>
          <p>Equity issuance for the quarter was about &#x2013; over $250 million &#x2013; and that was about $145 million through our KMP at-the-market program, and then $109 million on our KMR dividend. Working capital was a little bit over $200 million during the quarter. The largest piece of it during the quarter is really accrued interests. We typically pay &#x2013; most of our interest payments come in the first and the third quarter. The dock premiums, as I mentioned, we receive a fair amount of dock premiums during the fourth quarter. AP and AR was a source of cash of $30 million. We also had excess coverage, as I mentioned earlier, of $37 million, and then we used &#x2013; uses offsetting that was gas and storage and cash book overdrafts.</p>
          <p>For the year, the change in debt, $979 million. Uses were about $2.76 billion, with about $987 million in CapEx, $1 billion to $1.244 billion in acquisitions. In addition to the ones I mentioned in the quarter, for the year we also had the KinderHawk acquisition for $912 million. $371 million in contributions to equity investments, the largest one was the contribution to FEP.</p>
          <p>We also paid off $77 million &#x2013; or assumed $77 million of incremental debt when we brought KinderHawk on to our balance sheet. We paid $81 million in CPUC and FERC settlement. We issued about $1.42 billion in equity between KMP and KMR, and then we settled interest rate slots, which were a source of cash of $73 million. We sold a small terminal in the Netherlands, which was the source of $16 million. And then working capital and other items were a source of cash of $271 million.</p>
          <p>For the year, the sources of working capital, primarily the dock premiums, coverage. We also had distributions from equity investments in excess of what we reflect in our DCF, and then we add a loan to Plantation, which they repaid.</p>
          <p>That results in a debt to EBITDA for the end of the year of 3.6 times. On the third quarter call, I said that we would end the year at about 3.7 times. We did a little bit better than that given the incremental equity that we issued in November and December that we hadn't contemplated at the end of the third quarter, and then also some of the cash that we received associated with the dock premiums. So that's KMP.</p>
          <p>Looking at KMI, the first page of numbers in your package, you'll see us including the interim capital transaction, and that relates to a one-time item that we had in 2010. And so we provide this because this is what's going to appear in the 10-K. But we don't think this is a real way to look at our business. And we'd be happy to; it shows 28% growth for the year. But we think the more appropriate way to look at our business is to adjust for that one-time item in 2010. And so looking at the second page, which excludes the ICT, is what we're going to focus on.</p>
          <p>Now with respect to the numbers presented on this page, these are presented on a paid basis. And so what we're looking at for the fourth quarter is what KMI received from KMP in the fourth quarter based on the dividend that KMP declared for the third quarter of last year. So, we are looking at &#x2013; that's the cash generated, and then we're comparing that to the dividend that KMI paid during the fourth quarter, which would be $0.30, and that is in contrast to the dividend that we're declaring today of $0.31.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will switch to a paid basis in order to be consistent with &#x2013; I mean, to declared basis, sorry &#x2013; in order to be consistent with KMP. But looking at cash available to pay dividends, $243 million in the quarter versus $233 million a year ago, up $20 million (sic) [$10 million] or 9%. For the year, $835 million versus $763 million a year ago, or up $72 million or 9%. The $835 million was the cash available. We also paid out $835 million, which is the $1.18 that was already paid. The $1.18, as Rich mentioned earlier, compares to our budget of $1.16, and so we exceeded our budget by $0.02.</p>
          <p>Today what we're declaring is $0.31 a share. So another reason that we are making the switch from paid basis to declared basis is so that people can see &#x2013; so that we can present for people the numbers that we are basing the dividend that we are declaring on. And so just to switch 2011 to a declared basis, cash available to pay dividends if you presented it on a declared basis would be $866 million. Dividends paid, and that includes obviously the $0.31 &#x2013; or dividends declared &#x2013; using the $0.31 <mark type="audio gap" /> (47:54) of excess coverage for the year looking at 2011 on a declared basis and given the $0.31 that we are declaring today.</p>
          <p>Now looking at what drove the growth in the year, if you look up about four lines from the top of the page, total KMP distributions to us, $351 million in the quarter versus $315 million last year, $36 million increase or 11%. For the year, $1.349 billion versus $1.202 billion a year ago, $148 million increase or 12% increase. That $1.349 billion is about $19 million over our budget primarily driven by the incremental amount that we received on the GP interest as a function of more units outstanding versus our budget, and the $0.01 increase in the distribution.</p>
          <p>NGPL, the next line item, NGPL cash available for distribution to us, you'll see that we switched this from the prior quarter when we previously showed dividends paid to us. Given that we own only 20% of this investment, we can't control what they declare or what they dividend out, but we do &#x2013; but the cash is there. But what we're presenting is net income, or actually pre-tax income plus DD&amp;A less cash taxes, less sustaining CapEx. So we are presenting the cash that is actually generated by vicinity given that we can't control the dividends. $10.6 million in the quarter versus zero last year, up $10.6 million for the year; $30.3 million versus $34.7 million a year ago, down $4.4 million and down about $3 million versus our budget. And that's just a function of lower transport margin and LPF on NGPL.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expense, basically up $3.5 million versus the fourth quarter last year, up $12.8 million versus a year ago, and within about $2 million of our budget. Interest expense, $5.6 million in the quarter versus $5 million a year ago, basically flat, up slightly, which it has to do with slightly higher balance. For the year, up $8.3 million and slightly positive versus our budget. Cash taxes, $22.7 million higher in the quarter versus a year ago, and $49.7 million higher for the year right on top of our budget. They're higher versus a year ago due to the higher income.</p>
          <p>So with that for KMI, I will turn to the balance sheet. Looking at KMI's debt on the balance sheet, $3.236 billion as of December 31, 2011 versus $3.195 billion at December 31, 2010; so up about $41 million for the year, up $44 million for the quarter. And let me just go through a quick reconciliation on that. For the quarter, we had $243 million available to the pay dividends. We paid dividends of $212 million. We also had a use of cash to pay El Paso financing fees of $56 million, and then we had some items associated with NGPL that were about $18 million. The metric that we show versus the distributions that we actually received were about $9 million lower, and then NGPL actually reimbursed us some G&amp;A in early January versus by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>For the year, a $41 million increase in debt, $835 million in cash available to pay dividends, $771 million in dividends paid. $64 million went out on a $100 million pool. When you add the $771 million of the dividends and the $64 million, that's $835 million. So that's the $835 million that we refer to as paying in dividend, because our shareholders actually paid for the $100 million bonus pool.</p>
          <p>The MBO settlement was a positive $29 million after tax. KMR, which we elected not to sell at the end of the year, you need to subtract $46 million because we include that benefit in our metric. $56 million went out on the El Paso financing fee. We got about $69 million in tax refunds that were associated with one-time items. And then the $18 million that I mentioned on NGPL were the same for the year as they were in the quarter. That leaves us at 2.4 times on debt to distributions received, so a very strong balance sheet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good. Look forward to seeing everyone next week and asking more questions there, but two questions, if I could. One, I don't know if Kim touched on it, but just the recs tax settlement, was wondering if that was material for the quarter or if that's more just of an ongoing thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about $8 million in the quarter, and yes, it will have an impact on our 2012 &#x2013; a favorable impact on our 2012 budget as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Kim. And then not to parse earnings press releases too much, but just in terms of volumes at KinderHawk and what they're doing sequentially, I guess, maybe you can talk a little bit about your outlook for volumes there, what they've been doing lately? And maybe also where they stand relative to contractual minimum commitments? And then just maybe also how material that third-party commitment you got at KinderHawk could prove to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the third-party commitment is important in the terms of third-party volumes. Obviously still the great bulk of the volumes are coming from now BHP. We averaged around a Bcf a day for the year 2011 in our budget, and we'll discuss more this next week in our budget for this coming year in 2012. Tom, we expect about...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The average about 1.2, and that's based on the latest intelligence we have from both our third-party customers and BHP. So that kind of gives you an idea of what we did in 2011 and what we expect to do in 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Little bit on BOSTCO. Could you talk a little about the potential scale of that terminal and also the competitive dynamics in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, if you're familiar with the Ship Channel, of course, this is an absolutely prime location in terms of how far down the channel it is and the draft there. So we think it has inherent competitive advantages, and I think that the real proof of that is that we've signed either terminal service agreements or we have LOIs for actually all of that capacity and a little more. And we think eventually we will be able to expand that with a second dock and with additional tankage.</p>
          <p>And again, additionally &#x2013; eventually we think that will connect back to our Galena Park and Pasadena terminals, and we will actually be able to move a variety of products down there. Again, I think I've said this before, but &#x2013; I know I said it earlier today, but we believe that in the Gulf Coast, you have significant additional U.S. refining capacity being built.</p>
          <p>There will not be a demand for all that production, and we think that a good bit of it, particularly diesel, will actually get exported, particularly to South America. And if you believe that, Houston and Port Arthur and Beaumont are ideal areas, the structures and facility to handle export volumes, and that's essentially what we're doing.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we've done some major expansions on our Carteret facility, all subject to long-term contracts in New York Harbor. A lot of that capacity is being utilized by our customers who are actually importing primarily gasoline into the U.S. Northeast to replace volumes that are no longer there because refineries in the Northeast were closed.</p>
          <p>So long term, we think is BOSTCO could become a much larger facility. I don't think Jeff's in the room, but we have a lot of excess acreage here that allows us to build out significant additional storage beyond the 6.6 million barrels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the average contract life, can you talk a little bit about that, what you expect at BOSTCO? Will it be in line with your other liquids terminals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so. Maybe even just a hair longer, but yeah, in line with our other liquids terminals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a final question from me, can you talk a little bit more about the rail opportunities you see in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, the rail opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for Watco and other -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We made another preferred investment with Watco, which was part of our original arrangement with them. And we think there are going to be additional opportunities. Now clearly the fact that that pipeline capacity is being built out of Cushing down to the Gulf Coast, I think makes rail opportunities out of Cushing more difficult to put together on any kind of termed-up basis than was the case before that reversal was announced. But we continue to look at opportunities, and again, indirectly through our preferred investment in this short-line railroad Watco, we're getting some of that exposure. But we don't have anything further to say about new opportunities right now.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple quick questions for you. And on the CO2 side of the business, I realize Tim's going to go through this next week. But just from a big picture perspective, aside from the CapEx that you outlined regarding the transport portion of CO2, from a production standpoint, how are you guys thinking about the balance of maintenance versus growth CapEx for 2012?</p>
          <p>And what I'm really trying to get a rough idea of is your returns on each incremental dollar that's invested to grow 2012 production, minus what you can do on the cost cutting line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, you want to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understand the question right, what's the tradeoff between growing our distributable cash flow through investments versus cost cutting, and I think that profound leverage is on the investment side. With that investment, our production will ultimately decline, and growing that production or really stabilizing that production is a much bigger impact than what we can save in cutting costs. Is that what you were aiming at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's exactly it, Tim. Is it possible at this point to just put some rough numbers around it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Well, we're going to go over in some detail next week at the conference. I guess I can cover the cost cutting as well as the investment program at that point in time, and probably answer more detailed questions then.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. Last question from me, Rich, just kind of again a big picture question. As it relates to the Bakken within Product Pipes, how do you guys think about moving Bakken barrels either on Cochin or of course within KM Canada, possibly converting a portion of Platte and accessing that point at Guernsey to take barrels down to Wood River?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue to look at both those options. There's clearly a need for more transportation out of the Bakken, and of course our domestic volumes on Platte are consistently running full. So we're looking at a couple of different things there. As you know, we've talked about converting part of KMI, what we call the Pony line, back to oil .</p>
          <p>We've had some good interest in that, not prepared yet to say all the T's are crossed and I's are dotted. And so there's a lot of different opportunities on Cochin or doing something by converting Pony, I think, would be the two most likely ways we would take advantage of it. But clearly there's demand there, and it's a question of what's the best way to solve it, and that's what we're looking at right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm doing well, thanks. A couple questions on the Product Pipeline side of things. The condensate processing project that you guys have announced, just trying to understand maybe potential for growth in that project. Is the market opportunity there really to basically find the best end use for condensate coming out of the Eagle Ford, given that high-complexity refineries on the Gulf Coast maybe can't effectively use all of that Eagle Ford crude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's a good summation, and of course that's why the nature of the commitment &#x2013; in this case we already have 25,000 barrels a day committed &#x2013; is very important, because that commitment will basically determine how we run it in terms of what products we produce.</p>
          <p>As we've said further, there're just all kinds of opportunities there. One that several people have talked about, which is a possibility. It sounds sort of strange from a geographic location standpoint, but the possibility that some of this could be converted into diluent. And given the fact that there's not as much demand on some of these pipelines going from north to south, to move it up, for example, explore. We can move it into Cochin or Southern Lights or someplace else and get it all the way back to Canada.</p>
          <p>And there are actually now Canadian producers down here looking at that kind of opportunity and a lot of other opportunities. But you're right, I mean, the idea will be to maximize the diversity of utilization of that condensate coming in from the Eagle Ford. So we think it's an idea whose time has come, and again, actually applying this month for our environmental permits. And we're doing it at 50,000 barrels per day because we think that's probably where we'll end up.</p>
          <p>And then we'll have the expandability up to 200,000 barrels a day. I think it's kind of unlikely we'll be at that point at the start up, but we'll have fairly cheap or fairly reasonable expandability, up to 100,000 barrels a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And when you &#x2013; when that processing facility converts Eagle Ford crude into those very light end-products, do those products that the processing facility will be creating, are those products subject to any kind of export restrictions the way that crude oil is off the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's condensate that we're splitting and not crude. And my understanding is for the most part, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And another question on the Product Pipeline side of things. The Cochin project to deliver ethane/propane mix to Sarnia, any comments just on what the type of volumes that Sarnia can take down of that EP mix?</p>
          <p>And that EP, I guess, kind of looking forward, is there opportunities for growth as maybe some heavy oil crackers in Sarnia convert to an EP feedstock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's a little beyond my knowledge base. We have  a cont, as we like to do. We let somebody else take those important issues. But we have a contract with NOVA. I think it's a three-year contract for a certain amount of volumes, and that's up to them. And clearly, as everybody knows, some of that demand at Sarnia is, a large portion of it is eventually going to be serviced from the Marcellus. But for the next three years anyway, NOVA is interested in moving volumes up there, and so we'll just see what happens after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And those are going to be Marcellus-sourced EP volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these are Conway-sourced volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Conway. And just one final question, you mentioned turning the Pony line on KMI to potentially to oil service. And I guess as you think towards the future and think towards Kinder &#x2013; KMI pro forma for the El Paso acquisition, is there any potential to move -hypothetically if a pipeline were to be &#x2013; I guess if you were to be asked by regulatory agencies to divest of a pipeline, do you think it would be something that could be a possibility, just to convert a gas pipeline to crude oil or some other kind of hydrocarbon service in order to avoid antitrust issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That'd just be pure speculation at this point. We're just engaged with the FTC now looking at alternatives, so it'd be premature to answer that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
