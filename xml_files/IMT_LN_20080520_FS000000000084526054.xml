          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. To those of you here in the room, and everyone watching via our webcast, welcome to our 2008 interim results presentation. I'm joined by Gareth Davis, our Chief Executive, Bob Dyrbus, our Finance Director and as always several other key Imperial executives.</p>
          <p>Before I go into the detail of the results, I'd just like to draw your attention to this disclaimer, and I'll leave you to read it at your leisure.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start with an overview of the first half of 2008 where we delivered a strong operational and financial performance. Our standalone Imperial operations made good progress, gaining share in many markets. The results were enhanced by Commonwealth Brands with gains in both cigarette and fine cut tobacco as well as just over two months contribution from Altadis following the successful completion of the acquisition on January the 25th.</p>
          <p>This was a major highlight of the first half and I am pleased to say that Altadis also had a positive start to the year with progress across all three divisions. These performances delivered growth in cigarette volumes of 34% to 121 billion, and 38% growth in adjusted profit from operations to 918 million pounds.</p>
          <p>As the acquisition is currently wholly debt funded there has been a significant increase in the first half interest charge. The combination of these factors has resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings per share of 18% to 72.4 pence. And, I am pleased to announce an interim dividend of 24 pence up 14%.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to look at the first half results in detail, I would like to briefly update you on the progress that we've made since our acquisition of Altadis. Starting with asset disposals; in April, we completed the sale of Altadis' stake in Aldeasa to its joint venture partner Autogrill for 275 million euros, representing an enterprise value, including Imperial's share of Aldeasa's net debt, of 355 million euros. We also agreed the sale of a portfolio of fine cut and pipe tobacco brands to Philip Morris International; however we will continue to manufacture these brands on their behalf. And, by the end of March we had realized proceeds of 332 million euros from the ongoing programme of non-core asset disposals.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Logista, our tender offer for the minority shares ended on May 6th. Acceptances were received by holders of 37.3% of Logista's total issued share capital, increasing our holding to over 96% and enabling us to implement the available squeeze-out mechanism to acquire the remaining shares on June 9th. Shortly after this, Logista will be automatically delisted. The total cash consideration will be 922 million euros.</p>
          <p>As we have said from the outset Logista is a successful, profitable and highly cash generative company and it will continue to be run as an independent business. The successful management of the complex integration process has been a key focus and it will continue to be a priority in the coming months. Gareth will go into more detail on our progress to date in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Today we have announced a 1 for 2 rights issue to raise 4.9 billion pounds, net of expenses, to part fund the Altadis acquisition. The Enterprise Value was 11.3 billion pounds on January 25, 2008, the day we completed the deal, and the remaining 6.4 billion pounds will be funded by existing debt facilities.</p>
          <p>The subscription price of 14 pounds 75 pence per share represents a 33.6% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price which has been adjusted for the interim dividend.</p>
          <p>It also represents a 43.1 % discount to last night's closing share price of 26 pounds 18 pence per share, which has also been adjusted. The issue is fully underwritten and is sized to allow us to maintain our investment grade credit rating.</p>
          <p>Shareholders on the register on May 15 will be eligible to subscribe for their rights in the equity issue, and we expect to publish the equity prospectus later today enabling nil paid dealings to commence tomorrow. The rights issue will close at 11 a.m. on June 11. And the new shares will rank pari passu with existing ordinary shares, except that they will not be eligible for the interim dividend. We will therefore accelerate our ex-dividend date to June 4, 2008.</p>
          <p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen. And I'll now hand you over to Bob who'll take you through some the financials in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Iain, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Before moving on to the detail of the results, I'd like to start with a quick reminder of our new definition of revenue measures. We will continue to report net revenue for our tobacco business. However, we recognize that economic sales, as used by Altadis historically, or as we would refer to them, distribution fees, is a more appropriate measure for the logistics business so we will use that going forward. Using different definitions for the different divisions means that we will report segmental operating margins.</p>
          <p>Imperial's net revenue was up 14 % to 1.7 billion pounds reflecting organic volume combined, combined with Commonwealth's contribution. The Altadis net revenue and distribution fees relate to the post acquisition period. We have also redefined our adjusted measures to exclude the one-off acquisition accounting adjustments which we flagged at our March trading update and have included further details on these as an Appendix. We believe that this will ensure that our results remain easily understood and comparable with previous periods.</p>
          <p>Our new top level segmentation splits operations between Tobacco and Logistics to reflect how we manage the business. Tobacco adjusted profit from operations grew strongly, up 34% reflecting growth from Imperial operations, our enhanced business in the USA and Altadis. And, of course Logistics represents the results of that business segment since acquisition.</p>
          <p>The eliminations figure is the manufacturing margin recognized in the Tobacco segment where these goods have moved to Logistics but have not yet been shipped out of the Group to customers. The combined result is an increase in adjusted profit from operations of 38% to 918 million pounds. The main differences between adjusted and reported profit from operations include the 117 million pounds acquisition accounting adjustments I mentioned earlier, amortization of acquired intangibles of 96 million pounds as well as fair value losses on derivative financial instruments of 141 million.</p>
          <p>Clearly, financing both the Altadis and Commonwealth acquisitions has resulted in a significant increase in the interest charge in the first half. Despite this, and after tax charged at an effective rate of 26.5% adjusted earnings per share grew by 18% to 72.4 pence.</p>
          <p>For this reporting period, we have analysed adjusted profit from operations between the two businesses. Imperial delivered adjusted profit from operations of 778 million pounds up 17%, whilst Altadis contributed 140 million pounds in the 2 months and 5 trading days since acquisition.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at how Imperial has performed by region. In the U.K., net revenue was down to 429 million pounds mainly reflecting the initial impact of public smoking bans on volumes as well as the related effects on our vending operations. However, the adjusted profit from operations was up 2% to 285 million pounds benefiting from price increases and reduced costs.</p>
          <p>And in Germany net revenue was 261 million pounds up 2% with adjusted profit from operations up 3% to 120 million pounds. Results reflect the strengthening euro exchange rate, share gains in both cigarette and fine cut tobacco and some specific price increases. These factors more than offset market volume declines which were in part impacted by the introduction of increased public smoking restrictions. In the rest of Western Europe net revenue was up 7% to 307 million pounds with adjusted profit from operations up 8% to 153 million pounds.</p>
          <p>Profits increased as a result of euro exchange rate benefits, growth in our cigarette market shares and pricing improvements but were impacted by lower travel retail sales.</p>
          <p>In the USA our results were significantly enhanced by the contribution from Commonwealth. Net revenue was 108 million pounds with adjusted profit from operations at 54 million pounds. These results reflect market share gains in both cigarette and fine cut tobacco, and a price increase in October which offset cigarette market volume declines.</p>
          <p>And finally to the Rest of the World, net revenue grew strongly to 620 million pounds; up 18% and adjusted profit from operations grew 34 % to 166 million pounds. This excellent performance was driven by increased cigarette volumes and share gains in a number of markets.</p>
          <p>Our half year adjusted profit from operations grew by 31 million pounds as a result of the strengthening euro exchange rate offset only slightly by U.S. Dollar weakness. The main regions which gained were Germany up 11 million and Rest of Western Europe up by 16 million pounds.</p>
          <p>There was an offsetting negative impact of 6 million pounds on our interest charge. The overall effect of exchange movements was to increase our adjusted earnings per share by 2.9 pence; our adjusted earnings per share growth excluding forex would have been just over 13%.</p>
          <p>Since completion, all three Altadis divisions have made good progress and contributed an additional 140 million pounds of adjusted profit from operations to our Group's results. We have not included prior year comparative numbers as we believe that these would misleading given that we have only consolidated Altadis' results for 2 months and 5 trading days and we also had to align their accounting policies to our own.</p>
          <p>However, my comments relate to Altadis' operational trends since acquisition. In cigarette, performance reflects market share gains as well as the improving pricing environment particularly in Spain. Within cigar; we performed well in the USA, despite challenging market conditions, and in Spain net revenues improved. In Logistics, overall results were in line with our expectations. They were slightly down year-on-year, mainly as a result of a lower Spanish price increase in the first quarter of calendar 2008 compared to 2007, partly offset by the transport division which continued to perform well.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the cash generation for the enlarged group. Comparing the cash from operating activities after net CapEx, but before interest and tax, to our adjusted profit from operations, we show a conversion rate of 21%. Imperial's cash generation levels were similar to last year as a result of an increase in normal stock and debtor levels relating to the timing of duty and price increases.</p>
          <p>The nature of Altadis' Logistics business results in major changes in cash levels during the course of any given month and the range between peaks and troughs can be significant within this timescale. On the 25th of January, the Logistics division was at a high point in this cash cycle heightened by January price increases and the timing of VAT and duty payments. As the position normalized in February we experienced a cash outflow of approximately half a billion euros. If we exclude this from our calculation, our conversion rate would have been over 60%, slightly ahead of our last half year.</p>
          <p>Whilst our full year cash conversion rate will also be affected by this outflow, adjusting for this we anticipate that our full year conversion rate will be at a similar high level to recent years.</p>
          <p>Cash outflows include gross capital expenditure of 97 million pounds, higher than 2007 as a result of expenditure on the Taiwan factory, further investment in plant and machinery in Germany and Russia and also Altadis expenditure of 14 million pounds, which was mainly investing in IT in the Logistics division. Proceeds from the sale of fixed assets during the half year amounted to 8 million pounds with no profit impact. And our tax payments were again similar to our tax charge.</p>
          <p>Clearly on the acquisition front, we had a major cash outflow for the Altadis settlement which was partially offset by cash acquired. In the second half, we will receive the cash from the disposals of Aldeasa, brand divestments, further non-core assets and also from the rights issue.</p>
          <p>This chart shows our closing adjusted net debt which rose to 17 billion pounds, largely as a result of the Altadis acquisition which added 10.7 billion pounds when you include transaction costs and acquired net debt of 1.2 billion pounds.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the rights issue announced today will reduce this significantly in June. Dividends and working capital outflows were offset by operating cash flows throughout the period. There was also an increase of 1.1 billion pounds as a result of the strengthening of the euro. Our average net debt for the half year rose to 8.9 billion pounds.</p>
          <p>The all in average cost of debt for the year remained at 5.4% as increases in underlying interest rates were offset by a higher proportion of cheaper euro and U.S. Dollar debt in the period.</p>
          <p>Our net interest charge rose from 106 million pounds to 238 million pounds, reflecting the impact of wholly debt financing the Altadis and Commonwealth acquisitions. Under IFRS, net finance costs include two items relating to pensions and derivatives, which in the first half netted to nil, and we exclude these items from our adjusted EPS. And our adjusted interest cover was 3.9 times reflecting our pre-rights issue position.</p>
          <p>As Iain mentioned, earlier today we announced our rights issue. I'd like to give you a brief reminder of the theory behind rights issue mechanics. All things being equal, which they never are, Imperial Shares should trade at their theoretical ex-rights price &#x2013; or TERP &#x2013; from the ex-rights date of the 21st May. Shareholders who do not want to subscribe for new shares can sell their nil paid rights to compensate them for the dilution they will suffer. In an efficient market, these nil paid rights are valued at the theoretical ex-rights price less the subscription price of 14 pounds 75 per share.</p>
          <p>Under accounting standards, a rights issue at a discount is equivalent to a bonus issue combined with an issue at market price. Consequently, historic earnings per share and dividend per share comparators have to be adjusted for this inherent bonus element.</p>
          <p>Putting the theory into practice, the TERP was 22 pounds 21 pence per share based on last night's closing price of26 pounds 18 pence less an adjustment for the interim dividend of 24 pence. The Bonus element of 1.168, being the pre-rights share price divided by the TERP, results in a restated earnings per share of 117 pence and dividend per share of 59.5 pence for 2007. For the avoidance of doubt, in our 2008 financial year, earnings per share up until completion of the rights issue will be adjusted for the bonus element, but not thereafter.</p>
          <p>Our "business as usual" approach has ensured that we have delivered another strong set of results, although clearly integration is a key priority for us all. Going forward, we will build on the top line growth momentum whilst remaining focused on cost and working capital opportunities. And combined with the effective management of our cash this will continue to deliver long term sustainable value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I'd now like to hand over to Gareth to take you through the operational performance.</p>

          <p>Well, we've noticed Bob's not walking too well this morning &#x2013; not content with severing his Achilles tendon late last year, he managed to nearly sever something much more vital in the retracting turnstile door at Allen &amp; Overy last night. Life was never dull with Bob.</p>
          <p>Anyway, thank you and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to start with Altadis, it was a long and complicated process to get the deal finally done, particularly with the changes in Spanish takeover laws which unfortunately meant that completion was delayed by about four months. Nevertheless, now we are finally there, and everything we have seen to date confirms our views that Altadis and Imperial are a great strategic fit. We see tremendous potential for the enlarged group and many opportunities going forward.</p>
          <p>As Iain said, integration has been a key focus since we completed the acquisition. The various divestments and the Logista tendering process have been necessary priorities in these early months due to contractual or regulatory requirements. However, this has not detracted from the work of the Integration Team, which includes senior managers from both companies who have been undertaking a detailed review of the activities of the Group as a whole.</p>
          <p>As a result of this review, we have updated the targeted operational efficiencies to be generated through integration. We now believe that the Group will be able to generate annual operating efficiencies of around 300 million euros by the end of the financial year ending September 2010, rising to around 400 million euros by the end of the year ended September 2012. We estimate that the one-off cash cost of achieving these efficiencies will be around 600 million euros, which is ahead of the 470 million euros previously estimated, reflecting the higher efficiency target.</p>
          <p>In addition, we believe that annual net revenue synergies of around 60 million euros will be generated by the close of the financial year ended 2011 as a result of realizing opportunities from our enhanced operating platform and brand and product portfolios. We are currently progressing our projects to achieve these targets which we have committed to share with employees and their representatives in mid to late June, and we will also update the market at this time.</p>
          <p>So, now let's move on to look at our operational performance, starting with the highlights. These obviously included the completion of the Altadis acquisition which significantly increased cigarette volumes, contributing 22 billion sticks in just over 2 months, and bringing the Group total to 121 billion. Underlying Imperial volumes were up 2% and accounted for 93 billion sticks, with our U.S. business adding a further 6 billion.</p>
          <p>The EU cigarette footprint of the enlarged group has been considerably extended and presents us with great opportunities going forward, and we're now building real momentum in our Rest of the World region, enhancing our profit delivery through increased volumes, improving market shares and cost management. We've been very active in the U.S. during the first half, building our presence and developing a platform for future growth. And as always, these developments are underpinned by our cost focus, particularly in manufacturing where we continue to seek operational improvements.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to our brand highlights, I'd like to pick up on our European cigarette position as it stands today. It doesn't seem that long ago that when I was talking about Imperial in Europe, I was mainly referring to our fine cut tobacco operations. Then in 2002 with the Reemtsma acquisition we started to build a much more significant footprint, particularly in Germany and across Central Europe, as well as a small presence in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>We have done well on an organic basis growing to double digit shares in many markets but the Altadis acquisition has really transformed our presence in Europe, and I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
          <p>In terms of brand highlights, Davidoff performed well, increasing volumes by 4% with gains cross Europe and the Middle East. Underlying volumes grew by 16% if we exclude the ongoing impact of down trading and destocking in Taiwan, which I'll talk more about later. The further development of Davidoff continues to be a key focus and we were extremely pleased to launch the brand in the United States last month.</p>
          <p>Complementing this we have launched a number of brand extensions including Davidoff Black and White in Greece, the Ukraine and Lebanon, as well as Davidoff Rich Blue in the Netherlands and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>West had a more difficult first half, declining by 4% due to the impact of down trading in Germany. However West did do well in our Rest of the World region, growing volumes by 2%, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. And JPS continued its success story, with overall volume growth of 10 % and another strong performance in Germany. And of course Altadis has enhanced and strengthened our cigarette portfolio. Fortuna did well with growth in its main markets of Spain and France, and Gauloises Blondes made progress in a number of markets across Europe and the Middle East. We see great potential for these brands and are progressing a number of launch opportunities.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to go into the markets in a bit more detail. Before looking at U.K. market dynamics, I'd like to briefly update you on a couple of regulatory matters. You'll be aware that around two months ago the Government said it would launch a consultation in a number of areas; including proposals to restrict the display of tobacco products as a means of reducing youth smoking. We are continuing to monitor the situation and once the consultation begins, we will be making very strong representations opposing such unnecessary and disproportionate proposals.</p>
          <p>We are not aware of any credible evidence that children are encouraged to smoke by the display of tobacco products, and we believe that restricting product display would be anti-competitive, undermine the principle of adult choice and create a huge and unnecessary work and cost burden for retailers.</p>
          <p>You will also have noted that on 25th April, the Office of Fair Trading issued a Statement of Objections to a number of retailers and tobacco manufacturers, including Imperial, in its investigation into the retail pricing of tobacco products. In the Statement of Objections the OFT explained for the first time the details it considers are relevant to the alleged infringement of competition law. As you will be aware from our Annual Reports and 20-F filings this investigation has been ongoing since 2003 and relates to a period from March 2000 to mid 2003.</p>
          <p>We are in the process of reviewing this lengthy document and will provide our response within the required time period, and as we said at the time, we take compliance with competition law very seriously and we reject any suggestion that we have acted in any way contrary to the interests of consumers.</p>
          <p>So, let's kind go into the market dynamics. We estimate that the annual U.K. duty paid cigarette market has declined by 6% to 45.2 billion. This reflects normal market trends exacerbated by the initial impact of the comprehensive public smoking bans introduced in 2007. We currently estimate the impact of these bans to be around 4% and, in line with our experiences in other markets; we expect this to diminish further over time.</p>
          <p>Down trading both within cigarette and into fine cut tobacco continued, some fuelled by new competitor launches. The annualized fine cut tobacco market grew by 6% to around 3,550 tonnes. In January we increased our cigarette prices by an average of 11 pence per pack and the March 2008 budget increase of 11 pence per pack was passed on to the consumer in full.</p>
          <p>Against this backdrop our U.K. business had a robust start to the year despite a small dip in our cigarette share. Lambert &amp; Butler, now celebrating 10 years as the U.K. No 1 cigarette brand, and Richmond the No 2 brand performed well, complemented by ongoing gains from Windsor Blue.</p>
          <p>As a result of market trends, all premium brands in the market remained under pressure with the exception of Marlboro which we distribute for Philip Morris. Our fine cut tobacco share slipped to 62.2%. Despite an encouraging recent couple of months, Golden Virginia declined as a result of down trading pressure. This was partly offset by further gains from Gold Leaf which was launched last June and was up to 2.4% in March.</p>
          <p>Rizla, the world's leading papers brand and number 1 in the U.K., had another good performance helped by the success of the Rizla Smooth variant launched last September.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we delivered a strong performance in challenging market conditions. We estimate that the annualized cigarette market was down 5% to 85.3 billion sticks, in part impacted by the introduction of increased public smoking restrictions. Further downtrading has taken place within cigarettes as well as into other tobacco products, while cross-border inflows have stabilized at around 20%. The low price sector has now grown to around 23% of factory made cigarettes whilst private label brands have dropped to an estimated 11.3%, a significant drop from the 17% we saw in March 2004 when we created the fourth price sector.</p>
          <p>Other tobacco product volumes fell by 4%, with growth in the Single Tobacco sector more than offset by declines in traditional fine-cut tobaccos and eco-cigarillos. Over the past six months we have also taken selective manufacturer's price increases. We performed well in this environment and now have a combined cigarette share of 27.5% and a strengthened number two position. Imperial's cigarette share grew to 21.8% with Altadis adding a further 5.7%.</p>
          <p>JPS continue to grow rapidly and now accounts for around a third of the low price sector. In October, we launched Route 66 cigarettes as a value brand with encouraging initial results. West volumes have been impacted by downtrading; however going against these market trends Gauloises Blondes was resilient with its share remaining broadly stable. Our combined share of the OTP sector has grown from 18.9% to 20.3 %, approximately half of this growth by Single Tobacco with the other half being the contribution from the Altadis portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our next region is the Rest of Western Europe, where total cigarette market volumes were down 1 % to 316 billion sticks. The pricing environment continues to be positive and we increased prices in Italy and Spain in the first half. The regional fine cut tobacco market was stable with growth in a number of domestic markets offsetting declines in travel retail. And the high competition within this sector continues following a number of competitor brand launches.</p>
          <p>Following the acquisition of Altadis, we are now the cigarette market leader in Spain with our share up to 37.5%. The cigarette market was stable in our first half at around 85 billion cigarettes and volumes of our brands Fortuna, Ducados Rubio and Nobel were all up. We also lead the fine cut tobacco sector in Spain, with a 55.2% share.</p>
          <p>In France, where we now hold the number two position, our cigarette market share increased to 29.3%. The cigarette market declined 4% to 51.8 billion, mainly as a result of the public smoking ban coming into full effect, however against this background JPS, Gauloises Blondes and Fortuna all grew share. In fine cut tobacco, where the market was slightly up, we are the market leaders, even following divestment of Interval to PMI, with a portfolio of brands including Gauloises, Drum, Golden Virginia and JPS.</p>
          <p>Looking at the other highlights in the Rest of Western Europe starting with cigarette, in the Netherlands, JPS made further gains, and also performed well in Belgium along with Fortuna and Route 66. John Player Blue delivered a good performance in Ireland. And in Greece, Davidoff continued its impressive growth trend with its share increasing for the 10th consecutive year, now up to 4.4%.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the fine cut tobacco sector, in the Netherlands, Zilver and Evergreen continued to perform well and in February we added Drum Economy to the portfolio with positive results to date. Bastos and JPS helped drive further gains in our domestic share in Belgium, now up to 14.7%. And in Italy, Peter Stuyvesant make your own launched a little over a year ago, continues to make good progress.</p>
          <p>Let's now move onto the United States. The United States cigarette market volumes fell by 5 % to 357 billion sticks in the 2007 calendar year, slightly above the trend seen in previous years. This was mainly caused by the reversal of a trade stock build up in advance of a price increase at the end of 2006. The discount sector share was up to 27.6 % from around 27 % in 2006 and fine-cut tobacco market volumes are estimated to have grown by 12 % to around 8,700 tonnes. In October, we implemented a trade price increase of $0.70 cents per carton across our cigarette portfolio.</p>
          <p>When we announced the acquisition of Commonwealth in February last year, its cigarette market share was 3.7%. This has grown now to 4.2%, quite a step up given the high levels of competition in the market. Both USA Gold and Sonoma increased their total market shares to 2.6 % and 1.5% respectively and their combined share of the discount sector has now risen to 13.5%.</p>
          <p>Even in the relatively short timeframe since receiving MSA approval in November, we estimate that our fine cut tobacco market share averaged 3.4%, with a March spot share of 4%, following the nationwide introduction of Premier, the redesign of Bali Shag and the re-launch of McClintock.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to have almost completed the registration process for Davidoff which has now been launched in the majority of states, with promotional activity focused initially on 10 key cities. As a further enhancement to our U.S. footprint, tomorrow we will complete the acquisition of a small private tobacco company called Lignum 2, for 22 million U.S. dollars. Lignum 2 is a subsequent participating manufacturer of the Master Settlement Agreement. The acquired portfolio is complementary to ours including Rave, a value cigarette brand positioned in the deep discount sector. Rave is also sold as fine cut tobacco and has around 3.4% share, which when combined with our own portfolio gives us a total market share of around 7%.</p>
          <p>I mentioned earlier that we are really starting to see our Rest of the World region deliver on its potential, with strong growth in both profits and margins in our first half. With the Altadis acquisition we now have access to new markets like Morocco, Cambodia, Finland and Argentina, as well as enhanced positions in Russia, Poland, Austria and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>One of the key regions where we are seeing improved profitability is Central Europe. First half highlights included further progress from West and Route 66 in Poland and fine cut tobacco gains in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Through Altadis we now have a cigarette presence in Finland and an enhanced position in Austria, and it's pleasing to see share gains in both these markets.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, our cigarette volumes increased by 11%, with a very strong performance from Davidoff up 44% in the first half. Our market share was broadly stable in Russia and was up in both the Ukraine and Turkey.</p>
          <p>In Africa, our cigarette volumes grew 8% driven by Fine, which rose by 20%, as well as share gains in Burkina Faso and Senegal. And, the acquisition of Altadis has given us the number one position in Morocco where our leading brand, Marquise, continues to perform strongly. In the Middle East, our organic volumes were up 11 %, with continued growth from. Davidoff, particularly in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, complemented by regional volume gains from Gauloises and Gitanes.</p>
          <p>In Asia our regional performance has been impacted by increased competition and significant downtrading in Taiwan, following duty and price increases. As a result, our market share is now at 10%. We are looking at a number of portfolio initiatives to help address this decline and the opening of our new factory later this year will help our profitability and capital employed position. We are delighted to have signed a Joint Venture for the manufacture and sale of cigarettes with the Vietnam National Tobacco Corporation and Da Nang Province. This is the first agreement in Vietnam with an international company for both the production and sale of tobacco products and will enable us to launch our international brands in this market.</p>
          <p>Additionally, following discussions with Philip Morris, we have agreed to end the Asia trademark license framework agreement for the manufacture, sale and distribution of certain Altadis brands in the region. However, we are exploring other joint development opportunities in these markets. In Australia, our average cigarette share in the first half declined due to increased competition; however it has picked up again in the last few months, whilst in New Zealand our share increased to 17.9% with John Brandon performing well.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the cigar business. Our Cigar footprint has been profoundly enhanced by the Altadis acquisition, transforming us from a largely U.K. based operation into the world leader. We have around a quarter of the global market and the number one position in the high value premium sector.</p>
          <p>We are the market leader in the large cigar segment in the United States, and overall leader in Spain and France. You can see from the chart the importance of these markets to our operations, but overall, our cigar footprint expands to around 120 markets worldwide. Our key premium brands include Montecristo and Cohiba which are supported by a number of U.S. mass market brands such as Dutch Masters, Phillies and Backwoods, and by Farias and Vegafina in Spain and fleur de Savane in France.</p>
          <p>Our strategic focus remains on profitability and on using our innovation capabilities to adapt to changing market trends.</p>
          <p>In the USA, we performed well despite a challenging background of increasing smoking regulations, economic slowdown and a market trend towards smaller cigars. Although our net revenues were impacted by the weakening dollar, excluding this sales were up by just under 6% in the first quarter. We did particularly well in the highly profitable premium and natural wrapper sectors, and initiatives underway since April 2007, including increased promotional activity and new cigarillo product introductions, continue to produce positive results.</p>
          <p>Spanish market volumes grew in the first quarter of calendar 2008 confirming the solid recovery</p>
          <p>experienced last year, and we have increased our sales by 5%.This growth has mainly come from the dynamic mini cigar category with Altadis outpacing the market thanks to the positive evolution of our main brands Farias and Vegafina. In France, market volumes have declined as a result of the increased smoking restrictions.</p>
          <p>However, against this backdrop, Fleur de Savane increased share, and Ninas and Havanitos brands improved their performance following increased distribution.</p>
          <p>In March, we confirmed that the Habanos joint venture would continue and we will focus on enhancing this key relationship by seeking to grow these prestigious Cuban brands further in mature and developing markets.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to move on to look at the logistics operations.</p>
          <p>Through the Altadis acquisition we've acquired a significant logistics platform in Europe. As you can see from the slide, the largest markets in terms of distribution revenues are Spain, Portugal and France.</p>
          <p>Tobacco distribution accounts for around half our operations with other logistic activities, including transport services, pharmaceutical, tobacco related products, promotional and publishing making up the balance of sales.</p>
          <p>Like all of the Altadis divisions, we have consolidated the results since acquisition, however these high level comments relate to the first quarter of the calendar year 2008, our second quarter. As Bob mentioned, in Logistics, overall results were in line with our expectations. They were slightly down year-on-year, mainly as a result of a lower Spanish price increase in the first quarter of calendar 2008 compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>As well as pricing, the other main performance driver in the tobacco logistics segment is market volumes. In Spain and Morocco volumes grew in the first quarter, in Spain mainly as a result of a soft comparative period in 2007, and in Morocco because of lower levels of contraband. These positive market volume developments were offset by cigarette market declines in France, following the smoking ban, and also in Italy, to a lesser degree, following normal market trends.</p>
          <p>In terms of non tobacco operations many of the trends from 2007 have continued. The transport division progressed well, with growing distribution fees and margins. Wholesaling activity in France has been affected by a general market weakness in phone cards mainly due to increased competition, while in pharmaceutical logistics, operations are on track and we continue to explore new distribution opportunities.</p>
          <p>And finally a brief look at manufacturing. Within Imperial manufacturing operations, we delivered further productivity gains in the first half of 2008. Overall unit costs were down with a particularly good performance in fine cut tobacco, down 9%, and we further reduced the number of blends by 13%. As this picture shows, construction of our cigarette factory in Taiwan continues to progress well and it is expected to be fully operational by the end of our current financial year.</p>
          <p>We are reviewing best practice across the enlarged Group's manufacturing facilities to ensure that we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that our enhanced operating platform now presents. We are also aligning our key performance indicators to enable us to report consistently on a Group wide basis.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, it's been quite a start to the year. Our priority in the second half of the year will be integration and as I said, we will be able to share our projects with you in the next month or so.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the growth opportunities that we had before the acquisition are still very much a focus, but we are now operating from an enhanced platform and with a much stronger hand of cards. Maintaining the momentum behind sales growth in both new and existing markets will remain a priority for us.</p>
          <p>In the U.K. we would expect to see the cigarette market start to pick up in the summer months and in Germany we expect further share gains. In the Rest of Western Europe we anticipate continued progress although travel retail is likely to remain challenging, and in Rest of the World we aim to build on the momentum in the first half.</p>
          <p>In Cigar, we remain focused on profit rather than volume growth and in respect of Logistics; we expect many of the positive underlying trends to continue. And I also believe our U.S. business offers great potential for further development and I'm particularly pleased to see Davidoff in the market now. Our strengthened cigarette portfolio, when combined with our world leadership in cigar, fine cut tobacco and papers gives us plenty of scope to build our positions and we are actively progressing a number of opportunities.</p>
          <p>And as always, controlling our costs is an extremely important part of our strategy. So, as Bob said earlier, its very much business as usual for us, and I'm confident that this approach will stand us in good stead, enabling us to create value for our shareholders for many years to come.</p>
          <p>So, thank you ladies and gentlemen, we will now take any questions you may have. The presentation is being recorded so I should be grateful if you would wait for a microphone before speaking and then give your name and organization. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Erik Bloomquist, JPMorgan. So, if you could answer two questions. Firstly, if you could discuss in somewhat more detail the drivers of the strong profit growth out of the Rest of World &#x2013; the profit growth out of Rest of World?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where that came from for the Imperial division? And then secondly, if you could give us some more color on the sources of the revenue synergies? Is a lot of that coming out of the ending of the PMI trademark distribution, or is that coming from other sources? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of profit growth from the Rest of the World region, pretty broadly spread, of course now the U.S. is a separate region in it'd own right, I have to say particularly strong performance in Africa and the Middle East. We grew share just about every market there. Margins were strong and I think it's fair to say we still see tremendous potential in the Africa, Middle East region for us &#x2013; Davidoff did particularly well. But also the Altadis brands Gauloises and Gitanes did well. So, I think we've got a &#x2013; I keep using this expression, a hand of cards, but I think we've got a very good hand of cards now in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>I think also what was very pleasing was Central Europe; we saw further returns to profitability. I mean we've suffered quite a few years of depressed profitability because of weak pricing, duty absorption in Central Europe and now we're starting to see that region where we start to blossom as it come to the end of the derogation periods. Eastern European profits were also up. Volumes were up strongly. We have a much stronger position in Russia now in terms of market share. In the Ukraine, we had an outstanding performance there. And in other countries in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan, and the various other -stans, we did very well.</p>
          <p>Australasia profitability was very good. I think the Asian situation, I think we would look for improvement and I think have the capability and capacity now for that improvement. But we do have one problem to overcome and that is this de-stocking issue in Taiwan, for two reasons, one, of which pictorial health warnings are due to come into Taiwan from the turn of the year, so we don't want to be left with old stock. And secondly, our factory will open in &#x2013; be fully operational by the late summer that gives us the opportunity to shorten our supply chain and, therefore, our stock quite considerably because we've no need of stock under water or on the dock side as it were. So that will provide us significant working capital benefit. And we estimated savings of about 20 million a year through opening that factory.</p>
          <p>So once we've got over that Taiwan hurdle then I think we're set for a more positive future in Asia. And I think that will obviously be aided by the announcement we've made today about the joint venture in Vietnam. We have big ambitions for that region. It's not a piece of cake. There are some very, very strong competition, but we think we can enhance our position in Asia considerably over the coming years. So the mixed pack, Erik but very, very pleasing to see when you aggregate it all, it all went very well. In terms of the sources of the revenue synergies we see going forward, it's always a difficult one to plot, but I think it's fair to say, if we look at the activities planned for the rollout of Gauloises, Gitanes, Fortuna seeing these brands into the Imperial geography, that's where we see it coming from. And also we would see over time the cigar business utilized in the Imperial geography, which should give it much more volume and profit potential.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Eileen?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I am Eileen Khoo from Morgan Stanley. A quick question on the U.S., are you still sticking to your target of 50 million organic profit by next year? And also could you talk a bit about what's been the reception to Davidoff to date? Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The short answer is despite the weaker dollar, obviously and being a little later than we thought into the market with Davidoff because of the length of time for following the MSA approval you then have a product registration procedure in each of the states and that also was longer than we anticipated. So it's only in April basically, late April at that that Davidoff has been launched. The roll your own was a little bit quicker. So we are a little bit behind schedule in terms of our launch profile and the Imperial brands in America. Despite that and the weaker dollar we're still sticking to that 50 million. We think we can still do it. Davidoff is very early days; all I can say so far is it's won a couple of beauty parades. It was launched at one of the Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Trade Show, they won one for best packaging and best new brand award, but that doesn't actually pay the dividends. So, it's now been rolled out across most of the states, so we are concentrating on 10 key cities, New York, Miami, Houston, Dallas, San Francisco, Phoenix, that's probably about eight, sorry, Chicago and Atlanta. And so, we'll be concentrating on those cities in the first flush as it were. But so far, it's been very well received. It is I think, fair to say on average about a 30% price premium to Marlboro and about 14% price premium to Parliament, which is in the super premium segment. So, it's very highly priced, but we we're very encouraged by what we are seeing and are very optimistic. Over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, can you go for it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, can I ask three. It's Adam Spielman, sorry, from Citigroup. Can I ask three questions, please? First one is on the cost savings. I notice that your &#x2013; I think you hint at least that you're still in talks with the works councils. Does that mean to say that as you progress those talks there is a possibility that you can agree things which aren't yet included in the 300 million or 400 million obviously, depending on negotiations. That's question one.</p>
          <p>Question two, is on Logistics. Have you had any talks with your main suppliers, I am really talking about Philip Morris and I guess BAT and JTI, about how they feel about having the number two player in Western Europe distributing all their product. Because I know in Italy, Philip Morris wasn't happy with that. Thirdly, in the U.K., I think you've lost more market share than I can remember in previous prior periods. I was wondering, surely you are not happy with that, I mean, who would be? But how bad does it have to be before you either launch a new cheaper brand to compete with some of the competitors or somehow influence pricing to say enough is enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's take them in that order. I mean, in terms of the cost savings, I think one of the things to remember is we say we're talking about the &#x20AC;300 million in operation efficiencies rising to 400, not all of that is labor. Obviously, there are other non-labor savings which are quite considerable. But in terms of the discussions with employees and their representatives they will start mid to late June, Adam. And I wouldn't propose to say any more on that. Today we will update the market of it's &#x2013; once we have had those &#x2013; once we've started the discussions of those projects and proposals. It's a very dearly held principal of Imperil, if there are things that are going to change and our employees are always the first to know about them. So I just stress, it's not all labor that we're talking about there. Will other things come out on the hoof, as it were as we start the voyage of those operational efficiencies? Undoubtedly, there will be things -- other things that come to bear in the situation no doubt. That's our past experience. And I am sure it would happen again.</p>
          <p>In terms of the logistics issues that we're talking about with the -- with our main clients, we have stressed continually not only to the market, but more importantly to our main clients that Logista and the Logistics division in general will be run at arms length with a complete spirit of neutrality. I have talked to all the principals and &#x2013; in the various territories and suffice to say, I'm happy to say, I think they're reasonably relaxed about the situation that we have. But its actions speak louder than words. We have to demonstrate that neutrality. I think we are doing that. We will continue to do that. And I am not aware of any problems with any of the clients at the moment in terms of the longevity of the relationship. So I think that's a pleasing scenario and we aim to delight our clients anyway, Adam.</p>
          <p>In terms of U.K. market share, we've &#x2013; well we've, I think our MAT, the full year, last year it was about 46.4. I think we're looking at about 46.1. I mean at the moment we're not running around cutting our throats, as you might expect. The U.K. has always been a &#x2013; as we've said a bit of a nip and tuck type situation. We've gained 0.1, 0.2, we lose 0.1, 0.2. At this point in time I wouldn't say it's hugely bad, no one ever likes to lose share at any time. But it's bound to happen when you got competitors launching other products at fairly aggressive prices. We've got launch packages et cetera. These things happen. I think you have to remember as well we were the first to go with the U.K. price increase in January. So our pricing on the shells was higher earlier than our competitors. I've note down in the second half, it will be nip in tuck and could well go the other way where we gain some back. So we are certainly not in our cuts about it. Our profit is still growing in the U.K. and with the brands we distribute as well and overall without our fine cut there as well we are in a very good position in the U.K. So we watch the competition very closely. And if we think things are starting to run away from us then we would be slow to act, but these things stand at the moment, where reasonably comfortable with our position.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's David Hayes from Lehman Brothers. Just two questions: On the 400 million euros, can we still confirm that's a net figure and that goes to the bottom line that you've budgeted within that for some additional brand support investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the what for the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, start again. The &#x20AC;400 million of cost savings &#x2013; could you confirm that's a net number i.e. that comes through to the bottom line that you've already budgeted additional brand support and can you quantify that additional brand support coming out of the synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 400 million, then the vast majority of that will flow to the bottom line. If we need to invest some more above our plans along the way, we would have no hesitation in doing so, but we think the majority of that will flow to the bottom line. We then have on top of that the revenue synergy that I was talking about. I think that's always a much more the revenue synergies almost a much more difficult figure to be precise on. What we try to be, I think is precise in a flow direction as it were, I think we're very confident about that. We would hope obviously to improve that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the &#x20AC;600 million of cash outflow to get this &#x2013; should we be looking to offset some of that with property disposals as part of the integration process? And can you at this stage quantify what the cash inflow might be from that being part of the &#x2013; part of that process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think so far we've in terms of the disposals and this excludes Aldeasa and the divested brands that have been sold to Philip Morris International. But if you exclude those, we were talking about &#x20AC;650 million worth of disposals. We are just over half way through that at the moment, about 333 I think, that sort of area of disposals. So we have more disposals to come in that period, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you wouldn't expect 652 increase, as you've extended the cost saving project, you wouldn't expect the 652 increase because you have seen more opportunity to rationalize and...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thanks. Jon Leinster, UBS. Couple of housekeeping things, first of all, looking forward to 2009 on the basis of adjusted earnings, what do you think the depreciation and amortization charge on ongoing basis would be? And secondly, going back to well, taking a previous question, but looking at Germany you've now launched Route 66 which is a sort of fifth segment, and we know you've got Next down there as well. Is &#x2013; and I see you've launched Drum Economy, I mean, is there a &#x2013; is this, firstly is German cigarettes going to move towards even more aggressive stance and this Drum Economy sort of, again I guess simply adding on to that in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. While you are fiddling with your papers, shall I answer the second one. The &#x2013; I think with regard to the German question on Route 66. I don't think Jon, it's so much a question of driving things down.</p>
          <p>I think it's a question of having a similar number of brands in a particular segment as your competitors. We only had JPS in there and our major competitors have got two brands in that segment. So, this is our entry as it were with the second brand. So, I think, that's sort of read through. We need an armory of similar size and capability for that. I think it surprised exactly the same as JPS. Yeah, the 24 boxes is a slight discomfort so, by and large Jon it's price parity, so no intention to see increased price aggression in Germany. I think, indeed all the evidence suggests quite a contrary. We've seen selective price increases on things like Big Box on 100 millimeter and various other as I say selective rather than across the board increases in Germany over this half year.</p>
          <p>I think it would be an interesting country to watch over the next half year. We've seen sort of speculative articles in the press that mainstream German volume might move from 17s in a pack to 20s. We will have to see what happens on that. So &#x2013; but I don't see price aggression has been on the agenda for Germany. I think fair to say Drum Economy we launched in Holland, and I think what we've seen very much in Holland over the last four or five years is a significant down trading phenomenon. We can say that one of our core skill is &#x2013; skills is to capture those down traders. We are trading off the Drum brand equity. The initial results are very positive, I have to say. But in its early days, we'll have to see how things go. But I think what we've seen in Holland over the last few years is more and more economy type developments and segment developing across Western Europe of roll your own prices which is somewhat suffering and obviously as the market leader in roll your own, we want to be &#x2013; have the right products available in all the segments because we like to lead all the segments. So, I would rule out further initiatives and activities in the sub premium segment in roll your own and make your own.</p>

          <p>So &#x2013; the depreciation that's &#x2013; I'll get back to you. I assume you're not talking about the amortization of intangibles; you're talking about the deprecation of the enlarged group. I honestly, I'll get back to you on that one. How about that, Bob Dyrbus stumped for an answer, but it's better to be honest.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Hi, Chris Wickham from MainFirst. Just a quick question on Russia, I mean you obviously lost the legacy business, lost a minute amount of market share there from last year, but I was wondering if you can just tell us how the combined entity is going and just give us an outlook comment going forward on Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Early days, I think, we're left with, as a result of the acquisition about 11.5 to 12% share. We &#x2013; Imperial business lost, I think, 0.1 of market share, but we had a very good mix effect for us as Davidoff did well, we lost a little bit of share with Maxim which is a lower price offering. What we now is got the two businesses put together. I think a lot of changes are taking place in Russia, particularly on the distribution side because with a concentration in distribution now, I think, we would estimate, I mean obviously we're in a pretty strong position. We've got more brands we want to put in, but I would say there're more mid price and premium and more up trading dynamic that we will be concentrating on in Russia in terms of our combined portfolio, so that should have significant impact on profit going forward. So, I think our desire there is to see up trading, which is generally taking place in the market. You see certainly BAT, JT, Philip Morris, I think all achieving mix improvements, which is good to see, and we certainly intend to be part of that process going forward. So, we're at a reasonably strong position with say 11.5, 12% share. It's a very important volume market. It's roughly 40 billion for us, so we'll be putting a lot of effort into it. There's another question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Julian Hardwick, ABN AMRO. Couple of questions for Bob if he's still got his papers out there. Could you hazard a guess on where the net debt is going to end up this year given an awful lot of moving parts going through the cash flow? And I think back in March, you were talking about your monthly run rate of interest at 75 million, I mean, obviously we got the right issue, which we can knock off that, but is that still ballpark the right sort of base to be looking at for your interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, yeah, effectively in terms of the major cash flows, I mean effectively coming in the balance of the year, obviously we have the right issue, which is fairly eminent. We have the settlement, obviously the settlement of Logista, which is the outflow for that. We've got the Aldeasa and the brands, which is between them that's going to be effectively another &#x20AC;600 million coming in on those. And then effectively, we should be in our normal profile in terms of cash generation going forward. I mean, basically we would be turning operating profit into cash and slight unwind we see in the second half. Doesn't tell you that much I suppose, but the major out is effectively the 5 billion reduction, which at 5.4% reduces monthly interest charge by &#x2013; 75 is the place to start from and then there was &#x2013; in terms of the big steps, obviously the 5 billion initial big step-down and then you've got the cash outflows and the cash inflows you've got another probably a net &#x20AC;300 million outflow of Logista offset by the cash inflows, so it's the right place to start. And the average all in cost of debt, we reckon still runs 5.4%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, I just &#x2013; kind of following up on that in terms of the rating agencies. Is there any kind of target that's out there, in terms if you got to get to a certain point by certain time you want to maintain an investment grade. I'm just trying to getting a feel whether, if you talked about previously, the investment that you've given some leeway that you are tactically below the investment grade levels and then there was a good visibility, is there anything like that you can give us any color or facts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, in terms of discussion with rating agencies I think, broadly from what they said where they are in terms of the overall sort of target ranges for the various grades in terms of investment grade. And yes, they do allow you to go outside those corridors. So effectively, the right issue has been sized following discussions with the rating agencies at the minimum level that we could size it and retain investment grade.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Nico Lambrechts from Merrill Lynch. Could you talk a little about the pricing environment in Europe? And especially markets, where you are the price leader and then also comment about how you see changes in the behavior from PMI and also, what is there the pricing power of cigarettes in line of the general rise in food inflation and others? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, fair to say in the first half carrying on from the second half of last year. I think a pleasing improvement in pricing in Western Europe as I say we've seen increases in Spain and Italy. In the first half there were improvements in the second half last year in France, etcetera. I think going forward, fair to say, I think we'll see from our point of view an improved pricing environment I think what we're starting to see now, what we're not seeing so much is the big duty shocks that we've had in recent years. The French government, having duty increase for five years and then whacking it on the German government having five duty increases in quick succession. I think we can see a landscape of free, thankfully, of those great duty adjustments and duty shocks, which just kick contraband and illegal trade into life. So in that sort of, more settled environment, I think we're likely to see more regular, more modest duty increases in countries and that tends to support more modest and more regular price increases. So I am fairly optimistic about the landscape in Western Europe and Central Europe going forward in terms of pricing.</p>
          <p>I think obviously we all observe Philip Morris because they are the market leader in so many countries in Western Europe. They have just obviously gone to market themselves. They have their own strategy to pursue and we will obviously keep that &#x2013; weather eye on that but I think it's far too early to say that there's any change in behavior from Philip Morris. I haven't noticed any great price aggression from them or any other players in the market. In terms of our own position we have market leading positions obviously in the U.K. We've taken an 11 pence price increase across the board. We were the first to go this year. In Spain we are also the market leader who has taken a price increase there already, but overall I hope I am trying to sort of paint the picture to you that I see it as a generally much more positive environment in terms of pricing in Western Europe than has been the case for the last five years. And I think that goes for duty as well. I think governments are starting to realize that you cannot dislocate markets with these ill-conceived duty shocks that we were subject to over the previous five years.  I pray to God it stays that way. There was a last part of your question I can't remember what it was?</p>

          <p>Food inflation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Food inflation, well someone like me will always have a cigarette instead of a burger and don't be fooled by appearances. I think it's fair to say that the tobacco is a hugely resilient sector and a hugely resilient product and it particularly comes into certain times of economic downturn. Okay, people may trade down into more value offerings in all the segments in cigarette to more &#x2013; to cheaper alternatives or to roll your own or into small cigars or what have you. But that tends to be, I think, less economizing on tobacco than in other areas of the economy and that's why it's such a resilient segment and has been the case for 35 years I have been in the business and I think it will always remain the case. So I don't see too much of what I would call a macro economic threat to the health of the tobacco industry.</p>

          <p>Could I come back actually just John, just answer the question, the question that I couldn't answer, Bob Dyrbus didn't know but obviously he knew some people who did. Depreciations next year should be around &#xA3;150 million in '09 and amortization of intangibles, which is the other big piece probably somewhere between 450 and 500 million but that's subject to refinement at the year-end obviously. We've got the opening balance sheet that we're still finalizing. We will finalize that by this year end.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. I apologize I've actually got three things. First one on the cost savings, I think you said to me the forecast -- something like we only talked about cost savings that I can sign for in blood and I am wondering could you talk a little bit about what caused you to lift the target for eventual savings from 300 to 400?  Is that a result of new information or you've been more aggressive with your underlying assumptions there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think perhaps taking a view over a slightly longer period of time obviously and how the dynamics and the capacity of the industry is likely to develop is taken into account, various investments we're making in new machinery, new factories, etcetera. So it's taking the whole thing in. I mean, we only &#x2013; signing in blood etcetera, is very much a norm and I wouldn't vary from that. We don't quote a number unless we're very confident of delivering it. So, yeah, I suppose its going out a little bit further in time and certainly the work of the integration team and the planners that have been working on it has been going that way for the last few weeks in terms of newer things coming out down the track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And secondly on the U.S., which opportunity are you more excited about? There is the opportunity to expand in the low price end as people drift down to discount cigarettes and roll your own tobacco or is it to sort of <mark type="inaudible" /> brands on the top Davidoff, maybe some Altadis brands. Which of those areas do you think offers you the biggest opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it goes back Jon to when we acquired Commonwealth and where we saw our positioning in the U.S. I think to -- for us to go in to the U.S. and expect to take on the main ground of Altria and RJR. I think we break our heart in that segment. I think where we can do well is in the segment we've gone into, the discount segment. We have a strong and I think a position that can gain strength there. And at the top end of the market, I'm sorry, sticking to the lower end of the market, I think roll your own comes into that search for value, whatever you want to call it, whether its economy cigarettes, whether it's roll your own, make your own, it's people who are seeking value. I want to smoke, give me something I can afford and we are good at that. I think we proved ourselves pretty good also now in the super premium end of the market with Davidoff and I'm very excited about that because obviously the margins are significant, obviously we do have to invest to brand awareness and brand positioning as such. I think probably difficult for me to say whether I am more turned on by the top or the bottom, I think for us that's the sort of cocktail, and in terms of that mainstream type big brands the sort of Marlboro, Camels those types of things, as I said before. I don't think we are in that territory, we'll be at the &#x2013; on the ends of the scales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And final thing, sorry. On Germany, I think the market was dropped what 4%...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About five.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About five. Where are we now with cross border flows and also the public place smoking bans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>An interesting situation because of course we have now got Slovenia and the Czech Republic that have reached the derogation both on cigarettes and fine tobacco, I think fair to say. So now, and then I think we go to the end of this year Poland reaches the end of the derogation as well. What we've seen in recent times in Germany, if anything the, it's fair to say Germany as a whole, the level of cross borders come back from about, we can fix it about 22.5, 22.7 and we are seeing about 22% in the moment; but again a big disparity between the Old East and West Germany and West Germany is down to about 14, 14.5% cross border penetration. The Old East Germany you are looking high 30s, 36, 37 in some places. So, I think what we're likely to see certainly when Poland, the Polish derogations reached is I would see no diminution in that eastern part because people will be able quite legally to bring 800 cigarettes in from Poland, as they are now able to bring 800 cigarettes as opposed to 200 in from the Czech Republic. I don't see no impact collections and observations of cross border movements.</p>
          <p>I don't think we're seeing any great uplift from stuff from the Czech Republic and it might be a controversial thing to say. I don't think we'll see a massive uplift from Poland either, because no one in reality or very few have been respecting the 200 limit. And you can actually see people who walk across the bridge, Frankfurt on order, there is not much people in cars, they carry in bags and they must leave near the border and they will have 40 cigarettes and they carry some lumpy big bags across that bridge and nothing seems to happen. So overall, I don't think it will have a massive effect, I think, round about 20% seems to be where it is in cross border and that's bad enough, we would like to see that lower obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>SiPPs, I find a little bit of <mark type="inaudible" /> (01.23.50) keeping up to date, there is so much information that keep comes out of Germany on the SiPP's ban that sort of 14 out of 16 or 16 out of 18 lender in Germany impose restrictions. We then had some rollback in certain states where there has been a partial rollback of it to permit smoking in certain areas. I believe the debate is getting elevated, which is at national level about the bans. So, it does seem to be some form of kickback in Germany about the ban because it is affecting the <mark type="inaudible" /> (01.24.28) trade so badly in Germany, and we see that obviously in sales going through vending machines as well. It is affecting it just as much as it is devastating the pub trade in Britain, whereas you can see potential for a bit of rollback in Germany we will not see in the U.K.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Canada, this was launched last year? And the second one is about the rate of decline on segment in France and Spain and any color on the outlook? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Davidoff in Canada, first of all, was always likely to be as we've said very niche, super premium, and -- but I'll have to say our distribution partner in Canada has done a very good job. Its growth percentage is quite outstanding. That's what my father used to say, 10% of bugger all is still bugger all. It's still a relatively small volume. But with a very good growth factor, good growth percentage, and so it will grow -- continue to grow slowly and ad distributors doing a first class job for us over there. Market share, I think we will be below one, I would say at the moment. Sorry, what was the second part? Still declining, but I have to say in Spain a little what we certainly seen is a little strengthening the rate of decline not as far as we have seen in recent years. I think that's bound to the case as you get down to a lower level of the dark segment. It will -- the sort of curve should be quite as dramatic probably if you go from 20 to 10 it will be like that and then from 10 down to zero, it'll be a shallower curve. But inexorably is it decline and I'm sure we'll continue in decline, just a very little new recruits to that category. Okay. Charles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Charles Manso from Dresdner. Historically, you've grown your underlying operating profits by about 7%, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this time around it looks like 5% organic. Could you just confirm that? And could you say whether you think that's a new rate, a new level or what would it take to get it back to the 7, do you need Germany to be fixed? And, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, you finish your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's all right, and on Altadis leaving aside the question of synergies for a second, do you see the organic profit growth rates of Altadis being growth enhancing to you mutual or dilutive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think in terms of being organic profit growth rate slightly different so figure, as I say it was a little higher than you pitch it. So, I think obviously we have the advantage of the currency, the currency effect this year. But no, don't see any reason to change the normal rate, Charles, on that at all. I think what we are seeing so far from the Altadis business, as Bob said all the divisions of perform well. I think we had a really good performance from the cigarette division. So I think we would see the obviously the effect on Imperial being very positive on the combined business. I think if that covers your point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's enhancing there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Jon Leinster [UBS] again. Some of your peers have commented about higher raw material costs and even Philip Morris very kindly gave us a view as to how much of the cost in the next fee is in dollars and particularly with you, I suppose now your logistics operations. I don't know whether the contracts are now simply past through higher fuel cost on that particular side or not as well, or whether that would have an impact, I don't know whether you got any views on leaf and fuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms in leaf, certainly we are seeing in terms of this year's purchase is higher. Leaf inflation that we've seen before, I think a number of factors, some particular crop problems because of climatic issues. I think in Brazil, we're seeing a slightly smaller crop, but a very good quality one, obviously aware of some the difficulties in Southern Africa, but there is pressure. I think, obviously with more land being given over to crops, you can transform into fuel is putting some pressure there as well. But Tobacco has a habit of finding leaf tobacco, finding this equilibrium fairly quickly, but we are in a cycle I think of higher leaf inflations than we've seen over the previous five years. We have decent stocks of leaf and as already said higher stocks of in terms of duration of leaf than imperial-leaf. So combined we're in fairly good shape, I'd say on the leaf side, but I think over the next couple of years, there will be higher leaf inflation than we've seen. In terms of transport and oil prices, I think it's fair to say that the transport operation. The trucks aren't owned by Logista, in the sense that sub-contracted to individual driver, operators as it were, and I don't see too much problem on that at all. Okay. There'll be higher fuel prices, but I don't see it is too much of an issue going forward in terms of the clients, depends obviously how they go, but the current point in time I don't see it having a detrimental factor.</p>
