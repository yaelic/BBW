          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Gilead's fourth quarter and full year 2007 earnings conference call. We are pleased you could join us today. We issued a press release this afternoon providing results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, and describing the company's quarterly and full year highlights. This press release is also available on our website at www.gilead.com.</p>
          <p>Joining me on today's call to discuss our results are John Martin, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Milligan, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Young, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer and Matt Howe, Vice President of Finance. John Martin will take you through the corporate and product related highlights for the quarter, John Milligan will be reviewing the fourth quarter and full year 2007 financial results and financial guidance for 2008 and Kevin Young will summarize our commercial milestones and provide more color on the market dynamics surrounding our various franchises. We will then allow time at the end of this call to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to John Martin for the corporate update, I would first like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements relating to future events, expectations, trends, objectives and financial results that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Act of 1995. These statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. I refer you to our Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007, subsequent press releases, and other publicly filed SEC disclosure documents for a detailed description of the risk factors affecting our business.</p>
          <p>In addition, please note that we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will also be making certain references to financial measures that are on a non-GAAP basis. We provide a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers on our website.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John Martin.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to summarize for you Gilead's accomplishments during the fourth quarter of 2007. I will start my review on our corporate milestones for the quarter and provide an update on our research and development programs. Then John Milligan will run through the financial results for the quarter and provide our 2008 guidance and finally Kevin will review our commercial efforts.</p>
          <p>First, Caroline Dorsa off to a good start as Gilead as Chief Financial Officer, so we were disappointed by her departure for personal reasons after only two months. We will work hard to identify replacement, so that John Milligan can focus on his role as Chief Operating Officer, in the interim he will reassume the role of Chief Financial Officer, a continuation of his previous responsibilities.</p>
          <p>2007 marked a year of many important milestones for Gilead. We saw continued significant growth in our product sales particularly our HIV franchise which grew 48% from 2006 to 2007, which is the primary driver of our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 33% year-over-year. We executed on several product approvals and launches in multiple territories, and particularly Letairis for PAH in the US and Atripla in the EU and Canada. We also completed the integration of multiple acquired sites, embarked on several new collaborations and in-license compounds and expanded our footprint in Europe. In addition we completed regulatory submissions for a Aztreonam Lysine for inhalation for cystic fibrosis and Viread for HBV, and Glaxo filed for approval of Letairis in the EU, with all three products are currently undergoing review in the US and/or the European Union.</p>
          <p>We are prepared to launch these products later this year, leveraging the commercial infrastructure we already have in place, as Kevin will expand on in a bit. All this was accomplished by the approximately 2,900 dedicated Gilead employees who are committed to advancing patient care worldwide.</p>
          <p>In November at ASLD we presented a positive data from the two key pivotal studies for Viread for chronic hepatitis B. These data support the US and European filings which we submitted in the fourth quarter of 2007. The US NDA was accepted by the FDA and assuming a 10 month review, we'd expect to launch the product in the third quarter of this year. In the EU, the filing is a type II variation, therefore, we anticipate that the review could be quicker and if approved we could be in a position to begin launching in the free pricing countries of Europe in the second quarter of this year. The data from two pivotal studies show Viread to be superior to Hepsera based on the primary end point of HBV viral load decrease and histologic improvement. These results coupled with the long-term safety database based on the use of Viread in HIV infected individuals comprising more than one million patient years of safety data suggest that Viread will be an excellent choice for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.</p>
          <p>Despite the fact that there are now several antivirals on the market including Hepsera chronic hepatitis B continues to represent a significant unmet medical need. The market dynamics are very different in HBV than HIV. There are approximately the same number of HBV infected individuals in the US as is the case with HIV, but the diagnoses rate is significantly lower and the treatment rate is extremely low. We believe this creates a significant opportunity for a hepatitis B franchise.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our efforts in HCV, as you know, we have numerous research efforts for the treatment of HCV which also represents a significant unmet medical need and an area of research in which numerous biotech and pharmaceutical companies are focused. Our lead compound for HCV is GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. We presented preliminary data on the single dose and the first two doses of a seven day treatment course at the AASLD conference last November which demonstrated favorable antiviral activity pharmacokinetics and exposure at the doses evaluated. In the study we also observed a possible QTc prolongation at the 120 mg dose. And we proceeded to assess the effect of GS 9190 on QTc in a separate study of healthy volunteers.</p>
          <p>We have now completed the assessment of the QTc effects of GS 9190 at the 120 mg and at the 40 mg BID doses. QTc prolongations were confirmed at the 120 mg dose, but prolongations at the 40 mg dose were small, and we believe clinically manageable. Therefore we are in the process of reinitiating dosing of HCV affected individuals, to further define the efficacy and safety of the compound.</p>
          <p>GS 9450, our caspase inhibitor in license last year is currently being evaluated as a palo protectant in an on going Phase IIa study in HCV infected individuals. We anticipate data from this trial by the end of this year. We think that this molecule may also have utility in other diseases such as fatty liver disease or NASH.</p>
          <p>Turning to HIV, in 2007 significant progress was made to increase the diagnosis and treatment of HIV in the US and the EU. In the US eight states took legislative steps to reduce the barriers to testing and guidelines were modified to recommend treatment at higher CD4 count in an effort to better preserve patients' immune systems. Similar initiatives were seen in the EU where new treatment guidelines were implemented as well as initiatives to increase testing.</p>
          <p>We also saw the approval of two new classes of drugs targeting the treatment of patients that have failed on the other regiments, an integrase inhibitor and a CCR-5 inhibitor. In light of these new options for patients the new standard for the evaluation of novel agents in treatment experienced patients such as Elvitegravir is a non-inferiority study versus an active comparator.</p>
          <p>With the FDA's guidance we have been working hard to finalize the design of the Phase III program for Elvitegravir. We will be conducting two non-inferiority studies evaluating Elvitegravir doses of either 150 milligrams or 300 milligrams versus 400 milligrams of raltegravir in up to 1,560 patients.</p>
          <p>Our primary endpoint will be the proportionate patients who achieve and maintain HIV RNA less than 50 copies per milliliter at Week 48. We are evaluating that 300 milligram dose of Elvitegravir because of the clean safety profile exhibited with the highest dose of 125 milligrams evaluated in the Phase II warrant exploration of this higher dose. This may result in greater efficacy for patients with more advanced disease.</p>
          <p>With regards to our cardiovascular franchise, we plan to initiate the Phase IV program for Letairis in the second quarter of this year. The initial study will be blinded, a blinded two-arm study comparing the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil to the combination of sildenafil and Letairis in patients who are not optimally responding to sildenafil monotherapy. The study is intended to demonstrate the clinical value of the addition of Letairis therapy early in the treatment process.</p>
          <p>Phase III studies for darusentan in resistant hypertension saw progress in terms of the enrollment in both the DAR-311 and the DAR-312 studies, which are approximately 45 and 10% enrolled respectively. We believe we are on track to complete enrollment and receive data from these studies in 2009.</p>
          <p>On the respiratory front, aztreonam lysine for inhalation is Gilead's unique drug formulation specifically designed to achieve high lung antibiotic concentrations with a short duration of administration. Based on data from the two Phase III pivotal studies, the dose that provides the best efficacy is 75 milligrams delivered in two to three minutes three times daily. The US NDA was filed on November 16, 2007 and we have been notified that has been accepted and was granted a traditional review with a PDUFA date of September 16 of this year. Based on discussions with the EMEA, we plan to submit an MAA in the second quarter of this year. We are preparing to conduct a head-to-head open label study versus Toby in the European Union to support registration and will initiate this study shortly. This study will not need to be completed in order to gain approval of Aztreonam Lysine but will support a conditional approval strategy.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased with all the progress Gilead made in 2007 and look forward to further growth of our organization in 2008. Next John Milligan will review our financial results for the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you John. The fourth quarter of 2007 was another very successful quarter and completes a tremendous year of growth for the company.</p>
          <p>Total revenues which include product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $1.1 billion, our fourth consecutive quarter of surpassing $1 billion in total quarterly revenue. Fourth quarter product sales were $1 billion, a 34% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. This marks the first time the company has exceeded $1 billion in product sales in a given quarter. For the full year total revenues were $4.2 billion. HIV product sales totaled $864 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 driven primarily by the continued strong uptake of Atripla in the United States as well as the strong growth of Truvada across most major international regions.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were $365 million, a 41% increase over the fourth quarter of the prior year. This reflects our commitment to investing in our pipeline, and our geographic expansion, while keeping a sharp focus on overall expense management. I know you've heard in the past about our plans to expand our operations in the EU, and Kevin will speak to you in a few minutes about the strong progress we're making in this regard. We believe this positions us well for the future.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter 2007, net income was $402 million, or $0.41 per share on a fully diluted basis. Our full year 2007 net income was $1.6 billion or $1.68 per share on a fully diluted basis. Non-GAAP net income per share for the first quarter of 2007, excluding the impact of after-tax stock based compensation expense was $0.44 per share on a fully diluted basis, a 6% increase over the fourth quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income per share of $0.41 per share, which excluded both the purchase in process R&amp;D expenses as well as the after-tax stock-based compensation expense. We generated $512 million in operating cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2007 bringing the full year operating cash flow to $1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the specific results for the fourth quarter. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $1.1 billion, an increase of 22% from total revenues of $899 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. This performance was driven by a 34% increase in our product sales, partially offset by a 48% reduction in our royalty, contract and other revenues compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Product sales were a record $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007, marking four consecutive years of quarterly product sales growth. Product sales from the fourth quarter increased sequentially by 7% as our HIV product sales continued to grow. In terms of foreign exchange impact, $36 million of our product sales increase in the fourth quarter of 2007 was due to the strengthening of the underlying European currencies when compared to the same period in 2006 and $14 million when compared to the third quarter 2007. This favorable impact takes into account our hedging activities. Royalty, contract and other revenues decreased sequentially by 29% due primarily to the decline in Tamiflu sales.</p>
          <p>Now turning to more specifics on product sales. HIV product sales grew to $864 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 up 35% from $642 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and up 7% sequentially from the third quarter of 2007. Truvada sales were $449 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 up 33% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, of which approximately 6% was driven by favorable foreign currency exchange impact when compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Truvada sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were up 10% sequentially from the third quarter of 2007 of which approximately 2% was driven by a favorable foreign exchange impact when compared to the third quarter of 2007. Truvada sales accounted for approximately 52% of our total HIV franchise sales in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>In the US, Truvada sales were $210 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Sequentially, US sales were up 2% even though the fourth quarter of 2007 was the sixth quarter of Atripla availability in the US, thereby demonstrating Truvada's continued hold on its place as the NRTI backbone of choice in combination with protease inhibitors.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Truvada sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $212 million, an increase of 67% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 and an increase of 15% compared to the third quarter of 2007. Strong sales volume growth in Europe and a favorable foreign exchange environment were the key drivers of the increased Truvada sales.</p>
          <p>In response to an increased level of parallel trade activity in the region effective December 1, 2007 the company initiated a supply management system in France to manage orders of Truvada and Viread to ensure adequate and appropriate supply of those products to France commensurate with the market demands of France. We do not believe the impact from parallel trade was material to our overall HIV product sales during the quarter. We currently estimate that the supply management system has accomplished what we had hoped and we expect that future sales in the region will better approximate future demand.</p>
          <p>Atripla contributed $260 million to our fourth quarter HIV product sales as demand for this product continued to rise in the US. Atripla sales accounted for 30% of our total HIV franchise sales in the fourth quarter of 2007. The Sustiva portion of the Atripla which is distributed back to BMS and reflected in the cost of goods sold line was approximately $96 million or 37% of Atripla sales in the fourth quarter of 2007. Although, the EU collaboration is structured somewhat differently from the North American joint-venture Gilead will still pay BMS for the Sustiva portion of Atripla sales in the EU and product sales and cost of goods sold will be impacted similarly. We booked minimal sales of Atripla in the EU in the fourth quarter and we're reminding you here for future reference.</p>
          <p>Viread sales were $148 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, down 7% from the same period in 2006 due primarily to lower sales volume in the US, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of 4% when compared to the same period in 2006. Viread sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 remained strong and stayed relatively flat sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Hepsera for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B generated sales of $77 million in the fourth quarter 2007, up 70% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 of which approximately 7% was driven by the favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Hepsera sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 experienced a 3% decrease sequentially. In the United States, Hepsera sales increased by 4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, and decreased by 11% sequentially.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2007, there was a slight reduction in Hepsera inventory held at the wholesalers, but the inventory level remained within our contractual band. Fourth quarter 2007 Hepsera sales in the EU increased by 20% when compared to the same period last year, and decreased by 1% sequentially. The increase in EU Hepsera sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 was driven primarily by sales volume growth in the European territories.</p>
          <p>Finally, sales of AmBisome were $68 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 16% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 of which approximately 9% was driven by favorable foreign currency environment. AmBisome sales decreased by 1% sequentially. Our royalty, contract and other revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased by 48% compared to the same quarter of 2006, and decreased by 29% sequentially. These decreases were primarily driven by lower Tamiflu royalty revenues recognized from Tamiflu sales made by Roche due to lower pandemic purchases.</p>
          <p>Royalties received from Roche and recognized in our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $46 million. Those royalties which are paid one quarter in arrears reflect a royalty rate of approximately 22% as applied to Roche's sales of Tamiflu during the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>As you may be aware, Roche is currently scheduled to report fourth quarter 2007 earnings on Wednesday of next week. We expect on that call Roche will provide estimated 2008 Tamiflu pandemic sales guidance.</p>
          <p>Now turning to product gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2007 which excludes stock based compensation expense is approximately 79% compared to non-GAAP product gross margin of approximately 80% for the same quarter of 2006, and 80% to the third quarter of 2007. The lower product gross margin when compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the higher portion of Atripla sales. Remember Atripla sales carry the [ind] portion at zero gross margin, so what you are seeing is the simple impact of sales being slightly more weighted towards Atripla.</p>
          <p>Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 which excludes stock-based compensation expense were $159 million. This was an increase of 73% from $98 million in the same period last year and a $47 million or 30% increase from the third quarter of 2007 primarily as a result of increased license payments made to Gilead's corporate partners related to our collaborations, increased clinical study expenses as well as higher head counts driven both organically as well as by the absorption of acquisitions made in late 2006. As you may recall in the fourth quarter of 2007, we paid a $20 million upfront license fee to LG Life Sciences Limited which was included in R&amp;D expenses and which we disclosed at the time &#x2013; at the time we announced the transaction. As John mentioned, we are seeing good progress in enrolling patients in our two Phase III studies [ind] and you see the financial impact of that here as well.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 which excludes stock-based compensation expense were $155 million, an increase of 29% compared to $128 million in the same period last year to primarily to increase marketing, promotional and other expenses in support of our antiviral and cardiovascular programs as well as higher head counts especially in our cardiovascular business.</p>
          <p>On a sequential basis, non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased by 11% from $148 million from the third quarter 2007 to primarily to increase marketing, promotional and other expenses in support of our antiviral and cardiovascular programs.</p>
          <p>Our pre tax earnings, foreign exchange had a net favorable impact of $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 when compared to the same period last year and an $11 million net favorable impact when compared to the third quarter of 2007. This favorable impact takes into account the product sales and expenses generated from outside the United States as well as our hedging activities.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 26.1%. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 before the acquisition related in process R&amp;D expenses was 27.6%. Our full year 2007 effective tax rate was 28.9%, a decrease from the 31.4% effective tax rate for 2006 before the in-process R&amp;D expenses. The lower effective tax rates were primarily driven by increased earnings in favorable tax jurisdiction and a lower state effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>Next I'd like to turn to our operating cash flow performance for the quarter and finally our net cash positions at the year-end. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we generated $512 million in operating cash flow bringing total operating cash flow generated for the year to a record $1.8 billion. We also repurchased $33 million of our common shares this quarter through our $3 billion stock repurchase program bringing our total repurchases of common shares to $488 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet at December 31, 2007 showed cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. This is an increase of $504 million when compared to the balance of 2.2 billion at the end of September 30, 2007. We continue to actively evaluate strategic ways to use our cash and investments including continuing our efforts to pursue opportunities to in-license or acquire products to complement our own internal efforts. We're also clearly committed to returning cash to our stockholders as is evidenced by the $1 billion stock repurchase program we completed in the second quarter 2007 and our new $3 billion stock repurchase program which we initiated at the end of 2007 and which we intend to complete within the next three years.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn to the financial guidance for the full year 2008. You can locate all of our guidance for the 2007 year on Gilead's corporate website. Our guidance for the full year 2008 product sales is in the range of 4.7 to $4.8 billion which is approximately a 26 to 29% increase over 2007.</p>
          <p>To be clear, this product sales guidance is for direct product sales only, and does not include royalty, contract and other revenue. This guidance also does not include any potential sales for Aztreonam Lysine, for inhalation for CF or for Viread specifically for HBV, consistent with our practice of non-issuing guidance prior to product approval and initial launch.</p>
          <p>As a reminder the product gross margin and expense guidance, we are providing today will be non-GAAP which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Providing non-GAAP product gross margin guidance for the full year 2008 was 77 to 79%. The lower product gross margin compared to 2007 is entirely due to the expected higher mix of Atripla revenue from both the US and the EU, which includes the [ind] portion zero gross profit partially offset by product gross margin improvement driven by lower API cost.</p>
          <p>Providing non-GAAP R&amp;D expense guidance for 2008 from 610 to $630 million which is an approximately 18 to 21% increase over the 2007 non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense. The expected growth in R&amp;D expenses is primarily driven by the expectation of our product candidate entering and progressing into late stage clinical studies, including darusentan,  persistent hypertension, and Elvitegravir for HIV. As well as continuation of our Phase III Viread for HBV studies and initiation of the Phase IV program for Letairis.</p>
          <p>Providing non-GAAP SG&amp;A guidance of 710 to $730 million and approximately 17 to 21% increase over 2007 non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense. As expected, increase in SG&amp;A expenses over 2007 spending reflects anticipated higher head count and spending to support our business growth including expansion of the European footprint in the Nordics and Benelux as well as the cost associated with anticipated launches of Atripla in the EU, Viread for HBV in both the US and the EU and Aztreonam Lysine for Inhalation for Cystic Fibrosis in the US.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2008 is expected to be in the range of 29 to 30% compared to the 28.9% effective tax rate for the full year of 2007. We expect the tax rate benefit from increased earnings and favorable tax jurisdiction to be offset by the expiration of the federal R&amp;D tax credit on December 31, 2007. Regarding stock based compensation expense we expect the 2008 fully diluted per share impact to be in the range of 0.12 to $0.14 compared to $0.14 per diluted share in 2007. The 2007 stock based compensation expense reflects the impact of Myogen and Corus unvested stock options that we assumed as part of the acquisition some of which had accelerated vesting due to employee transition.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, our solid operating performance continues to be a validation of the significant efforts made by the more than 2,900 Gilead employees around the world. We remain committed to driving performance for our shareholders by working to improve the lives of patients around the world. At this point I would like to turn the call over to Kevin who will discuss our commercial highlights for the quarter. Kevin?</p>

          <p>Thank you John and good afternoon everyone. 2007 was an extraordinary year for Gilead's sales and marketing operations. New product launches and expanded presence in Europe as well as products which are pending approvals have paved the way for what we expect to be a very exciting 2008. In anticipation of the launch of Atripla and the expected approval of Viread for HBV we expanded our European operations in 2007 by opening marketing subsidiaries in three additional countries, taking our total European presence to 11 countries. We believe we are well positioned to successfully execute on our 2008 marketing strategy. I would now like to turn to the commercial update for the quarter. I will start with our antiviral franchise, which as you know is comprised of our HIV and HBV marketed products. For the analysis of our market share data in the US and Europe, we rely on the most up to date third party data available to us in each market. As a reminder, this data lags behind our financial results by one quarter. Our US HIV franchise performance remained the best in the industry in Q3 of 2007. And the gap between Gilead and our closest competitors continued to widen.</p>
          <p>Atripla built on its leadership position in the US as approximately 25% of the estimated 514,000 patients or just under 130,000 patients were on  Atripla therapy. For the fourth consecutive quarter since the launch of Atripla over 80% of treatment na&#xEF;ve patients started therapy with one of Gilead's products with approximately 55% taking Atripla, 25% on a Truvada regimen and 1% initiating on a Viread-based regimen.</p>
          <p>In patients switching to Atripla from other therapies approximately 49% were from non- Gilead based regimens, primarily Combivir patients at 21% of total such patients. As demonstrated by two consecutive quarters of sales growth, Truvada continued to be the backbone of choice for antiviral therapy in the US, with an estimated 160,000 patients receiving Truvada. This represents approximately 31% of all patients treated with antiretrovirals. Notably 64% of all US patients or 330,000 received a tenofovir molecule during the third quarter in one of its three forms namely Atripla, Truvada, or Viread.</p>
          <p>We continued to make good progress with our HIV products in Europe and believe that with the launch of Atripla, we will be able to further strength our position. In late December Gilead along with our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb announced the approval of Atripla in the 27 countries that comprised the European Union as well as in Norway and Iceland. We have already shipped product to wholesalers and hospitals in the UK, Germany and Austria where our sales representatives have begun detailing Atripla. The rest of the European Union will follow over the course of the year. We will market Atripla with BMS in most of Europe while BMS will be primarily responsible for marketing in several countries in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Atripla sales across the majority of Europe will be captured essentially in the same way that it is in the US. Gilead will record revenues and distribute back to BMS the SUSTIVA portion of Atripla as reflected in our cost of goods sold line. We're very excited to offer the first once-daily single tablet regimen throughout the EU and we anticipate similar uptake dynamics in each country as we have seen when we launched Atripla in the US.</p>
          <p>The estimated market opportunity in just the big five countries alone is now 250,000 patients on antiretroviral therapy. This population grew at an estimated rate of 9% year-over-year. Truvada's continued to build on its strong base throughout the EU. By the end of the third quarter of 2007 we estimated that approximately 100,000 patients of just under 40% of all treated patients within the big five EU markets were being treated with Truvada. In the big five EU markets Truvada plus Sustiva was the leading treatment regimen up 14% followed by Truvada plus Kaletra at 9% and Truvada plus Reyataz at 6%. In naive patients approximately 60% of the patients initiated therapy on Truvada. Having the top three regimens pushed Europe in exactly the same starting points as the US was when Atripla was launched in mid-2006. Truvada is now the number one brand throughout the big five markets while tenofovir is the leading molecule in Germany and Spain. When [ind] anticipate we will achieve the same position in the other countries in the coming quarters. As John Martin mentioned in 2007 significant progress was made in the US as well as in the EU to continue to reduce the barriers to test it and to accelerate the initiation of treatment. These steps will continue to add growth to the treated HIV patient population in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to our hepatitis franchise, during the fourth quarter of 2007 in the United States, Hepsera continue to be the leading antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. As of the end of December 2007, Hepsera maintained its place as market leader with a total prescription share of just over 45%, in the Gilead territories outside the US, Hepsera continued to grow as well. We anticipate the approval of Viread for HBV in the EU and US later this year and commercially we are already preparing for a launch in these markets. We believe we have the infrastructure in place to support a successful launch without the need for major restructuring effort.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our cardiovascular franchise and Letairis for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH. We're very pleased with the recent performance of Letairis, as well as the market trends we have been seeing. We're beginning to hit full stride in our launch. We now have approximately 3,200 physicians enrolled in our Letairis Education and Access Program, otherwise known as LEAP. Although only a subset of these physicians are prescribers, they are all part of the physician referring base that others turn to, and an important groove for expanding awareness and diagnosis of the disease.</p>
          <p>To-date, nearly 800 physicians have prescribed Letairis.  And during the fourth quarter, we recorded approximately $15 million in Letairis sales. Letairis patients are coming from four primary sources; new patients to therapy, patients that have accelerated LFTs that have been taking bosentan, patients who were initiated on PDE-5 inhibitors and have not responded to therapy, and patients that discontinued STRIDE-3 clinical program. Moreover we've seen &#x2013; we've observed a small cohort of patients switch from bosentan because of poor efficacy.</p>
          <p>On the reimbursement front, Allstate Medicaid plans and the top managed care plans are reimbursing Letairis at an equivalent tiering to Tracleer. Structural changes we have implemented since the launch of Letairis to our LEAP program as well as recent modifications in our Risk Minimization Action Plan or RiskMAP have been positively received and are helping to reduce barriers to treatment.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe we're well positioned to continue to build upon the very solid first six months of Letairis.</p>
          <p>In closing, I'm personally very proud of what the whole commercial organization accomplished in 2007. And I'm excited about the many opportunities we have ahead of those to continue to deliver upon our sales goals, while maintaining a diligent focus on operational excellence and business compliance.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question and answer portion of the call. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on an outstanding year. Just wanted to maybe understand Atripla a little bit better, so if I can do a two part question. First is, you seem like you have gotten, the most you are going to get as far as the step function of new patients into therapy based on the new testing, the dropping of consent laws, and I wondered if you guys could also look out longer term and talk about the new NNRTI class etravirine and TMC278 and how you look at those competitively and how it might impact the Atripla franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mike with regard to the step function that you are describing, I think what you are saying is that we've done a lot of work to try to push more patients into care and has that actually been completed in fact its very, very early in that stage of development of bringing new patients into care. I think also we are getting 80% of those new starts; certainly we are not satisfied with 80% of those patients, but obviously bringing more patients' into care benefits us greatly. So we will continue to work with public health officials, government officials and thought leaders in the industry to increase testing to increase awareness to try to take that 25% of patients who don't know they have HIV and help them figure out that they have a disease that they can spread quite readily.</p>
          <p>The second portion of this with regard to the new zero type compounds etravirine which just came to market in 278. I guess, its fair to say that etravirine as a salvage agent, it's going to be used in combination with other products, I don't see that as being competitive with Atripla that was your specific question because its really its excluded from treatment naive patients and as a twice a day product, I don't think it has much of a use in those, in those patients. It could potentially be competitive with viral immune I would say. With 278 from what we understand, from what's out there are, there are some issues with 278 and it's going to take a longer to develop and maybe at a lower dose than was previously thought. So, we're going to standby and watch and see how that product profile evolves over time, but it's clearly going to be delayed more significantly than people have thought, even maybe six months ago. So, I don't see a huge competitive threat there at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just add to that Mike. You've seen in this quarter of the data of the Q3 data that now Atripla is taken over in terms of the naive patients to 55%. So, it's now moved from Truvada to Atripla. And so, I think that's a very strong position and shows the importance of having a one tablet, once a day regiment for compliance and avoidance of resistant. So, I think that's a very strong position to be in, and shows the, shows the importance of having that as a once daily regiment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mike if I just may add something else as well. From a clinical perspective Atripla I think, establishes a very high hurdle bar for other compounds to come in because of the tolerability and safety of the regiment and the single pill once daily and also the long-term data as you know we have now clinical data. We have extended our 903 study to 10 years. So, in two years from now we will have 10 years of clinical safety and efficacy data on this particular regiment, that's a very high hurdle bar for future compounds to over come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. I had a question on the HIV drugs and then one on Letairis. For the HIV trends in US, they were a little bit light relative to what we might have expected from some of the prescription data sources. Can you help us understand if there were any other factors on changes within the pre specified wholesaler ranges &#x2013; wholesaler inventory ranges or non-retail sales during the quarter?  And then on Letairis, the 15 million number for the fourth quarter seems a little bit low relative to the metrics that you had provided on the last call and some of the extrapolations that we were all doing. Are you seeing good expansion among the original 450 docks who you had last quarter or is most of the growth there just coming from some initial trialing among the new 350 docks that you added during the quarter?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Tom, let's start with the HIV numbers. Yeah, we did see pretty significant draw down of our inventory within our US wholesalers. So it went from on the higher end of the range to fairly low, still within the contractual bands. We saw that across all the HIV products and [ind] announcing Hepsera as well. So that was one of the reasons there was a slight disconnect. Outside of the retail market, the non-retail segment was fairly stronger in the course of the quarter, so I think most of the, as you put it lightness would be due to the draw down of inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tom, on Letairis, as you've seen we moved from 450 prescribers to up to 800, so I think that's a fairly significant increase in physicians who have at least tried Letairis in one patient so I think that's very encouraging. Whilst we're not including it in numbers for competitive reasons, yes, we did see an increase in some of the larger prescribers so there is that increase going on. And I think as I said we're seeing prescribing in the four main buckets and what I would also add is I am encouraged by seeing those early patients who were not doing well on bosentan. And I think that's an encouraging sign for the positioning of Letairis going forward. I think what we're also hearing is I think the interaction between sildenafil ambrisentan if you look closely at the sildenafil label and you see how bosentan affects the dosing of the ratio of sildenafil. I think not to have that interaction is a very positive profile for Letairis is now coming through.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. And my congratulations, I'll ask the question, I know you won't answer it, but it's my job to do it. Looks like your product sales guidance is 100 to 200 million above the street. I know you won't break it down, but can I don't know John if you can help us at all when we're building our models where the difference may be &#x2013; your internal projections versus the street. Should we be looking at HIV, is that really the message here?  And if you won't answer that, I've got another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a very complicated question even to answer if I could. The street consensus has a wide variety of models that feed into it. So, there are people with different opinions of different products. I think if you think about us for the next year, there is a lot to think about with regard to HIV growth, particularly in Europe. As Kevin mentioned earlier, because we're so much earlier in the launch of Atripla in Europe then we are in the United States, it's really almost as if we were 2 years back there, because we're getting 65% of patients, so there is good opportunity there. We do have good opportunity across all our product lines, obviously Viread launching late in the year for HBV, we're not including that product guidance, and we're certainly not at the point where we can give any guidance on the street right now, there are bits and pieces that are missing there. But unfortunately Mark, I can't give any greater color on it than that, but thank you for the nice thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair, that was colorful enough, I appreciate it. And because the follow-up on that is, in thinking about the European launch for Atripla, how should we think about that modeling it over the year, I know you are not going to give of course guidance obviously, but can you walk us through kind of key milestones that are going to happen over the year with regard to reimbursement etcetera, things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark, it's Kevin. Well good news is, we've already shipped out product in our three first markets, actually this week we just got some really good news for the UK, and that's that the London consortium, which is basically approximately 65% of your HIV business in the UK, just listed Atripla at the pricing that we wanted, which is our target of one plus one, so that now allows London hospitals to begin their usage of Atripla so that was a very nice milestone for us. In terms of the rest of the markets &#x2013; and we're particularly obviously concerned about France, Spain, Italy &#x2013; we think it will be approximately about a 9 month rollout in terms of pricing and reimbursements. Again, our target is one plus one pricing, and we think we can get that in about three quarters of the year, which would be a little bit under what we achieved with Truvada. So, our expectation is certainly during 2008, we will have all the big five and hopefully, one or two additional countries like Portugal that make nice additions to our European sales.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, prior to the three quarters from now, will there be meaningful sales in France, Spain, and Italy?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. A couple of questions quickly on HIV, Kevin you mentioned that 64% of treated patients are now on some sort of tenofovir based regimen. And could you confirm that, but also give us a sense of what you think there must be a maximum for what that can get to and what you think that is, because obviously at some point patients are going to be resistant to tenofovir and go on to other medications?  And could you give us a sense of what the comparable number is today in the EU, and where it might go to?  And then I just wanted to ask about the integrase inhibitor John, you mentioned quickly about the Elvitegravir Phase III trial. Could you give us a little bit more detail about the dose, the ritonavir boosting, and then the comparator, the patient population? Because I think that would be useful, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, I may not answer quite in the right order. But if you take Europe, we've now got 40% of all patients on Truvada, I am not quite sure but we can follow up on total tenofovir for you. The other thing I pull out with Europe is that we've now achieved 60% of new patients. Now, if I compare that to where we were going into the launch of Atripla, and we're one quarter behind that in terms of data for Europe, the US was at 66% Truvada in naive patients. So you can see we've virtually got to the same basis of launch of Atripla in Europe that we had for launch in the US. In terms of how much farther we can go, and I think the same comment applies to both US and Europe, we still think we can go further. We believe we've got the preferred product in Atripla and obviously, we double detail with Truvada. What's also very encouraging is that if a patient comes off Atripla 85 to 90% of the time they are going on to a Truvada based regimen with a PI. So, we think we are in a very strong position. So, I just left a National Sales Meeting, Monday, Tuesday and I can tell you, our expectation is to continue that growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Kevin, if I may answer the question about Elvitegravir quickly. So it's two identical -- two studies of identical design. One is primarily being carried out in the US, one in Europe. Each study will have three arms, about 240 patients per arm. And they are randomized 1:1:1 to 2 doses of Elvitegravir. So either 150 or 300 milligrams and the control arm is raltegravir at the commercial dose. You are correct. Elvitegravir has to be given, ritonavir boosted and the way we deal with this in the protocol is we require patients to be on the boosted protease inhibitor. So that will take care of the boosting. And we have confirmed that in numerous drug interaction studies that we have carried out over the last two years or so. And then the endpoint is fairly simple, it's the proportion of patients that are below 50 copies per mL at week 48, it's a non-inferiority design with a delta of 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Geoff sorry, back to me, just dug out the number for you. We've achieved just over 50% share for the tenofovir molecule in the big five markets and that are very, very close and I would expect to cross 3TC very, very soon. So it's very, very close to becoming the leading molecule.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats again on a good performance. John, I'll stick to the one question rule, just had a quick question on, I'm not sure you can answer this, but relating to Tamiflu, can you give us a little bit of sense as to what are you &#x2013; I know you can't give us guidance, but what are you seeing at the year ahead on Tamiflu?  And then as presumably as stockpiling demand dries up, how do you look at that drop in royalty revenues, as a kind of marker as to how much you are willing to spend on your expense line, so another way of asking that, are you managing your expenses as a percentage of product sales and so the contract revenues might not impact you as much? I'm just trying to understand how you think about your expense structure. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question Yaron. So, we don't have any -- we don't know what Roche's numbers are. So we can't give you even any body language into what will happen next week. We have been saying somewhat echoing what they've been saying is that we expect those pandemic orders to be down substantially year-over-year without having a definition of what substantially means in recognizing that it's fairly fluid product category because, birds showing up at different parts of world can have effects or not depending on what happens over the course of the year. But we do expect it to be down substantially year-over-year. Roche will not give product guidance for seasonal prophylaxis use of individuals. So that won't be part of their guidance. And again we're not sure what that's going to play out, but I did want to &#x2013; I do want to say a couple of things, they said most of the orders that they have were mostly sold in 2007. So it didn't sound like there are a lot of orders that were left to be filled in 2008 and I don't know what the magnitude of those orders are. And also about the seasonal issue, we were just alerted that there is heightened flu throughout Europe. We don't know what that's going to mean Roche sales; it has been a fairly mild season in the US as well.</p>
          <p>So, it's one of those things where we can't say much more than that because that's about all we know about how the product is going to behave during the course of the year. And then the second part of your one question was about the -- how we manage the business, and it really relates to percentages of products sales -- our own product sales because that's the only way you really can manage a business since Tamiflu is completely out of our hands at this point in time so that's how we are looking at it, we do manage it very efficiently. So, there is not a lot that you could do up or down, certainly down to decrease expenses given all the exciting things we have to work on.</p>

          <p>Question on gross margin, Atripla is now accounting for in '07, roughly 20% of revenues, yet your margin from '06 to '07 is only down 300 basis points, what can you tell us about that, it's -- why it's been better performing, is it a better contribution from for instance Truvada doing better market growth, and then an extrapolation of those answers looking to 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, why is our gross margin better than you would predict, I think there is a couple of answers in there, one of which of course relies on currency, the effect of prices in dollars as many of our products have gone up so that's helped us somewhat. We have also worked very hard on initiatives behind the scenes to lower all our manufacturing costs so trying to drive down our API cost including differing outsourcing strategies, bringing in different contractors to lower our raw material costs and importantly moving on the profit itself, so we have a lot of people just trying to improve the efficiency of manufacturing by getting more out for each reaction that we run and that's actually been quite successful. So, across our product mix we have been doing that and that's really helped offset some of the decreases that would otherwise occur with Atripla and it's really those two reasons.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Quick question with respect to the market for PAH and Letairis ambrisentan. Actelion had just reported, I guess roughly 16% growth of bosentan or Tracleer, can you describe a little bit as to what you are thinking is occurring in that market, where we are getting those both in your product and theirs from?  And how do you think that will progress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi William, it's obviously difficult for us to talk about the competitive sales, so I mean they did drop by 10% in the third quarter and then back up by 16%. So, how you interpret that I &#x2013; that's probably best left for Actelion. I think, the good news is that with the noise from both companies and additions from people like United Health that there is a lot of noise out there. The very fact that we have increased the prescriber base by almost 80% over the quarter, I think is an indication that there is a bigger group of physicians outside the big PAH centers that are aware that PAH, many of them largely refer in to the big centers and we certainly support that. Our educational efforts are very much targeted to the opinion leaders with their large centers and many of them rely on these networks and we fully support that especially. So, I think the fact that you've got a lot of education in the area and a lot of promotion in the area is making the ability to pick up PAH higher among certainly physicians who see PAH in the first instance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's actually Michael, but thank you for taking the call. I guess I am going to ask a question on 9190. Can you give us &#x2013; can you remind us again because I want to get a, what's the doses you used already and what the efficacy you saw in that Phase I trial? And then can you give us more color as to the millisecond change in QT at the 40 and the 120 that give you comfort that the QT prolongation will be manageable? I mean I guess with that what typical amoxafloxin controlled QT is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Michael just a quick update, we can also call you afterwards if you want more details about this. But we tested in the original study and the current study the 40 and the 120 milligram BID dose. At both doses we saw significant and fairly large reductions in <mark type="inaudible" /> they range from about 0.5 logs to 2 logs depending on what you look at is it 1A, genotype 1A or 1B it differed somewhat, and we don't really have enough patients in either group to definitively say what the viral log reduction was. Now we did observe and confirm at the 120 mg dose definitively a QTc effect. At a 40 mg dose we saw the effect was still there, but we have now consulted a number of cardiologists and the consensus opinion was that this was definitely a clinically manageable issue. And we now are in the process of reinitiating dosing in this study and of course what we have to do first is talk to regulatory authorities what they think about this. The QTc effect was less than 10 milliseconds. As you know also with only a smaller number of patients it's really difficult to say what exactly the effect was and it's also complicated by the fact that there are a number of different corrections that you can do for heart beat and all those corrections give you a slightly different number. But, again the overall message is that that effect that we see is clinically manageable and we are confident that we can move forward with the program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I have two very quick questions; one is on the inventory ranges you mentioned that it was at the low end of your contracted range?  Is there normally progression to the mean, does it, do we expect it to come back around the mean levels over the next quarter?  And secondly just on the Letairis combination trials, can you give us some timelines as to when we can actually start looking at some data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Sapna, so yes things tend to regress towards the mean and we were a little bit on the high side. We came down farther than we would have predicted based on the historical way these things fluctuate, but came down to the very low end. So that's not the worst thing in the world to happen to us at the end of the year, so I wasn't unhappy with it. My expectation is that it will probably slowly regress towards the mid line of that, but I can't say for sure that that will happen because it's a difficult process to predict how wholesalers' behave over the course of the years. And I guess the second thing is the Letairis studies are designed to be &#x2013; initiate dosing in the second quarter, so depending on the enrollment I think it wouldn't be until next year that you would start to see data on that, so 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for asking that question Joel. So, there was a press release that came out today from <mark type="inaudible" /> patent, and I think if you read through that it certainly seems very misleading to me in terms of what has actually occurred with some exaggeration in there. So basically what happened is what we thought would happen. Initially there were two patents which were rejected. There were two more that were potentially going to be rejected. We had, talking to both, we expected that to happen and in fact it did a couple of days ago. And so now, this allows us to go back and so these are non-final rejections, so that's important, as were the initial ones, and this now allows us to go back in and submit more data back to the patent agency and begin to work with them towards defending the claims that we think are fully valid.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Can you help us quantify the impacted new treatment guidelines recommending treatment at CD4 counts below 350, I mean is it appropriate to think of this as a whole list of new patients coming on say in 2008, 2009 and then just kind of leveling off in terms of growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually quite difficult to sort of quantify finding data around a number of patients with various CD4 counts is quite hard. One of the data sources we have looked specifically at the so-called ADAP patients. Those are the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs and about half of those patients present at 350 or below, so a significant portion.  Now ADAP patients make up certainly about 27% of our overall patient group here in the US. But, I think it's still the case that there are many patients 350 and below presenting both in the US and in Europe. So, I think it's going to be a big encouragement for physicians to begin prescribing earlier. I think the opinion leaders in the major centers are already there. What really helps us with these guidelines from a promotional point of view and with our medical sciences in the field is I think it's more of the general HIV physician who adheres more closely or takes there time in changing there practice with the patients staffs. And so I think it's going to very much help us with a what we call the lower decile physicians to encourage them to be beginning antiretroviral therapy specifically Atripla, Truvada in new patients.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. My question is on the European market for your drugs, you mentioned that there is 250,000 or so patients in the big 5 European countries with HIV. But my read of the literature suggests there are many times in the -- non big five countries, and then particularly in the countries in Eastern Europe. So, my question is what can you do to access those markets, is it realistic to think over the next several years, you could have meaningful sales in none big five countries or is the reimbursement environment in those none big five countries such that you'll never really have meaningful sales there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a bit of both, it's clearly a lot of HIV in some of the Eastern block countries certainly just the HIV in Russia is talked about a great deal. Some of those countries have, as you say lower pricing, poor reimbursement, and just access to HIV therapy is more restricted, what is I think interesting about Europe is to see some of the movements of populations. So, there is HIV going into countries like Germany, particularly the UK right now from the migration, economic migration of populations from the Eastern side of Europe. So, they then going into the healthcare system, because their employed people and therefore qualify for the National Health Systems, and so, we'll increase the treatable population. So, I think it will be slower in terms of up tick of our HIV therapist in the Eastern European countries, we do operate right now largely through distributors countries like a Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia. We will be thinking about whether there comes a time to put Gilead as an affiliate into those countries. So, we'll be thinking about that. But I think it's going to be a little bit slow in those countries. But they will in the long-term get there and become I think a bigger proportion of our sales contribution.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and let me add my congratulations on a great year. Just a question on the, the price increases for Atripla, Truvada and Hepsera in January. Whether wholesalers were given an option to buy in or continued option to buy in related to those price increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Ian, its Kevin. Yes there is an option because that's part of our inventory management agreements that we have with four major wholesalers so that is standard &#x2013; the standard calculation. As you know we put those in place few years ago and so that's kind of a standard calculation. And it's also one of the reasons that we typically tried to announce a price change early in the quarter to allow that to, that increase to then, to then move down during the quarter. So that's the reason those price increases came in, in January the 1st.</p>
