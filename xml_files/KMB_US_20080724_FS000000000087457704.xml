        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David.  Good morning, everyone.  We appreciate your interest in Kimberly-Clark.  With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Randy Vest, Vice President and Controller.  Here's the agenda for today's call.  Mark will start with a review of our second quarter results, then Tom will provide his perspective, and that will leave us with plenty of time for Q&amp;A.  For those wishing to follow along, we have a presentation of today's materials in the investors' section of our website, kimberly-clark.com.</p>
          <p>First, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call today.  There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated.  Please refer to the Risk Factors section of our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin.  Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results and operations.  For additional information on why we make these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, see today's news release as well as additional information on our website.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, and good morning.  I'm going to briefly review the quarter and I'll start with sales.</p>
          <p>The top line remains very healthy with organic growth in excess of 7%, which is at the high end of this 5 to 7% range we're now expecting for the full year.  Higher sales volumes and net selling prices each contributed three points of growth and product mix was favorable as well.  A 4% benefit from currency exchange rates brought total sales growth to 11%.</p>
          <p>Now let me review the top line for each of our segments.  In personal care sales climbed 15%, driven by strong volume growth of 9%.  Higher net selling prices added two points of top-line growth while currency benefited sales by 4%. In North America sales volumes increased 8% and net selling prices advanced 1%.  Volume growth was broad based including a 10% gain for Huggies diapers.  In addition, our child care and adult care brands delivered high single-digit volume increases spurred by innovations rolled out over the last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to Europe, personal care sales volumes were off 5%.  Despite solid growth in Huggies baby wipes and our child care brands, those increases were more than offset by lower diaper volumes and a continued competitive promotional environment.</p>
          <p>In the developing emerging markets, personal care sales jumped 25%, the fifteenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.  Sales volumes increased more than 14%, highlighted by low 30s growth in the fast growing BRICIT countries, double-digit growth in Latin America overall and also in South Korea.</p>
          <p>Now turning to consumer tissue, sales rose 8%, including four points of benefit from currency.  Our focus on increasing revenue realization drove a five-point gain in net selling prices with good progress here in the U.S. and in most international geographies.  Improved product mix also benefited sales while volumes fell about 3%.</p>
          <p>In North America net sales fell 1%, as higher net selling prices of 5% were more than offset by lower volumes.  The majority of the volume decline came from two areas.  First, towel volumes were down following the price increases we implemented in the first quarter and in comparison to a strong year ago result.  And second, consistent with the first quarter, volume comparisons were impacted by our decision to shed some low-margin businesses at the end of last year in order to improve revenue realization and to support growth of higher margin offerings.  Meanwhile, both Cottonelle and Scott Bath Tissue delivered solid increases in sales overall.</p>
          <p>Switching to Europe, consumer tissue organic sales growth was about 1%.  Although sales volumes fell 3%, that was more than offset by higher net selling prices of 4% as we've raised prices in the UK, Italy and various other markets. In the developing emerging markets, consumer tissue organic sales rose 14%, led by our business in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Now moving to K-C Professional and other, sales increased 10%, including four points of benefit from currency.  Organic sales were up 6%, driven by higher net selling prices of 3% and improved product mix of 2%.  Overall sales volumes were up 1% in the quarter.  KCP organic sales in both North America and Europe rose about 6%, driven by net selling price benefits of three and 4%, respectively.  Sales volumes advanced 1% in both geographies and mix improved nicely in North America as well.</p>
          <p>Also our KCP's business-building efforts in the developing emerging markets helped drive organic sales growth of about 17% in the second quarter.  Lastly, health care segment sales increased 3%.  Top line growth was driven by higher volumes of 5% and currency benefits of 2%.  These gains were partially offset by lower net selling prices and product mix, each down 2%, reflecting continued competitive conditions in the surgical supplies market in North America.  As expected, health care volume comparisons improved from our recent trends with the impacts of our decision to exit the latex glove category and prior year avian flu preparedness benefits now fully behind us.</p>
          <p>Our higher margin medical device portfolio delivered double digit volume growth in the quarter.  We also had double-digit gains in exam gloves due to the growth in our Nitrile business.</p>
          <p>Now to move to operating profit and cost savings, and for this discussion I'll refer to adjusted operating profit and margin, which exclude certain charges related, detailed in this morning's news release.  Second quarter operating profit fell 2% to $665 million with an operating margin of 13.3%.  Profitability was impacted by significant cost inflation, which totaled about $180 million in the quarter. As we mentioned in last week's communication, inflation was approximately $50 million, or about $0.08 per share higher than we estimated heading into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite the inflation, we continue to reinvest in our brands.  Strategic marketing investments increased by nearly $25 million in the second quarter, rising faster than sales.  Margins were also impacted by planned production down time in order to improve our inventory position.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cost savings, total savings were nearly $40 million in the second quarter.  Our ongoing force program generated savings of $1 million in the quarter.  That compares to our strongest performance, quarterly performance a year ago.  This year's results also included higher spending levels at some of our facilities, as well as some efficiency losses from the planned production downtime we took in the quarter.  We expect our fourth savings to pick up in the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the strategic cost reduction plan, we realized $38 million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter, and we're tracking to exceed our original target for the year.  So, in total, we still expect to deliver total cost savings for 2008 in the 200 to $250 million range.</p>
          <p>Now let's look briefly at second quarter segment operating margins.  As I mentioned in last week's conference call, the rapid increase in cost inflation has pressured margins in all four of our segments.  With that said, I am encouraged that Personal Care margins remained in excess of 20% in the second quarter.  Further, K-C Professional and other segment profitability improved sequentially with more net selling price benefits.  Besides the input cost inflation, both Consumer Tissue and Health Care margins were impacted by production downtime related to inventory management, and Health Care is also incurring some duplicate costs as it streamlines its manufacturing footprint.</p>
          <p>Now switching briefly to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 30.1%.  It's toward the low end of our previous guidance for a rate in the 30 to 32% range.  Based on what we know now, the third quarter 2008 adjusted rate should be in the 28 to 30% range.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to cash flow on the balance sheet, cash provided by operations was $753 million in the quarter, that's up 16% from the year ago period mainly because of a decreased level of investment in primary working capital.  And I have to say I'm encouraged by our focus on improving inventories which led to a three-day decline in days of inventory on hand compared to the first quarter.  Now having said that, we're still above year-ago levels and we're not quite to where we need to be, but it's great progress.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital spending, we invested $213 million in the quarter.  That brings the year-to-date amount to $434 million, which is in line with our full-year investment target of 850 to $950 million.  Regarding share repurchases, we bought back 3.5 million shares of our stock at a cost of about $220 million during the quarter.  As previously announced, we expect to buy back 700 to $800 million worth of KC stock in 2008.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up the financial review.  To recap the quarter, we delivered strong top-line growth.  Our margins were weighed down by significant and unanticipated cost inflation, and we remain focused on improving the long-term health of the company by reinvesting in our brands and businesses and by improving our cash flow.  Now I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.  Since we just spoke to you last week about our results and our outlook for the balance of the year, I'll just comment very briefly, then we'll move right into Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The headline this morning is that our second quarter results reflect continued progress with our growth strategies, as well as the significant challenges we're facing on the cost front.  As I said last week, I'm encouraged that our top line momentum has remained strong.  Thanks to the efforts of our Kimberly-Clark teams around the world, we've delivered organic sales growth of more than 6% through the first half of the year, with particular strength in Personal Care and across developing and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>K-C Professional has also turned in solid sales performance for the quarter and for the year so far.  At the same time, inflationary pressures have intensified dramatically over the last quarter.  It now looks like we'll be absorbing as much as $900 million of commodity costs increases this year and that's more than double our estimate at the beginning of the year.  And the reality is that the rapid run-up in costs has outpaced our ability to offset the impact of those costs in the near term through price increases and through other actions.  We will, however, take the necessary steps to pass along these cost increases and get bottom line results moving in the right direction.  First step is already underway with our Consumer Products and K-C Professional price increases being implemented this quarter in the U.S.  Prices have been raised in a number of other markets as well.  And it's possible that further increases may be warranted.  We're very focused on improving revenue realization in this kind of a high cost environment.</p>
          <p>Second, we're focusing on operating our business efficiently so we're driving productivity, taking costs out of the system, controlling G&amp;A spending, improving our working capital with performance, aggressively doing the things you would expect us to do in this is kind of a cost environment.  Meanwhile, we're going to continue to do the right things for the long-term health of our business so we're stepping up marketing spending to build our brands.  We're bringing innovation to market across our businesses, and we're investing in capital in the right ways and the right amounts to support our growth, particularly in developing and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So our goal is to get back on track with the objectives of our global business plan just as quickly as possible.  And I am very confident that our teams can do this, with a strong culture and the resolve to overcome the short-term cost adversity that we're facing today.</p>
          <p>And moreover, we have a long history of successfully building our business and creating value for our shareholders, which we intend to continue.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you for your interest today and now we'll be happy to begin to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question from Chris Ferrara with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Just wondering if you could talk about the downward movement in volume in the towel business?  Where is that relative to what your exceptions were like?  How is the elasticity in that business? Because it seems that you guys have held volume and others have held volume pretty well so far. Is this sort of the first real sensitivity that you've seen, you know, relative to the last couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'd say a couple of things. First of all, Viva had a tough comparison to a year ago. Viva was up double digits in the second quarter last year so that was part of it was we had picked up some distribution and had some nice volume gains there that were, you know, tougher to annualize and compare against.  We also had a little bit of distribution loss on Scott Towels, so I'd say, overall, we probably would look worse than the category. Having said that, I think that the towel category and the facial tissue category are probably a bit more, economically sensitive. And if the consumer runs out of towels or facial tissue, they don't immediately run out to the store to buy more whereas if they run out of bathroom tissue that's obviously an emergency purchase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on the commentary that came out of Costco earlier in the week, are you guys seeing, I guess, more or less pricing push back from retailers than you did, say, three months ago, and are you finding retailers are eating price increases more than they were before or has none of that changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, you know, retailers are the ones that set the finished product pricing on the shelf.  So that's their call.  Generally, you know, in our categories, we've seen the price increases pretty much be passed through.  So, I'd say in discussions that I've had with retailers recently, they're seeing so many companies come with price increases this environment, they understand it.  They see what's happening in the cost environment and they've probably been more understanding about it in the last three months when oil was, you know, bouncing off the upper 140s than they've been at any time that I can remember.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions, I guess. One is just to continue on that thought on the price realization, the price pass-through to retailers. At least in the North America numbers that you posted today, doesn't look like you're getting much of a price realization.  So, can you explain that a little bit? And what is kind of percolating in the back of my mind at least is -- are the, particularly in Personal Care, what's percolating in the back of my mind is maybe they're passing through the pricing but then they're pushing back on you guys and saying, and you now have to promote, is what the retailers are saying.  So can you walk us through that in particular, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that maybe the gap on Personal Care that maybe hasn't been as visible is that on a couple of the larger account codes our primary competitor rolled back part of the price increase in the second quarter. So they -- to hit a strategic price point, they dialed price back a couple of percent and so that hit us in the second quarter.  But it wasn't really an action by the retailer. It was more of a desire to hit a strategic price point on the larger corrugate packings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so to continue that thought, your volumes are up quite well in Personal Care, particularly in North America.  I mean, is that really all because you're gaining a ton of share, even given the promotion that your competitor is doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if you look at the share results for the period, I think infant care and child care are up a little over or a little under about a share point, which were positive.  Baby wipes was down a little bit. Actually private label share was up a bit in baby wipes. And fem care, we had probably low single digit volume growth, but probably lost about a share point.  Adult care, shares were up about a point.  So I wouldn't say across Personal Care share results -- you had some that were up, some that were down.  I'd say overall, it was probably a slightly positive trend.  But, you know, continued to, you know, to deliver reasonable volume growth in that environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Shifting gears a little bit to, you know, similarly competitive and potentially even more slowing down environment in Europe. Clearly over time you've made some progress on the margins in particular in Europe with the turnaround plan there.  You know, can you give us a little bit of an update about that, an update about the turnaround plan and just get us feeling comfortable that things are actually on track even as we see some of these volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess a couple of things.  If you split Europe into different parts of the business, the part we usually talk about is the consumer business, so I'll start with the Health Care and K.C. Professional business that you don't talk as much about. Those businesses are doing fine in this environment. Actually, K-C Professional, which of you might argue would be the most economically sensitive, had a very solid quarter in Europe overall.  And so we're able to get price realization, driving our wiper and our safety businesses as well as having some reasonable progress on washrooms.  So, the non-consumer side of the business, overall, continues to do fine in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the consumer side, we made, we're basically on track with our profit plan for Personal Care for the year, but at a relatively soft volume quarter.  Now, we've got some product improvements that we're coming into the marketplace; we didn't have the A and P fully turned on until we get full distribution. So you'll start so see us spend more behind the innovation in the third and fourth quarter. Personal Care overall I would say is on track for the year.  Tissue got slammed with a lot of the cost issues that hit our tissue business in North America as well.  You had high energy costs and in Europe a lot of electricity prices went up even more than they did in the U.S., high natural gas costs, high distribution costs that were diesel related, and at a tougher market to get revenue realization in. So we've been pretty aggressive on pushing price up and it's had more of a volume impact on us probably than some of the other competitors might have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last thing I just want to get comfortable with is this force $1 million number.  I mean clearly, I guess 60 million if I remember, about 60 last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a sense of how you're comfortable over the next couple of quarters that's that's actually going to be a ramp up, even though yes, the comps are getting lower or I'm sorry, getting easier versus what it was this quarter last year, but give us a sense of how comfortable you are on those numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when you look at the guts of it, the product specification, productivity improvements, negotiated material savings, which are the things that we have a lot of program-added support around, those were basically coming and tracking as planned.  The big negative other, which had more to do with we took a fair amount of downtime in different businesses this quarter to bring inventories in line.  Probably spent more on maintenance than we were planning which when you've got a machine down, there's a tendency to be able to get your maintenance done.  So one of the things we're going back and making sure is that we're on track with our overall maintenance spending for the year. We just probably loaded more of it into the second quarter than we were planning.  As we rolled up our expected force savings for the year in our most recent forecast, our teams were still planning and committing to come in to the range that we'd anticipated for the year.  So I would expect to continue with the product specification work, the productivity work, the negotiated material price savings, and we shouldn't see the same level of negative other that we had this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question come from Linda Bolton Weiser with Caris and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I was wondering if you could just give all little bit more color on the force savings in the quarter, and you know, exactly what kinds of things are going to be done incrementally, and just can you comment on, it does seem like your, well at least your overhead in the admin cost structure is very lean compared to comparable companies in the industries.  I'm wondering on a go-forward basis, how can you continue with these ongoing cost savings?  And can you talk about that on a longer-term kind of basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.  We just talked -- I don't know if you heard my response to Ali's question about force, but the things that we're doing that were detailed in Mark's remarks around product specifications, productivity, negotiated material price, are all things that we believe are going to continue and help us continue to focus on delivering against our force objectives.  And force is kind of a grass roots program.  If you look through the history of our program, I think we've had over 30 thousand individual cost savings ideas bubbled up by our people around the world.  We've got organized networks within the company that are sharing ideas that are bringing those ideas forward.  Many of our manufacturing teams are beginning to work on the next generation of force to drive an even leaner manufacturing approach into our business operation.</p>
          <p>A lot of the force is focused on cost of sales.  And as you talked about SG&amp;A, the areas there that we're focusing on, a lot of our business process outsourcing work has given us a leaner approach there.  I know Mark Buthman and his teams are focusing on standardizing our processes more, which makes it simpler to update, simpler to operate, makes it easier for us to do business.  So those are areas that we continue to look -- to focus on, getting more efficiency from our between the lines spending, so we can afford to invest more in our brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  And also can I just ask, you know in this time period here when you're performing quite well in Personal Care but you're more challenged on the Tissue side of the business, and I'm sure you've talked about and looked at the possibility of splitting your company up many times in the past, but is that a renewed idea, you know, in this timeframe that we're in?  Can you just kind of put a little color around that?</p>

          <p>We actually believe that with some of the pricing that's coming on the Tissue front that we'll narrow that gap as their margins improve in the back half of the year.  So, again, we go to market as one company with, you know, with one sales organization.  And if you look across our range of brands they really fit the health and hygiene vision that we have for the company.  And so overall we believe the portfolio still works for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just one final question, on the Health Care segment margin in the quarter, it looked unusually low.  I think it was on only about 9.7% or something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there something unusual affecting that in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, they took a fair amount of down time that was related to bringing our inventories into line as well, so they had a share of that negative other that you saw in the force savings that we talked about, was related to some things that were going on there.  They had some higher commodity costs.  A lot the Nitrile gloves, the surgical gowns were all made with oil-derivative products, so a pretty good share of oil inflation as well that flowed through.  Health Care on the surgical side is still a tough competitive market.  They haven't been able to get as much price.  In fact, I think Health Care had negative two points of price in the quarter, so not only are they faced with the higher costs, they've actually had to be more competitive on price in some markets to hold onto the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.  I have questions again on North American Personal Care on the issue of pricing.  I mean, it is normal when pricing is first established that it can be offset with promotional activity for a while.  Should we expect the pricing to take effect more in your numbers going ahead?  And as it does, do you think that your -- are you seeing your volume being hurt at all?  Or are you seeing any downward shift in mix within, say Huggies, to the basic version of Huggies?  And the final piece of that is do you think the Personal Care margins can stay above 20% over the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  On the Personal Care volume standpoint, I'd say that pricing seems to be going into the marketplace a little bit faster than maybe it once had.  So you do have some lead time and some promotional price points that you've committed to that you have to honor, but because there's so many people in the marketplace that are raising price, it's probably happening a little faster than even it has in the past.  So having said that, we will probably still get full realization of this price increase in the fourth quarter, and we'll get some, a lesser amount, in the third quarter.  You know, in our particular case, we're not seeing lot of mix shift on our diaper business. I think Love's share was up a little bit in the quarter which obviously showed maybe some shift of the category into some of the lower price variance, but our super premium segment continues to be very healthy.  We've had a lot of innovation and news behind it, and I still believe that where you bring innovation that's meaningful, the consumer will trade up for that where they see the value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to think that your downward guidance for the rest of the year is more in the Tissue business than Personal Care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tissue's certainly getting -- the thing about natural gas, the diesel fuel element of it, those are hitting Tissue much harder than our other business areas, and so we've probably seen a little bit more volume sensitivity in Tissue to some of the pricing moves, particularly in towels and in facial.  And the facial increase is just beginning to go into effect, but historically, they've been a little bit more sensitive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you really don't think you're going to be hurt in volume in Personal Care North America much at all?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bill.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, good morning.  Can we focus a little bit on the SG&amp;A cost savings?  It looks like it was down a hundred basis points year over year.  Are there reversals of accruals in there?  And the reason I ask is because I think you said that advertising was up as a percentage of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, advertising was up as a percent of sales.  The between the lines promotion spending was pretty consistent as a percent of sales.  Selling was down slightly relative to sales. And then within G&amp;A, basically there isn't anything too unusual, although I would tell you that with a part of your performance comp being run through G&amp;A, when you're not going to be hitting your numbers with performance-based pay, you do wind up with probably slightly lower accruals for some of that stuff that is a little bit of a benefit to G&amp;A.  I wouldn't say that was the only factor there. But that was probably one factor that held down the increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Bill, just to follow up on the strategic cost reductions that Mark mentioned, probably about almost half of the strategic cost reductions benefited G&amp;A spending.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of our business process outsourcing savings which are really starting to ramp up this year benefit G&amp;A probably more than any other line item</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  I mean, we've heard some rumblings in the marketplace that you guys were thinking about consolidating some of the marketing heads in one location, maybe outside of Neenah.  I mean, are you prepared to talk about that now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's news to me, so no.  Tony Palmer lives in Dallas, but he's on a plane a lot. And so, no.  We've got a wonderful marketing organization here in Neenah.  And we have no plans to move them.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Bill, they've been in place for quite a while with some pretty good disclosure in our 10-K.  But essentially, they're used to help us monetize our timberland sales.  So you do it on a receivable basis and it's a tax-advantaged way of doing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So when we look at your net debt and do our leverage ratios, it comes out in the wash, right?  Because it's two notes and they just kind of wash each other out, is that right?</p>

          <p>First question is, you mentioned in the press release reducing late last year your sales into the private label channel.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was -- as we said in the first quarter, it was as good piece of the volume decline in the first quarter, less so in the second quarter, and overall, our private label business is less than 5% of our sales.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you look at the price increases that you've put into place, and assuming that raw material costs don't get worse than they are, would you figure that some time in 2009 the growth margin would stabilize and start to rise again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I mean, I would hope we'd start to see some improvement in the fourth quarter as you get a full quarter of price increases.  But you know that's certainly our plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the plan, if we run the numbers, there would still be a decline in the fourth quarter but not as great as, you know, what's happening right now, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some sequential improvement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Sequential improvement.  When you raise your prices to the retailers, this is, I guess, just a technicality in the way this is all done, but, and you talk about all of the raw material costs that are going up, do you raise prices based on the raw materials that go into the product or can you also include some energy cost inflation in the price increase you're asking for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly when you talk with your customers you want to show the overall cost environment.  You know, you don't give them a detailed P&amp;L and show them all of the input costs.  They obviously are quite aware.  They're buying diesel fuel in the marketplace, they know what that costs as they move their products around.  You know we try to give them an understanding as to what the impact is of the various materials in kind of order of priority.  And so, they have a better understanding probably of our cost structure than they did four or five years ago as we've gone through this period of inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one final question.  The inventory improvement, are you done with the downtime in the businesses that took them in the second quarter, and what kind of inventory improvements did you see from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, we're still not where we want to be.  As Mark said, we made progress, but we're still higher than we were a year.  So you'll probably still see some downtime happen in the third quarter as we really focus on getting inventories back into balance, for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would be in the same businesses as in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mix. You'll probably see, potentially a bit more down time in Tissue.  We took quite a bit in Personal Care and Health Care.  Health Care you may still see some in the third quarter, but should be through that in the fourth quarter.  So each of our business teams has a plan based their product launch schedule.  Where they need to build for product launches versus, you know, where they can take inventory out of the system and are trying to manage it within that environment.  And then, Mark, if you've got any color on that.</p>

          <p>Yes, Connie, I think you'll see ebbs and flows.  I think Tom described it right.  In some cases, as you're rolling out products, you actually have to build inventory even though overall we're trying to push it down.  So I think you'll see the businesses continue to take downtime when they need to get to sustainable -- what they think is the right sustainable level of inventory.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lauren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, just following up on the comments you guys made about North America Personal Care price increases, and you're expecting to see the full impact in Q4.  Do you now think you've realized everything that you will realize of the February increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say so. I mean, obviously in the second quarter, as we said, there was a partial roll back of the February increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But other than that, the pricing was relatively stable in the second quarter.  And so, we'd expect, you know, the third quarter to be kind of a transition to the new pricing, and then fourth quarter would be fully implemented.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then the second thing I wanted to ask about was K-C Professional.  North America volume is still holding in okay it seems.  But you know you've always commented this is the one part of your business that really is the most difficult.  So I wanted to see if you could commentary kind of on the outlook for volume in that business separate from your efforts on revenue realization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was talking with Jan Spencer who runs that business for us and his team recently, because that's obviously, for me, kind of the early warning of what's going on in the economy.  And I would say that they would tell you today that their distributors are probably nervous, because they see big parts of the economy that aren't doing as well, as you think about automotive and airlines and where business travel may be going.  On the other hand, they would also probably say, you know, things have been maybe better than they would have expected given what's going on in the economy.  So while day-by-day things continue to be little better than expected they're probably a little nervous on what could happen if the economy pulls back further.  So, so far so good and we continue to do reasonably well in this business really kind of across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I also still wanted to follow up on force.  So in order to still hit your total cost savings goals for the year, restructuring is running above plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I was wondering if that means that you are, does the total savings from restructuring over the life of the program go up?  Or is that you are you able to accelerate some of those savings to make up for the negative impact on force because of the inventory down time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I guess, we said that we would deliver at least 350 million from the restructuring program, and I still think that's right.  So overall I think whether we're accelerating it and getting those savings earlier, which is a good thing, or going to slightly over deliver on the program, it's probably a little bit too early to call that, and we'll give you more '09 guidance or we'll have kind of a final answer on that later in the year or early next year.  And you know for force, we've been pretty consistent over time at delivering force in the 100 to 150 million a year range.  And I would expect that to happen this year and to be delivered on into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, really?  Okay, so even with a negative variance this quarter and with expected further downtime next, you will still think force for the full year will be at least 100 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, typically in force, the down time itself isn't a negative.  It's the other stuff that we did during the down time that hurt us this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's not the negative variance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no, it really does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just a final thing with the promotional environment in Europe on Personal Care.  I know you've talked in the past about it being very retailer driven, but at least the way it was written in the press release this time, it actually made it sound to me like it was more manufacturer driven and that you opted not to participate.  Is that a fair statement, I mean ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in the first quarter, it was more retailer driven.  And I'd say in the second quarter, you saw some of that abate a bit and saw some hot future prices that we elected not to match.  So it's hard to say whether that was driven just by retailers or some combination of competitor and retailers, but ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But competitors were more willing, I guess, to fund those &#x2013; even if it was the retailer's idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You saw more buy-one-get-one-free's in the first quarter.  You saw more one- third-off's in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great, thank you.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Consumer Tissue in the emerging markets, developing and emerging markets, you specifically called out Latin America and Russia.  And I'm wondering can you give us a little bit more color on the other markets as well as how sales trended by category?  And then I've got a separate question on Health Care.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe Mike can give you some of the detail on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in Latin America, the Consumer Tissue business was the strongest.  And I think Mark talked about the strong organic sales growth there.  Volumes were up high single digits and price and mix was also up high single digits.  And in Asia, we continued with what we've seen over the past couple quarters, higher pricing as cost increases are passed along.  Prices were up 4% in Asia and volumes were up about 3%.  So we're getting growth overall.  And -- but much faster growth in Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's helpful.  Thanks.  And then on Health Care, to the extent that it seems like surgical supplies have been a bit challenged for a while, and it's a more competitive category, I'm wondering are you rethinking your staying power with that category?  Is that something you'd consider divesting of?  And maybe what you think the margins could be over time if that's changed?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean the surgical business has got a wide variety of components. We have everything from sterile wrap, where we have a very stable position, strong market share, to the Nitrile gloves which we've talked a lot about where we actually saw a reasonable volume uptick this quarter.  And then surgical gowns, which was probably the one that came under the most competitive pressure this quarter as it had a couple of competitors leading price down in that category, despite the cost increases.  So again we've got a leading market share in that category.  We're doing some things on our cost position to make sure we can be competitive at a reasonable price and a reasonable margin for us.  And those initiatives aren't fully in place yet. But we're continuing to work on those and believe it's an attractive business for us still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question.  I guess can you just give us more of an update on the management transition that's taking place obviously with Robert replacing Steve, and Bob replacing Robert? Obviously D&amp;E markets haven't missed a beat. Just maybe thinking more about Europe and some of the changes that you might be able to enable there in that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Overall, the transitions are going very well.  And all of the participants have done everything they can to make it a very smooth hand off.  So Steve has worked very closely with Robert to make that transition seamless.  Obviously Robert had worked in NACP for a number of years before he's gone on to work in other parts of the business.  So he knows the people, knows the businesses and the market place.  And then Robert has in turn worked with Bob Black to get him started up in D&amp;E.  And so the reality is we have a lot of good people running our businesses day-to-day in all of the markets around the world.  And so that gave us a strong base to be able to make the leadership changes at the top.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just kind of sticking with Europe on the Tissue side.  Can you just talk maybe a little bit about, you know, with SCA coming in and taking over P&amp;G's brands.  I know obviously we've talked about just a weak environment out there.  But I was just wondering more from a competitive standpoint if you haven't talked about it already.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, P&amp;G's brands weren't in a particularly strong place in any of the markets.  Probably the one brand they had that was fairly decent was Tempo, and that's primarily in the hanks business, primarily on the Continent, where we're a relatively smaller player.  So I wouldn't say we've seen a huge amount of impact from that deal at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Filippe Goossens with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentleman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Filippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with my favorite topic, emerging markets again.  Last week Tom, if I recall correctly, when we were talking generally about cost inflation, commodity prices, you had basically indicated that in emerging markets there was less need to take pricing because the impact on the cost structure was less than in the U.S. because of the favorable development of their currencies versus the dollar.  Obviously very hard to predict where currencies are going to go, but some indication that maybe the dollar will stabilize at current levels.  Can you share with us, one, how you look at the need to take pricing in emerging markets and within that context?  And secondly, we've talked about the revenue contribution of emerging markets. But we've never really talked about the earnings contributions.  And the question there is are you continuing to make progress in narrowing the margin differential between your developed markets and your developing markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the last question first, yes. We're narrowing the margin gap, but unfortunately it's because the rest of the corporation is moving closer to developing emerging markets.  D&amp;E has done a good job, and we've talked about it for a number of years, of growing profits roughly the same as or in some cases slightly faster than sales growth.  We've seen that over a number of quarters be right around that range. So there's less dilution from the faster growth in emerging markets in our margins than maybe there ever was.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing decisions, it's very much a local market phenomenon.  A lot of it depends on sourcing.  If it's all locally sourced, then you are looking at how does that currency perform versus the dollar and what are the pricing needs, who are your competitive set, how are they sourced?  And so it's very much of a market-by-market decision on how those things play out as opposed to an enterprise-wide strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the other part of the emerging market question, Tom.  Obviously it is one of the great highlights of your business here the way that's developing.  At this juncture you still have not seen any slowdown in that business, Tom?  We had Brazil recently increase interest rates meaningfully again. We had Indonesia raising fuel prices or at least cutting back on subsidies significantly.  At this juncture, you're still not seeing any material slowdown, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.  And I would say the markets that we -- across Latin America generally we're doing very well, including Brazil.  Indonesia's a very small market for us, so we don't have a huge amount of exposure there.  We continue to do very well in Korea. Markets like Vietnam are just on fire right now and are going great guns. So individual pockets of strength that have worked very well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then moving to the last two final questions if I may, Tom.  The first one is intuitively if you're operating in a higher inflationary environment, you would think that distributors, retailers would try to stock up ahead of another price increase.  Yet we're not seeing that. Is that because you as an industry are not allowing them to do that or the retailers, conscious about their own margins and working capital constraints, are just not doing that like they used to do in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess a couple of phenomenon, and this is more anecdotal than anything else.  You've seen a couple of different behaviors.  One is in a couple of cases, retailers have actually taken their prices up ahead of the effective date of our price increase.  So if we gave them 90 days notice, maybe 30 days before the price increase, they will take the price up on shelf.  So in effect they, instead of loading, they basically upgrade the value of their own inventory.  You're starting to see that phenomenon.  I think the other thing that you're seeing is that with so many competitors taking price increases, they don't have the warehouse space to load across everybody.  They just don't have the room to store the product.  So when you have that kind of general inflation, they've got limited ability to do that.</p>
          <p>Now we've got fairly high Q products so if they were going to load on our stuff, it would fill up their warehouses a lot faster. I think those are maybe two factors that are a little bit different than if this was an isolated one-off price increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the final question from me, if I may. Last week you provided quite a bit of granularity as it relates to the different components of the commodities inflation, which was very helpful.  Can you also just elaborate a little bit more on that granularity in terms of what the difference is or what the lag is before these higher input prices start flowing through the P&amp;L?  Should we assume that gas goes quicker because you are not as much hedged there?  How does it compare with paper?  A little bit more color would be very helpful here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Things like diesel fuel, because it's a direct pass-through from the carrier, so diesel is probably the fastest.  Polymer prices are reset every month, and we tend to pay a negotiated smooth price where we probably never pay the market peak but we also don't pay the trough.  So there's a bit of averaging that goes into the polymer shift. But it directionally follows movements in oil price, so that resets monthly.  A lot of other packaging related costs around polyethylene and so forth, those are situations where each individual packaging supplier will have discussions with us, and we'll look for ways to offset part of that.  So some of the packaging adhesives and things like that take a little bit longer, so it may be over the course of a quarter or two for those costs to get fully baked in.  Things like pulp, whenever the market price changes, I think in one contract we have a 30-day lag, in other contracts, it's a straight market price.  Those hit you pretty much directly.</p>
          <p>For all of our US inventories, we're on LIFO so we would flow current costs through the P&amp;L so there really isn't an inventory buffer of moving it through inventory before it hits the P&amp;L.  That covers most of the major buckets.  Natural gas, again, to the extent we're not hedged, it flows directly through the P&amp;L as natural gas changes in the marketplace.  We're typically at least half-hedged though, so you've got a period of time where it averages into the numbers.</p>
