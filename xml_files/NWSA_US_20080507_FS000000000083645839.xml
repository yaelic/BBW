          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.  And welcome to the News Corp. Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Release. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to our first speaker, Executive Vice President Mr. Gary Ginsberg.  Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, operator, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call.  Joining me today are Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of News; Peter Chernin, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer.  As is our custom, Dave will begin the call with a brief summary of the results, focusing on items not immediately obvious from a reading of the earnings release that you should all now have.  Rupert will then give some detailed commentary on our latest acquisition of Dow Jones Company, followed by an update from Peter Chernin on the progress we're making at Fox Interactive Media. And as an aside of our own progress, we'll be posting both Rupert's and Peter's comments in their entirety on our News Corp. website.  We'll then take your questions,</p>
          <p>This call is of course governed by the Safe Harbor provisions.  On this call, we will make statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors including those described in News's public filings with the SEC but could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>And with all that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gary, thank you, and good afternoon everybody.  As you have seen in today's earnings release, we are continuing the strong growth trends we reported in the first half of fiscal '08.  For the third quarter of this fiscal year, revenue and operating income are up both 16%, another strong result for News Corporation.  These improvements were led by strong performances at our television, cable, and newspaper businesses and it was achieved despite absorbing approximately $53 million in incremental losses related to startup businesses such as the Fox Business Network, the Big Ten Network, and startup television operations in Turkey, Poland, and Serbia.</p>
          <p>In looking at net income this quarter, there are a few items to be highlighted.  This quarter's net income and earnings per share included a tax free gain of approximately $1.7 billion related to the Liberty transaction.  Additionally, we also had a reduction in this year's equity earnings of $146 million and this is primarily due to a write-down by BSkyB of its ITV investment, of which our share was 101 million. And our tax rate in the quarter of 10% was significantly affected by the impact of the tax-free treatment of the gain and the previously taxed equity earnings from DIRECTV.</p>
          <p>Taking all these items into account, reported net income increased 1.8 billion to 2.7 billion and earnings per share increased to 91 cents versus 27 cents last year. Excluding the net income effect of the items included in Other and the ITV write-down, earnings per share was 30 cents this quarter, an increase of 15% over a similarly adjusted 26 cents in the March quarter a year ago.  I think it's also worth noting that as part of the Liberty transaction, we reduced News Corporation's gross shares outstanding by approximately 513 million shares, a reduction of more than 16%.</p>
          <p>Now given that you should now have the details presented in our earnings release, I'll provide context on the recent performance of just a few of our businesses.  Our Film segment's operating income was $261 million in the quarter, and while down from a year ago, this is another solid result.  I want to remind you that the year ago results were very strong, reflecting the DVD and theatrical successes of such blockbuster releases as Borat and Night at the Museum and carryover DVD sales from The Devil Wears Prada and Little Miss Sunshine.  The current quarter results reflect strong theatrical success of Alvin and the Chipmunks and Juno, also continued DVD sales of The Simpsons Movie and Live Free or Die Hard.</p>
          <p>And additionally, we're set up well for the rest of the year as we anticipate good results yet to come from films released in the quarter, most notably Horton Hears a Who, which was released mid-March and has generated over $275 million in worldwide box office to date.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, third quarter operating profit increased more than 50% from year ago levels with every major business within this segment delivering double digit earnings growth.  As you know, Fox aired this year's Super Bowl, which as the most watched show in the last 25 years, contributed to our continuing ratings gains.  The Fox Broadcast Network nearly doubled its operating income from higher advertising pricing for both our entertainment and our sports programming, strong post-season NFL ratings, which were up 7% excluding the Super Bowl, and up 5% for NASCAR. And lower prime time cost as a result of airing less original scripted shows also contributed to the result.</p>
          <p>Our station earnings increased 12%, largely reflecting Super Bowl revenues and political increases, and MyNetworkTV greatly reduced its quarterly loss, primarily due to lower programming costs.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the cable networks, we also had strong growth in this segment, a 17% improvement in operating profit to $330 million.  This again is an especially strong result considering we incurred startup losses of about $40 million for the Big Ten and Fox Business Channel launches.  The largest year over year gains were from the RSNs [Regional Sports Networks], reflecting affiliate rate and subscriber increases, the international channels from advertising and affiliate increases, and they were led by our Latin-American and European channels.  And additionally, the Fox News Channel, FX, and SPEED all delivered double digit profit growth, largely driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue growth.  The results also include the consolidation of the National Geographic channels which were not consolidated a year ago.</p>
          <p>Turning now to SKY Italia, SKY Italia reported operating income of $97 million, a 7% increase over the year ago results.  SKY added 77,000 net new subscribers in the quarter.  This is down from 135,000 reported for the same quarter a year ago.  Much of the decline compared to the year ago's quarter is due to the timing impact of the new free trial promotion, under which we delayed recognition of subscriber additions until the expiration of the free two-month trial period.  We completed this promotion as planned at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Over the past 12 months, we have had net subscriber additions of 342,000, resulting in 4.5 million subscribers at quarter end.  Our ARPU for the quarter was approximately 45 euros, and this is similar to last year.  SAC, excluding the free trial cost, was down slightly from the level we reported in the third quarter a year ago, and SKY's churn in the quarter was up versus the same quarter a year ago, but it still remains on track to achieve an annual churn rate of around 10%.</p>
          <p>From an operating income or profit perspective, we had a planned increase in cost this quarter driven by the free trial promotion, the mix of movie programming, and the addition of 11 new channels. Additionally, comparative results were impacted by the expiration of a minimum guaranteed payment we received on certain mobile phone programming contracts that did not carry over to this year.  These results were all in line with our expectations, and as a result, it does not reduce our anticipated growth for this business for this fiscal year or beyond.  In fact, since quarter end, new subscriber activity is up nearly 30% versus the same period last year and that excludes free trial subscribers.</p>
          <p>At our Newspaper and Information Service segment, they also reported a strong quarter with operating income of $216 million.  This is up 38% over the third quarter a year ago.  This increase primarily reflects double digit earnings growth at both the Australian and the UK newspaper businesses as well as the inclusion of the Dow Jones businesses, which were acquired in mid-December.  The Dow Jones businesses contributed operating profit of $21 million in the quarter, and note that this operating profit for the quarter includes incremental acquisition amortization and related charges of $23 million which Dow Jones did not have a year ago.  Excluding these non-cash reductions, this quarter results compares favorably to the 37.9 million of operating profit that Dow Jones itself reported for the quarter ending March 2007.</p>
          <p>And at our Other segment, we incurred an operating loss of $7 million as compared to a loss of 104 million reported a year ago.  This $97 million improvement is primarily due to the absence of last year's World Cricket Cup losses as well as higher contributions from Fox Interactive Media [FIM] and NDS, offset in part by startup losses related to our Eastern European TV initiatives.</p>
          <p>At FIM, revenues in the quarter of $210 million were up 55% from the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to search and advertising revenue growth at MySpace.  Of the total FIM revenue, $66 million was from our search deal with Google. Ad revenues at FIM increased by 18% versus last year.  And operating for FIM in the quarter was $27 million.  This is up $24 million from the same quarter a year ago as the majority of the revenue growth was reinvested back into the business for new features, products, and ventures and Peter will comment more on this in a moment.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2008.  Three months ago, we raised our expectations of operating income growth for fiscal 2008 from the low teens level to the mid-teens level.  This guidance excluded any results from the Dow Jones acquisition.  Based on our actual results to date and on the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our mid-teens operating income growth guidance.  Note that this guidance is like to like as it continues to exclude Dow Jones results.</p>
          <p>And with all that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Rupert for some additional comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave, good afternoon. Once again, another very solid quarter, 68% growth in both revenue and operating income, and for the nine months fiscal year to date, our revenues are up 15%, operating income is up 21%. And as Dave just said, we remain very comfortable with our full year forecast of mid-teens operating income growth.</p>
          <p>The quarter was also quite strong from a strategic sense.  We finally completed our deal with Liberty Media, effectively selling our interest in DIRECTV for a tax free gain of $1.7 billion.  At the same time, we reduced our outstanding share count by more than 16%.  Now after closing this deal, we will have repurchased $14 billion worth of News Corp. stock over the past three years, by far the largest concentrated period of buying in the company's history.</p>
          <p>Recently we put in a very competitively priced bid for New York Newsday that if accepted will enable us to greatly improve our financial performance at the New York Post.  Although subsequent to our offer, additional competitive bids have emerged.  As financially desirable as this asset is, we will continue to be disciplined in our pursuit.  And last week, we finally divested our Gemstar stake, netting approximately $950 million in value.</p>
          <p>This quarter also marks our first full quarter of earnings Dow Jones.  The more time I spend working with the company, the more opportunities I see in improving and expanding their current businesses.  Although a small acquisition relative to our market capitalization, it is potentially transformative on many levels, and we're very focused on revitalizing this great company starting now.  I know this is an area of focus for you as well, and I want to divert a few minutes to giving you greater perspective of why we are so excited about its future prospects.</p>
          <p>First a clarification; from day one, the financial press have been fixated on portraying this move as a change in strategic direction.  The company is now focused on allocating more of its capital on print businesses.  That is not our intent nor is it factually correct. We have not changed our playbook.  We continue to be about seizing opportunities, opportunities that fit strategically, leverage our core competencies, and deliver a good return for shareholders.  That's what we had with DIRECTV, we've got with Dow Jones, and that is what we would get with Newsday.</p>
          <p>In the case of Dow Jones, what is getting to be lost in all this chatter is one crucial fact. Dow Jones is not just a fantastic global newspaper. We bought the world's largest provider of business content and information with a collection of exciting non-print growth businesses.  In fact, many of you may be surprised to learn that the biggest growth area of Dow Jones is its Enterprise Media group &#x2013; by far its biggest growth area, I should say, which generates the overwhelming majority of the company's profits.  These products including the branded services Dow Jones Indexes, Newswires, Factiva, are primarily sold to businesses on a long-term subscription basis and represent terrific growth opportunities as we build them out.  Just starting with the Indexes businesses, they are Dow Jones fastest growing products with revenues up 37%, profits up nearly 50% in the quarter ended March 31. And Factiva, with a database of 14,000 new sources in 22 languages, grew its revenues by 10% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The financial services industry is expanding at breakneck speed, not only here in the US but especially in rapidly developing markets.  Our products are specialized applications assisting trading, wealth management, investment banking, private equity, and hedge funds are positioned perfectly to grow with this demand.  In fact the Financial Information Services group posted a 13% jump in revenue with earnings up over 8% compared with year ago results even after increasing spending to further develop this business.</p>
          <p>Our outlook is equally optimistic with regard to Dow Jones' array of digital online assets.  The Wall Street Journal Online counts more than 1 million paying online subscribers.  Only three traditional US newspapers count that many paying readers, and one of those is the print Journal.  WSJ Online has also steadily grown a subscriber base, increasing paid subscribers 11% year over year in 2008.  The Wall Street Journal Digital Network, which includes WSJ.com, MarketWatch.com, and Barrons.com also generated significant year-over-year growth in terms of both visitors and page views.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'd like to point out that we also anticipate considerable growth at The Wall Street Journal.  There are significant opportunities to raise advertising revenues, increase circulation volume and revenues, and reduce subscription churn in several markets around the world.</p>
          <p>The Wall Street Journal continues to defy industry trends, growing individually paid subscriptions by 1.6% to 1,456,000, and overall circulation up 0.3% to 2,069,000, continuing a trend over the last three reporting periods that have seen individually paid subscriptions grow 12%.  The Journal was one of only two newspapers of the ten largest in the country to grow its circulation, in fact, the only one to grow its paid circulation.  More important, The Journal's circulation revenue grew by 6.8% in the three months.  That was on top of 7.3% growth in calendar 2007.  In the vital individually paid circulation category, which represents the highest quality of circulation, The Journal is up over 12% for the past four reporting &#x2013; ABC reporting periods.</p>
          <p>We are beefing up the overall Journal package to appeal to a wider range of both readers and advertisers.  In March, The Journal began adding new features to its news and editorial pages with four additional pages at an annual cost of about $6 million.  The new content includes a third editorial page, a weekly sports page, expanded US news and world news section, and the addition of a currents page highlighting trends in religion, education, and science.  Importantly, The Journal is not moving away from its core areas of business, finance, and economics coverage.  In fact, as part of the reordering of content, we have added space for corporate and business news in the Marketplace section and for international finance news in the Money and Investing section.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me just say that we've got to keep all this in perspective.  We're talking only about the first full quarter of numbers under News Corporation.  This is destined to be an extra inning game to use an overly used metaphor.  We're only in the first inning.  Those of you expecting to see immediate dramatic results in 12 weeks are kidding yourselves and setting an unrealistic bar.  Over time as we have done dozens of times at News Corp., most recently at SKY Italia and MySpace, we have made our acquisitions work, generating great returns to our shareholders.  We'll do it again at Dow Jones.  It may take time, but I'm as confident of it as any acquisition I have done.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn it over to Peter to talk a little more about our digital and interactive efforts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rupert, and good afternoon everyone.  I'd like to spend the next few minutes talking about Fox Interactive Media.  Since the press began reporting a few weeks ago that we will fall short of our initial revenue projections for the year, there has been a lot of speculation on the strength of the business.  And I think it's worth right now to give it some perspective.</p>
          <p>This is a very healthy business with significant progress across multiple fronts.  We continue to expand our leadership in the fastest growing consumer area of the web.  But let me begin by saying yes, we will fall short of what were very aggressive initial projections of 80% growth for this fiscal year.  But it's worth pointing out that in a tough economy, our shortfall will be slight roughly, only about 10%.  And to put it in some context, FIM is nearly a $1 billion revenue business, a business that is not even three years old.  And to give you some comparisons, it took Google five years to hit $1 billion.  It took Yahoo! eight years, and we'll get there in a little over three years.</p>
          <p>It's also worth pointing out that FIM's revenue growth is tied to an entirely new category of advertising inventory.  Social media has only been around for a few years, and gaining market acceptance for any new category will always have its challenges. But as the creators of this new media, as the leaders, we will be in the forefront of developing the tools to make it work.  We're incredibly optimistic about the future of social media and our role in shaping it.</p>
          <p>When it comes to some of the specific challenges we're facing, I think that there are three areas worth noting.  First of all, the explosive growth of social media has created an enormous amount of advertising inventory.  As pages on MySpace and Facebook continue to grow, the lack of scarcity creates a liquidity challenge.  We spent a lot of time developing prime real estate opportunities to draw the big advertisers and big CPMs, particularly with the MySpace home page and features like MySpaceTV.  We are focused on migrating more of these big brands and their dollars to MySpace.</p>
          <p>Second, people who visit sites like MySpace are there for an entirely new form of Internet activity. As a consequence, the online ad models that have driven the Internet economy in the past need to be refined for the social media universe.  New methodologies are required which we are actively developing, including our HyperTargeting initiative and our optimization efforts.</p>
          <p>Third, it's still difficult to quantify the economic value of a friend in the social media space, particularly with advertisers who have long histories with the metrics by which they value their brand spends on TV and radio.  We're working with these major brands and their agencies to educate, innovate, and experiment in the social media and to develop the right set of metrics.  We're making headway and it remains a work in progress.</p>
          <p>But despite the obstacles we're facing, what we're accomplishing is extraordinary and we think the future looks very exciting.  Overall, our revenues are up across the board year to year.  Branded revenue is up 21% over last year, and branded sell-through is trending up for the year with a 19% increase from quarter 1 to quarter 3.  Performance revenues were up 24% year over year. And importantly, or actually I think most importantly, even as our MySpace user base continues to grow, we're actually earning more money per user, and I think this is in some ways our most important statistic.  FY '08 revenue per unique is up 49% over last year.  And another important statistic is if you look at it today, 54% of all social network ad dollars are going to MySpace.  So as the category of social networking continues its explosive growth, we will be the prime beneficiary.</p>
          <p>We're also starting to see increased momentum with our HyperTargeting initiative.  Hundreds of HyperTargeting campaigns have been run in the last several months with 20% or more of all orders today including some HyperTargeting.  And we are seeing double the CPMs for HyperTargeting campaigns versus non-HyperTargeted.  Orders with HyperTargeting are about 60% larger.  And we're attracting new advertisers like retail store TJ Maxx, which used HyperTargeting to reach consumers who are fashion aficionados; or the Target chain, which used HyperTargeting to identify consumers by genre of music; or Chevrolet, which traditionally focuses only on pure content sites but which used HyperTargeting to reach snowboarders.  We're enjoying a considerable number of repeat orders with about 75% of advertisers ordering HyperTargeting again.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing successes in sales of key pages with sought after branded advertisers and are attracting many high profile brands for the first time this quarter including such brands as Novartis, Wrigley, Virgin Mobile, Unilever, and Toyota.  Several have stepped up to the popular branded skin of the MySpace home page which goes for a 70% premium on the standard home page buy.</p>
          <p>On the branded channel side, Colgate recently launched a video contest where users produce their own MySpace video on MySpace TV. And Activision just executed its biggest spend to date with a roadblock of The Music Channel to promote its best selling game, Guitar Hero.</p>
          <p>Luxury brands are beginning to work with MySpace as well.  Nordstrom just began sponsoring the Fashion section of the Applications Gallery and Cartier is launching a global campaign.  And I think as importantly, in terms of category growth, we're seeing major jumps in several big categories including automotive, which is up 73%; consumer electronics, which is up more than 300%; beverage, which is up 600%; and education, which is up 850% year over year, all very important categories for us.</p>
          <p>This past quarter, we reorganized our sales operation to more tightly align the product and revenue teams for each FIM brand, allowing us create deeply integrated advertising opportunities more efficiently. And we launched a standalone monetization technology unit, the Fox Audience Network, so we can leverage the tools we've created and built to scale on a broad level to build a new line of business. I think one of our great developments in the past several months is we recently opened up MySpace and Photobucket to outside developers earlier this year, and more than 7,000 outside developers are working with the MySpace API, creating more than 1,000 new apps in just the first two months, and driving more than 2.1 million of outside applications and installations across the site.</p>
          <p>Just as importantly, we're seeing explosive growth in mobile.  MySpace Mobile is the fastest growing lap/mobile product in the United States, and the number three mobile product overall.  And just this past month, we passed more than 1 billion page views per month on our MySpace lap product.</p>
          <p>In terms of the competitive landscape, we also feel very good about where we are today.  Perceptions of the MySpace brand continue to outpace that of Facebook in key demographics.  And despite what was a big Facebook buzz last year, MySpace is gaining audience share and is at an all-time high in terms of audience reach and engagement according to both comScore and Nielsen, more than doubling Facebook's US audience with 73 million MySpace users compared to Facebook's 36 million.  And minutes spent on MySpace in the US far surpass Facebook; 242 minutes per user per month versus 167 minutes per user per month for Facebook.</p>
          <p>In fact, over the past year, virtually every FIM property showed impressive growth.  IGN and Photobucket were up 40% year to year in unique visitors worldwide. IGN remains the number one games information property. And in just the past quarter, it is Direct 2 Drive service surpassed 1 million games sold digitally online.  Photobucket's worldwide page views for March 2008 were 2 billion, up 85% year on year.  And FOXSports.com is up over 20% in worldwide unique visitors year on year, and recently launched its mobile lapsite, and it's the number one mobile lapsite for sports information in the US.</p>
          <p>We're also rolling out a number of very important new initiatives, I think the most important one of which is the music joint venture which we just signed this month in April with Sony, UMG, and Warner Music Group, which will expand on MySpace's already existing strength in music to build out the most popular destination music site on the web with catalog representing probably about 80% of the music catalog available.</p>
          <p>We also established Fox TV stations as leading online local news properties in its first year of operation and I think are well over 12 million uniques on our Fox television station web properties.</p>
          <p>MySpace TV continues its rapid ascent and is now a strong number two to YouTube in online video, so in addition to everything else, we have the number two online video site.</p>
          <p>It's also worth mentioning that in our category of premium video that Hulu, our online video joint venture with NBC, is off to a much stronger start than expected since coming out of beta and launching live in March.</p>
          <p>In summary, let me very clear. We are very pleased with the performance of the FIM division and MySpace specifically and confident in their continued growth and profits. Without a doubt, we have challenger and in some cases, things are going a little slower than we expect. But we know what those challenges are and we're addressing them and developing the solutions to meeting them.  We are committed to growing this business and we continue to believe that we are making significant progress in adding new features in monetization, in technology, in audience growth, and in market share.  We believe that FIM and MySpace specifically continue to grow as one of the handful of the most important destinations on the web.</p>
          <p>And with that I think we're happy to answer any questions you may have.  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of questions.  When you think about use of capital now, you talked about acquisitions in the past.  I'm wondering how you think about it with your stock now down at these levels, what is the right allocation of capital with Dow Jones now behind you.  Has that changed your mind?  And just two, to the extent that you're not successful in acquiring Newsday, what do you do with the New York Post?  It's losing tens of millions of dollars at least according to press speculation. I'm just wondering what the plan would be if you don't get it and where you go from here?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the price is going up next week or the week after to $0.50 cents.  We're making several moves there which will save over $20 million this year regardless, I think 26 million.  Regardless, that's net of paper increases and everything else.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see what you're saying. Given that Dow Jones is behind us, we have no major requirements for capital at the moment.  I think what I guess you're trying to get to is with respect to what are we doing with the buyback, and where we have been with that, we've been extremely concerned with respect to the capital markets and all the fluctuations there and the concern as to what could happen. So what we have been doing is being very conservative.  As you know, we're a very conservative company with respect to capital.  I think what we will do is we will look at the markets over the next month or so. To the extent they stay stable as they have been, we will go back and relook at and revisit whether or not we can continue on with our buyback.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I have two questions as well.  Given the inevitable consolidation in the Internet sector, how do you see MySpace evolving?  Do you see it as a standalone entity or as part of a bigger and more diversified company, so you would own a smaller piece of a bigger company?  And separately, several networks in recent days have been very bullish on the upfront.  Besides high scatter CPMs, which seems to be due to lack of GRPs, what plans would make you positive?  I mean do you agree with what other companies have said, and if you could in your comments just separate broadcast television from cable networks. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first side, Jessica, I think we feel great about MySpace as a standalone entity.  I think if you look at almost any measurement, social networking has been growing faster than any other category on the web, and we have, as I said, 52% market share of all money inside that category, so we feel great about our efforts.  We're continuing expand our efforts.  At the same time, we're willing to have strategic conversations if we thought they made sense, but I don't think anyone should assume that we have any concerns about our positioning.  I think any time you have a dominant market share in the fastest growing part of the web, you ought to feel pretty good about your position, so I think that's our position there.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the upfront, probably every single earnings call I have ever been on in my life in May, the networks talk about how huge the upfront is going to be and the advertisers talk about that it's going to be a very tough upfront. Instinctively I think it's all positioning on both sides.  I do think we have had the strongest scatter market of any network. So whatever the upfront is going to be and I'm obviously bullish about it, I think we are as well positioned if not better positioned than anybody.  And we continue to see strong scatter in both the network front and the cable front right now, and we're coming off a strong ratings and a very strong competitive positioning in both.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much.  I want to switch over to the film business for Peter, just how you feel about the progress for Blu-ray and how much you think it might contribute to the back half of the calendar year, and then just any comments that you might have on day-and-date. You have had some reservations in the past as you were going through the tests and others are moving forward. And what kind of financial contribution, if any, do you think day-and-date might bring to the film line?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, look, we are bullish on Blu-ray.  We're very pleased to see the industry has finally gone to one format.  I think the biggest issue with Blu-ray right now is there is a tremendous capacity &#x2013; there's a tremendous constraint of players available at retail.  I think they sold out virtually every player that was there over Christmas and in January, and they're right now in a big, big manufacturing push.  And so it's pretty hard to find much more than one or two Blu-ray players in a store right now.  That should change dramatically in June, over the summer, and particularly going into the fourth quarter when I think you'll see a lot more players available, and you'll see the price of those players begin to come down.  And as you see the players come out, I think you'll begin to see much expanded orders of Blu-ray.</p>
          <p>I think the two things that are important to us on the Blu-ray side are both number of orders of disks obviously, but also maintaining a higher price margin, which we have been able to do right now.  We think these disks are more valuable.  So far, all of our competitors have held to a higher price. And so I think if we can have a higher price margin and begin to see the players, we think this can be a big contributor.  I think we have said that we would hope that Blu-ray represents about $1 billion at retail home video this year, and I see no reason to change that right now.</p>
          <p>In terms of day-and-date and Video-on-Demand, we have participated in tests, and we will going forward release some titles day-and-date whereas others we will do a holdback.  And I think what we particularly continue to monitor very, very closely is will day-and-date Video-on-Demand cannibalize our traditional Video-on-Demand &#x2013; or cannibalize our traditional DVD business.  We're going to keep monitoring that closely.  We're going to keep experimenting, and at least from a Fox perspective, we think it's too soon to declare overall that we're going to move every single one of our releases to day-and-date, although we'll continue to experiment. And right now from a financial point of view, I would expect &#x2013; look, Video-on-Demand has been a rapidly growing category.  I would expect it to continue to rapidly grow as ultimately it makes the availability of our product more ubiquitous.  But I wouldn't expect it to be overwhelmingly additive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  I wondered if Rupert could give us a big picture view on how he is seeing the economy and advertising environments in all the different locations that you operate in.  And what's your feel for how those two factors, the economy and advertising, is going to progress over the course of the calendar year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think you've got to look at the US economy first.  There is no doubt that the consumer economy is stressed, and you're seeing that reflected in advertising, more short-term planning, short-term bookings.  As far as we're concerned, we're increasing our share of market stations everywhere, even though there are some declines in total business.</p>
          <p>And Australia is just booming.  I mean, it's going up all the time. And in Britain I would say steady, and in Europe. Whether that will follow the American pattern fairly soon or not, I don't know.  Certainly I'm told that business is slowing down on the Continent.  Our business, certainly in the UK is in a very healthy condition.  Again, I only talk about what I see myself from week to week and month to month.  I'm not an economist. I can't predict what it will be like this time next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks; a couple of questions for Dave.  With the favorable impact from foreign exchange on the business in the quarter, I was wondering if there was a way you could help us quantify the benefit of both the revenue and operating income in the quarter.  And then at the cable networks, I mean your results were so strong again at the cable networks, I'm just wondering if you look apples-to-apples at advertising growth, stripping out of course the new networks and then the benefit of consolidating NatGeo, what was the year-over-year advertising growth in the quarter?  And then if you could give us any color around whether you're seeing any deceleration or any impact from the economy there at the cable networks advertising?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the ad growth in the quarter was approximately 26% at the cable, the cable networks.  You asked so many questions, I hate to say this, but would you mind going back to the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's around &#x2013; I think the benefit on the operating income line is around $35 million to earnings. And the revenue number I don't have, but I will get Reed to get it for you.  Around $200 million &#x2013; it's approximately $200 million on the revenue side.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And then on the cable network advertising, I'm just trying to get a sense for the ongoing trends there.  I mean maybe your growth is &#x2013; your growth there is obscuring any of the underlying trends, but maybe if you could just give us a little bit of the core, fully distributed networks, are you seeing any deceleration, acceleration?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're &#x2013; this is Peter. I think that we're seeing continued strength.  We're seeing a few cancellations here and there, but then they'll come back a week later, and I think I would in some ways echo Rupert's comments, which is what we're seeing more, is a little bit more what I would term volatility in a world in which overall there is still quite a bit of strength.  So it's a little bit more volatile than it was three months ago, but overall we're seeing great strength and continued growth across our fully distributed networks.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I've got a question on a few of the transactions that you've discussed in the past.  The UK land sale, is that going to occur this year?  And if you can update us on the Russian outdoor and the US TV stations, is that on hold now that the private equity market is not there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan, it's Dave. I'm reluctant to give you this news on the land sale because we've been negotiating it for two years, but I do think it's going to close before the end of June.  That's what I know today, but I'm not going to give you any guarantee, but I do think it's going to close before the end of June.</p>
          <p>On the TV station sale, we are going through the regulatory process.  All I can say is we talked to the buyers, and they're committed to the buyers.  We have talked to the lenders.  They're committed.  So I think that's going along reasonably well, and with the approval process taking place, hopefully sometime in the first quarter of our next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Russian outdoor business, it's really a slow process, and we're continuing to work on it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Rupert, if I could ask two questions, one about Premiere and the German TV market and your thoughts on whether that market is becoming more attractive for News Corp.  It has been a challenging pay-TV market in the past, and if there are any maybe synergies between Premiere and SKY Italia?  And then over here in the US, are there &#x2013; if you look three to five years from now, do you think News Corp. will still have a material local TV station business?  I'm just curious how much value that still provides to the network.  I realize it's a profitable business, but I'm just curious if you think that is strategically still is a valuable asset for you guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the latter part of that, we are &#x2013; the question, I think that the TV stations, it depends on how well they run.  We are investing &#x2013; I'll caution a little bit, but we are expanding enormously the amount of local news we do to distinguish our stations from the cable programming, and it's the alternative.  I think it's certainly essential or a huge help to our network.</p>
          <p>As for Premiere, we're going up to &#x2013; we're buying in the market, but there's a limit, very little, a bit above where we are now before we go through a new regulator rating.  But we would like to stop actually and be on that board and have a look at that business from inside.  It has been through a lot of ups and downs, and it's just a fantastic market.  People in Italy are extremely keen on our people in SKY. I think it's a great business.  All our expert &#x2013; and I think it's a big opportunity, but we're just being a little cautious.  We'd like to get inside their company for a few months before doing anything further.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just add a comment on the station business, which is I think it's important not to look at any one of those sectors in isolation, and I think we look at those stations, which I think are extremely well run and have gained significant market share in this quarter, which I think is a pretty good indication.</p>
          <p>But we look at them as part of an integrated television business, and I think they have a positive impact on the network. They have a positive impact on our ability to grow 20th Century Fox Television both as a promotional platform for the shows and then ultimately as a buyer for some of those shows in syndication.  They have a very positive impact on our interactions with the cable companies and our ability to get retransmission consent either in the form of cash or in the form of additional cable carriage.  They're meaningful for us in our local sports businesses. So I think you have to be wary of pulling out any of these things in isolation, and I think looked at in the context of our global television business or certainly our US macro television business, you can see the overall growth in that television sector.  And I think the stations are a big contributing factor in that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Regarding SKY Italia, can you talk about the rationale for the promotion in the quarter relative to your view of subscriber growth and opportunity in the Italian market?  Should we view this as indicative of a more challenging environment despite the relatively low multi-channel penetration?  And then also assuming that you brought on board more new customers than you actually booked during the promotion period, can you tell us how net new customers in the quarter compares to the roughly 136,000 net adds that you had in the quarter last year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just a new promotion, a new form of promotion which we were testing.  We now have to &#x2013; it's over now, but we have to stay with it and see how the new people that we have, are they going to stay with us, are they going to churn, how will they compare with people, with subscribers we have acquired in other ways. If it's as good as we hope, we'll certainly be doing a lot more of it.  If not, we'll move on to other promotions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess your outlook for growth in the Italian market, I mean it's 20 to 25% penetrated.  You still see plenty of opportunity there that is not indicative of that?  Can you just maybe give a little commentary about that opportunity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's absolutely going to continue to grow.  You've got a strange market there where you've got three so-so government channels and three owned by the Prime Minister.

You may remember this law that was passed in Italy about a year ago that allowed our subscribers to cancel their contract. It was about roughly 20,000 subscribers under that law.  But if you look at where we are currently, as I said in my opening remarks, we're up 29% in new subscriber additions as we start the last quarter of the year, so the business is not slowing at all, and we're on target for our long term matrix and profit.</p>

          <p>Look, I think it's hard to tell.  I think as I said in my comments, we look at this as a work in progress, and we look at a lot of progress we're making across multiple fronts.  I think the single biggest challenge which we're constantly grappling with is just the huge amount of inventory, and as you see us growing our business, this category has grown so rapidly between our own growth, which is accelerating in terms of minutes and page views and users and Facebook's growth that it puts pressure on our ability to raise CPMs because of scarcity value.  But we continue to believe that we're making progress. And we think the overall trends are quite positive, maybe a little bit slower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, but overall we see no reason to change our optimism about the business.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys; just one for Peter on FIM.  Given the cost of international expansion and your new applications and developing the new ad models, what do you see as sustainable operating income margins for FIM over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early to say.  I think one of the decisions we clearly made this year was not to take our foot off the accelerator in terms of growth, and so I think you have seen us continue to invest in international, where we have had remarkable growth across &#x2013; I don't know, I think we're in 20 &#x2013; 30 territories, and all of them somewhere &#x2013; I think the oldest of them is only a year and a half old, and we're still growing our uniques and still growing our monetization. And we made a conscious decision not to slow that down in terms of short-term improving our margins.</p>
          <p>The same thing is true here in the US.  We are continuing to invest in technology. We're going to invest in the MySpace Music joint venture, which we think has a lot of opportunity.  We invested in apps.  We're investing in new development tools for users.  We're investing in a new home page et cetera, et cetera. So I think we could have clearly escalated our margin this year, but we made a decision to continue to invest, and we believe that's the right strategy.  We're seeing continued growth, and it's too soon to start milking this thing for margin right now.  I think it's much more important that we keep focused on growth both internationally and in terms of tools and applications for users here in the US.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks; a couple of questions. The first is if we go back historically to previous quarters, in 2Q '08 your Fox News OI grew about 47%. 1Q '08, it more than doubled. 4Q '07, it was up 41%; 3Q '07, up 49%.  Basically you have to go back to 1Q '07 to find flattish numbers or anything below double digits.  So can you put that in the context of I guess this quarter where Fox News grew OI 11%?  Is there something going on?  Is there inherent lumpiness?</p>
          <p>Can you also comment just to clarify in terms of your new FIM target, it sounds like you're around the 900 million mark, but on the EBITDA side, is it 10% of the original range &#x2013; or EBIT rather, 10% of that original EBIT range?  And I guess the last question is you guys have talked about pacings at the local stations over the past couple of months, I think publicly. Can you talk about have the pacings accelerated or decelerated since the last time you have talked about it publicly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the Fox News.  The Fox News, there is no slowing really. What we have got is increase in our costs in the current quarter for the elections, for politicals, and you've got a little bit of when you look at the comparisons, I think we started a year ago, the new affiliate rates.  And so you've got a little bit of that year over year where the pace of our affiliate &#x2013; the growth rate of our affiliate revenue is slowing because we had some of it a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me state that slightly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be the contracts kicking in at different times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right. The only lumpiness in growth in Fox News is that our first big affiliate contracts had kicked in this time last year and our next big new one is this summer when our Time Warner contract kicks in. And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see so that could reignite the OI growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have Comcast at the end of the year. I think we have Charter and Cox in '09 and '10, so the only lumpiness that you'll see in Fox News growth from an affiliate point of view is when the old contracts expire, and that's the only thing going on there.  Overall there is continued growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of FIM, we're not breaking out the specific numbers, but as I said, our revenues were &#x2013; we will miss that original target by about 10%, and probably slow down a little bit on the EBITDA side but not because of lack of revenue, more just because we don't want to take our foot off the growth accelerator. And so I think if we stopped investing in growth, we could move our margins back up to the previous levels. But right now we're really focused on continuing to grow our revenues.  We would expect to be well over $1 billion next year, and that is our primary focus right now.</p>
          <p>The third question, which was on station pacings, while we are &#x2013; while we have not been breaking out monthly pacings, we are seeing a little bit of a slowdown in station pacings in the fourth quarter.  Again, we continue to grow market share, so clearly we have no doubt that our stations are outperforming the market.  But I think if you look at the overall advertising economy, which we talked earlier, still remains pretty strong on a national broadcast and a national cable level.  It is a little bit slower on the local station side, particularly in certain geographic areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But as you look week to week over the past couple of months, do you find that the pacings have been decelerating or about the same, down the same, stable, or have the pacing declines accelerated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that they decelerated a little bit at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and we're actually seeing them pick up a little bit at the end of the fourth quarter and into the first fiscal quarter next year.  So there's a fair amount of volatility in there and I wouldn't say there are any overall trends other than fourth quarter a little bit slower than the third quarter and picking up a little bit towards the end of the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first fiscal quarter.</p>

          <p>Two quick questions.  On SKY Italia, you hinted at the numbers, but I was wondering if you can just give us hard numbers for the churn and the SAC in the quarter. And then a slightly longer term question, when you think about the Netflixes and the Blockbusters of the world, it seems like their role in the theatrical business is getting smaller. I was wondering if you look out three to five years if you see a point where with some combination of VOD or Hulu or something else where the economics may be superior for you to pursue some other mode of distribution.  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>...in line with where we were. And I think the actual churn, we had 185,000 gross subscribers, so 108,000 churned out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In terms of movie distribution and change in vehicles, I guess the only general comment I'd make relative to Blockbuster and Netflix is that we like the sell-through business much more than we like the rental business.  We don't have anything against it, but in terms of margins for the studios, the sell-through business, whether that sell-through business is on electronic sell-through or DVD, is a higher margin business for us than the rental business, whether that rental business is on Blockbuster or on Video-on-Demand.  So I think what you will look for us to do is consistently try and open new avenues of sell-through.</p>
          <p>I think the deal that we recently signed with Apple to put our movie titles on electronic sell-through I think was a significant deal for us.  We worked a long time to get those economics right, and we felt that those economics are right.  We have other electronic sell-through things that we have with Amazon and various other web players and we will continue to look at those.  We will certainly continue to play in the rental business whether that is physical goods rental or Video-on-Demand rental. But I think the big thing that studios should be focused on or that we're focused on is really margin, much more margin than anything else. And we have consistently over a ten-year period seen that there are much higher margins for us in the sell-through business than there have been, regardless of what delivery device you use, than there are in the rental business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'll keep it to just one question, but it might be a little long winded.  This has to do with the company's newspaper strategy and in particular your interest in Newsday, given what you talked about in your prepared remarks. So I think we all obviously understand that the goal was to consolidate or the goal is to consolidate the back office of The Post with the back office of Newsday to increase profitability of The Post. However, it would seem an expensive way to improve profitability of The Post. Moreover since neither appears to fit into your longer term content strategy, wouldn't it be a more prudent move to divest The Post, and keep in mind this is coming from an avid Post reader? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. I guess the first question is for Rupert.  Where do you see the mix of Dow Jones online revenues growing?  I think you're probably at the 40% range today, so how do you see that shaking out in the next couple years?  And the other question perhaps for Peter, I think given that Fox News has been traditionally benchmarked to CNN, which has significantly gained on ratings recently, do you think that is something that might affect your upside with the affiliate renewal conversations that you're having now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our online revenues at Dow Jones, I mean this is what it's about, is electronic delivery of information. I expect that we will at least double our revenues and do a lot more than that to our profit margins online.  Just to add one more thing to that, the actual subscription rate for the print Journal is a lot less than half that of The New York Times, and we intend to put that right. Between that and online rates and online expansion, we can see improvements in revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars. This is a business which has been undermanaged or not managed for decades.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me just make sure I get that correct.  When you say double the revenues, you expect that as a proportion of Dow Jones' total revenue that online revenues would approach what percent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our online revenues will be a lot more than 50%, probably 60 &#x2013; 70% of total revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>As for Fox News, despite some very clever advertising by CNN, Fox News continues its dominance.  We have had our ratings increase over the prior year.  I think we're up 9% in total day, up 10% in primetime.  I believe we are still probably double their ratings.  That's not an exact factor; we can get you the exact number.  But I think...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Monday to Friday, we are at least double.  Weekends, they get closer to us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think if you look at probably most importantly if you look at all cable networks overall, we are the number four rated cable network in primetime. CNN is number 13, MSN [MSNBC] is number 27. So despite some clever advertising, we remain still the dominant news source.  We would expect that to grow as we go into the general election, and we don't see any impact whatsoever.  I think if anything, it's pretty hard for me to imagine any affiliate, any cable operator saying we don't want the number four cable network, and we certainly see any indications.</p>

          <p>I don't think we have any level of interest.  I think that we would respond accordingly to any propositions that we thought did or didn't make sense to us, but we're not sitting around saying this is of interest to us or not of interest to us.  We're prepared to have any strategic conversation that we think does or does not make sense.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to pick on that a little more.  What are your thoughts on the consolidation of the Internet companies?  Do you think Microsoft will need to buy Yahoo! to compete with Google? And also on the SAG front, the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists rejected a SAG request to postpone talks a third time.  Are you going to seek a quick agreement with AFTRA to pressure SAG into compromising on the DVD residuals on pay branch network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I obviously have no comment on whether Microsoft needs Yahoo!. I think you should ask Microsoft. It's interesting and fun as a bystander, but whether it's necessary for them, I think that's their question, not mine.</p>
          <p>As for SAG or AFTRA, we're not going to seek a quick deal with anyone.  We are always &#x2013; we have been very consistent in our positioning, which is we are anxious and eager to find fair deals that serve the industry as a whole well, that appropriately and fully reward talent for the work they do, and yet at the same time allow companies to both stay economically viable in the current environment, and more importantly to participate in new media and to participate in potential growth areas without constraints that would otherwise restrict us. That was simply our strategy with the writers and our strategy with the directors.  It was our strategy with the one deal with made with AFTRA.  It was certainly the strategy we had when we into negotiations with SAG. And unfortunately we weren't able to successfully complete those negotiations this week, and it's the same strategy we will go into the AFTRA negotiations with today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p>But we're not seeking anything quick.  What we're seeking are fair deals for everybody; ones that treat talent fairly, but also allow there to be a healthy industry in which everyone both talent and the companies can continue to prosper in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Could you talk about the future for the Internet consolidation?  What are you looking at?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding Newsday, why did you decline to increase your bid for Newsday after Cablevision put up a higher cash offer?  Do you consider your current 580 million offer to be part of a binding agreement with Tribune's Sam Zell, and do you see any possibility of raising your bid if Cablevision looks like it will prevail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think Cablevision will prevail. Just be patient for a couple of days, will you?  We're certainly not in the business of getting into an auction here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Since we've talked a lot about newspapers on this call, I thought it was worth just getting your latest sentiment about reports linking the company to The New York Times potentially. I know you're obviously focused on other things right now, but any thought on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I never read such nonsense in my life. It's obviously illegal, and we don't have any ambitions there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and actually can I follow up real quick on the SAG front?  Just operationally, I was wondering about operating in this potential strike environment because you spoke more about the negotiations as opposed to the financial impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think it's a shame that we weren't able to come to an earlier agreement with SAG, and I think the unfortunate ramifications are that it's difficult for anybody to start a movie at this point. You won't see any movies start now because they might be potentially interrupted by a strike, and I think any industry that has already weathered an extremely devastating strike earlier this year, the onset of what's essentially a de facto actors' strike is I think a really bad thing for an industry. Certainly we have endeavored to try and get and keep the talent back to work, and we would love to make fair deals for everybody concerned as soon as possible so that we don't have this de facto slowdown which we're already in the midst of on the movie side.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys.  Peter, I was wondering if you can explain a little bit more what kind of films, what types of movies we could see out on day-and-date from you guys, day-and-date VOD you said would be very selective there.  Any kind of color on what kind of movies could work for you guys on that front?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really.  I think we're going to experiment, and we will try different genres and different categories and see the results and see what impact it has on DVD sales, but I don't have any sort of specific sort of template on what will or won't be day-and-date.</p>

          <p>Hi, Rupert. I just wondered if you could give us your reaction to the independent committee at Dow Jones or at the Wall Street Journal which claimed that the letter and spirit of the independence deal had been breached there over the resignation of Marcus Brauchli.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Naturally, we don't agree with it at all.  We stick absolutely to that. It was up to Marcus to go to the committee, and he chose not to, if he wanted to object in any way, and he's staying with the company.  He'll have an office in here. We are looking forward to his -- making great use of his counsel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="29" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just say this. We are very actively engaged in a search both inside our company and outside the company for a successor and to be able to move forward as quickly as we can, and we are naturally keeping this committee fully informed as we go along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="29" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="30" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I'm just wondering at this point, what is the value of keeping Fox Interactive Media and MySpace together. Why not just have MySpace and do something else with Fox Interactive Media or dissolve it?  Why does MySpace need to be part of it, other than to make all of this money?  I didn't mean that to sound flip, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's &#x2013; I'm not quite sure the nature of the question, but ultimately if you look at certainly what we just did in the advertising side, we keep trying to have these things run efficiently, as efficiently as possible. Fox Interactive Media is largely just a corporate construct to organize some of our holdings and help us manage them, but MySpace is run independently. It now sells its ads independently, builds its features independently, and we organize our businesses in what we hope and trust is the most efficient way possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="30" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Fox Interactive, I mean, having MySpace's numbers really &#x2013; looking at Fox Interactive Media's numbers, we're really looking primarily at MySpace's revenue, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think MySpace we've said repeatedly is clearly the dominant revenue generator, but there are important other businesses inside of there, whether it's ITN, which is growing nicely, Fox Sports, which is a leader in sports, Photobucket, et cetera.  So I think that we're trying to organize and run our business efficiently, and we certainly don't think that there are any negatives to MySpace to being organized inside of this larger thing and some benefits in terms of joint buying of technology, joint buying of spectrum, investments, et cetera, utilizing some corporate staff and functions.  So we think it's organized well, and we will consistently keep an eye on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="30" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last thing on that, the decentralization of the ad sales, is that going to put you further behind for a little bit in achieving your goals?  Does it hold things back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think actually it will accelerate us because I think one of the things it allows us to do is to more closely align the building of features with monetization of those features.  And I think particularly as we learn more about how social networking works and we learn more about building new applications, building new features, building things like MySpaceTV or the music joint venture or new iterations to the home page, it allows those people who are in product development to be essentially next door to the people who are responsible for monetizing those developments.  And essentially what we were looking to do is cut out a layer in between, and so not only do we think it will [not] slow us down, we think it will actually accelerate our ability to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What's your strategic vision for a combined New York Post/Newsday operation and also for future ventures with Tribune?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On both scores, we see Newsday continuing to be a very important local newspaper covering two of the greatest counties in America and wealthiest counties in America, and the Post covering basically the city of New York and being a paper with a very different character.  We're not putting them into the one newspaper.  But there are great savings in printing and distribution and of course all the normal back office functions.  There's a lot we can do together and we will pursue that and see.  We're very optimistic for both papers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="31" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When do you think that this deal might be wrapped up?  Because you told county exec Steve Levy a couple weeks ago that it would be two weeks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was only one and a half weeks ago.  We're hoping to wrap it up within the next week, and I don't mean the end of next week, I mean within the next seven days.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="31" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was also curious about &#x2013; I guess part of that led to your decision to stand firm on the Newsday bid then because maybe Zell is close to making a decision and it might be you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
