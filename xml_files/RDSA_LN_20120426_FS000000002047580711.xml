          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q1 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'd like to introduce our host, Mr. Simon Henry, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, operator. Welcome to Royal Dutch Shell's First Quarter 2012 Results Presentation. Good morning or good afternoon wherever you may be. I'll take you through the results and the portfolio development for the quarter and leave plenty of time for questions. First of all though the cautionary statement.</p>
          <p>Okay. Quarterly results are important but they still remain a snapshot of performance in a volatile industry, where we are in the process of implementing a long-term strategy. First quarter earnings, excluding identified items, were $7.3 billion and that's an earnings per share increase of 15%, compared to the first quarter last year. With $2.4 billion of divestments in the quarter, we're increasing divestment target for this year from $2 billion to $3 billion range to at least $4 billion.</p>
          <p>Underlying oil and gas production increased by 4% in the quarter. We've started up new projects in upstream and now in the Downstream for further growth and we continue to mature new options mostly of course in the upstream, with successful drilling in the Gulf and new exploration acreage in the quarter. So this continues progress we made on the new options in 2011, for example, the Abadi floating LNG project in Indonesia and the additional liquids rich shale positions.</p>
          <p>The dividend for quarter one will increase year-over-year, with the strategy delivering underlying and sustainable financial growth. So we're making good progress against our targets to deliver a more competitive performance.</p>
          <p>Give you some more details starting with the macro environment. Now if you look at the macro picture compared to the first quarter last year, oil prices are higher. There is an increase in the differential between Brent and WTI. Our overall global natural gas realizations, they increased from the first quarter 2011, while &#x2013; though, of course, the U.S. Henry Hub related prices declined quite sharply.</p>
          <p>Our overall refining marketing and chemicals margins were all weaker for Shell year-over-year. Currently, we're seeing a very mixed picture on energy demand. Oil prices have been supported by geopolitical events, despite a market which, in our view, is fundamentally well supplied. We've seen LNG demand increasing year over year, led by Asia.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., a combination of improving economic conditions and low gas prices are now stimulating gas demand. But European gas demand remains weak, due to the weak overall economic conditions and basically price competition with coal. In oil products, our underlying volumes were flat quarter-one-to-quarter-one. Demand is being eroded in developed markets by high prices. Our volume is flat in Europe and the U.S., firm demand for branded fuels in Asia.</p>
          <p>Economic outlook remains very uncertain, particularly in Europe, where many commentators see the prospect of a new recession. So those are the Q1 to Q1 trends. In aggregate, a weak demand picture and little evidence of fundamental year-over-year recovery or in fact much improvement since the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to earnings, let me just highlight that we published country level tax information for the first time yesterday. Now, Shell is committed to high standards of transparency to all stakeholders and we've had a number of questions from you on this topic. And I hope if you access the information on the website you'll find this information useful and I'd be happy to take any questions you might have on it.</p>
          <p>So, moving onto the earnings. Current cost of supplies, CCS, earnings for the quarter including the identified items were $7.7 billion, excluding identified items the earnings were $7.3 billion. Earnings per share increased 15% compared to 2011. On a quarter-one-to-quarter-one basis earnings in Upstream were higher and Downstream lower.</p>
          <p>Cash flow generated from operations was $13.4 billion. Dividends in the quarter were $2.7 billion, of which about $1 billion was settled with the new shares under the Scrip Dividend Programme. Now, we are offering the Scrip again for the first quarter of 2012. We have recently restarted share buybacks in the quarter, the second quarter that is, and that's part of our overall strategic intention to offset dilution from the Scrip. Scrip dividends have now totaled over $5 billion since we launched in 2010.</p>
          <p>Just let me talk about the business performance in a little more detail. Upstream earnings excluding identified items were $6.3 billion in the first quarter, and that's an increase of 35% versus the same quarter last year. The earnings were of course driven by higher oil and international gas prices, but also by volume growth from high margin new projects, particularly in Qatar, and also a positive environment for gas trading. There were some offsets from higher cost and depreciation and lower U.S. Henry Hub gas prices. The headline oil and gas production for the first quarter was 3.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. That is an increase of 4% excluding asset sales exits and price impacts.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had some 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of entitlement loss from profit sharing contracts, as a lower entitlement kicked in at contracted milestones and high oil prices moved some PSCs out to cost recovery mode. The LNG sales volumes grew by 17% quarter-one-to-quarter-one and not reflect basically growth from Qatargas 4 and Nigeria LNG.</p>
          <p>The year-over-year planned maintenance impacts were negligible in the first quarter at Upstream and Downstream. So during the second quarter of 2012 looking forward, there will be higher levels of planned maintenance activities on offshore fields in the Americas, in Asia-Pacific and in Europe. This is expected to lead to a production impact, a negative impact of some 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day across second quarter and that's compared to the second quarter in 2011.</p>
          <p>In Qatar, the Pearl gas-to-liquids project continues to make good progress. We're on track to reach full capacity in the middle of 2012, as always planned. We are running planned maintenance on sections of both the Pearl Trains during the second quarter. These pit stops, they are part of the startup phase of the project, clearly impact production. The three large startups last year: Qatargas 4, Pearl and the Athabasca Oil Sand Project in Canada, are all capable of producing 450,000 barrel equivalent per day at their peak production or capacity.</p>
          <p>These three projects alone produced some 360,000 barrels a day in the first quarter. That compares with 130,000 barrel a year ago, so clearly significant growth from them and clearly also further growth to come. I'd expect the three projects to deliver a fairly similar production level in the second quarter as first quarter this year, reflecting the pit stops I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Downstream. Excluding identified items, the Downstream CCS earnings were $1.1 billion, and that's lower than year-ago levels. Oil products results were lower than year-ago levels, but similar year-over-year numbers in chemical. In aggregate, refining, marketing and trading margins were all weaker compared to Q1 2011, some uplift from the Ra&#xED;zen joint venture in Brazil and from lower operating costs. However, we did see an improvement in refining chemicals and trading conditions compared to the fourth quarter 2011, which was a particularly quarter. Although marketing margins were weaker sequentially, this was due to continuing rising oil prices in a weak demand environment.</p>
          <p>Chemicals and refinery availability, the manufacturing availability were both higher than a year ago; they also improved against what was not a good fourth quarter. We're expecting worldwide refinery and chemicals availability for the second quarter 2012 to be in line with the second quarter 2011. These are better figures from downstream overall, but clearly, still a difficult environment and we're just not where we want to be here. So those are the earnings.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flow. Cash generation on a 12-month rolling basis was some $50 billion, including $6.8 billion of divestment proceeds, with an average Brent price across that period of $115 per barrel. Both the Upstream and the Downstream segments generated surplus cash flow after their own investment and, as a result, the gearing at the end of the first quarter sat at 9.9%. And that compares with 13% at the end of the fourth quarter and, clearly, we're moving lower in the zero to 30% range as, of course, you would expect in strong oil price conditions.</p>
          <p>Disposals are an important element to Shell's capital efficiency and our overall portfolio enhancement program and the divestments broadly matched acquisitions in recent years. We're making good progress this year with $2.4 billion of divestments in this quarter. We also signed further deals that we'll complete later in 2012. So as a result, we now expect over $4 billion of asset sales in 2012 and that's an increase of course from our previous $2 to $3 billion guidance. We sold some $36 billion in assets in the last five years, roll-over ran 17% of our capital employed.</p>
          <p>And I'm particularly pleased in this quarter to welcome new strategic partners into our Prelude floating LNG venture in Australia, where Inpex of Japan, KOGAS of Korea and CPC of Taiwan have now joined us. This partnership monetizes some of our own Shell optionality at an early stage and are part of Shell's plans for new growth in global gas.</p>
          <p>Our organic spending guidance total of capital investment for 2012 remains at $32 billion, excluding, as we said before, up to $1 billion of spend, assuming we get access to drill in Alaska this year. We continue to look for additional acreage positions in exploration and undeveloped resource positions. We spent around $0.6 billion on this in the first quarter. Quite likely there is more to come as we go through the year.</p>
          <p>Let me update you in progress on the growth portfolio. Production has now commenced at the Caesar-Tonga project in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pluto LNG project in Australia is now &#x2013; has reached ready-for-start-up status. Together, the two upstream projects are expected to add a total 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 0.9 million tonnes per annum of LNG.</p>
          <p>On the Downstream side, we've just started processing crude in the Port Arthur refinery expansion project. That will create the largest refinery in the United States. There's some 600,000 barrels a day of overall total refining capacity. These three projects are all part of the diverse portfolio of some 26 projects we previously discussed that Shell is developing worldwide today. We're driving the targets that we set for cash flow and production.</p>
          <p>We also made progress maturing new projects with medium-term growth potential during the quarter. We signed up over 77,000 square kilometers of acreage so far this year, including high potential frontier positions in deepwater in Nova Scotia in Canada, and Tanzania offshore, and in the Orange Basin in South Africa. In the Gulf of Mexico, we had good drilling results in the Appomattox prospect. This is a Jurassic reservoir sort, so new to the industry; we're just learning. So we're now estimating 0.5 billion barrels of potential in this field. We also see further upside potential as we drill new wells in the area.</p>
          <p>Earlier this week, we announced an intended cash offer for Cove Energy plc in the UK and this was recommended by Cove's board. This is part of a strategy to build up our presence in East Africa and Cove would mark our entry into Mozambique gas and also new exploration potential in both Mozambique and Kenya. Now the cost &#x2013; total cost for Shell is expected to be just below $2 billion. That includes the price to Cove's shareholders and an estimate of the capital gains tax charge. So, good progress on the growth portfolio.</p>
          <p>The call wouldn't be complete without some comments on dividends. Shell has a strong track record on dividends. Dividends are the company's main route to return cash to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, we have paid more dividends than any of our sector peer group and, absent further changes to stated dividends, we will still be the largest dividend payer in our peer group. We haven't cut our dividend for decades and I'd just like to reiterate, we maintained our dividend across the credit crisis, despite the pressures we were under. We used the balance sheet to maintain both the dividend and the growth spending in 2009, 2010 and that was in the period when many investors worried we'd be forced into a cut.</p>
          <p>We have reduced our costs; we are delivering growth and it is this structural improvement that is driving the increase in dividends that we confirmed today. And that's a return to growth after a pause in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Now oil prices have almost doubled since 2009, whereas refining margins and the U.S. natural gas price clearly have remained low or got lower. We as a company must look through the short-term volatility when we plan for dividends and we take decisions on a long-term policy basis. There is no simple mechanical formula. The resumption of the measured affordable dividend growth that we've confirmed today reflects the improving underlying financial position of the company and the delivery of our strategy in line with policy.</p>
          <p>So, just let me summarize before we go to questions. First quarter earnings have increased from the year-ago levels, driven by operating performance, new projects and strong oil prices and this is despite the continued challenges for our industry in the downstream and in North American natural gas pricing. With $2.4 billion of divestments in the quarter, we're increasing the divestment target for the year to over $4 billion. Our underlying oil and gas production increased by 4% in the quarter, starting up new projects in upstream and downstream for further growth. The dividend for quarter one will increase, with our strategy delivering sustainable financial growth and we continue to mature growth options and growth mostly in the Upstream, so making good progress against targets to deliver a more competitive performance.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to move to your questions. Operator, please could we just have one or two questions each, so, everybody has the opportunity? Operator, please could you poll for questions? Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  The first question comes from Theepan Jothilingam from Nomura International. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Afternoon, Simon. Thank you for your comments. Two questions please, firstly, a very good number in integrated gas. I'm being greedy but is there anyway to disclose the split between GTL and LNG? Or put it another way, could you give us maybe the delta quarter-on-quarter for LNG? And some comments on whether you think this result is sustainable going forward.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there've been some media headlines this morning about your intentions in Mozambique. Could you confirm whether you've already been in discussion with some of the existing players in Mozambique before you made a higher bid for Cove? And is it right to guess that you're pretty confident you're going to increase the stake beyond Cove? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Theepan. Thanks for the comments. Integrated gases indeed the main driver of the improved Upstream earnings performance and cash flow. It is of course the strategy playing out in action. We've being saying for sometime this is core to Shell strategy. So there's increase of $1.35-or-so-billion dollars in the earnings, Qatar, both projects are responsible for about 60% of that. The remainder is split roughly equally between additional volumes ahead of Nigeria and Russia, better pricing and better opportunities from cargo diversions, simply because we have more LNG to work with and, of course, the market's been fairly tight in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So it is strategy coming into action, so in the same macro, then, yes, it would be basically sustainable. It's also fairly robust, given that, as you're probably aware, the majority of the LNG volumes and obviously the GTL volumes are oil price-linked, so very little exposure, by definition, in the integrated gas segment to lower prices, for example, in U.S. or spot prices in Europe.</p>
          <p>Media headlines on Mozambique and Cove, I have to say, I've not read them so I can't comment specifically and &#x2013; but, what we have said is, firstly, the bid 8.5% effectively over the Rovuma Area 1 license, we are in the &#x2013; it is agreed by the Cove directors and &#x2013; but clearly there is a period to go before we can close out that deal. So we're hopeful that we bring, not only the right price to the Cove shareholders, but also have the right capability to get the government approval, which we need.</p>
          <p>8.5% remains perhaps a little low for a Shell presence in what hopefully will be quite a large LNG development and we are and will remain interested in increasing from that level of involvement. I really can't comment on whether we have or will hold discussions with individual members in the existing consortia, either in that area or elsewhere. I just confirm that, yes, of course, we're interested but one step at a time; we must close the Cove deal first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just come back to your comment on LNG and Q1? You talked about it being a tight quarter. Do you see that going into Q2 and beyond for 2012 please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general. yes, although it is a big seasonal. So the demand can come off a bit across the summer, it depends on how warm it is in countries with lots of air conditioning. And so, in general, the demand is higher than it was a year ago. We will see Pluto coming on and there's a couple of other smaller projects likely to come on during the year, but most of the volume's already sold into long-term contracts. There are various Chinese regas terminals opening up capacity expanding. India is fairly strong in its demand for LNG at the moment. So as we look across the variety of markets, we do expect the market to stay pretty tight.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Rigby from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two questions. The first is I noted your what looked like a very pointed remark about your Downstream that &#x2013; what sounded like a remark that suggested you wanted further improvement. And I just wondered whether you could talk about what you can do, excluding any kind of rebound in refining conditions, albeit that hopefully have improved in the second quarter. I say that in the context of a refining business that I think that has barely made money in any quarter since 2007 or 2008.</p>
          <p>The second is just on your commentary at the end on the dividend and the balance sheet; I think you brought that in. Is &#x2013; I take your point about where oil prices are. But, as you said, is -Downstream's not great. And you're generating a kind of level of cash flow now which is pretty similar or inline with the kind of number that you aspirationally want to do at mid-cycle. So, what are you thinking about how you'll deal with what is very impressive level of free cash flow generation that you're now starting to throw off? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. And Downstream, fundamentally, the comments are driven by the fact it's a third of the capital employed <mark type="ph" /> in this quarter as happened (23:34) I think of the earnings. So that's the reference there that's really not where we want to be in the Downstream. We've certainly seen some challenges in refining margins, but clearly we don't necessarily control those. Our aim in the portfolio has been, remains and probably will be to be in large, complex refineries that are geographically well suited. So, Port Arthur, for example, and <mark type="ph" /> Pernas (24:02), Rheinland, Singapore, but there are clearly still some challenges at the periphery in refining.</p>
          <p>Our marketing businesses typically have held up well, but there is weak demand to be fair in developed markets. We need to make more of the positions we have. We need to ensure that we're meeting customer requirements at lower cost. And I think there is an element of optimization of margin delivery around trading supply refining envelopes, as we are adjusting to feeding pretty much the same marketing demand with a lower refining capacity. So there's some optimization we can do.</p>
          <p>Now uptime in the quarter, availability of 94% in refining, so we're actually got better availability than we've had for quite some time. The challenge is actually utilizing all of it in the challenging markets. And also just highlight as we go forward, clearly, Port Arthur and Ra&#xED;zen</p>
          <p>are both contributing or, hopefully, going to contribute more over time, because both of those are effectively growing in the business. Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet, hence the longish answer. There are &#x2013; we'll have to pull all of those levers to get the returns back to where we need it to be.</p>
          <p>And dividend <mark type="ph" /> kind, EES (25:24) over the past, in fact, the past 12 months and the previous quarter, the 12 months leading up to that our cash flow from ops, excluding the divestments, was $43 billion, which coincidentally was the target that we'd set for 2012. Bear in mind now our $10 billion, nearly $11 billion dividend, plus the ongoing net capital investment expectation of $30 billion. Gearing is coming down; we are doing a little bit of buyback. And, clearly, we need to keep a couple of billion in the bucket for Cove, assuming it goes ahead. And &#x2013; but just to be clear, the dividend is linked to the underlying structural cash flow, it's not linked to the gearing.</p>
          <p>And &#x2013; so put the gearing and the balance sheet to one side. So the underlying cash flow is coming through but there is more to come, as that more to come feeds through, then, as we've said before, the board has the discussion every quarter and they're &#x2013; is sensitive to the comments they hear. So, let's say as we go forward, no projection when we'd consider a further growth.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Iain Reid from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon; Iain Reid from Jefferies. Can I just come back on the dividends statements you just made? You probably see what Exxon announced the other day and Chevron. And, historically, yes, you have been the biggest dividend payer but you're not going to be now with Exxon's increase. And, obviously, they do a substantial buyback as well. So I take your point on the kind of historical levels of what you've paid out, but it looks like you're slipping behind some of your competitors now in terms of what's going today. So does the board take into account this kind of competitive pressure that obviously investors can switch their attention from a kind of one dividend payer to another? Because, obviously, the analysis you've done is looking at other companies in the same peer group.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on U.S. gas, is it possible to say how much of the U.S. gas you're producing at the moment is non-liquid related, i.e., pure dry gas? And what's your plans for investment in growing that number whilst the &#x2013; while Henry Hub is at these sort of levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay. So, Iain, my arithmetic could be wrong, but I think we still are the biggest player. I get it's more competitive now, I accept that. We're still pretty high in the payout ratio. And I think the moves we see are quite good because it starts to level the playing field. The majors now their payout ratios are converging. And so, I guess it means game on, if we're all on the same payout ratio than we better start growing the earnings and cash flow competitively; so good to see that we're in more of a level competition.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you added buybacks, it wouldn't be that level?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm talking about the dividend buybacks of primarily a management of gearing in the balance sheet issue. So underlying cash flow growth will be the driver of our competitive position and that will directly flow through into dividend. And so &#x2013; and the straight answer to your question, does the board take this into account? Absolutely, they do and they've been asking, how do the Americans get away with so much lower payout and yields for quite sometime?</p>
          <p>And U.S. gas percentage and LRF. We have not a lot of production in the liquids-rich shales at the moment. Almost all of our U.S. gas is, in practice, dry gas production. The liquids-rich shale and associated production at the end of the quarter was just over 10,000 barrels &#x2013; at the end of the fourth quarter, sorry, at the end of the year. At the end of the quarter, it was around 40,000 barrels. So we are growing that quickly in the Eagle Ford area. That figure does include the gas that comes with the liquid.</p>
          <p>So our aim as we go through the year, we were 240,000 barrel or so in terms of the first quarter onshore unconventional activity production, gas on liquids. We expect that to grow through the year, but we are basically still in the process of switching drilling activity from dry gas to wet gas or liquids. And difficult to project exactly what the outcome is but the net impact is probably less volume in 2012, more we believe in 2013. I'll give you an update more specifically, I expect later in the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Two questions, if I may, the FAS 69 disclosure in the 20-F shows that in the Upstream production costs, excluding taxes, went from broadly $11 on a per barrel basis to roughly $13.5. So they went up 23% from 2010 to 2011. I was wondering whether you could comment on what is driving the change? I already seeing significant cost inflation coming through there mix effects going on and driving that OpEx per barrel figure.</p>
          <p>And secondly again in the 20-F, there was a comment in the CEO statement from Mr. Voser where he writes: I believe we can get more value out of our assets. The uptime of our processing facilities could be greater and there are significant savings to be realized in our supply change.</p>
          <p>And I was wondering whether you could make any comment over the sort of broadly the order of magnitude of the additional value that he's talking about there? And also, the sort of the broadly the time horizon of which these additional savings and that additional value could be realized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Martijn. You've been doing some good homework there. Production increased 11% to 23% and fundamentally there are some mix effects there. For example, the Oil Sands comes on stream. You saw the first cost coming in Qatar and our cost per barrel in, for example, the onshore activity that I just talked about, the onshore gas is this fundamentally higher and there's also some foreign exchange impact.</p>
          <p>So all of those put together are really driving the cost up and plus having there was a bit &#x2013; there was somewhat less deepwater production from pretty much the same cost base and that was a Macondo related issue. So all of those things lifted the unit cost, but also I need to recognize that almost everything I've just said are in areas where fiscal treatments are relatively attractive as well. So we have more access to the price upside. So cost is only one side of the margin question.</p>
          <p>The question of more value, if we could get our uptime in the right place: we've used numbers internally to have this discussion. It's somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion and it's split roughly equally between Upstream and Downstream. And that's a gross margin, so prior to any additional cost. And that's fundamentally a value that we believe left on the table from incidents that we can or should prevent in an operational sense or ways of just sustaining uptime longer in a safe and responsible manner on the assets which we operate. So, that's what we're shooting for internally.</p>
          <p>Supply chain benefits definitely in the billions. We spent on third-party goods and services last year, $70 billion, in terms of contracts placed with third party, $70 billion. There is some inflation out there but right now and certainly even including last year, the potential for us to improve from some of the things we've been implementing over the past three, four years, such as the global framework agreements, aggregating our demand, simplifying our standards, improving the supplier relationship, sometimes integrating into the supplier relationships.</p>
          <p>You can see on the spend of $70 billion, we ought to be able to take more out than we suffer cost inflation going into that number. So, some of that shows through in lower CapEx, some shows through in lower OpEx, potential remains, the forward potential in the billions of dollars. We don't have a specific number for it though. So, hopefully, that gives you some size of the prize.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah, thanks. That's quite helpful. In terms of timing, is this &#x2013; would you expect that those savings and that additional value can be delivered from measures that have been taken in the past? Or is this very much sort of an effort that's still needs to be undertaken and will only pay off over a number of years going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had a very quick question, you mentioned Alaska. I was wondering what the key thresholds are for you to be able to start the drilling there? And what kind of potential size you're looking for the exploration targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michele. This is possibly the most important single milestone of this year. That's what does it take to drill? Well, there are three things we're working on. One is operational, second is regulatory and the third is the legal or the litigation access. Operationally, we plan two rigs and around 35 other vessels, which will provide all the support and logistics, including, of course, the oil spill response. All of that fleet, including the two rigs, is either on-station in Alaska or on its way to Alaska at the moment. So it's a huge logistical exercise but likely via a fleet into the Alaska mortise. So, operationally, this is not easy operationally but we're on track.</p>
          <p>And the second point, regulatory permit. A significant number of permits are required, everything from exploration <mark type="inaudible" /> (36:34) to air quality permits. All regulatory permits are either achieved and in hand or we expect to receive in good time to be able to start drilling in the third quarter. And on the last comment, we have an expected size of prospect but we have actually invested around $4 billion to-date in Alaska. So you can be fairly sure that we're looking for something big enough to justify that level of investment and the persistence that we've had to show over the five, six years in which we've been preparing to drill.</p>
          <p>So, the third challenge, I'm afraid, is a legal one. Now this is the U.S. where we have, one, no control and, two, not necessarily too much of a firm view about what the outcome might be. What we have seen in previous years is that some of our friends have launched legal action at the last minute in courts that are not necessarily predictable and that has led to difficulties in going forward. This year, we've invited the courts to consider the litigation that we expect in good time, such that due process can be considered, the exploration plans and other regulatory processes can be considered by the courts in Alaska in good time to give either a yes or a no to the plan to drill in the third quarter. Now that does not rule out unpredictable events in the U.S. legal system. Having said that, we're confident that we're ready, willing and able to drill, that we can do so in a very safe and responsible manner, and we look forward to a successful campaign this year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, can you talk a wee bit about the financial framework in which you view the Mozambique acquisition around some indication of how you think about pricing, et cetera? And then the &#x2013; and the returns?  And then, secondly, unrelated, can you just remind us what contribution and when you're expecting from the Port Arthur upgrade this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alast. The financial framework around Mozambique <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:05) initially in the strategic framework. Current LNG market is 240 million tonnes per annum. We expect growth in the early, in the next ten years basically, to 400 million tonnes per annum and there are a significant number of projects already filling that gap. But we expect growth beyond that, potentially to 500 million tonnes per annum and beyond as a result of our assessment of the gas market in countries that are likely to import LNG. It's a huge market, it is growing. Our current capacity is 21 million tonnes per annum. Our amount under construction is 7 million tonnes per annum and we are looking at 15 million tonnes per annum, excluding Mozambique, of new potential projects.</p>
          <p>We need to do a significant number of new projects in addition to our projects already under construction, just to keep the market share in what is a fast-growing and attractive business, witness the $2.4 billion in the integrated gas segment in the previous quarter. So there's great returns, good projects, long lifecycle, and Shell is clearly a significant and very competitive player, the largest private player in this attractive industry so financial framework has got to be seen in that context.</p>
          <p>If we're successful in entering Mozambique and the project goes ahead, then we would be looking at ranking that against other LNG opportunities. We can't do everything I've just talked about, but we will do the better ones. So it actually provides a bit of diversification in the portfolio away from Australia, for example, where all our projects under construction today are actually in Australia, although many of those we're looking at are not, such as Canada, Indonesia and, hopefully, now Mozambique.</p>
          <p>In pricing and returns, there's no reason why Mozambique should not be as good if not better than our current LNG projects. Clearly, the entry cost is only going to be a small part of the overall investment because a large LNG development has huge capital investment associated. Now we don't have a figure for that, you'd need to ask the operator. But they took a 17 Tcf to 30 Tcf and potentially 30 million tonnes per annum of LNG, so it would be significant the investment that we need to rank against several alternatives.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, in general, clearly the $2 billion is affordable, but the increase in the asset sales is not entirely unconnected with the potential to add new assets to the portfolio. So as we monetize either non-core assets or we dilute them into smaller shares in important assets under construction, that enables us to recycle and expand the diversity in the portfolio. And so that's how you can see it both strategically and financially.</p>
          <p>At Port Arthur, it's &#x2013; some of the downstream units are working already with finished product, the distillation unit has crude cycling at the moment, the hydro cracker will start up by the end of the quarter. Collectively, probably not a huge impact on the second quarter; should start to see some contribution in the third quarter. Please just do remember, it's actually embedded at a 50-50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco. So we just see the equity share of earnings in Motiva joint venture. At the moment the margins are maybe not that attractive in the Gulf Coast, but over the cycle we expect Port Arthur to be a significant contributor to the Downstream earnings.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, Simon. Thanks for the call. Two questions, if I may. The first was just around the cash flow for the quarter. On an underlying basis, ex working cap, we saw a small decline year-on-year. It seems to me that's to do with tax cash paid. I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color on that? And how Asia is moving forward, whether we should expect an increase in the cash tax rate? And whether that relates to Pearl or anything else, if you can give us any color there?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, on the Gulf of Mexico and Appomattox &#x2013; apologies for the pronunciation &#x2013; if you can perhaps give us some color on when we could expect FID and what the potential upside is in terms of resources there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rahim. The two important questions, the CFFO for the quarter at $13 billion, basically the same as it was last year excluding working cap. The primary difference is actually the tax paid, you're absolutely correct. Tax payments tend to run in line with previous year's profit. So of course in 2011 the profit was higher than it was in 2010. So there's an element of, yes, we pay more, but then last year we earned more. And going forward &#x2013; and it's not impacted by things like Qatar, although Qatar is clearly in a profitable situation at the moment and paying tax.</p>
          <p>So the &#x2013; what can you expect going forward? Well, the quarter-on-quarter variations won't be so high and over a rolling 12-month basis the cash tax paid catches up with, broadly speaking, the earnings. There are also some one-off effects where divestments don't always carry the same overlaid tax rate, effective tax rate, as the underlying earning. So it should structurally improve going forward.</p>
          <p>Gulf of Mexico exploration, we talked specifically about Appomattox doubling the potential resource there up to 500 million barrels. But it's worth just reflecting, we are bringing Caesar-Tonga on stream. Well, in fact, Anadarko brought it on stream for us in March. We are building Mars-B, Cardamom and also BC-10 phase 2 in Brazil. And we have three opportunities in the Gulf, of which Appomattox is actually the largest, but Stones and Vito are the other two that we're currently appraising ahead of, hopefully, FIDs in the not too distant future.</p>
          <p>Appomattox is the largest; it's also probably the most uncertain because it's in that new East Gulf area in the Jurassic play. We are appraising &#x2013; we will &#x2013; we have just appraised, that's the driver of the doubling. We will drill, hopefully, another couple of wells in the area. And we already have the Vicksburg discovery also in that area. We have 75% or 80% Shell working interest in quite a bit of acreage in the area and we're fundamentally aiming to appraise and understand that area while we progress all three of those prospects towards FID.</p>
          <p>Our aim generally in the Gulf is to create the production line of assets, where we design one, build many in terms of the surface and subsurface facilities. We are doing everything we can to bring investment decisions forward, but Appo is so potentially large and uncertain that we're probably several years away from investment decision.</p>
          <p>Worth also saying on the Gulf actually, we've stemmed the decline post-Macondo, we've now started to grow it again. But primarily Perdido has been the factor there. We are now 90,000 barrels oil equivalent a day in Perdido, which is good to see. And there's still further growth to come peaking probably next near on Perdido. So, thanks for that. Good opportunity just to get the overview in of the Gulf. Very important area; it's 50,000 barrels a day below where we would have hoped to have been. It's been slower to get back to operation there but we do have five floaters drilling at the moment, four platform rigs, one floater in, a new deepwater rig in a testing mode and we've got another one on the way, so by the end of the year we'd hope to have seven floating deepwater rigs.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. Yeah, a couple of quick questions, actually, both in the U.S., one in the upstream, one in the downstream. The profitability in the U.S., it's below $10 a barrel operating. Now you had talked about reducing the investment in tight gas. Are we seeing any of that impacting the volumes yet? And what else might be &#x2013; is in those numbers that might be affecting these quarters? I wonder whether any of the costs associated with Alaska is showing as operating costs or is that fully treated as CapEx at this stage?</p>
          <p>The second question is you also talked about the squeeze on demand for oil product and this is particularly visible in Europe, where I think year-on-year was down about 8%. We haven't seen that in the reported numbers in the States and I'm assuming that that is due to exports possibly. But there's big difference between &#x2013; there seems to be a big difference in the reported sales in the U.S. compared to Europe. And I'm just trying to understand why that might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try and help, Peter, thanks. The oil products is &#x2013; I'll start at the back end &#x2013; demand products. An interesting fact there, the Rhine River, it hasn't rained enough. It was low, therefore it was difficult to move product, therefore we sold considerably less than one might have hoped to do in both commercial and trading in the supply sense. But at some point it was beginning to threaten supply security. Fortunately, it started to rain again but had quite some impact in the quarter. So that explains Europe against the United States. Our own volumes in the U.S. being generally maintained, but the market is flat. It's not clear, is it going up or is it going down, we'll see as we go into the driving season.</p>
          <p>And profitability Upstream in the Americas, you're absolutely right that it is somewhat less than we might have wished for. And, yes, there is some of the Alaska spend going into OpEx; we don't capitalize until we drill. But other factors that were quite significant in the quarter, we had quite some significant maintenance activity in the Oil Sands in Canada. We are seeing higher depreciation and amortization, partly as a result of early production in the onshore gas or liquids-rich shales carried quite significant unit depreciation because we are quite slow and conservative to actually recognize proved reserves there.</p>
          <p>Clearly the gas prices, the natural gas prices had quite an impact. And in Canada, in particular, the WTI discount has an impact on crude realized prices. So all of those factors are keep going the Americas earnings low, which is unfortunate but hopefully not all sustainable issues as we go forward. We are switching out of gas into liquids-rich shales. That is having, as I've mentioned earlier, not too much volume impact now. It may have 20,000, 30,000 barrels a day impact by the end of the year relative to where we might otherwise have been.</p>
          <p>But as we switch into what is essentially an appraisal activity on the liquids-rich opportunities in Canada and the U.S., we won't replace it with liquids production this year but it will create the potential for liquids production next year. S, it will be a value upgrade assuming like-for-like drilling activity. So we're just managing this within the overall capital and also our operational capability. We're running about just under 40 rigs at the moment of which we're shifting probably more than half towards the liquids opportunities. And so hopefully that covers everything. Thanks, Peter.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Simon. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions if I could. Firstly, could you just give us an update on your latest strategy in North American gas, particularly your plans to build a large scale GTL plant in Louisiana? And how that would compare to economics on LNG exports? I mean, clearly you're bullish on the LNG market long-term. Is that something you're eventually going to consider?</p>
          <p>And, secondly, could you comment on your latest thinking in Australian LNG? Again, there's some headlines saying you're prepared to cooperate with other players on Queensland coal-bed methane. And how the economics there would compare to Mozambique? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kim. And North American gas strategy and fundamentally we're looking at 40 Tcf plus of gas which in a $2 world we probably would prefer to monetize on something other than natural gas. So we're looking at four different ways of doing that, of which LNG and GTL are two. The other two are gas direct-into-transport, LNG uses fuel for trucks, ships or rail, or gas-to-chemicals, which essentially is an ethane play in the Pennsylvania region.</p>
          <p>Gas-to-liquids, yes, we are looking to replicate what we've done in Qatar on the Gulf Coast, not necessarily in Louisiana, we're looking in Texas as well as Louisiana. Essentially looking for Brownfield opportunities, exiting infrastructure, access to the gas network and looking at what have learned in Qatar that can bring the costs down, increase the yields, increase the efficiency? It will take some time, a year or two, to work that through and then several years to construct. So we're some time away from making a decision on gas-to-liquids, and more likely towards the end of the decade before we get production. It does look attractive.</p>
          <p>How does it compare with LNG export?  Well, it depends of course on the answer to what will be the cost be and what will the yield be. But there's not a lot of difference there we'd say at the moment. LNG export, we would expect and are giving priority to exports from Canada, from the West Coast to Asia and we're working with our Asian partners and potential customers, of course, KOGAS, Mitsubishi and PetroChina. Our focus on LNG export is primarily on Canada. Out of the U.S. it's possible, but looks a little expensive in terms of getting access to facilities. So focus on Canada.</p>
          <p>CSG, coal seam gas, or CBM in Australia. Just to reiterate, there are four projects planned, three under construction plus our Arrow LNG project, where the LNG is in the feed process, potential FID maybe the end of next year. But, clearly, CSG is not like Sakhalin. We've started up Sakhalin on a handful of wells and it runs at full capacity on nine wells. To run big LNG and on the CSG basis you may need several thousand wells, which you can't just start and drill and start up on day one. So it is clearly a challenge for all the projects to have enough gas available to run the trains economically.</p>
          <p>What I said this morning, I've not seen what's actually has been reported, was that we have plenty of gas for our two-train project, where we're prepared to choose our timing of FID to minimize the potential impact of inflation and, in the meantime, if and as we develop production capability, we're open to discussion with other projects on provision of gas into other people's facilities. That doesn't mean it's going to happen, but we were open for discussion.</p>
          <p>Just to be clear, we're value-driven here, we're not in any particular hurry. We will develop the upstream and the midstream according to what makes best sense for getting the right balance between production, cost and ultimate market access. S, work program at the moment is feed, potentially FID end of next year. Hopefully, that's fairly clear.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, two points of clarification, I'm sorry if you covered this already. But was the tax charge lower than expected at 42%? I think it was 45% in 2011. And can you just tell me what the tax charge might be this year?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, on the exploration expense, I think it's $362 million, which looks low, in fact, it's the lowest since Q1 2009, so presumably a one-off low charge. But what would you assume as a run rate for the rest of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jason. Tax charge is not really lower than expected. We've got fundamentally &#x2013; we're shifting earnings from high tax regimes to low tax regimes, which will show through over time, so Qatar, the U.S., Canada, relatively low tax. Just to note, we did publish some of the country tax revenue payments yesterday. And difficult to forecast because it does depend on maintaining that mix, but no surprise, there were one-offs last year than there were this year, as they &#x2013; the divestments carried more one-off issues.</p>
          <p>Exploration expense. We expect to spend $5 billion on exploration this year, couple of billion on the onshore type activity, $3 billion on more traditional primarily offshore type activity. I would expect a higher run rate than a few hundred million. We're on track to spend that money. Some of what we spent in the first quarter was effective acreage acquisition, which don't expense; we don't expense acquisition, we don't expense drilling. Most of the rest gets expensed unless it's associated directly with successful efforts. So, it's just a question of phasing of activity and then type of activity in the current quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, thanks, afternoon. Just a couple of points of clarification perhaps. Athabasca Oil Sands, can you just expand on the maintenance comments and give us some indication of when you might perhaps be moving towards new capacity on that project?</p>
          <p>And, secondly, I just wonder whether you could make any commentary at all about the acreage that you've actually acquired in the States and what your initial appraisal activity suggests in terms of which acreage is more or less attractive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I presume, Lucas, the second question is about the liquids-rich shales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry, it is liquids.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Many thanks. In the first quarter in Canada, in the Oil Sands, we have unplanned maintenance events. We're still learning a bit about managing some of these assets and it did contribute to some of the numbers I talked about earlier in terms of the potential value left on the table. We are, however, improving. When we will be at capacity? Well, we've shown every individual piece of the value chain works at capacity, in fact, the upgrade is work above capacity.</p>
          <p>What we've not yet done is deliver that capacity on all parts of the value chain consistently over time. So we have, we've had weeks, not only at capacity, but actually above capacity at both the mine sites and the upgraders. So we have ongoing, both short-term maintenance activity but, most importantly, the debottlenecking projects, which will not only increase the overall capacity, they will help improve the reliability.</p>
          <p>It's typical, just for your information, for mine sites to be built for some reason with a target reliability and availability in the low 80%. And given that we manage better than that in most of the rest of our portfolio, that's what we've been working on over the past two to three years and we are steadily lifting that towards 90% and beyond.</p>
          <p>And acreage purchased in the U.S. and Canada, liquids-rich shales, although we tend to look at globally, as much as just North America, but specifically in North America we've picked up acreage obviously in the Eagle Ford, which we're drilling. And that's the most advanced; it's the only one that has material production for us. And &#x2013; but we have acreage also in the Mississippi Lime and several plays in Canada, including the Alberta Bakken and the Duvernay play, which is of the geological name, rather than the company.</p>
          <p>So we are currently operating nine rigs in appraisal and development and another four in exploration. We expect that to increase over the coming months. We &#x2013; and those are the areas that we're focusing on. We have other acreage that we may not get the rigs to as quickly and &#x2013; but we are certainly pushing the boundaries of all our existing acreage to the extent we can to produce wet gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Simon, when you talked earlier about 40,000 barrels a day from the Eagle Ford gas and oil. Can you give us some sense as to what the proportion of that 40,000 comes from liquids?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not just Eagle Ford, by the way, the 40,000 [barrels] but it'll depend on how the plays play out. Just one comment worth making on the LRS plays. They're not the same as each other; they're not even the same if we're drilling wells a kilometer apart. We're getting quite different results and that's exactly the same as the rest of the industry. This is an immature activity. It is not as mature as the gas and it's very difficult for anybody to project specific outcomes based on what we know about reservoirs and that includes the Williston Bakken as well.</p>
          <p>So, it remains uncertain. It's an exploration play. It's early appraisal, so 40,000 might be 50-50, it's probably not going to be a long way away from 50-50 but it's commonly more specific at the moment. As we drill these out &#x2013; these prospects out and as the industry drills the prospects out, we'll see more real in them I think in expectations, both cost recovery and ultimately the asset pricing that people are paying. Almost all our acreage is what we call emerging or frontier, none of it is mature, to the extent of having a high level of production.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay and, Simon, sorry, can I just ask you one other, chemicals, can you give us any idea what proportion of your profit now is coming from the U.S. relative to say a year ago? Again, just to get a sense of how Europe, rest of world has moved at a time when prices have being going up and demand probably being weaker, whilst U.S. has been supported by faltering input costs and ongoing steady demand?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you an exact percentage but it's certainly better in the U.S. compared to a year ago. Europe is down partly because of we sold <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:24) and partly because we &#x2013; Asia is also down, there's been some destocking and sales down a bit. But &#x2013; so the U.S. is up, the rest of the world down, but primarily that just reflects strategic choices. There's a playing out and what is still an attractive market medium-term and we think we're in a lot better position than we were previously.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question on your Marcellus spend. A partner of yours in the area apparently has chosen not to consent to the incremental drilling in the region, thereby, implying your net CapEx should increase in the short-term. That to me begs the question, how do you manage your budget in the Marcellus? Do you manage to a dollar spend? Or do you manage to an activity level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to say I don't manage it at all. I manage more at the portfolio level and the guys on the ground manage it. So, you're absolutely right, well, informed that there are non-consent partners in the Marcellus and, of course, if we drill that acreage their back-end costs are a multiple of the original costs. So, effectively, we're acquiring acreage by drilling it or acquiring a higher share in the acreage by drilling it.</p>
          <p>We will indeed do that where it makes sense. And the Marcellus is certainly an area where we see low cost and high potential overall, so we'll continue to do it. In the short-term, clearly, it does increase the CapEx. Our actual drilling spend in Marcellus, not that material for the group, so to be &#x2013; technically, we leave it with the guys who run the onshore operation to maximize value, rather than worry specifically about a number of wells or a number of rigs.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a general &#x2013; in general, would you expect your activity level to be flat for the balance of the year? Or increase, decrease, even if kind of qualitatively?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our net activity will increase, but it will increase on the liquids and the exploration and appraisals. We're moving rigs away from Haynesville and Pinedale and, basically, flat in Marcellus and Groundbirch and increasing everywhere else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Simon. I had couple of questions, please. So first, on the income statement I see the interest expense of $552 million. On an annualized basis about 6% of your debt and that compares with only about 3% last year. So I just wonder if it's something going on there? If there's any guidance for what we can expect?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you make reference to a good contribution in your downstream of the Brazilian JV, Ra&#xED;zen. I wonder if you can give us some visibility on how material that is? And also the JV's looking to perhaps acquire BG's stake in Comg&#xE1;s. How does it fit in this strategy? What is the game plan there?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Irene. Interest expense is higher as a percentage of the debt in the earnings this year, because we're capitalizing less interest. A year ago,9 we were capitalizing more interest into projects such as Pearl and Canada. We typically only capitalize interest into very large projects and so I think that's the primary drive there.</p>
          <p>Ra&#xED;zen materiality it's, hopefully, several hundred million dollars per quarter. It is being driven or helped at the moment by good sugar and ethanol prices. So far, we have had a very successful operational start-up. Ventures are not always easy bringing together two cultures, but we found very good strategic alignment. Cosan is a good partner and we're seeing more synergies, more opportunities than we'd originally envisaged in the operation, which has been good so far.</p>
          <p>The Cosan, independently and separately have indeed made a bid to purchase the stake, 60%-plus stake that BG holds in Comg&#xE1;s, where we hold most of the remaining share of Comg&#xE1;s, a little bit of it is actually on the public markets in Brazil. Our &#x2013; I can't say what our reaction &#x2013; because it's a deal in process &#x2013; might be, but this is not necessarily a multi-party squeeze out of BG. This is a Cosan/BG deal; it's not a Shell deal.</p>
          <p>Longer-term, of course, the Cosan's interests are basically for them to determine and you to talk to them about, but if their interest are in the energy sector development in Brazil, the clean energy sector development, these are the statements they make, then Comg&#xE1;s is not only well placed being in S&#xE3;o Paulo State and close to a lot of their current activities there, it has potential longer-term percentages with Ra&#xED;zen but there are no current plans to merge or take the strategy together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Can I just very quickly ask about going back to the point on the potential for GTL in the U.S. Obviously, the life of such a project is 30-years plus. It is a free market; the project's economics too depend on the oil to gas price differential. Isn't it a little bit of risky to sort of bet that the current differential remains in place for that time period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair question but I would push back on, it doesn't actually depend on the differential, it depends on the difference between oil price and cost of gas, if we're producing our own gas. It only depends on the differential if you're buying the gas. What you give up if the Henry Hub gas price were to go to $10, $11 again, would be the opportunity cost of course. So what it does actually, it de-risks the portfolio from just being pure natural gas by converting some of the natural gas to oil. So it's really play on what do we see the long-term oil price, as long as we got low-cost gas in our own portfolio. So that's how we think about it. So the question we need strategically to consider, which is being considered.</p>
          <p>But if I had an answer, I'd probably be looking to share with you in a strategy discussion. What is the proportion of the total gas resource base on which we want to effectively develop liquids-related pricing exposure? And it's not necessarily 100%, but I don't know what the number is. But the priority we're giving at the moment, as I mentioned earlier, Canadian LNG and we're looking at GTL. That may not use a whole significant demand to the 40,000-plus [barrel] Tcf that we actually have but something that will &#x2013; on which the strategy will evolve, as we see &#x2013; get a better view of the costs, and the economics, and the relative attractiveness.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. The first is in the Q1 earnings. I might be reading too much into this but your opening line was emphasizing that these sort of snapshots is part of the long-term strategy. I just wondered whether perhaps you felt that the Q1 was perhaps a little bit ahead of where you expected it to be, perhaps trading or cost seasonality, perhaps you could comment on that?</p>
          <p>And just, secondly, when you're commenting on Alaska, it did sort of remind me that both Exxon and E&amp;I have recently advanced their offshore plans in Russia, given a change in the tax regime. Could you perhaps update us on your plans there, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Neill, I think. You may be reading something in there that was maybe not intended, but the snapshot is essentially the same as we used in Q4. We don't lose a lot of sleep if we have a particularly bad quarter, as long as the strategy is being delivered. We don't celebrate too wildly with a good quarter. We have to look through cycles. So, yes, Q1 looks like a particularly good quarter, but then if you put the last six months together that's perhaps more representative of where we see we are on the overall delivery journey.</p>
          <p>Alaska, or Arctic more generally, our focus clearly is in the U.S. on Alaska and Greenland, where we will do some further study work this year, looking to drill in the not-too-distant future, we hope. Russia, as a whole, big country, lot of acreage, some of the acreage being taken up. We're always open to discussion with Russian partners but it needs to be &#x2013; we need to be able to find an outcome that suits both their needs and our needs and that's not yet been possible for us. But we have good relationship with both Gazprom and Rosneft and maybe that will ultimately lead to further opportunity. But in the short and the medium-term, we have quite a lot of Arctic exposure, quite a lot of Arctic experience and that's where we'll be focusing our efforts.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, Simon. Just a quick question regarding gas pricing in China, given your unconventionals position there, I just wanted to see if you could give us a sense as to how much the Chinese are using that to promote gas-on-gas competition in the country? And whether that's beginning to affect LNG prices and the sorts of levels that you're beginning to &#x2013; or that you're achieving on new contracts that you're signing out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hootan, it's a good question, but you're probably slightly ahead of the game in terms of an answer I can give you. Just to be clear, the Chinese energy policy, at the moment, in the 12th Five Year Plan is clear. They expect to grow gas as a share of primary energy demand from 4% in 2010 to 10% or higher by 2020, so probable trebling or more of the total gas demand in country, as a result of needing to meet energy demand &#x2013; the demand that is growing, but also for a cleaner form of energy. So, it's got quite strong support already in the policy and that policy was predicated mainly on imports either pipeline or LNG.</p>
          <p>LNG, typically, is setting marker prices on the coast. Further inland, the prices tend to be a net back against those coastal prices. There has been a policy to raise prices from their current levels, which are certainly higher than North American at the moment anyway, towards the import parity over time, essentially what you say the gas-on-gas competition. But prices are set differently for different consumers as well. So everything you say &#x2013; you ask about is very valid, but all of the answers come not from Shell but from the government. And I'm sure that they will be taking into account, exactly what is the potential in shale gas? We don't know that yet. That's what we are trying to help establish together with PetroChina, at least in the acreage we're working together there. So we completed 11 wells last year, we hope to complete quite a few more this year, maybe around 25.</p>
          <p>So by the beginning of next year, we will have a much better feel for what's the real volume potential and what is the cost of producing that volume. And when we see that and possibly more broadly across the country, I'm sure the government will consider long-term policy that will encourage the development. Now what the outcome of that actually is in pricing terms, I just don't know just yet. Good &#x2013; great question but about, at least 12 months, if not 24 too early.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Hi, Simon. One question: with regard to selling 32% of your Prelude 100% stake to some Asian partners, what are your intentions there for the future?  Are you trying to accelerate the exploration efforts there in that area? And also with regard to further FLNG projects starting up there, like a concert or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. There are three partners have come in Inpex, KOGAS and CPC. Now two of them are clearly LNG customers for Shell and interested in LNG supply back to their home base. And so, for us, that's a typical way of de-risking an equity LNG project, where we started at 100% bringing in customers. The Inpex is slightly different. You'll note that in Q4 2011 we agreed to enter a body floating LNG project in Indonesia, which is an Inpex project.</p>
          <p>So we have joined a 30% share of that project and they have come in per share of our project. So, it's a part of a developing relationship with Inpex, who we do work with elsewhere in the world as well, for example, in Canada. So, that's good. We feel it's a good way for Shell to de-risk the project, monetize some of the potential value in the project but also to maintain the existing relationships and other opportunities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the book value of $500 million I think in the project, is that &#x2013; this part of construction, et cetera, what has been done on FLNG?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just have one question regarding the share class. So, can we have an update on the potential merger of the Class A and B, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sorry, the share class. Sorry, it was not easy to hear you, there's some background noise.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Potential merger of the A and B?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Class A and the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question was about potential merger of A and B shares. We discussed this a little back in February. It is something that we would like to do, clearly, it would simplify and remove some restrictions we have in terms of our financial and corporate framework. Current &#x2013; well, the previous issues we talked about with some withholding tax challenges and we would need some agreement there basically from the Dutch government.</p>
          <p>Now you're probably aware there is no Dutch government as of the weekend, unfortunately, there. The government was unable to reach an agreement on the budget, so we do not know when the next election will be but there is talk of maybe six-month period and then potentially months after that to form a new coalition.</p>
          <p>So from a Shell perspective, this means it's very difficult to expect or even to try for any discussion about the condition under which we could merge the shares. I'm afraid that's probably off the agenda relative to where we were in February. We would hope to be able to raise that when there is a new government in place in the Netherlands.</p>

Second quarter results will be released on the 26th of July. And Peter and I will talk to you all then and the intention is to make that a face-to-face meeting in London, so, quite literally, I look forward to seeing you all again in the near future. Thank you for today.</p>
