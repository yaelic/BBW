          <p>Good day everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings 2007 Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dye, please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thanks for joining us today. This morning Apache Corporation released fourth quarter and annual 2007 results, which on a reported basis totaled $3.19 and $8.39 respectively. But consistent with prior quarters, we have provided adjustments to those numbers, which reflect one-time items, which are non-GAAP that total $2.92 and $8.65 per share respectively. Our adjustments primarily relate to foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the Canadian Federal tax rate on the deferred tax balances that are on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. In addition, any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or adjusted costs incurred will be identified as such with a reconciliation again located on our website at www.apachecorp.com.</p>
          <p>Steve Farris, our CEO; and Roger Plank, our CFO will now make prepared remarks prior to taking questions.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our year-end 2007 earnings call. For Apache, 2007 was a year of high impact exploration success, on track development of major projects, and very strong and balanced production growth. Apache achieved record results in virtually every measurable financial and operating category. Production grew at 12% to a new record average level of 561,000 barrels oil equivalent a day in 2007, which marks the 28th year out of the last 29 that Apache has grown its production.</p>
          <p>We've grown through good and bad times in the balanced deep portfolio we have built during all those years, means that we now have a growth engine that is capable of continuing that strength into the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we replaced 167% of production in terms of SEC proved reserves; proved reserve additions from the drill bit alone replaced 140% of production, an outstanding reserve addition performance and it should support Apache's continued growth path and has led to record proved reserves at 2.450 billion barrels oil equivalent at year end. 2007 marked the 22nd year of consecutive reserve growth for Apache.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings of $2.9 billion increased 26% over 2006 and eclipsed the previous record set in 2005 by 11%. Our balance portfolio profile delivered outstanding results in 2007, and clearly showed the upside potential we have across commodities, place, and countries, in the current environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.65 increased 25% over 2006, and broke the previous record set in 2005. Our cash flow from operations is $6.2 billion, increased 22% over our previous record set in 2006.</p>
          <p>2007 was a year of high impact and broad-based exploration success, and most notably, in Australia, we discovered the Julimar complex in April of '07. We estimate a gross recoverable resource potential between 2 and 4 Tcf currently. Apache has a 65% working interest in this block. Then in the course of 2007, we completed four wells in the area which have given us increased confidence of this 2 to 4 Tcf gross recoverable estimate.</p>
          <p>The latest well, which is Julimar-1X was completed in January and had 113 feet of net pay, which we chose not to test because it was an excellent result. In Canada, our Ootla shale gas play in Northern British Columbia took an important step forward. We drilled and tested one horizontal well and tested two wells that we had previously drilled vertically.</p>
          <p>The preliminary test results encouraged us to acquire additional acreage during the year, which now stands at over 400,000 gross acres. In Egypt, we made several deep Jurassic oil and gas discoveries, which include the Jade, Alexandrite, Imhotep discoveries and the Matruh Concession, which is in northern part of our greater Khalda area and they all had tremendous flow rates. We also made discoveries in the northeast Abu Gharadig Concession operated by Shell and an interesting discovery in East Ras Budran that tested over 1,900 barrels a day. It's on an onshore concession area near the Gulf of Suez and we'll drill appraisal wells to all of these discoveries in 2008.</p>
          <p>Each of these highlighted discoveries and the other ones across our international portfolio added recoverable resources to Apache representing a multiple of what we are recognizing at this point in our proved reserves. And this underlines the resource depth of our portfolio. 2007 was also a very successful year for Apache in progressing six large development projects that will add over 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day of production over the 2009-2011 timeframe. These six projects include Australia's Van Gogh, Pyrenees, Reindeer and Julimar and Egypt's Salam gas plant expansion and water flood activities.</p>
          <p>On total, in 2007 we spent on E&amp;P activities $5.25 billion with $4.2 billion on exploration and development. If you relate this level of investment to our proved reserve additions for the year, you will derive a 2007 finding and development cost of $15.31 per boe for all sources and $14.76 per boe from exploration and development activities alone.</p>
          <p>On the acquisition side in 2007, we purchased 70 million barrels of oil equivalent, which is primarily oil reserves from Anadarko for a price of $1 billion. It's hard to believe that oil prices were $55 a barrel when we completed that transaction last February.</p>
          <p>The acquisition has been a success-book from a financial and operating perspective. Today, we're producing over 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent from these properties and have a significant drilling program planned in 2008.</p>
          <p>All in all, 2007 was an outstanding year and we achieved record financial and operating results, while executing a very successful worldwide exploration program that really enhanced our deep development and growth pipeline for the future.</p>
          <p>I would like now to address 2008, which is shaping up to be another year of numerous high impact growth catalysts for Apache. We had previously provided guidance for 2008 in the 6 to 10% production growth and we remain comfortable with that range. I want you to bear in mind that at the end of last year we took the opportunity to sell or have contracted to sell $360 million of marginal properties. So, at this point, we anticipate being at the lower end of that range.</p>
          <p>Currently, our overall 2008 capital budget is coming in at about 5% higher than last year, and will be directed at continued delivery of our portfolio of opportunities. As many of you are aware, Apache allocates capital quarterly to our regions so that our going-in budget is preliminary at best.</p>
          <p>The most obvious catalyst in 2008 is our exploration program, which is our most ambitious program ever and potentially exposes the company to over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of recoverable hydrocarbon resources.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we've planned an active drilling program in the Carnarvon Basin. We will drill five additional wells at Julimar, which will go a long way in defining the ultimate resource potential of the block. Also in the Carnarvon, we will drill two key appraisal wells at Halyard and Maitland and both of these areas have multi-hundred BCF potentials.</p>
          <p>In the aggregate, the recoverable resource potential of the 2008 Carnarvon Basin exploration program is in excess of 900 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our working interest across the Carnarvon Basin program that I just outlined is between 50 and 100%.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in Australia in 2008, we will drill seven wells in the Gippsland Basin on the acreage that is adjacent to several giant producing fields. This exploration program has more upside potential than any other exploration program in the company.</p>
          <p>The first three wells will be drilled with a jack-up beginning this month followed by four wells later in the year to be drilled with a semi-submersible. Recoverable resource potential in this program is over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>In Canada, we have nine well program planned in our Ootla shale, in British Columbia this winter with our 50% partner in Canada. Our goal is to determine whether this play is commercial and we will be experimenting with different multi-stage fracturing programs to enhance the flow rate. If the play is commercial, it would expose the company to 3 to 6 TCF of reserve additions net to Apache's interest.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, we plan to drill 40 exploration wells in 2008, many targeting the deep Jurassic, which has yielded several large discoveries to Apache in the past. We have started this year out with a major exploration success at Hydra-1X discovery in Egypt, which was announced two weeks ago and tested 42 million a day and 1,300 barrels of condensate from the lower Jurassic.</p>
          <p>The 2008 exploration program in Egypt of 40 wells includes a diverse range of plays and prospects, which highlights richness and depth and extent of our portfolio in the country. We'll be drilling 18 shallow, Upper Bahariya, Abu Roash prospects, six Cretaceous wildcats, and 12 deep Jurassic wildcats.</p>
          <p>We'll also drill four wildcats in our Tharwa acreage, which we acquired last year. The recoverable resource potential of the Egyptian exploration program is in excess of 130 million barrels of oil equivalent. All in all, 2008 exploration program exposes the company to over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resource potential net to Apache's working interest.</p>
          <p>On the development side in 2008, we will continue progressing the six major projects that alone will add over 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent to our production in 2009-2011 timeframe. Continued delivery of these major industry projects on time and within budget, as we approach our on-stream date, will be an important catalyst for Apache in 2008.</p>
          <p>At Van Gogh, the development in Australia, all development wells will be down by midyear, and the facilities construction is on schedule to achieve first production by the middle of 2009 at a net rate to Apache of 20,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
          <p>At the Pyrenees development, which is operated by BHP, facilities construction will begin this year with development drilling scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2009. This project will come on line in late 2009 or early 2010, again at a net rate to Apache of 20,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
          <p>At Reindeer, which is a gas discovery, we will drill two development wells and begin pipeline and onshore natural gas processing plant construction. The field is slated to begin producing in the middle of 2010 at a net rate of 60 million a day to Apache.</p>
          <p>At Julimar, we will complete the appraisal program this summer and look to sanctioning the project in the second half of the year. Field will come on line in 2011, and we estimate that the net flow rate to Apache is about 200 million a day.</p>
          <p>In Egypt we expect to finish the construction on the Salam gas plant expansion by year end, which will add 90 to 100 million a day net and 4,500 barrels of condensate net to Apache at the end of the year. We're also continuing our expansion of several Egyptian waterflood projects with continued drilling and increased water injection capacity to build toward net production of 20,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
          <p>Aside from these major explorations and development projects, we have an active program planned in the U.S., Canada and the North Sea, and I might just run through them real quickly. In the Central Region, we continue an active drilling program with 307 total wells planned. We'll focus on our primary Anadarko Basin drilling plays at the Red Fork, Springer and Atoka, as well as further exploiting the properties acquired in 2007 in the Permian Basin.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf region, we will continue to develop the Grand Isle 40 complex and focus on other opportunities really around our production base. We'll run a similar program to the past couple of years with 60 to 65 wells planned and 8 to 10 operated rigs running.</p>
          <p>In Canada, recent changes in the royalty rates in Alberta have caused us to redirect our 2008 capital spending. Our drilling activity plans have been refocused by what we consider to be short-sighted decision by the Alberta government with their announcement of significant royalty increases starting in 2009. We have cut our 2008 capital program in Alberta by 40%, predominantly associated with deeper gas drilling. Ironically, those are the plays that can provide Alberta with larger discoveries providing production growth with a smaller footprint. We would hope that the government will reconsider their decision, but in the meantime, we haven't increased our activity in British Columbia and Saskatchewan.</p>
          <p>The reduction in Apache's Alberta activities will be made up in large part by increasing our activity in the Ootla shale play. As we're constantly reminded, the richness in growth opportunities of our balanced portfolio is demonstrated in this case. In the North Sea, our program will be dissimilar to 2007, which includes drilling 16 wells at 40s. We will also continue refurbishing the top sides with plans to finish installing gas lift compression capacity and additional water injection capacity.</p>
          <p>Consistent with previous calls, we want to inform you that we have a scheduled maintenance turnaround at our Alpha platform in April that will reduce our production by 4,000 barrels a day in the second quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about the fundamentals of international gas, which may also provide catalyst to Apache in 2008. In 2007, we saw a strong price convergent of low domestic gas prices to levels required to meet supply growth requirements and compete with other international markets. Apache generates top tier returns in countries like Australia, Egypt and Argentina at low prices we have seen historically. Today, international supplies certainly are not available at 1 to $2 gas. As gas prices move up to the $7 level, our real upside will be apparent.</p>
          <p>We also hope you noticed our fourth quarter 2007 realized natural gas price in Argentina increased to a $1.60, which is over $0.50 higher than any quarter we reported since entering the country. This number is 45% realization upside versus our previous record in the country and is based on fundamentals of supply and demand and not speculative activity on the NYMEX.</p>
          <p>Australia, in particular, provides a good example of how international gas fundamentals will provide an important catalyst for Apache in 2008. Now, many of you are aware that natural gas prices in the Carnarvon Basin increased from under $2 to over $7 in the past year due to increased gas demand from the mining industry and large takeaway capacity from LNG, which is priced in the spot market against highest price offer internationally, be at Henry Hub or other.</p>
          <p>We tendered 80 million cubic feet of gas a day of our Reindeer production to the mining industry, but first delivery beginning in 2010, and received over 20 expressions of interest. We are currently negotiating with one buyer for most of that gas and the contract will represent a good barometer as to how much the Western Australian gas market has strengthened. We hope to announce something soon as early as this quarter.</p>
          <p>In the second half of 2008, we will explore markets for Julimar gas by again tendering volumes to the Western Australian markets as well as investigating the viability of LNG. The marketing results of Reindeer and Julimar could both provide meaning catalysts to our shares.</p>
          <p>I would like to close with a few comments and then I turn it over to Roger Plank, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>We had record financial and operating results in 2007, but more importantly, have built tremendous growth momentum that extends our visibility well into the next decade. Our development pipeline is absolutely world-class with six development projects coming online in 2009 through 2011 that will add over 100,000 barrels a day of production. We intend to add to that development pipeline in 2008 with the strongest inventory of exploration opportunities we've ever had. With major programs in the Carnarvon and Gippsland basins of Australia, the Western Desert of Egypt and our shale play in Northern BC 2008, we will expose the company to greater resource addition potential than in any previous year in our history.</p>
          <p>So we look forward to continued success in 2008. Roger?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. We've talked over the years about Apache's portfolio approach to the business and our balanced commodity mix and geographic diversity have enabled portfolio effect in the form of yet another year of consistent profitable results. We spent decades building a company capable of delivering such a performance and, frankly, while our approach may not always be in favor, it's certainly difficult to argue with the result. Just about anyway you slice it, 2007 was a standout with unparalleled results in our 53 years.</p>
          <p>Records were reached in all key categories of revenues, cash from operations, earnings, reserves and production. The benefits of unprecedented oil prices in our second highest gas realizations were multiplied by a 12% rise in production to 561,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driving Apache's Oil and Gas revenue up 23% to a notable $10 billion. It's also notable that 3 billion of the 10 was generated in the final quarter, which we hope might provide sort of a sneak preview of things to come in 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash from operations crossed $6 billion for the first time and at 6.2 billion was up 22%, almost as if we added a fifth quarter to the years' results. Cash flow per share totaled $18.52, that's more than triple of what it was just five years ago. Over one quarter of our $10 billion in revenue made it to the bottom-line at $2.8 billion. Apache's record 2007 earnings were up over a quarter of $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of $8.39 increased 10% from $7.64 per share the prior year. Adjusting for the impact that foreign currency fluctuations and a reduction in Canadian taxes had on deferred tax balances, Apache earned $8.65 a share, up 25% from 2006 adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>Apache continues to deliver competitive results with return on capital employed and return on equity reaching 16% and 20% respectively. Our record financial results are an outcrop of exceptional operating performance as Steve has outlined.</p>
          <p>In addition to driving production higher for the 28 over the last 29 years, reserves grew for the 22nd consecutive year, up 6% to 2.4 billion barrels equivalent, that's 7.2 barrels equivalent behind each share.</p>
          <p>Of our 2.4 billion barrels equivalent, 343 million barrels equivalent were added in the last year alone, at a cost of $15.31 per boe, replacing 167% of the year's production.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, 84% of our additions before revisions resulted from exploration and development. The 286 million barrels added through the drill-bit, at $14.76 per boe, replaced 140% of Apache's production, which speaks volumes as to the effectiveness of Apache's drilling program.</p>
          <p>In a day and age where competition for both opportunities and services is intense, it would be easy for a company to hit the wall by running short on drilling opportunities and long on costs. Hopefully, our results demonstrate, this is hardly the case here at Apache.</p>
          <p>Nowhere were Apache's results more noteworthy than in the fourth quarter of '07, exceeding both our own expectations, and those of the Street's. Fourth quarter revenues crossed the $3 billion mark for the first time, that's up $1 billion from fourth quarter '06, and a half a billion from the third quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>Record oil prices of $83 a barrel, enabled oil to contribute some two-thirds of our revenue, despite representing less than half of our production. Compared to fourth quarter '06, cash from operations increased $636 million to $1.9 billion, while cash flow per share of $5.71 rose 48% sequentially from a year earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, cash flow increased by $300 million or $0.88 a share. And earnings for the quarter crossed $1 billion for the first time, up more than 100% from fourth quarter a year ago and 75% higher than the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>To be fair, fourth quarter '07 included $89 million of positive adjustments or uppers items that went our way for a change and they're not likely to be repeated. The reduction in Canadian federal tax rates reduced deferred taxes as a result of adjusting our deferred tax balances. This added $135 million to the quarter's earnings and more than offset a $46 million increase in deferred taxes internationally, reflecting continued weakness in the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Combining these two items; benefited the quarter by $89 million or $0.27 a share. So, on an adjusted basis, fourth quarter '07 earnings of $982 million were up 107% from adjusted fourth quarter '06 earnings.</p>
          <p>On a per share basis, fourth quarter adjusted earnings totaled a record $2.92 per share twice the $1.40 of a year ago and handily beating a consensus estimates of $2.52 by 16%.</p>
          <p>Cost remained an issue for both Apache and the industry as a whole, as I'll go into shortly. However, I'd note that despite rising cost, Apache's fourth quarter cash margins topped $40 a barrel for the first time. To put this in perspective, it was only two years ago that our entire realized price for the year broke $40 a barrel for the first time.</p>
          <p>Zeroing in on cost and margin, lest we confuse you with numerous comparisons, I'm just going to compare fourth quarter to third quarter to focus on the most recent sequential changes.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, cash margins reached record levels rising 19% over third quarter of '07 to $41.51 per boe, while cost rose, higher prices more than offset the increase, even if you include DD&amp;A our total pre-tax margins rose to $29.24 of boe, up from $22.73 sequentially.</p>
          <p>Lifting cost per boe rose to a reported $8.90 per boe from $8.21 last quarter. Obviously, high prices are a double-edged sword when it comes to cost. To fully grasp where costs are going, you should be aware of a number of items outside of our base running rate, such as foreign exchange impact, some lingering hurricane repair, and incentive-based compensation expense. If you normalize for these items, lifting cost rose 3% to $8.30 per boe from $8.05 per boe on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>Workover expense, which continues to provide positive production impacts accounted for $0.09 of the increase, but generally higher costs accounting for the balance. For 2008, we would estimate a range of 8.25 to say 8.75 per boe for a sort of our base running rate depending on what your expectations for prices are.</p>
          <p>Full cost DD&amp;A increased 2% sequentially to $11.13 per boe, although drilling costs have moderated somewhat in certain areas, they continue above historic levels. G&amp;A cost increased to $1.42 per boe from $1.19 driven by increased stock-based compensation expense on a higher stock price, removing this variable again just look at sort of a base running rate drops G&amp;A per boe to $1.12, up from an adjusted $1.01 in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>For 2008, adjusted G&amp;A per boe should fall in the range of say $1.05 to $1.15 per boe. Severance and other taxes of $3.57 per boe increased to $1.15 quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by 16% higher North Sea volumes combined with 18% higher oil price realizations, which resulted in more PRT.</p>
          <p>Finance expense decreased $0.15 to $1.02 per boe on significantly lower debt balances. And turning to income taxes, our fourth quarter effective tax rate dropped 31% from 48% in the third quarter due primarily to two issues. First, the third quarter rate was higher because of the Australian and Canadian currency strengthened during that particular quarter adding to our deferred tax. And the second issue has to do with a fourth quarter catch-up adjustment for the Canadian tax reduction mentioned earlier. For the year, our effective tax rate was 39.8% and the portion of taxes that was deferred averaged 48%.</p>
          <p>Looking back on my prior notes, I realized my predictive skills in this area fall far short, but absent the unforeseen, our effective tax rate should approximate 40% of which 40 to 45% should be deferred.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I'd like to amplify on Steve's comments about why we have high hopes for 2008 and beyond. In a nutshell, I believe Apache is in the best shape with the best outlook that we've ever had. 2008 production growth is virtually assured. Our backlog of large scale development prospects has never been greater providing visible sources of growth into the next decade. Our worldwide acreage position of over 1 million acres &#x2013; of over 40 million acres is second to none in the upstream sector and a very important key to our continued growth. We have another active year plan for 2008 as Steve indicated, it took &#x2013; it's again a portfolio effect number of lower risks, singles and doubles, combined with our highest potential exploration program to-date. And as again as Steve indicated, we are off to a fast start with meaningful discoveries in both Egypt and Australia.</p>
          <p>From a financial standpoint, we've also never been stronger. Solid production should underpin cash flow that more than covers our preliminary E&amp;D budget of somewhere around $4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And finally, Apache's strong balance sheet with 22% debt as a percentage of capitalization is a real asset during a highly uncertain period for the economy. In the tightening credit markets that are fall out of the subprime debacle, Apache's A rated balance sheet gives us a tremendous competitive advantage in accessing capital at reasonable cost with which to continue to carry out our business strategy.</p>
          <p>So with that, we would be happy to address any questions, you might have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just with respect to Argentina in the gas market, do you anticipate the recent price strength to continue and is the market now at a point where you may be able to increase your gas directed capital spending in the country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with respect to the gas price, frankly we do expect it to continue. If you look at some of the later contracts that we have signed over the last quarter, quarter-and-a-half, one was with a major fertilizer that we contracted for three years at $3.00, 3.50 going to 3.90 over a three year period. I don't think the current supply is certainly keeping up with demand. So one of the reasons we got in Argentina at the time that we did, we really anticipated that the current shortage in supply would have a real impact on prices.</p>
          <p>So with respect to our capital budget, what we have done is basically limited our capital budget in Argentina to our cash flow. And although we are very high on Argentina, I think that's the prudent thing to do in the current environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then jumping over to Canada, I would like to talk specifically about the tapering of your activity and how damaging the royalty changes have been, and then on the other side of the coin the increasing of activity in the Ootla shale play. Does Ootla qualify as shallow gas or is that not impacted by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you &#x2013; the current structure of the Alberta royalty is both a rate and price curve. And so at lower rates, you actually pay a lower rate than you would under the old regime and as you go higher, you pay a disproportionate higher price. Which is why we curtailed our deeper drilling activities, because they generally come on at higher rates. If you get a 5 million a day well, for instance, the royalty today in Canada under the new regime is 50%, which seems exorbitant to us. Which is why we &#x2013; in the lower rates for Alberta, start out at 5% and cross that path at about 220 Mcf a day.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Ootla shale, I mentioned that we're going to drill nine wells up there with our partner, EnCana. We currently are into our winter drilling program. We're drilling three wells right now as we speak, and we'll put multiple stage fracs on those wells. EnCana should start their drilling momentarily. Actually, they took one of our rigs and started their drilling program. So the winter is going to be real important to the Ootla play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Following on that thought, on the Ootla play rather, could you speak to perhaps the anticipated economics of the play or what you're seeing in your first horizontal that has you encouraged? Anything that you can add there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; the horizontal well that we drilled this last year, we put three fracs on it, and it tested, it came on at 3 million a day and it's been on 10 months and still making over a million a day. Very good results with very good pressures. The ones that we're drilling today will put at least six individual fracs on and expect a higher initial rate than what we got out of the first horizontal well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you hope to get the cost to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's finish drilling our experiment. We have to drill those wells for about $5 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a couple questions. Could you remind us what it is you have targeted for sale in the U.S.? And the second question I had was for Steve or Roger. In looking at the development program that you've got to bring on the 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the 2009-11 timeframe, has your idea or your thoughts on what the capital spending will be required with that, has that changed at all in the current environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first part of the question was -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah. We have actually closed, some at the end of the year and then following along at the end of the year, we've already closed about $250 million worth of sales and have a few pending for another about $120 million. Basically, it's either non-operated or marginal production that we've sold. We sold a little bit of production in the Permian Basin, we sold a non-focused area for us in North Louisiana. We sold a non-operated field in the Gulf of Mexico, and we also sold some non-focused area production, non-operated production in Canada. It's really the tail end of our properties. We just thought it was a good time with prices where they were to turn that into cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, future development costs, has that &#x2013; have your projections for that changed at all in the current cost environment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it really hasn't. In fact, we put &#x2013; the numbers that we have down now, we feel very comfortable with.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of the reason is we've contracted for some of those costs, so it kind of locks -</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly on the Pyrenees and the Van Gogh development we have and a great extent on Reindeer. Obviously Julimar right now is a estimate. But we also made the estimate higher than what we hopefully anticipate it actually being.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions. First, you obviously mentioned the tightening LNG market. In terms of the majors, have you seen them approach you around the world, obviously, it's a bit clearer in Egypt and Australia for incremental gas supplies for any of the LNG expansions? And if so, are there particular expansions you can highlight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both in Australia and Egypt we have had discussions with LNG players in that part of the world. And those are ongoing discussions. So &#x2013; and it really is a very good barometer to what you're going to see, I think, happening in domestic gas markets around the world. Because they're competition &#x2013; once you put an LNG facility out there, the competition is, you know, it's going offshore or it's going in country. And we are seeing that &#x2013; certainly seeing that pressure in Australia and we're also beginning to see that pressure in Egypt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Does that make you want to look at areas like other areas of Asia such as Malaysia and Indonesia where there's already LNG schemes in terms of developing incremental gas or accessing licenses? Or is that not on the radar screen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not on the radar &#x2013; our goal is to develop core areas that have long-term potential. And I'm not suggesting that those two don't, but in the areas that we're in, if you look at our acreage position or you look at our infrastructure position, all of them are sizable, and all of them have the potential to continue to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly, obviously you've been fairly active in Australia, also signing rigs. Are you seeing any sort of weakness in the jack-up market as these new rigs are added in the Asian region? Or have you changed your rig signing strategy to just hold off a little bit while they come through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're definitely &#x2013; internationally you're definitely seeing a small reduction in prices. Nothing compared to what you're seeing in the North America today, but they're definitely starting &#x2013; they've hit &#x2013; at least currently, they've hit their peak and we're starting to see lower prices. Especially on the jack-up side, and especially in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question with Gil Yang with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Steve could you comment on what you expect to happen to Canadian production with the 40% drop in capital spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I tried to make sure that I said that correctly. Our overall capital spending in Canada is going to be about flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have done is redirected our capital spending to other areas. And to speak a little bit to our shale play, we have gas plant capacity up there right now, protected play capacity of about 25 million a day, which we could increase with some compression. So, while those wells are in a remote area because of some other drilling we'd done many years ago, we have some capacity take away there. So, our budget is basically flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A production budget... oh, your capital budget? But would there be any impact to production because you're maybe spending more money on exploratory longer-term projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what you saw in 2007 is probably what you'll see in 2008, and that is a little drip down but not dramatic, if you understand what I'm saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And second question is, you spent $320 million or so in Argentina, and you booked 19 million barrels with pretty high F&amp;D cost. Can you comment on what was going on there? What kind of projects you were investing in maybe that were longer-term that we didn't see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you've got to be careful, because you got an awful lot of seismic in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would say the same thing of Canada. We spent almost $100 million in acreage in Canada last year. So, when you look at the total E&amp;D spend, either in Argentina or Canada, we had a significant seismic program. We're shooting 680 square kilometers of 3-D seismic right now in Tierra del Fuego. And I think we announced our first well made 1,600 barrels a day off of that that 3D seismic. So, it's paying dividends but you get a one-time hit early on and then you get the benefit of it over several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and so, if you excluded that upfront investment &#x2013; can you quantify what the F&amp;D would look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't, in front of me.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's about 15 bucks if you, again, remove the ARO and the capitalized interest, Gil, from that calculation, which I don't think you do. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but if you take that seismic...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what the seismic is I don't know. I can get that for you off-line.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>'08. What's your target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing I would tell you is that when we talk about budgets, as I pointed out, we allocate capital quarterly. So, I think Roger has our regional budgets, but that is very much subject to change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much. Well, I mean we look at it every month, really, and it'll depend on what happens to prices, cash flow, economy, all sorts of things. So, this is a very tentative budget, but in Argentina we're looking at somewhere around $250 million for the year 2008. The biggest increase is going to be in Australia. It's going to be... we're looking at something like 900 million versus 400 million for exploration and development. In Chile, we've got a seismic program, so we're slating something like $15 million there. Egypt is also likely to see a meaningful increase in its E&amp;D budget to about $0.75 billion, which is up maybe 135 from the prior year. North Sea is about flat at five and a quarter. Central is about flat at 650, that's our onshore region basically split between the Mid-Continent and the Permian. The Gulf is perhaps flat, that may be down $100 million to $900 million. And Canada, as Steve indicated, is about flat at about six and a quarter or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that should add up to about 4.5 billion or so that we referenced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then in the Gulf you did sign up an abandonment plan for the next several years. Was that an internal Apache goal to kind of clean everything up, or was that MMS mandated, or how did you push that forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really both. I mean, I expect we're taking an opportunity &#x2013; a big chunk of that is part of that Grand Isle 40 complex that BP retained. When we bought the Grand Isle 40 complex, BP retained their obligation for the 37.5% we bought and we own 37.5% of. So, if you're speaking to the contract that was out there, the biggest chunk of that is scheduled toward &#x2013; to that Grand Isle 40 complex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think there'll be an uptick kind of industrywide? Are you getting ahead of that before costs start increasing or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've really tried to get ahead of it in 2007 as well as working on it in 2008. I doubt if you see a large increase in 2008 over activity 2007.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just trying to... the Alpha platform going offline in the second quarter in the North Sea. How long do you have that in your budget for it to be offline? And how much production would you expect to be offline?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we project it's going to be about 4,000 barrels a day for the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. What are the plans in terms of your excess cash flow, any specific targets for those dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Raymond Plank always likes to point out is, if we really ever end up with excess cash flow it would surprise us. We generally find things to do with it. The other thing I would say about that is that we've got in front of us, and I think Ellen pointed out, that future development capital that we have in some of our major projects, those numbers add up to be over $2 billion net to Apache. So, we have uses, may not be short-term uses but we have long-term uses for our cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of opportunities to make acquisitions, are you looking at significant acquisitions at this point or do you plan to look at significant acquisitions in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think hopefully you've got the feel that we've evolved in such a position with the asset base that we've built, we intend to grow organically. Does that not mean we would make an acquisition? Certainly, we're an acquisitive company, we look at things that fit us that are in areas that we want to be. The acquisition market is pretty frothy right now, and so we &#x2013; certainly not looking at anything in a major acquisition way. We always look for things that tag on to what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, that's helpful. And then, I heard you talk about the rig rates softening a little bit internationally. Could you talk about other drilling complete costs, do you see them still softening and can you give specifics on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, probably everybody is aware of Schlumberger's comments, and I'm not commenting just on Schlumberger, but there is absolutely no doubt that with all the new equipment and what's happened in Alberta, North American costs, service costs are coming down and we see that in rig rates and we also see that in primary services. Internationally, there is still a very active programs going on in the world. We have seen semis come down somewhat, but certainly not to levels that percentage drops that you've seen for jackups and Gulf of Mexico or land rigs in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then Roger, just real quick, I missed some of your comments on the LOE, could you again just give us the specifics why the LOE was up in the fourth quarter, and why it's not going to be up to that degree on a unit basis in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one reason was we had workover activity that was $0.09 of the increase. And then we &#x2013; I mean, I don't know whether it will be up or not, but the things that we need to adjust for are the foreign exchange impact, that was $0.18 till the increase. Lingering hurricane repairs, which hopefully will die down here, was $0.12 and then incentive based or stock based compensation expense was $0.30, which happens when our stock goes up. And I think we closed the quarter at $107 change, so that was a big number at that point. But depending on what happens in those particular areas, that will drive the direction of the rates to some extent in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would expect the stock to be huge this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll model that. And then just lastly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just lastly in terms of your budget for cost, are you budgeting lower costs or you're being conservative in budgeting kind of flat or slightly up cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we budget for spots on the map. And all of the capital that we have allocated right now is for projects that could either have an AFP on them or a real estimative cost. So, the thing I think you're going to see is we're going to be able to drill more wells with the same amount of money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Okay, very helpful, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll take our next question with Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon here guys. A couple of quick questions here for you. On the Australian gas prices, obviously you guys are having uplift here in the fourth quarter. Curious if you could maybe quantify for us when some of your existing contracts roll off, I don't know if there is a way to break this up into kind of percentages in the next couple of years, because clearly there could be upside from re-contracting that gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have about three quarters of our gas that will roll off in the 2010 to 2015 period. And so we'll have to see what kind of price we can get when that happens. Frankly, we might just contract with the same user that we have now, but just have a change in price as the market directs. But we will have one contract that you may be familiar with, with Burrup that would extend beyond that period. So, of roughly the 200 million that we have contracted today, about three quarters of it will roll off in beginning in '10 through '15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also in Australia you guys reported a very robust oil price in the fourth quarter. I was curious, is there anything sort of going on there that was unique to why the price is so high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen the price of Tapis become very robust, because it's in the Asian markets and it's kind of a premium crude. So, we've been benefiting from that. As I recall, we saw that last quarter as well. So, it's just selling at a premium to WTI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Switching over to Argentina, real quick here. It looks like your gas production has kind of been down for the past couple of quarters. Is that not at all really going to be an area of focus, you spending more time drilling for oil down there in your program? Just trying to get a sense of what we should expect in the next couple of quarters there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the biggest impact is not the capability of the wells. The biggest impact is pipeline takeaway capacity up north, and also the limit of selling gas across to Chile. And so, what we are having to do is re-inject that gas and script the liquids. That's not a performance issue, that's more of a market issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might just say one thing about that. We did, as Steve indicated, we saw our price improve to $1.60 I guess for the quarter, which was a very nice increase. The way the market works over there, we got to deliver a certain volume of gas, roughly 145 million cubic feet a day at a fixed price. So when we bring on incremental gas then we can go after the kind of markets that Steve was talking about, $3 contract type price. So as far as can you make economics at these prices, really it will be a blend of the old price and the new but to the extent we bring on incremental production we'll get a free market price that has been 2.5 to $3.5 an Mcf. So, I think our guys are still planning to drill a number of gas wells because of that aspect of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the primary drilling for gas right now at least will be in the Neuquen and the primary drilling for oil will be in TDF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

          <p>Thanks for tuning in. Roger and I are going to head up fairly soon to the First Boston Conference in Colorado. So you should probably direct your questions this afternoon to Dave Higgins, and his number is 713-296-6690. Again, thanks for joining us.</p>
