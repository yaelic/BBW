        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Julianne. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO; and David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and CFO.</p>
          <p>David will provide a few comments about the results that we released this morning. He will highlight some of EMC's activities this quarter and discuss some modeling assumptions for the rest of 2009. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening in the market, EMC's execution of the strategy, and how EMC is positioned. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the line to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today in our press release, supplemental schedules, and slides that accompany our presentation. All of these are available for download within the Investor Relations section of emc.com.</p>
          <p>As always, we have provided detailed financial tables in our news release and on our corporate website. And with regard to details of VMware's results, we refer you to their financial release from last night.</p>
          <p>The call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And lastly, I will note that an archive of today's presentation will be available following the call.</p>
          <p>With that, it's now my pleasure to introduce David Goulden. David?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to announce that EMC achieved solid Q3 results, with revenues of $3.5 billion, up 8% from Q2; non-GAAP EPS of $0.23, up 28% from Q2; and free cash flow of $745 million, up 86% from Q2.</p>
          <p>It's encouraging to see our focused efforts resulted in good sequential revenue growth, improving profitability, and strong free cash flow in what continues to be a challenging economic and IT spending environments.</p>
          <p>Within these results, our EMC Information Infrastructure business achieved $3 billion in revenues and about $0.20 of non-GAAP EPS. VMware also had a solid third quarter, contributing $489 million of revenue and almost $0.04 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC.</p>
          <p>Results that I would like to particularly highlight include solid overall performance on both a consolidated basis and for EMC Information Infrastructure, evidence of the strength of our model and good execution; improving growth in North America, especially in storage, an encouraging sign; profitability has improved sequentially, a sign of very good cost control efforts by EMC and VMware employees; excellent free cash flow generation, demonstrating the strength of our financial model; and what looks to be an increasing stability in IT spending, this is important for obvious reasons. Overall, there is a lot to be positive about in this quarter.</p>
          <p>This morning, I am going to make some comments about the Q3 spending environment, our business outlook for the rest of the year, and some more specific details from our Q3 results.</p>
          <p>As you may recall, during our Q2 report, we noted that IT spending was becoming more stable and predictable heading into the second half of 2009. While we did not expect a big pickup in the economy or IT spending plans, we believe that customers were become increasingly confident about spending their budgets.</p>
          <p>What we experienced in Q3 was in line with our expectation in this regard. There has not been a noticeable improvement in IT spending plans for 2009, but we did see customers continue to move forward and spend more of their budgets. There was steady customer activity, with a more normal ramp during the quarter, similar to what we saw in Q2. This is good to see.</p>
          <p>Based on what we've seen through three quarters this year, things are playing out pretty much as we expected, so our view of the environment remains unchanged. While second half IT spending is showing more of a normal seasonal progression in Q3 and Q4, it's coming off a very weak first half. As a result, when all is said and done, we still expect overall IT spending to be down very high single to very low double digits for the full year 2009.</p>
          <p>More specific to EMC, this second half improvement is a positive sign, as customers are getting more comfortable with spending their budgets. Our Q3 results are evidence we have the right business model and the right portfolio to do well in these challenging times and give us increased confidence in the remainder of 2009.</p>
          <p>As a result, we now expect to achieve Q4 consolidated revenue of approximately $4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.30, which will result in 2009 consolidated revenues of approximately 13.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 for the year. Note that these non-GAAP EPS expectations reflect $0.01 of additional dilution due to a slightly higher Q4 share count of about 2.12 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the quarter. EMC Information Infrastructure revenues were $3 billion, up 8% sequentially. Within this number, Information Infrastructure product revenues were $1.96 billion and Information Infrastructure service revenues were $1.07 billion.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.20, up 40% quarter-on-quarter. Free cash flow was $576 million. Looking at the geographic results for the Information Infrastructure business, our U.S. revenues represented about 55% of the total and were up a strong 14% sequentially. EMEA and Latin America were up three and 15%, respectively, from Q2, while APJ was down 4%.</p>
          <p>The BRIC plus 13 countries were up 8% quarter-to-quarter and 4% year-over-year. A very positive data point is that these markets were up 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. While it's too early to call a trend, it is encouraging to see.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we did see somewhat better than expected results from our public sector vertical, especially in North America, as the U.S. government closed out its fiscal year-end. In addition, we saw some upside in the U.S. financial services vertical, as their budgets stabilized and they started to make some investments.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results from the businesses within Information Infrastructure, Q3 Information Storage revenues were 2.7 billion, up 9% sequentially. In the high-end, Symmetrix revenues were up 10% sequentially. While there is still some pressure on demand for big-ticket IT items, the V-Max ramp is ahead of target and proceeding extremely well.</p>
          <p>The V-Max is popular because it is a highly differentiated Information Storage platform with exceptional quality and features. It's also aligned with customer priorities, such as consolidation, virtualization, and improved efficiency. The V-Max is clearly strengthening and extending our leadership in the high-end of the storage market.</p>
          <p>In the mid-tier, EMC CLARiiON revenues were up 1% sequentially, a fairly normal seasonal change. Within this, Dell CLARiiON revenues were down 15% quarter-to-quarter, but direct channels more than offset this and were up a solid 6%.</p>
          <p>I think it's probably worthwhile to spend a few moments and clarify the nature of our Dell CLARiiON revenues. Dell CLARiiON was 25% of total EMC CLARiiON revenues this quarter, and there are two types of revenues within it. One type is the OEM revenues for Dell/EMC co-branded CLARiiONs that makes up about 15% of total CLARiiON. This business is at the core of our partnership with Dell.</p>
          <p>The second type is a more opportunistic reseller-type business for EMC-branded CLARiiONs, where EMC is also generally involved in the transaction. These revenues make up about 10% of total CLARiiON. We and Dell are strongly committed to the core OEM focused partnership, but have chosen to deemphasize this reseller-type business. As a result, the resell revenues were down 24% sequentially and will probably continue to decline over time.</p>
          <p>While these changes will have an effect on our channel mix within CLARiiON over the next few quarters, we expect the strong progress in our channels business will continue to drive CLARiiON on its successful trajectory. The CLARiiON remains a key element of our broad and compelling mid-tier offering, and we are confident that EMC will continue to extend its lead in the mid-tier space.</p>
          <p>EMC's Celerra NAS business continues to do very well, and we achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-to-year revenue growth in Q3, as growth returned to over 40%. In this space, EMC's unified storage continues to gain a lot of customer traction with a best-of-breed combination of SAN and NAS. We have a differentiated offering that addresses the needs of both commercial and large customers. This is enabling us to continue to grow at significant rates despite the competition and gain share in a tough spending environment.</p>
          <p>One of the fastest growing opportunities in our storage business is flash technology. We continue to see a high level of demand for this capability across our platforms. We expect to see even more utilization of flash in our systems when our fully automated storage tiering, also known as FAST, comes out across all of our major platforms later this year.</p>
          <p>Data Domain is now an integral part of a newly formed division within EMC. While Joe will comment more on this business, I would point out for the full quarter, the Data Domain business was up about 40% year-on-year. This is a great result in a transition quarter and is ahead of our acquisition plan. Data Domain growth has been strong throughout 2009, and year-to-date growth is over 40%.</p>
          <p>Another positive data point is the fact that the Avamar business continued to experience significant double-digit growth in Q3 and is also up over 50% on a year-to-date basis. Together, this continued growth demonstrates excellent focus and execution by the teams, highlights the strategic value of this acquisition, and is indicative of the strength and leadership we have in this market.</p>
          <p>Additional storage highlights include the progress that our Mozy online PC backup business has made, including a strategic announcement in September with China Telecom to offer cloud-based services, and a more recent agreement with Vodafone.</p>
          <p>In addition, Iomega, our consumer and small business focused operation is seeing increased customer demand for backroom protection and had a better-than-expected quarter, up strong double digits year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Information Storage is a great business, and we are committed to making the investments necessary to extend EMC's lead. As customers are beginning their journey towards private clouds, we are focused on helping them make the transition at their own pace. With our product portfolio, solutions, and partnerships, EMC is uniquely able to help solve their problems of today, while at the same time helping them position themselves to meet their needs of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>While the near-term economy continues to be challenging, we are confident we will continue to gain share, because EMC has the best, the broadest, and the most integrated storage portfolio to meet the needs of customers, both now and in the future.</p>
          <p>Our RSA Security revenues in Q3 were $152 million, up 4% sequentially. This business has executed well this year. Even in a tough environment, growth has been positive each quarter in 2009 as information-centric security continues to be a top customer priority. Our strategy here is playing out well, as RSA is more than holding its own across its major businesses, such as authentication, SIEM, DLP, and encryption.</p>
          <p>The recent agreement we signed with First Data Corporation is great evidence of this success. This is the first of its kind solution to seamlessly embed RSA security and encryption capabilities right into First Data's infrastructure, which can then be offered as a service to First Data's 5.4 million retail customers. This is further proof of how information-centric security is an important focus of customers and highlights RSA's strong position here.</p>
          <p>Revenues from our Content Management and Archiving division in Q3 were $177 million, down 2% sequentially. As we went through the quarter, there were signs that customers are engaging a bit more on these types of projects, especially in areas such as compliance and case automation. We also expect the addition of Kazeon to our eDiscovery business will be positive going forward. As an example, earlier this week, we just announced a Kazeon-based SourceOne solution for managing SharePoint repositories, a new opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>In Q3, EMC's Global Services business performed well and revenues grew 4% sequentially. The services organization continues to improve its customer value proposition, and as a result is seeing more opportunities across our customer base.</p>
          <p>In addition, it's great to see that customer loyalty and satisfaction remain very high. EMC's services capabilities are an important competitive differentiator that we are confident will continue to help customers meet their near-term cost containment requirements, while supporting their longer-term objectives for re-architecting the data centers for the future.</p>
          <p>Now turning to some highlights from the income statements. Q3 EMC Information Infrastructure non-GAAP gross margins were 53.1% and operating margins were 16.7%. Both metrics are up year-over-year from the 52.8% and 16% we reported in Q3 2008. Clearly, we've done very well executing on our cost reduction plans and maintaining disciplined expense controls in order to show improved profitability off a smaller revenue base.</p>
          <p>More telling perhaps is that Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was up 270 basis points and operating margin was up 320 basis points from last quarter. This is an excellent result, highlights our successful cost reduction efforts, and is a good example of the leverage in our model. I would like to thank everyone at EMC for their hard work and dedication in achieving this result.</p>
          <p>This margin strength is impressive, taking into account that we've also been making necessary investments for the future. As you will recall, we are investing in transition efforts to reduce our long-term cost structure and we've spent $35 million so far in 2009. We've also invested approximately $60 million in our Cloud Infrastructure and Services business this year.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to be well ahead of our plan for cost savings of $450 million in 2009 versus 2008. We also continue to target $500 million in savings in 2010 versus 2008 from these initiatives.</p>
          <p>We are committed to a healthy balance of growth, earnings leverage, and investment for the future. And I think we've done a very good job in a challenging environment. Given our recent efforts, we believe we are putting into place a business model that can support a fair amount of growth operating leverage, while at the same time allowing us to strengthen EMC's lead and invest in our strategic growth opportunities. Joe will discuss these opportunities and our efforts in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Now turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results. Total Q3 consolidated revenues were approximately $3.5 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 5% year-on-year. On a constant currency basis, revenues were down about 4% from last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.23, and free cash flow was $745 million.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow this quarter is $265 million higher than non-GAAP net income, a great result. So far this year, we've generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow. This is more than $660 million greater than cumulative non-GAAP net income through three quarters and slightly higher than the free cash flow in the same period in 2008. We are very pleased with the strong cash generation we've achieved so far this year.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 17.4%. We now expect the rate for the full year to be around 19%. The rate we reported in Q3 reflects this revised annual rate, including the necessary adjustments for Q1 and Q2. The 2009 tax rate is expected to be lower than our previous estimates due to changing global income mix and higher R&amp;D tax credits.</p>
          <p>Q3 consolidated operating cash flow was $808 million. A few balance sheet items that impact operating cash flow include deferred revenues, which were $3.5 billion; inventory turns, which were 7.7; and DSOs, which were 49 days, all very good given the current economic climate.</p>
          <p>We ended Q3 with $8.4 billion in cash and investments, of which 3.7 billion is held overseas and an additional 2.2 billion is at VMware. This quarter we spent approximately $2.5 billion on acquisitions and strategic investments. The bulk of this was due to the EMC and VMware acquisitions of Data Domain and SpringSource, respectively.</p>
          <p>Financial flexibility is a critical strength and competitive edge for EMC, particularly in this unpredictable economy. Our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in our business, even during challenging economic times.</p>
          <p>In closing, we are clearly pleased with our Q3 results. The breadth and depth of our technology and solutions portfolio allows us to assist customers in achieving strong ROI for their current IT projects, whilst helping them to effectively and efficiently move towards re-architecting their data centers for the future.</p>
          <p>Although the economy remains unsettling and the spending environment is challenging, we are encouraged with the signs of stabilization we are seeing and we believe that our strategy and portfolio position us exceptionally well to be successful in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Our execution this year has been very good. We are making a lot of headway on cost efficiencies and important investments for the future. We remain focused on meeting our short-term objectives and positioning ourselves competitively for long-term success.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Joe.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I would also like to welcome everyone to today's call. Thank you for joining us.</p>
          <p>Overall, given the current IT spending environment, I was quite pleased with our Q3 results. Our results demonstrated that the market demand for our storage, virtualization, security, and compliant backup recovery and archiving solutions was and is solid.</p>
          <p>EMC's business model has proven resilient and strong in this turbulent economic climate. The people of EMC and VMware around the globe are executing our strategy and business plan very well. And as always, I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication, and congratulate them on their success.</p>
          <p>I am sure the top issue on your minds are around what EMC is experiencing relative to this economic climate, and even more so, what's happening on the IT spending front now and into 2010.</p>
          <p>I will start with Q3. Throughout Q3, the predictability of our business was very good. The timing of our order flows throughout the quarter were very close to our historical patterns. Market acceptance of our new product lines was strong, and very importantly, the confidence and esprit de corps of our people is exceptionally high.</p>
          <p>On the macro front, 2009 is progressing pretty much as we expected. We predicted back in our January call that the year-on-year revenue declines would bottom out in Q2, and that IT spending in the second half of 2009 would be stronger than the first half. And as you can see from our reported results and our Q4 forecast, this is the way the year seems to be playing out.</p>
          <p>I might also note, we predict the continuing consolidation of the IT market, with the particular belief that the larger players would be the most aggressive. For sure, this is happening, including EMC as a consolidator; and again, we predict this trend will continue.</p>
          <p>As David indicated, our practice has always been to talk about next year in detail on the January conference call and we intend to continue this practice for 2010. However, I will give you a bit of feel for how we are thinking 2010 will shape up, from both an IT spending point of view and from a consolidated EMC product and solution competitiveness point of view.</p>
          <p>For 2010, on a macro-economy economic recovery front, we expect a slow but steady recovery. In 2010, we expect IT spending to return to growth, albeit somewhat below the historical growth levels we saw in 2004 through 2007. We also expect that year-on-year growth in 2010 for storage, virtualization security, and compliant backup archiving and recovery will be above IT industry averages.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we believe we have a terrific set of technology assets in virtualization and the cloud, as well as in information storage and security. With these assets, we are really focused on four opportunities that are or will become multibillion-dollar markets; markets we expect will exhibit solid double-digit growth, not only in 2010, but well beyond.</p>
          <p>The first and largest of these opportunities is to provide key technology support to help our customers move to the next generation of fully virtualized data centers. We call this our internal or private cloud initiative. This move will provide our customers with a more flexible and dynamic IT environment, one that's easier to operate, one that is extremely secure, and very importantly, one that costs significantly less to build and operate.</p>
          <p>The second growth opportunity is the external or public cloud. We will work with our telco and service provider partners to establish external clouds that are fully compatible with the internal clouds that enterprise customers will build out.</p>
          <p>And as part of these two initiatives, we, with our ecosystem partners, will enable our customers to establish their own federated clouds. These clouds will allow customers to distribute their IT workloads across their own unified internal cloud data centers, and the external cloud data centers their chosen service provider partners will deploy, providing our customers with another level of flexibility and efficiency. EMC will also offer a portfolio of SaaS-based solutions that will operate on top of these clouds infrastructures. Our first is Mozy, that provides online PC backup.</p>
          <p>The third opportunity for us is to provide the benefits of virtualization and fully-protected and compliant information storage to the desktop and mobile market. This vClient Initiative benefits customers by allowing them to more efficiently provision users once, not for each of their multiple, continuously-changing devices. This means not only a better, simpler management scheme, but better security and protection from viruses, and provides a lower total cost of ownership.</p>
          <p>The fourth opportunity for EMC to lead the charge to the next generation of backup recovery and archive solutions. We have sized this market at approximately $10 billion for 2009. It's an extremely fragmented market, with EMC being a leader. The opportunity here stems from the continuing sea of data that customers need to better manage and protect. The attributes of automated tiered storage, coupled with the best-of-breed deduplication technologies are the keys to success here. Clearly, we are absolutely accelerated in the move of backup and recovery from tape to disk.</p>
          <p>And the best news of all, according to a recent Gartner study, only 8% of backup recovery solutions currently deployed use data deduplication technology, a great opportunity for EMC.</p>
          <p>We have moved extremely aggressively since our acquisition of Data Domain. We have already formed a new billion-dollar-plus division we call BRS, or Backup and Recovery Systems. This division, led by former Data Domain CEO, Frank Slootman, combines Data Domain, Avamar, NetWorker and our Disk Libraries, and again, in its first quarter of operation, produced very impressive results.</p>
          <p>It is very important to note that for EMC to capitalize on these four strategic growth opportunities, we will need a strong network of complementary alliance partners. Obviously, we will partner very closely with VMware, but I want to make it very clear that all other technology companies, and I mean all, are welcome and, in fact, encouraged to also partner with VMware. And as always, they can be assured of open and equal access to VMware's leading technologies.</p>
          <p>And over the next several weeks and months, we will continue to form deep alliances with leading IT players in the areas of information technology -- infrastructure technology, excuse me --application providers, system service providers and system integrators. EMC's ecosystem will be second to none.</p>
          <p>Also, I am proud of the seasoned and talented executive team that EMC has in place. EMC-ii is anchored by Bill Teuber, David Goulden, Howard Elias, and now Pat Gelsinger. And of course, we have Paul Maritz on the VMware side; a really strong team.</p>
          <p>In closing, we believe we have the vision, the strategy, the technology, and the partner ecosystem and management team in place for EMC to win and prosper into the future.</p>
          <p>Thanks again for joining us, and now I would like to turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&amp;A portion of today's call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, guys, and congratulations on the quarter. I guess I want to try and understand a little bit the guidance and what you are applying on an organic basis. By my math, it looks like maybe Data Domain was about 70 million or so of revenue contribution in this quarter. And I believe, Joe, you had mentioned that you would do about 200 million with Data Domain for the full year. So if I look at your guidance on an organic basis, it looks like you are guiding somewhere around 12 to 13% sequential growth versus historical, more normal seasonal growth of about 16, 17%.</p>
          <p>So I would like to understand what the puts and takes are there, what you're assuming for Data Domain and why we should think kind of a sub-seasonal growth for Q4?</p>

          <p>Aaron, let me start, and maybe Joe can add some color to it. So Data Domain gave us about three points of growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis, on a year-on-year basis in Q3, so a little stronger than the number that you mentioned there. When I apply that and I look at the sequential growth in Q3 to Q4, given that we had Data Domain in for most of Q3 and all of Q4, if I kind of normalize that, I am looking at about a 14% reported growth, about 13.5% organic growth. And if you look at that compared to prior years normalized for acquisition, that would compare with about 15% that we would see in what I would call a kind of growth year with a full budget flush. So given that we are in a tough economy with IT budgets still being under scrutiny, we think that 14% sequential growth that we have guided to is actually a fairly impressive number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. Could you guys talk about what your plans are for your cash? You had good cash flow this year so far. You have your share count creeping up with the higher stock price, and you have a convert. Maybe it's time to buy back more stock, or discuss what your acquisition strategy remains to be, is it string of pearls or anything bigger on the horizon? Thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ben, as you know, on the -- I'll do the acquisition front and I'll let David add some color here. But our stated preference and I'll state it again, is to continue with our string of pearls approach. I also always state that I don't want to take any options off the table that we believe firmly will benefit our shareholders and the company for the long haul. But nothing has changed on that front, and that will for sure be one of the focuses for usage of cash. And obviously, as you are right, with a couple years away yet, but we do have to think about taking out the convert for cash, which is what we are going to do.</p>

But given the four strategic growth opportunities that Joe has outlined and the huge potential for us to really expand our business in those areas, that's kind of a primary focus for how we're looking to put our cash to work right now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. David, you highlighted the operating leverage in the core EMC Infrastructure business. But when you look on a consolidated basis, your revenues declined 5% and expenses declined 3%. So again, on a consolidated basis, the gap between the revenue decline and expense decline year-over-year does not seem to be narrowing significantly. Should we expect this divergence to continue or should we view this more of a one-time, given sort of the SpringSource acquisition by VMware? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I actually think, Wamsi, obviously, you're asking kind of what happens on the VMware side. And the reason our non-GAAP operating-on a non-GAAP operating margin basis is you're not seeing quite so much contribution from VMware this quarter compared to a year ago, is really the impact of the software capitalization.</p>
          <p>I mentioned to you back in January that software capitalization, or the net effect of software capitalization, was going to be a significant headwind this year. And in fact, that is proving to be the case, particularly in the second half of the year, with VMware being the area where you're seeing the biggest impact. Obviously, a lot of the development costs going into vSphere were capitalized.</p>
          <p>Those are now being amortized and there is less new capitalization to offset that. So that's the major factors impacting what's happening to the VMware non-GAAP numbers as looked at from the EMC point of view.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. The question involves the unified storage platform. You're doing quite well there in terms of the 40% growth in NAS. I was just kind of curious if you could give us a little more context around how much of this growth is being driven primarily with legacy EMC customers versus maybe new incremental customers to EMC?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Question for Joe here. For the Dell relationship, you kind of mentioned quickly the deemphasizing the reseller agreement. Do you think the EMC channel and the direct channel, especially on the CLARiiON side, make up for whatever revenue falls off here from the change in the Dell relationship?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I certainly think we have that capability. But I just want to make it pretty clear that, as David talked to you about, between Dell and us, we are extremely committed to the OEM side of the relationship. What's kind of winding down, if you will, is the reseller side of the relationship. And of course as that winds down on that side, we are trying to pick up that slack through our own direct sales and mostly through channel partners.</p>
          <p>And David talked to you about some pretty impressive growth there. So obviously, we had sequential growth in CLARiiON, despite a significant down from through the Dell channel. So that would say we are certainly beyond the knee of the curve, and we've got to continue to, a) work with Dell and make sure that this OEM opportunity becomes stellar and grows. And at the other side, also work with Dell about opportunities around our deduplication technology, around opportunities with our NAS technology, and at the same time continue to build out other channels and beef up our direct selling organization to make sure that we can pick up the slack that we are going to lose from the reseller side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. So you mentioned high-end storage was stronger during the quarter. I just wanted to understand how much of your high-end storage revenue is being contributed by V-Max? And also, if you can quantify the effect of the transition to the Intel-based architecture on the gross margin for Symmetrix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. The good news is that this quarter, over 50% of our Symmetrix Systems' revenues came from V-Max, which means that in the second full quarter, up to a full half or a little over half from V-Max, that really is about one quarter faster than we would've expected. Typically, for a major transition like this, it takes three quarters before we get to 50%. So we think that's a very good sign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the effect of the transition to the Intel architecture and gross margin for Symmetrix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, you saw a lot of operating leverage and gross margin leverage coming through the quarter. As we said, as V-Max ramps to volume, it has lower production costs than a DMX-4, so obviously that's one of the many factors that did help us drive a lot of operating margin and gross margin increase quarter-on-quarter.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to kind of follow up on the change in the nature of the Dell relationship, or at least the go-to-market, as you've detailed a couple of times. How are you thinking about margin contribution from that revenue stream going forward, both in terms of gross and operating?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the OEM relationship is the most profitable to both of us, because, obviously, they make better margins, but then they do virtually all of the selling.

          <p>Thank you. My question was about the Nehalem product cycle coming up in the next-generation data center, and some of the deferred maintenance on servers that we've seen. Can you talk a little bit about what you see coming in terms of a data center refresh?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not 100% sure of your question, but let me take a stab at it. And if I'm not on what you're asking, let me know. I think what we are really saying is if you look at the inherent power of these new class of four-core going to eight-core very quickly here, processors, Nehalen processors that Intel has out, and the amount of memory they can have and the amount of power they have, and if you look at the roadmap, it is clear-and the fact that these processors have been-have a lot of what Intel calls VT technology in them, which is virtualization-aware technology, which brings down the overhead of a VMware, for instance. It's clear to us that data centers of the futures will be pretty close to 100% virtualized and under a VM type environment, you will be able to run any and all applications.</p>
          <p>And once you get to that particular opportunity, if you look at where VMware has taken vSphere, you will be able to have a much different management model and a much-and be able to have a lower cost infrastructure to run your applications. And that's where we are headed. And of course, from a storage point of view, we are-two systems we've done from scratch, if you will, to make sure that we are there, is on the block side, we've done a lot of work with V-Max.</p>
          <p>And then on the object side, we have come out with a brand new system called Atmos. And then, of course, by its very definition, our future NAS systems will play very well there, too. And then, of course, that puts a real premium on security, as you do more federation across more of your own data centers or your partners' data centers, and those cover areas of data leakage and identity protection and verification and the GRC side of making sure you have good security and event management. And this is software we do in our RSA. So we think we are very well positioned for that cycle, and that's what that cycle will be made up of.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Quick question for David. If you look at the mix of the margins here, both services and products were up nicely. I'm curious to know if you think you can sustain the gross margins on the services side in the mid-60s, and if you think the product gross margins can get back to the mid to high 50s level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Troy, sure. On the services margins, yes, we've made a lot of improvement there. That has been through a lot of our cost reengineering, cost improvement, and efficiency programs on the services side. As I mentioned, we've done that whilst keeping customer sat and loyalty pretty close to all-time highs. So we are very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>So we do hope -- we do expect to be able to maintain margins at this level, but don't expect to see a huge amount of improvement from here forward on the services side. And as I said on the product side, the biggest factor in our margin equation going into this year, certainly back in Q1, was the volume effect. And you can see, as volumes have increased sequentially during the year, that we've seen a nice improvement in product gross margins. And we do believe that as volumes continue to increase and we continue to see the full effect of our new technologies, there is certainly some upside potential from here on that side as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Joe, just kind of a big-picture question. I know close rates are more important than pipelines sometimes, but if you could talk about pipeline and just trying to get a sense for pent-up demand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so far, as I said, our productivity has been-our productivity against our pipelines have been very good. Our pipelines have been proven accurate. And obviously, that's what gave us the confidence to call a 14% growth from Q3 to Q4. And it's a real growth, because there is really no acquisition effects, because we had the acquisitions done, in the case of Data Domain in Q3.</p>
          <p>So it's pretty close, as David said to consign. We wouldn't have made a call like that if we didn't have the pipelines and the visibility to make that call. And obviously, the proof is in the pudding. Our field sales force now has got to come through. But they've got a pretty good track record, and that gave us the confidence to do what we did.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Congratulations on the nice quarter. So I understand you're not talking about Q1, but can you comment on the typical seasonality for Q1? I guess, are you expecting less than normal sequential decline as the macro situation gets better? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I think we've done more than we usually do, Kaushik, so I will kind of take the fifth again. We always have, I think, give you a very detailed rundown in our January call. We will do that again. I wanted to give you some of our thinking as we are building our plans in terms of what we expect the market to do, which I've done. But other than that, I don't want to go any further right now.</p>

          <p>Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. And as I said, we are excited about our product portfolio. We are excited about the opportunity that we have in these four great areas, in addition to our kind of business as usual.</p>
          <p>And I personally am excited about the management team and the depth that we've built here, and I think it's going to serve us and the shareholders very well.</p>
          <p>So again, thank you for your interest in EMC, as always, and we will be talking to you soon. Bye-bye.</p>
