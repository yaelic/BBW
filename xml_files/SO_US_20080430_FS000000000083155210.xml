          <p>Good afternoon.  My name is Kimberly and I will be your conference operator today.  At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company First Quarter 2008 Earnings Call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Ratcliffe, CEO.  Sir, you may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kimberley.  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to be with you today for our First Quarter Earnings Call.  Joining me today is Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Let me remind that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information.  There are various important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a good quarter and we are off to an excellent start for the year.  Continuing with our long-standing commitment to customers through superior reliability, customer satisfaction and low prices, we now also find ourselves well positioned with a transparent and stable regulatory framework during a period of significant capital investment. With Georgia Power's three-year rate plan along with the formulary base rate mechanisms and clauses in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, we have a great deal in transparency in cost recovery and in our overall financial profile for the next several years.</p>
          <p>Turning now to a discussion of the economy, there are signs that economic growth in our territory is slowing.  However, we expect the decline in the Southeast will be less severe than in the US economy as a whole, due to the healthy demographic trends and a favorable business climate.  The slowdown in construction of new homes has had a significant impact on the building products industry.  We've seen a decline in sales to the stone, wood products and carpet manufacturing sectors.  On the positive side, job growth in the region is currently ahead of the US.  In addition, the Southeast is expected to outperform the national economy in terms of both household growth, currently 1.8%, and population growth, which is now 1.7%.</p>
          <p>Finally, as we emerge from this economic slowdown, we expect that the states of Alabama and Georgia will add nearly 280,000 jobs by the year 2010.</p>
          <p>At this point, I will now turn the call over to Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer, for a discussion of our financial highlights for the first quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2008.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.  As you mentioned, we're off to a good start this year.  In the first quarter of 2008 we reported $0.47 a share; that's an increase of $0.06 a share over the first quarter of 2007, excluding our synthetic fuel investments.  Although synthetic fuel is no longer a factor in our 2008 earnings, we will still compare our results during 2008 to our ex-synfuel earnings for 2007.  On an as-reported basis, our earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $0.02 a share above our earnings from the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the major factors that drove our first quarter numbers compared with the first quarter of 2007.  First, the negative factors. Non-fuel O&amp;M for our traditional operating companies had a negative impact of $0.04 a share on our earnings for the first quarter of 2008 compared with the prior period in 2007.  This was primarily due to an increase in the number of planned outages and the duration of outages associated with installing new environmental equipment, as well as an increased customer service expense.</p>
          <p>Increased depreciation and amortization due primarily to increasing environmental investment reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share compared to the first quarter of 2007.  Also consistent with our growing investment, interest expense for our traditional operating companies reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share compared with the first quarter of 2007.  Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings $0.01 a share in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the positive factors.  Increased revenues due to short-term or market response rates and regulatory actions in Alabama and Georgia added $0.10 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the first quarter of 2007.  Usage and economic growth added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same period in 2007.  Total customer growth year-over-year was 1.1%.</p>
          <p>On average, weather in the first quarter of 2008 was normal as it was in the first quarter of 2007.  So weather was not a factor in our earnings.  We had other contributions to earnings from our traditional business that added $0.03 a share in the first quarter 2008 compared with the first quarter 2007.  This increase stemmed primarily from allowance for equity funds used during construction or AFUDC related to our environmental construction program.  In conclusion, we had $0.15 of positive items offset by $0.09 of negative factors, so overall our quarter came in at $0.47 a share.</p>
          <p>Before I discuss our earnings estimate for the second quarter, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our recent dividend increase.  As you may have seen last week, we announced a 4.3% annual dividend increase effective with our second quarter dividend payment in June.  The dividend is now $0.42 per share on a quarterly basis and $1.68 per share annually.  This marks the 242nd consecutive quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its common shareholders.  In fact, every year for the past 60 years, Southern Company has paid a quarterly dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter dividend.</p>
          <p>Our dividend plus our financial objectives of regular, predictable and sustainable earnings per share growth and stable A credit ratings are key components of our overall low risk shareholder value proposition when compared with the overall market.  These financial metrics plus the future three year period of comparative regulatory stability that David referred to earlier distinguish Southern Company from many of our peers in the industry.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our guidance for 2008.  It is clear our businesses are performing well.  While we exceeded our first quarter estimate by $0.08 a share, a portion of this variance can be attributed to O&amp;M timing.  Our current plans are for O&amp;M to be on budget by the end of the year.  Given this and the potential for other variability, particularly during our peak summer months, we are maintaining our current earnings guidance of $2.28 to $2.36 per share.  Finally, our estimate for the second quarter is $0.55 per share.</p>
          <p>At this point I'll turn the call back to David for his closing remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul.  I wanted to update you on a significant event which has transpired since our last earnings call in January.  As you may have seen earlier this month, Georgia Power and its partners Oglethorpe Power, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and Dawson Utilities have signed an engineering procurement and construction agreement with Westinghouse and Shaw Group to design, engineer, procure and construct two AP1000 nuclear units.  If selected and approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, the units would be constructed at Plant Vogtle, near Augusta.  Based on its current ownership interest, Georgia Power would own approximately 45.7% of the new units.</p>
          <p>The signing of this contract is a significant step forward, and if approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, Vogtle units three and four could be one of the first nuclear plants to be ordered in the United States since 1978.  However, it's important to remember that this is another step in a long process.  The next milestone is the selection of a preferred bid by Georgia Power.  All bids will be submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission by tomorrow afternoon, May 1.  The Georgia Public Service Commission through its independent evaluator will review the nuclear EPC contract as well as all competing base load generation bids.  From the alternatives, Georgia Power will then select a preferred resource, and expects to file an application for the certification in August of this year.</p>
          <p>The final step will be the certification proceeding before the Georgia Public Service Commission with a decision expected in March 2009.  Under Georgia law, once certification is obtained, Georgia Power would then be assured recovery of all capital costs spent on the project, assuming they are incurred in a prudent manner.  At this point, we have not provided a cost estimate for these two units.  However, if constructed, the project would include a combination of fixed price and indexed components.  As discussed previously, the contract terms and conditions are part of a confidential and competitive solicitation monitored by the Georgia Public Service Commission's Independent Evaluator.  After all bids are submitted, Georgia Power expects to release additional details regarding the project, including the total estimated cost of the plan.</p>
          <p>You may have seen in the 8-Ks we filed in April, on April 8th, that we increased our capital expenditures budget for the next three years. The new CapEx forecast totals $14.4 billion for 2008 through 2010. Our CapEx budget for 2008 remains unchanged at 4.4 billion.  Our forecast includes 1.3 billion in 2009 and 2010 as a placeholder, in the event that the nuclear bid is ultimately certified.</p>
          <p>For units three and four at Plant Vogtle, the major capital dollars are expected to be spent from 2009 to 2015, with an expected commercial start date in 2016 for unit three and 2017 for unit four.  Nuclear energy is the best means of meeting some of the nation's future additional energy requirements without emissions of carbon dioxide.  In addition to nuclear, it will take a host of new technology approaches as well as renewables and energy efficiency measures to achieve meaningful reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
          <p>To this end, we are working with the state of Mississippi and the Department of Energy to construct a coal gasification facility of approximately 600 megawatts in east central Mississippi to be completed in the 2013 timeframe.  The technology is a transport gasification process that we developed in partnership with Kellogg Brown and Root and the Department of Energy.  We believe the Mississippi coal gasification option, in addition to meeting additional load requirements in the region, represents an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of this clean coal technology, including the potential for carbon capture.</p>
          <p>You may be aware that earlier this month, the Mississippi legislature approved a bill that provided greater certainty of cost recovery.  If approved by the governor, the measure will authorize the Mississippi Public Service Commission to allow a utility to recover all or a portion of its pre-construction cost and earn a return on its prudent construction cost for the new base load generation.  As we continue both the nuclear project in Georgia and the IGCC facility in Mississippi, we will as always keep you informed and updated about our progress.</p>
          <p>At this point Paul and I will be happy to take any questions you might have.  Kimberley, we'll now take the first question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to go &#x2013; I guess Georgia Power did exceptionally well and I was just trying to go a little bit beyond the items as to what generated that nearly 34% improvement in net income. I don't know if you can share with us whether O&amp;M was flat or there was a higher non-fuel margin, or is this what was predicted in your budgets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ashar, this is a reflection of the base rate increases that we've seen plus the AFUDC equity component associated with the increased investment that we've made at Georgia Power.  Plus they've seen continued momentum that they had last year in the industrial sector to continue in to this year.  There are some segments that are non-home building related that are doing quite well and those are the commodity-based segments like primary steel and those types.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so in essence you are saying industrial sales were much higher than &#x2013; were very strong, is that correct? And then there is a higher AFUDC earning, and I guess the non-fuel margin is better because of the rate case. Am I right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and could you just mention what happened, I know it's a very small thing, but anything unusual at Mississippi Power?  Earnings were down a little, I guess 4 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They had a higher O&amp;M, Ashar, for the quarter, and a higher depreciation for the quarter.  They also are &#x2013; the O&amp;M is related to evaluation of their IGCC project.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I was muted.  You parsed out $0.10 of upside from revenues from rate cases and MRR.  Can you kind of tell how much of those were related to each?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, their equally divided between rate impact associated with the regulatory actions in both Alabama and Georgia as well as the market response rate that we've seen in Georgia as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about the market response rate mechanism and what we could see in the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, those pricing products are prices or tariffs that provide customers with options to make purchase decisions based on incremental market prices.  This product has been around since the early 1990s, so over 15 years that they've been with us both at Georgia and at Alabama.  Customers have choices with this product of course; they have a choice to continue to their purchase patterns as they normally do.  But it's really based on their own economic thresholds or margins within their own business.  The other option they have is based on prices reduced or change or usage patters or select other pricing products, so given that as a platform for decisions, we don't see this product being a carry on for the rest of the year.  The question is the sustainability.  We think it will start adjusting based on the prices that they see and the customers will make some other buying decisions.  Last summer we saw the customers adjust their usage patters during our peak period almost 300 megawatts.  So it's a demand response price product that based on the individual customer's economics, they make those decisions.</p>

          <p>Sales for industrial are up 6% for quarter-over-quarter.  What we're seeing is, if you take the segment that is non-building related, it's still a strong growth area for us, particularly the primary metals, transportation.  We've seen activities around pipelines, so I think it's been a robust momentum builder, if you will, for us in that segment.  However, the downside is the lumber-related industries.  Those have seen a significant reduction in overall sales.  Now if I said 6%, I meant 0.6%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The good news is it's been raining in the Southeast so we're in better shape going into this summer with regard to our reservoirs, and the reservoir that gets most public attention in the Atlanta area is Lake Lanier.  It's about 13 feet down.  It was about 20 feet down last year, so it's in better shape also.  We expect that if the Corps of Engineers operates that facility with a more conservative approach, which they are currently doing, that we should not be impacted during the summer as long as they provide the kind of minimum releases that we expect.  And we expect that our own production &#x2013; we budgeted about 50% of normal for hydro generation and we're running just slightly behind that so far this year.  But I think that 50% number is a pretty good number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just kind of on the fuel supply conversation, how do coal inventories look and it seems we're actually seeing people sign contracts at pretty rich prices.  Are you guys having to sign up on price and how are deliverabilities from Latin America up to you guys right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Inventories are great.  We're right where we want to be going into the summer.  We always try to build a little inventory going into the peak period.  And no question that prices are up and to the extent we're trying to replace any supplies, we would see that also.  Good news is that we're about 90-plus percent contracted for the year.  I think it's 50% in &#x2013; what is it?  50 to 60% in 9.  So as we replace supplies or actually contract supplies in 9 and beyond, we'll begin to see the impact of these prices if they stay there.  Hopefully when world supplies get back in balance maybe out of Australia and South America, we'll see a little moderation in these prices.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Okay. We've seen some massive sales happen in the Southeast on the generation side, and you guys do have a pretty big place marker for Southern Power from a CapEx perspective over the next couple of years.  Have you guys taken a look at these recent auctions and is there anything that looks interesting or anything in the pipeline where you guys might be able to put that capital to work sooner?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>As you know, Dan, we continue to look at opportunities within the Southeast.  Currently Southern Power is contracted through 2011 and &#x2013; for 92% of all its capacity, and part of our strategy has been looking at acquisitions.  And we're very active in that space to try to find an economic opportunity that might exist out there.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>It's more of the fits and starts.  There's nothing to &#x2013; uniformally going out there right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I was just curious if you could clarify the statements you had made around Vogtle and the new build, and just what you were looking for in August and then in March of 2009.  I was just curious when you would be giving like notice to proceed to Shaw Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me go back through the process.  It's a little bit convoluted, but I think I can walk you back through it.  We will submit, we being Georgia Power, will submit its contract terms and conditions on May the 1st.  In turn, the evaluation process, which is governed by an independent evaluator, will evaluate that bid along with any other bids that are submitted as part of the RFP process between May and August.  In August, they, that is, the independent evaluator, will make a recommendation to the Public Service Commission with regards to what they believe is the best alternative.  In August, the Georgia Public Service Commission will begin a series of hearings to evaluate that recommendation and its context.  They have until March of '09 to make that decision, meaning either agree and certify the decision around Vogtle, or select some other alternative depending on what comes through the RFP process.  They can decide earlier, but they must decide by March of '09.  Does that help?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions.  Southern Power is down for the quarter, any particular reason and what kind of trend we should think about for the rest of this year for Southern Power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Annie, one of the things that we have seen with Southern Power is an increase in their maintenance costs for the quarter associated with the turbine inspections and part of their ongoing use of those turbines, so that was an increase over last year.  We are expecting them to be on target for the remaining part of this year.  As you know, Tom had mentioned at the last quarter earnings call, that we're budgeting 135 million per year for the next three years for Southern Power, so we expect them to perform at that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question has to do with your CapEx, I just want some clarification.  You did mention for the next three years 14.4 billion.  Is the 4.4 billion for '08 and the rest is for '09 and '10, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then '09 and '10 is for the nuclear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>'09 and '10 is for all the remaining environmental CapEx spend and our T&amp;D capital, our new generation which includes the Vogtle expenditures.  For '09 we have 5.2 billion budgeted and 2010 we have 4.8 billion budgeted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But only 1.3 billion of that is related to Plant Vogtle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the one, okay thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Daniele Seitz of Dahlman Rose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just was wondering when do you start collecting on the return on your expenditures on Vogtle?  Does it come after the decision of March '09 or do you have to wait for another case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniele, I assume you're talking about the potential to recover construction work in progress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not at this point authorized to do that, so right now if the commission certifies Plant Vogtle, unless we do something different, it would be under the conventional financing process where we collect AFUDC through the construction phase and then when it's commercial, we put it in rate base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are considering whether or not we should discuss with the Public Service Commission the idea of minimizing the cost to customers by taking of a CWIP process, but that's a decision that Georgia will have to make and the commission will have to agree too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you ask for, I mean would you consider asking for it in 2009? Or do you have to wait for a longer period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have to wait for any particular period, so it will be a matter of discussion here in the next year or so.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I also have a question on Vogtle.  When you say the $1.3 billion, is that your 45% or is that 100%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's our 45.7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your partners, what risks would Southern be taking that there would be a liquidity issue with your partners not being able to fund their CapEx commitment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, I'm not aware of any risk right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, the process for them, they have to determine their take by July 2nd.  They have to lock in their ownership portion on July 2nd.  As far as liquidity, we don't see that being an issue at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If they weren't able to contribute to the CapEx plan of the build though, would there, what would happen in that event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'd have to simply sit down and look at that situation as it evolves.  Because there are multiple co-owners, we just have to see what the situation is at the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you remind me of the process for the IGCC plant in Mississippi?  What milestones should we be looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I Well, we have, as we said, we are working with DOE to try to get funding for the IGCC project in the form of transfer of the commitment that DOE had made to the technology commercialization in Orlando.  Also some tax benefits, also some loan guarantees provisions that we're working with them.  We expect to get some ruling from DOE here in the next month or so.  At that time, as I mentioned in my remarks, we would have to go back to the Mississippi Public Service Commission and get them to certify the capacity and have a discussion with them about the potential for construction work in progress on that project.  There's still a lot of work to be done.  We're doing the feed studies on the technology side at this point.  So we still have a lot of work to do to put that project together, but we're moving through the process.  Hopefully by fourth quarter, we should know whether we're going to move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would be above and beyond your planned CapEx or would that be already in plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it would be above and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, one other point I'll add is, when they are referred to the DOE process, last year Mississippi Power submitted and received approval for $133 million of tax credits associated with this project.  Our opportunity is to try to expand that with clean coal power initiative funds and the other offerings that are being made for coal-based generation for the country.</p>
