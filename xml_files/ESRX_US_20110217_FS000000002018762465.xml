          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Express Scripts fourth quarter 2010 earnings call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference now to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. David Myers. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone. With me today are George Paz, our Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include, but are not necessarily limited to, financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations, or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for the reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release. The earnings release is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff, who will discuss our fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Today, we are pleased to report another strong quarter. As I told you last quarter, we believe there are only a few metrics that truly matter for the creation of long-term shareholder value: claims, earnings per share, EBITDA, cash flow, and of course return on invested capital. Our performance on all of these metrics for both the quarter and year was strong.</p>
          <p>Adjusted claims grew to $753.9 million for the year. Earnings per share were $0.71 for the quarter and $2.50 for the year, reflecting 40% growth over full-year 2009. All of this growth in EPS came from operations, as EBITDA was up 42% year over year. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 20% to $2.1 billion. And return on invested capital was 20.5%. And I note that this calculation includes all intangible assets in the base.</p>
          <p>On last quarter's call, we discussed our view on guidance, which we believe may be slightly different than some of our peers. To reiterate, we focus on forecast accuracy, guide to only the metrics that matter, and create long-term shareholder value by delivering on these metrics.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we still expect EPS to be in a range of $3.15 to $3.25, representing growth of 26% to 30% over 2010. As it is still early in the year, the range around the midpoint has not narrowed. As we move through the year, there are several factors that could move our performance above or below the midpoint of this range.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our view on guidance, our policy is not to provide quarterly forecasts, as we believe that would only distract us from our long-term goals. However, as we transition out of integration, we'd like to provide a point of clarity. As I said last quarter, earnings per share for 2011 will be more back-end loaded than normal.</p>
          <p>First quarter 2011 EPS is expected to be below fourth quarter 2010 EPS. This expected decline is driven by the normal seasonality of client renewals; increased call volumes as a result of plan changes, which is even higher this year as a result of the healthcare reform changes. And unlike prior years, we expect only a minimal increase in generic fill rate in the first quarter to offset these normal seasonal patterns.</p>
          <p>The strong historical performance and outlook for the future I just summarized can be attributed to our focus on the metrics that matter and the consistent execution of our business model of alignment. We follow a simple four-step process to develop and implement field tested and market ready innovations for our clients. We work tirelessly to listen, study, and understand our clients' needs. We analyze these needs in terms of both clinical and financial components. Then utilizing our advanced understanding of human behavior, we design and pilot innovative approaches to eliminate waste and improve outcomes while maximizing member acceptance.</p>
          <p>Finally, we closely monitor program performance against design expectations to continually refine and optimize financial and clinical outcomes. All of this is done in a clinical-first culture where decisions are data driven and based on facts derived from randomized controlled trials.</p>
          <p>The significant investment we have made in our Research and New Solutions Lab, which is unique in the industry, is a testament to our belief in the power of this differentiated model. This model creates value for our clients and their patients; and because we are aligned, creates superior shareholder value for our stockholders.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. The milestones we reached this year are tangible proof of the strength of our business model and the commitment of our employees to improve clinical outcomes while driving out wasteful spending.</p>
          <p>As a result of our focus, dedication, and passion for service, we delivered record earnings and record cash flow while accomplishing the following; the seamless and efficient migration of NextRx lies with minimal disruption. Thanks to great cooperation from both companies, we were able to achieve our goals in this area on forecast. This alliance now opens new horizons for improving healthcare outcomes. The near completion of rationalizing our footprint and realization of synergies, the opening of our new Technology and Innovation Center, which secures our best-in-class pharmacy technology leadership; and as Jeff mentioned, the launch of our new research and new lab solutions, while we are expanding the application scope and value of Consumerology.</p>
          <p>During December, we hosted two important events, our annual kickoff meeting with our national sales force and our annual Consultant Summit, where we bring together leading PBM consultants to discuss our unique and differentiated approach to the marketplace. In all my Express Scripts years, I don't remember a time that both groups were as bullish on our value proposition and product offering as they are today.</p>
          <p>We are turning data driven research into insights and insights into real solutions that improve care and drive out waste in the pharmacy benefit. Our investments in Consumerology not only differentiate us in the marketplace but also sustain our competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>It is now clear; optimal clinical outcomes cannot be accomplished without an advanced understanding of behavior. Consumer decisions and choices often stand between doctor's orders and the patient achieving the best care at the lowest cost.</p>
          <p>We embarked on a mission nearly five years ago to understand this behavioral component, and it's working. Not only do we have industry leading insights into consumer health behavior, we have successfully translated those insights into solutions that have proven to be both effective and member friendly.</p>
          <p>Previously, I mentioned how enthused we are about our offerings for this selling season. Here's why. We recently launched Select Solutions, a family of choice based products that nudge members to positive behaviors in radically new way. Following the success of Select Home Delivery, we applied the behavioral science to address other challenges in pharmacy benefit, including drug mix, therapy adherence, and specialty pharmacy. Now through the power of choice, plan sponsors and members alike are able to effectively manage the pharmacy benefit both clinically and financially.</p>
          <p>Also, we recently launched Specialty Benefit Services, a next generation breakthrough that delivers enhanced patient care access across the pharmacy medical spectrum. Specialty Benefit Services applies proven management methods to both the pharmacy and medical components of specialty spend, driving significant savings while improving healthcare outcomes.</p>
          <p>We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities in our marketplace. Clearly understanding and improving patient behavior will be more crucial than ever as we help clients and members navigate their healthcare environment in the wake of healthcare reform. We also will enhance our leading position in the management of costs and health outcomes in the fast growing Specialty Pharmacy area.</p>
          <p>Our focus on consumer behavior will allow us to be the most effective and successful PBM and maximizing health outcomes while reducing costs through the advent of biosimilars. Our unique value proposition and innovative approach to the management of pharmacy benefit will allow us to continue to lower costs for our plan sponsors, improve health outcomes for our patients, and drive superior returns for our stockholders.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll be happy to answer any questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning, a couple questions. First on the &#x2013; I guess let's start with the SG&amp;A first. You guys provided guidance in 2010 for SG&amp;A, and the actual came in much lower. Is there any sense for how that might trend for 2011, without giving specifics? I'm just trying to get a sense for whether that may grow or could actually be down.</p>
          <p>And the other question I think I'm more focused on is the gross profit growth in the fourth quarter. Is there any sort of startup costs related to new business tied in that were absorbed in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense for the gross profit run rates. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Jeff answer some of the specifics around this. But keep in mind, we give guidance. And one of the problems you have when you give guidance is that the more metrics you give, the more micro components you have to manage. In reality, business has to be nimble and we have to be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, and we have to anticipate what's coming down the pike.</p>
          <p>So when we look at Medicare changes, Medicaid opportunities that afford themselves, new client opportunities, implementation costs, all those things go into a bucket. And our job is to deliver on what we told you we would deliver on. And to the extent that we could have higher margin, it gives us more opportunity to invest in things to speed up, accelerate investments to improve our long-term goals. To the extent we are overwhelmed with new clients coming on board, if you will, then we've got to spend the money now to bring those up. All those things go into an analysis, which at the beginning of the year nobody has a crystal ball that tells you where you're going to come in. So our best guess is to try to give guidance.</p>
          <p>We like &#x2013; as Jeff said in his prepared comments, our goal is to hit EBITDA targets, ROIC goals, and earnings goals. And throughout the course of the year, there are going to be gives and takes on the timing of generics, when do clients actually buy clinical programs, when do they put in Select Home Delivery. All those pieces go into the numbers that can allow us to beat our midpoint of our range, to be slightly below the midpoint of our range, or to give us a shift between gross margin and EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, to your earlier question, was there unusual cost? I don't think any of us at Express Scripts truly understood the amount of confusion that was being dealt to the marketplace through healthcare reform and all of the myriad of changes that were coming in on Medicare. So we knew there was going to be a lot, and we staffed up our call centers and our account management and gave them the tools to manage a very high volume of inquiry that was going to occur. But quite frankly, it even exceeded our expectations. And so we had to turn up some of our flexible resources to meet those needs during the fourth quarter in order to make sure we were well positioned for 1/1. Obviously, 1/1 is very, very important to us.</p>
          <p>Our call center costs and a lot of these components do run through cost of goods sold, so those numbers drive down margin. But again, at the end of the day, these are things that we've worked our way through. January was a tough month, with everything going on from the suspension of preexisting conditions to covering people until they're 26. Think of yourself if you're a senior and you're trying to choose all the different Medicare options you have available during the fourth quarter. There are just tons of questions that arise, and we had to staff up for that. I think we're pretty comfortable with where we came in. I think we did a very good job of that, but it's always a challenge. Jeff, do you have anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's exactly right. We've been saying for several quarters we're focused on the metrics that matter. That's what we're really going after, as George says. We think that allows us to stay nimble and really create long-term shareholder value. The bottom line is that we think our business is performing well. EPS for 2010 was up 40%. The range for '11, as I said, is up 26% to 30%, and all of this growth is coming from operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree. The results are pretty solid. Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from the line on of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff, just maybe to follow up a little when we think of gross profits. Are you seeing any change in generic procurement? Some of the drug distributors have talked about the fact that there are less manufacturers, which means that there's less opportunity to really bring the cost down. So I'm just wondering what you're seeing on that side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that is a core competency here of how we go out and how we negotiate contracts with our entire supply chain. And we continue to think that we can derive value from that space. Obviously, I don't really like to go into all the details of individual negotiations. But at the end of the day, generic drugs, for the most part, are commodity products, and we feel like we can negotiate good prices on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, just so we understand, whether there are eight manufacturers or five manufacturers, is there a big difference in how you should be able to procure the drug and the margin you can make? Is it materially different? Or because you're so good at buying generics, it doesn't really matter if there are five or eight manufacturers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Five versus eight does not matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just secondly, George, it was interesting that you mentioned Medicaid. We've noticed that PCMA [Pharmaceutical Care Management Association] has been talking about many state governments trying to now adopt some of the commercial methodology around generics and other things for their Medicaid programs. Do you think Medicaid is an area that Express Scripts will have more interest in participating in over the next couple of years? That would be my first question. And then secondly, as we think about those type of government contracts, maybe you can give us some of your thoughts around pass-through pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. With respect to Medicaid, that has always been a focus of ours. As you know, Lisa, we provide back office and support to many, many managed care programs, quite a few of which are focused in Medicaid, and you're absolutely right. When you look at the state budget deficits facing many of the governors today, they're looking at opportunities and ways to drive out costs. And a lot of the fee-for-service programs do not put the constructive constraints around the benefit designs and access in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p>And using the tools of the PBMs, step therapies, prior authorization programs, formulary designs, those things can really take a lot of cost out, and I think we're seeing a tremendous amount of interest by the administrations in looking at those opportunities. So this is an area we will continue to focus very heavily on and try to help our managed care companies position themselves for growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it would be through the managed care companies? It wouldn't be you're now trying to circumvent your managed care companies and go directly to the states?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some can carve out the pharmacy benefit, but that's usually not done. It's usually a managed care program that manages the entire spend. Obviously, if we get an RFP for a state that just wants to just have a drug benefit carve-out for the managed care drug spend &#x2013; I'm sorry, for the Medicaid drug spend, we'd bid that. But I don't think that's where it's headed right now. I think it's more headed to more of an overall management because keep in mind, the drug side of this thing is 15% or so of the cost. And when so they still want to attack that other 85% and get their arms around the whole thing. So the natural progression is to go to managed. And then at some point in the future, if they see there's value, then you would carve it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then my second question just is around pass-through pricing on government contracts. Are you starting to see that more prevalent? Obviously, if you're doing Medicaid through managed care, my guess would be it's still a standard PBM contract. But what about any of the other government type of contracts? What are you seeing today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably six, seven years ago, maybe even five years ago, we saw a pretty big demand on pass-through pricing, and there were a lot of requests for that. We still get them, but I don't think the demand and the requirements are nearly as strong as they used to be. And I think the reason is, is because the PBMs have been able to demonstrate significant savings through their models. And that is if we can show our profit alignment to the client being in the generic side, it certainly speaks.</p>
          <p>Pass-through pricing can have the same price on average per drug on a bushel basket of drugs, whether it's pass-through or what we call spread or traditional pricing. The benefit of this pass-through or spread is you now know you've got your vendor, your PBM aligned with you because if you put your profits in the generics, they're more apt to try to push that. And I think more and more clients and more and more people that select our products understand that dynamic and have stayed with the traditional side. So I think it's really case specific as to what the client is looking for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. I appreciate the comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, George and Jeff. I appreciate the comments on avoiding the line item guidance, but I'm happy to ignore it for this question. Why wouldn't we see a little bit better gross margin here in the first quarter? I saw you bought more inventory than I've seen you do historically. I presume that's branded inventory. You're bringing the mail facility down, I thought. And then just lastly, didn't a considerable portion of your lines renew to formularies that do reflect the WellPoint muscle there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind, again, think about what has happened this year in the myriad and the number of Medicare changes that came in through the course of the year. Last year when you look back, if you go back in our history, you'll see first quarter historically has been below fourth quarter. And this last year, the last two years, I guess, we haven't had that phenomenon because of the acquisition of the NextRx, which provided a catalyst as we were bringing that client on board.</p>
          <p>But typically, we have to gear up. We've been saying this for 10 years, 14 years that you have to staff up for 1/1. It's a lot of work. And when you put in the level of Medicare compliance requirements that occur, all that stuff works its way through in the first fill or two of the new year. But all that hits you in the first quarter, so you have to staff up through the fourth quarter and be full boat in the first quarter. And then you can start tapering off towards the end of the first quarter. The other thing that's a big catalyst, obviously, is the timing of generic launches. And I think Jeff mentioned that didn't &#x2013; this first quarter of this year, we don't have that catalyst. Jeff, do you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. I think we're not going to get into the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>George, am I wrong in assuming the formularies have a bit more integrity this year, or is that just not as big a profit driver as I thought it was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think giving you a 27% to 30% growth rate isn't too bad, Robert, I don't know.  I think that's a pretty big focus and it is driving results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and what changes specifically did you do with the formularies this year with LIPITOR, in your end view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're trying to hold. That's a client decision, keep in mind. We go out; we have a lot of pharmacists that work for us. And the pharmacists go out and consult with the clients, but it's ultimately the client's decision. So a client has to make a decision today whether or not they want to keep LIPITOR. If they've already got it on their formulary, do they want to keep it through the rest of the year and absorb the higher costs, or do they want to move to generic simvastatin and those lower doses today?</p>
          <p>Our recommendation now is to stay with LIPITOR. You're going to maximize your generic benefit and you're going to maximize your discounts with the more people you keep on LIPITOR because keep in mind; as you move those people away from LIPITOR, you're going to get &#x2013; a lot of them will go to the generic. But some percentage of those will go to other statins, branded statins, which will have a cost driver once the drug goes generic. Obviously, they're not going to go switch them back again. Doctors don't like to ping-pong this stuff. So we'd rather make that switch as effective as possible. So our goals through this year are to try to keep people on LIPITOR.</p>
          <p>One of the big things we did when we had such success when simvastatin came out from ZOCOR was the effort we put on keeping people on ZOCOR. If you watch the drug trends, when a drug is in its last year of patent protection, you'll see the market share of that drug decline pretty significantly through the course of that year. It's not given support typically from the manufacturer. The detail reps are all working to move it, and our job is to try to hold it. So that's going to be the big push this year is to hold our LIPITOR percentages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, you did give cash flow guidance, I believe. What's a reasonable share repurchase assumption for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've guided free cash flow &#x2013; I'm sorry, cash from ops $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. And what we've said is that we expect to use the majority of that cash from ops or the majority of the free cash flow to do share repurchases. So we haven't given a specific number, but we said the majority of it is for repurchases. Obviously, how that repurchase rolls out over the course of the year tends to be pretty lumpy based on when we have a window.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks. I guess just piggybacking on that last one, you still have a very strong balance sheet. So how do we think about leverage and the potential that you would either lever up to maybe even buy more stock back over time or other means? Can you give us some color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we think we have a very strong balance sheet at the moment. We are levered less than one times EBITDA. Certainly, we could take that number higher. We've said many times our range is one to two times. It feels like the right leverage for us to maintain our solid BBB rating. So certainly, there's a lot of dry powder. And our use for that capital hasn't really changed. We think really the highest and best use or the highest ROIC tends to be internal investments, like the lab we were talking about earlier, which we think is going to have a really high return. After that, we have good accretive M&amp;A things like WellPoint, where we can create a lot of shareholder value. And when we fill up those two buckets and there's still cash left, we use it for share repurchases.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We never really want to comment on M&amp;A. I think there are things that look interesting to us. But when or if they become available for sale at the right price and terms is always hard to comment on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then before, I think in response to Lisa's question, you were talking about your contracting across the supply chain. Can you give any color on any trends or nuances maybe in '11 versus prior years or future years relative to your relationships with retailers and maybe negotiating trends or purchasing trends there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The big retailers, obviously, have a lot of our business, and we have a lot of their business. So when we can come with ways to work together, we try to make sure through our contracting process that the retailers make more money on generics than they do on the brands. And if we can keep that alignment and then we've got it with our clients and then we've got it with our retail outlets, then it's a good model. Then they're aligned with us.</p>
          <p>So when you're the pharmacist working behind the counter and an Express Scripts member walks in and all of a sudden, the drug has got a step therapy in front of it, hopefully the pharmacist knows that that's a good thing for them as well as for us and certainly for the patient because once they switch it by calling the doctor's office to get the generic substitution, then everybody wins. That's something we walk a fine line on every year as we negotiate with our retailers to try to get the most out of the economics out for our clients and our shareholders, and at the same time maintain the integrity of the aligned system throughout the supply chain. So that's something we stay very heavily focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I read between the lines there, I guess is it fair to assume that in a bigger generic year there's a little bit more margin to go around there? And in a lesser generic year, there's a little less, just conceptually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, there are two things. The higher the brand inflation rate, the bigger the opportunity is to drive down brand discounts because obviously, if you had a 10% brand inflation rate, some part of that should go back to the shareholders, their shareholders, our shareholders, and to the plan sponsors as cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Same thing, to your point; if a big, big generic comes through and there are going to be a lot of players in it, and once it stabilizes and you get four, five, six manufacturers on it, then it's going to push down price. And if that drug goes down to 80%, 85%, 90% off, wherever it ends up, that obviously is going to be a big component that's going to help drive down overall generic price points</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks George, and then last one. You mentioned the Specialty Benefit Services. Maybe could you just give an example of one or two or new or different things that you're doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still 55% of all specialty drugs are going through on the medical side. Some drugs are easier to get at than others. But the idea is to &#x2013; when you have an Express Scripts card and you go and then you find out you've got a pretty severe disease, you can have &#x2013; so in a lot of our Blues plans now, our number is printed and there's a prior authorization number. As you know, when you go to the doctor they always take a picture of the front and back of your card. On the back of that card will be this number you have to call.</p>
          <p>The doctor before they start you out on like a specific MS drug, they would call that number first to get authorized, and it does two things for us. And that occurs both at the clinic level and could occur at the hospital level, depending on the severity of the disease and where you're at. It's a little tougher in the hospital. So what ends up happening is when they call that number, they get you on the right therapy at the start by prior authorizing and prior approving which therapy you're going to be on so that you're on the right drug, and just as importantly at the right cost.</p>
          <p>If that clinic direct bills the health plan and those dollars are buried inside of the codes from the hospital or the clinic, trying to decipher them and pull that out and make sure it's being done at the right price is often after the fact, and trying to get your arms around that is very difficult. So the goal here is to get all this stuff done ahead of time, similar to what we do in a pharmacy today. When you walk into a pharmacy with your card, obviously, it's all real time and electronic. That doesn't exist with many of the clinics and hospitals. So the idea is to start using those tools and leveraging them into that space to help control those costs.</p>
          <p>And by the way, once we get that prior authorization in, we now can really start looking at adherence levels because again, as you probably know, a lot of people that get diagnosed with a pretty severe disease, there's a tremendous amount of issues that go around that; the member's willingness to accept it, all the things that go into managing the family's approach to your or to the patient's situation. And so it gives us the opportunity that we see that the drug has been prior approved. And if we don't have an adjudication occur, we now have the ability to reach out to both the doctor and the patient and make sure we get that patient started on therapy. So there are a lot of health improvements that occur as well as cost reductions.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, just a couple of quick follow-up questions. If I look at 2010, it looks like 2010, it seems like your gross profit per script and your EBITDA per script basically increased sequentially throughout the four quarters of 2010. George and Jeff, if I hear you correctly, you're suggesting that in 1Q, obviously, the numbers will be a little bit lower for the reasons you stated. I'm just trying to understand as '11 unfolds here and the generic contribution ramps and the expenses decline from the 1Q levels, George, as you described, shouldn't we see that steady progression of gross profit per script or EBITDA per script throughout the four quarters of '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a hard question to answer without giving guidance on a whole bunch of metrics by a whole bunch of quarters, which I specifically don't want to do. But yes, we would expect to continue to grow the business quarter by quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The progression throughout '11 should be increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just follow up on a question on generic pricing, George, the three drug wholesalers went out of their way on their conference calls to discuss some firming in terms of generic pricing and seeing some instances of actually pretty significant price inflation on the generic side. Is that starting to show up in your results at all? Are you seeing that trend, and can that become an issue or something we need to be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Jeff said, we really worked this hard. Competition is a wonderful thing and especially when you have commodity products. Our job is if our prices go up on the generic side, then our ability to stay as competitive and drive down cost for all of our clients is at risk. And we just don't &#x2013; we haven't seen it and we're not willing. I just haven't at this point, I don't know what they're seeing. I can only tell you what we see. I think you have to push on them a little more and understand what's taking place.</p>
          <p>We think there are still an awful lot of competitors. And when you've got big, big drugs and you've got a lot of manufacturing and you have the ability to &#x2013; what does it cost to bring through another 1 million pills through that processor? The costs are usually pretty low. And so on a variable basis picking up additional volumes typically leads to an action that's taken. And we haven't seen that occur, at least not in our book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, fair enough; and maybe, Jeff, if I could just ask you one more with respect to share repurchase. Obviously, from where you were last quarter, the stock has moved up considerably in the last 90 days. I was just a little bit surprised to see that you didn't really buy back any stock in the last 90 days, and I'm just curious if there's any reason for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't comment on why or why not I'm buying back shares, obviously. But as I said earlier, it's when we have an open window. It's based on the other uses of cash that we may have in the quarter. Certainly, at the end of Q3, we made a large repayment of debt, so I think there are lots of potential reasons. I just don't want to comment specifically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Maybe I'll start out with one for George. You talked about on the specialty side biosimilars. In the President's budget, there was a proposal to change the exclusivity period back from 12 years to 7 years. As you guys think about how to plan ahead in that business, in your specialty business, for what may come to market over the next several years, do you think that the legislation we saw last year is what we're going to have to go off of? Do you feel like with folks you have in DC, et cetera, there's a bigger push to get a bit more aggressive with getting biosimilars to market? And if that were the case, what as a team do you need to do to make sure the organization is ready for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great question. One of my disappointments over the last couple of years as we were facing healthcare reform was try to get biogeneric legislation through, and the compromise was biosimilars. We lost on the seven years and ended up with 12 years. I don't know. PhRMA [Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America] is a very powerful lobbying group. It's going to be hard to get the 12 years to 7 years. We're going to fight it incredibly hard. There's probably more of a leaning towards looking for ways to save money than we've seen in a long time, as the Republicans and some of the key Democrats both understand. At least I hope they understand the deficits we're facing, and this is a key move.</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day, biosimilars isn't the answer. It's biogenerics, and we've got to move down that path. And we're still a ways away from that, but that's something that our people in Washington are very focused on. Myself, Dr. Miller, our Chief Medical Officer, and Keith, our General Counsel, we have to take the responsibility for all of our clients and for America at large to try to get this fixed because it's working in Europe. There's a tremendous opportunity to drive down costs. Once we get those tools of a biogeneric or, even to that degree, a biosimilar once it gets to market in place, then our tools become that much better, and our opportunities become that much greater. So it's clearly a focus of ours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jeff, I hate to belabor a point, but we're seeing the stock dip down as we're talking here, so I think there's a bit of confusion. As we think about the profit mix for this quarter and then the progression into Q1, there are a lot of things that go into that gross profit line, whether it's internal investments or just mix, et cetera. So as we think about the progression into Q1 and then on the earnings line, the EBIT growth that's implied I'm assuming in Q1 is north of 20%, as you typically don't buy back a lot of shares in the quarter. To distill it maybe a bit, it's too simplistic to say that if anyone is assuming we're seeing a deceleration in the business, that's probably not the case. And two, pricing as it currently stands is not a huge driver right now of your business, given the robust outlook you have on the EBIT line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the metrics are pretty straightforward and pretty simple. EBITDA was up 42% in 2010, and we're guiding it up, EPS up 26% to 30% in 2011. So obviously, we feel pretty comfortable about our core business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To that point, we're hearing an awful lot of questions and concerns about pricing, and I understand that. I understand why some of you may be concerned. But at the end of the day, and I've been saying this for &#x2013; I was CFO before I was CEO, so I guess 14 years. I think when you'll see pricing pressure is when we can't grow earnings any longer. And from my perspective, there are two ways to sell. You sell on results, which is drive down cost for your clients and give them a better offering which improves health outcomes for their patients, or you drop price because you have nothing to offer.</p>
          <p>I think this management team has always stayed incredibly disciplined, and we understand the commitment we have to make to our shareholders, the commitment we have to make to our clients and patients, and we understand that we can't sit back and rest on our laurels. We have to constantly innovate inside on our space and bring new solutions that are meeting the needs of today's problems to our clients in order to sell our services at a higher price. And not necessarily at a higher price; keep in mind what's happening here. There is inflation, generic launches and utilization trends and aging population. A lot of things are causing drug spends to go up.</p>
          <p>So the question isn't do I have to go out to my clients and ask for an increase in price. That hasn't happened since I started here. No client ever allowed me to raise their price. What happens is, is the amount of those increases in utilization trends, in changing dynamics that are occurring, which is driving up drug spend, how much does the client get to capture as a reduction to that trend line versus how much of that profit opportunity do I get to deliver to our shareholders versus how do I stabilize my patient's price. That's the dynamic that works here. And so it's how much of those increasing trends do I get to keep. And that's what we focus on and that's what we drive for.</p>
          <p>So each and every year or every three years when our clients come up for repricing, they get deeper discounts. What has happened over those three years is if you assume an 8%, 9%, 10%, pick a number of drug cost inflation, do the math. What happened to the discount that you have to be able to deliver in order to try to make sure that those numbers stay in conformity with the trends we're trying to hit, so it's a tremendously dynamic process. And again, I think if you can make your client comfortable that you're doing everything in your power and not causing disruption of the membership to manage that drug trend and at the same time improve their health outcomes, they're willing to pay for it. And that's what we see in our numbers and that's the model we offer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning, just a quick question on renewals and new business opportunities. George, you said half your book is locked for a longer period of time, so it seems to me you got maybe $7 billion or $8 billion up for renewal in 2012, which is much lower than your peers. Is that the right ballpark? And given that your renewal book is much lower, why couldn't you be a nice share gainer this year in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the guidance on the share, if we grow share this year, it will come through in the 2012 results because everything that we're bidding on is 1/1/12. So that's going to take place over the next couple of months. Clearly, our focus is to find those clients that want to do business the way we want to do business and grow our book. We are absolutely focused on growing prescriptions when it's on the right basis. So that will stay one of our key goals.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we don't give guidance to that now because it doesn't affect this year's earnings. So as the year unfolds, and it's already starting, Larry, when we look at &#x2013; it's getting a little ahead of ourselves. So we see those numbers starting; clients are already out for bids for 1/1/12, but the real lion's share of this is going to come in the spring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I meant for '12, I'm sorry. Let me get you to elaborate on something. You mentioned, typically your customers spend about 15% of their overall health spending on drug. The federal employees' program has said publicly this past year that drugs now represent 30% of their spending. Does this disclosure, I guess, give you stronger conviction that this contract structure should be changed closer to something like TPharm? And if so, when could that happen and wouldn't you see that as an opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, I really hate to talk about specific opportunities, but I do think that there is a tremendous amount. If you look at the government programs, they don't do a real strong job of managing the benefit. One of our mantras and one of the things we offer is tremendous tools, both anything from mandatory programs such as mandatory mail, mandatory generics, all the way down to educational programs to Select Choice programs. And to the extent that we find a client that wants to use our tools and we could navigate the opportunity for them and they want the cost savings, that's what we're looking for, and we'd be more than happy to take part in programs where we can do what we do best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then finally just a quick clarification on SG&amp;A. I think your message is very clear today than in the past, but maybe just elaborate a little bit on your comments when you said the staffing of your call centers and how that falls into cost of goods sold. Without having to be too specific, how do you allocate those call center and staffing costs between cost of goods sold and SG&amp;A so that we can understand that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our financials follow the form of most companies, and that is if the cost varies directly with the clients, it's going to go through cost of goods sold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>If it's more administrative functions, it's going to go through. So what ends up happening is there's an awful lot of software build-out and product build-out that has to occur as Medicare and Medicaid issue guidance and rules. A lot of those costs are going to go through infrastructure costs down in SG&amp;A. Call centers and pharmacy costs are going to go through cost of goods sold.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have some clarification questions. First of all, on the first quarter guidance, given that the focus is on EBITDA per adjusted script, and that really is the key metric, can you give us some guidance for what should we expect for that metric in the first quarter both sequentially and year over year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The simple answer, no; we're going to stay out of that game. As George said earlier, giving individual line items in given quarters just limits our ability to be nimble and react to changing conditions, so we're going to stay away from that. We've given guidance for the year, that's what we're trying to hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say changes in conditions, what are the swing factors really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Those are usually going to be business opportunities. If we have a chance to bid on a large account, and some of these bidding processes are quite expensive, we put a certain amount of money in the budget. But we don't know if it's going to be the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter when the opportunity is going to arise. So we have to be able to deploy that capital at the time it's required. The same thing happens with Medicare. Usually, there's going to be a rush in Medicare right before year end for guidance coming down. But that's not necessarily the case. Guidance can come out in August. It can come out in June. And we have to react to that, and we have to plan our affairs.</p>
          <p>Most of it's got a period of effective date so we have to decide when we're going to spend that money, when we're going to get up to speed, where is the client's need in today's environment versus the guidance that's coming out and balancing those needs for our clients to make sure we are staying &#x2013; meeting the needs of the marketplace is critically important. And we like to have that flexibility to &#x2013; obviously, we have a commitment to you to hit a number. But by the same token, we want the flexibility to meet the business needs during the year as they unfold.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so really when you think about this selling season, it seems that this selling season is heavy on these larger accounts, on large employer contracts. Historically, this is a market that you were just less penetrated than some of your peers. Now that the NextRx integration is behind you, do you think that you have better tools to service that customer base? How do you think about this opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure we're all that less penetrated. At the end of the day, we don't talk about clients. We don't sit up and tell you a list of all of our Fortune 100, Fortune 50, Fortune 500. We have a pretty good darn representation in that space, but I just don't think it's right. If you look at &#x2013; I outsource my hardware management to a firm. I don't think that firm would really like it if I was talking about them on the phone. I just don't think that's our place.</p>
          <p>So we manage, again, to try to hit our targets. We try to find the clients that are aligned with us that want to do the programs we want to do, and we go after those clients. We don't bid a lot of business because we don't believe it's lined up with us. We believe there are opportunities in the managed care space. There are going to be opportunities on the state government spot. As we talked about earlier, there are going to be opportunities in the Medicaid business. There are going to be businesses in small employer, large employer. Our job is to hit our five-year growth plans by making sure that we continue to go after the business that makes sense for our shareholders and the rest of our book of business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then lastly maybe you'll answer that one for me. You talked about the new specialty offering. When you think about your book of business, what percent of your clients represent an opportunity for this product? In other words, what percent of your clients manage their specialty benefits through you because the way I think about it, the ones that don't are like the growth opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two pieces to that question. The Specialty Pharmacy piece is well in excess of 50% of our clients are using our Specialty Pharmacy services. The piece that's not being managed is the piece that's going through the medical benefit. And that's the piece that we are focused on. And quite frankly, we're just kicking this off, so we don't have a lot. And we've got several clients that are either in pilot phase or signed up and executing today. We're rolling that out to our clients through this year, next year, and into the future.</p>
