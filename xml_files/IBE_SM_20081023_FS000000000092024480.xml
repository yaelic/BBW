          <p>[Foreign Language] Welcome to this presentation of results and as usual we get start to our President Ignacio -- to our Chairman Ignacio Sanchez Gal&#xE1;n. Questions and answers after the presentation. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you to all those joining us today through the web. And with me today I have Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, CFO and Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, Director of Operations or COO.</p>
          <p>We'll follow the same order as usual. I'll make a description of the results. I'll give you an outline of results for 2009 -- 2008 that is. Then our CFO will give us more details on the results of current financial situation. And then we'll have sort of brief conclusions at the end and then we'll have the questions-and-answers session.</p>
          <p>In first nine months of 2008 our net profit has increased to &#x20AC;2,481 million, &#x20AC;2.4 billion. In just nine months, we have surpassed our profit for the year 2007. This growth is based on a sound growth of our growth operating profit, with an increase of 29.1 over &#x20AC;5 billion. This is, thanks to the positive results and the positive contributions of all the businesses of new Iberdrola. And in this sense, I'd like to highlight ScottishPower and Iberdrola Renovables.</p>
          <p>This shows -- this approach and this business model have been appropriate based on geographic diversification and this diversification which gives a company increased value creation at a lower risk.</p>
          <p>By profiling a risk in this way, we see that given the current financial crisis, we see that it's not going to affect all our businesses, it won't affect all the businesses or all industries in the same way. So it's a good idea to be today in this business when we've done all the right work and all the right decision making.</p>
          <p>Iberdrola is not only in the right business which is stable and non-cyclic, but also have the high capacity to adapt to any environment, thanks to the flexibility and the commitment to our energy plan 2008-2010 and in recent years we have put through financial management which have been sound and careful and will also be able to pre-end our investment requirements.</p>
          <p>So the result is solid, financial position after the incorporation of Energy East to our group, so it's mean key figures. Production has -- is overhead power 106,000 gigawatt hour has 22% growth, this is thanks to the growth in the ScottishPower and the increase in production and Mexico and Iberdrola Renovables. More than half of Iberdrola's production is already taking place outside of Spain. And as the production increases investments has enabled us to ensure that 52% of our capacity is based on CO2 emission free technology.</p>
          <p>The main growth factors of our business results are accounted by ScottishPower and Iberdrola Renovables. In the first nine months of 2008 ScottishPower EBITDA is amounted to &#x20AC;1.37 billion, which is -- represents 28% contribution to the Group. So its 28% contribution of the -- to EBITDA of our Group. Let us thanks to 10% increase in the energy production and an increase in distribution and also a 10% in decrease in costs -- in current local currency that is.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to highlight the stability of revenues for this company given that the contribution -- the regulated business to the EBITDA is close to 50%. As I said earlier Iberdrola Renovable hands also an important contribution to EBITDA, which amounts to &#x20AC;768 million or 16% of the Groups operating profit. This growth is thanks to an increase in production by 83.6% and earning to 20 -- 12,000 gigawatts.</p>
          <p>And this is also thanks to introduction of a new stock capacity. Introductions of 1,400 megawatts from a regulatory point of view in the United States, the PTCs or the product tax have been pushed back to 2009, meaning that there is further support from regulatory authorities for this new technology which will enable us to reach our goals for the United States.</p>
          <p>Thanks to high diversified portfolio and introduction of our turbine -- turbines. Iberdrola Renovables has a very flexible business, which will enable us to adapt to the current financial situation while holding up our commitments to profit easily to northern than 10.</p>
          <p>In the last quarter, as you know we've introduced Energy East to our group. The DA was close in 15 months, which is since it was a very long but naturally shorter than other acquisitions due to the transaction was closed last month. But I'd like to highlight that the financial resources we acquire for the acquisition were actually provision and year -- year earlier when the financial scenario was actually far better than it is today. That was pure agreement with the company.</p>
          <p>We've also attained regulatory approval on which we are very satisfactory conditions for Iberdrola, meaning that we've also met all the requirements -- major requirements for the group, especially the positive impact on our profit per cash, per share of our peer, earnings per share. Energy East was therefore stride -- we will continue to diversify our revenues -- source of revenues and also the more regulatory stability of <mark type="indiscernible" /> days, which is also the beneficial for Iberdrola.</p>
          <p>Our margin has grown five percentage points over and above our operating expenses. So as I mentioned EBITDA of the company has strong 29.1% reaching &#x20AC;4.92 billion. Again this growth has been filled by our international business and revenue above accounting for 90% of that growth.</p>
          <p>Last we have net profit, as I said has grown by 54% reaching &#x20AC;2.5 billion in only nine months. And our operating cash flow grew to &#x20AC;3.5 billion with -- to growth of 31% vis-&#xE0;-vis in same period of last year.</p>
          <p>I would now like to take account add current years involving the tariff insufficiency in Spain. The principle which has been approved by the law. The current law acknowledges the problems of this -- with the current rates in Spain and therefore of cost of financing is lower rates. But it's a commitment, if we not meet that would be a problem for us and also for this government.</p>
          <p>On the other hand with the mismatch between this regular tariff and the real cost means that the government has decided and it's fully committed to ensure this is problem being solved before the year 2012.</p>
          <p>In addition, we hope that this would help us to improve our situation. At the same time with the dynamics of the free market is also contributing to solve this problem. As you know, in July this -- almost official rates some of 50% to the market of the entire industrial sector.</p>
          <p>The results that we are showing today are basically the consolidations up Iberdrola last business model, a diversified growing business with lower risk. Almost half of the EBITDA of Iberdrola is in regulated business.</p>
          <p>The emission <mark type="ph" /> and distribution of electricity and gas. These are predictable businesses that contribute stable long-term cash flow. 14% of EBITDA comes from our partially regulated business, such as renewable energies, as we got formicate <mark type="ph" /> defined by these important regime. And the difference -- if said some different will take the full development for energy, for production and also increase in revenues.</p>
          <p>Along side new technologies it's obvious to predict the revenues and continue to grow your cash flow, as new investments become productive. The rest of the remaining results, funding results whether that come from the regulated sector.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we've today good proportion on the margin is already closed with future contracts in future. In the UK, ScottishPower hedge its natural -- a natural hedging to lower its risk.</p>
          <p>And then for any investments conducted in recent year time increased the stability and revenues of the company rather margins. EBITDA they said 85% of EBITDA comes from countries whose credit rating is triple AAA, as United States, Spain and United Kingdom. And that's very important in considering the current finance situation, there is news and that is taking place in South America.</p>
          <p>So Iberdrola is in a very solid situation and is stable. Even while or there is -- even while there is economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Demand has reduced elasticity when -- even when GDP drops as we have seen that in Spain for example, there has been now did in demand through in the course of the last 25 years and we have actually had some different financial difficulties in this country in that period. In United States and the UK, demand has verily fallen and will it has -- it has actually been with the maximum 3%. So sensitivity is very, very low compared to any fluctuations in GDP.</p>
          <p>In addition, our energy management policy means that we've cover 70% of our production so only 30% is exposed to any variations in pool prices. In addition to our model, we also have the ability to adapt to changing environment. In this regard we are currently, actually managing our investment portfolio. This enables us to be flexible with our financial commitments and we can also delay up to &#x20AC;2 billion in investments, kind of annual basis without affecting our corporate results to the year 2010.</p>
          <p>Given the current market situation, we will use this flexibility when needed and then -- I want to stress there is a big is there, because we are still very careful in conducting our investments to make sure we can maximize -- maximize and make the most of our investment, all of that to create value for shareholders, if that was necessary. If we applied that there are still -- our forecast profits for the 2010 will be &#x20AC;3.5 billion. So we have this target given -- even given in the current market situation.</p>
          <p>Our plan -- our balance sheet is well balanced, thanks to <mark type="indiscernible" /> and its affluent work in this field means that we have a very sound balance sheet considering the current market situation. The goal here is to have A rating for the group, and the investments have already been done in the pre-handed way, avoiding the risk of attend of going to the market. For example in 2007, the operation with ScottishPower and the Energy East and also the IBO of Iberdrola Renovables, this has enable us to invest &#x20AC;30 billion in the last two-three years and while reaching at leverage level of 47% and &#x20AC;9.2 billion of liquidity of once credit available to us. Therefore Iberdrola today, it is sound and diversified group generating growing cash flow at lower risk and the business again in doing finance in a very flexible way by combining caution and minimizing financial cost while maximizing value. And now Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada will give us a result in detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mr. Chairman. Good morning. Now we're going to take a look at some of the important aspects of the income statement for the first nine months of 2008. and then we will take a more detail look at the most relevant data in our main business areas. And then we will analyze the financial situation of the Group.</p>
          <p>Net profit, as the chairman said has grown by 53.8% to reach &#x20AC;2.48 billion based on strong operational growth of 29.1% at EBITDA where international business ScottishPower Renewables in Latin America contribute 90% of that &#x20AC;1.1 billion of the increase in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Energy has not contributed at all in these results. But they are on the balance sheet, but it was start to contribute at the beginning of the fourth quarter. This is -- there is a growth in the international sector of the Company.</p>
          <p>Now, we also have the benefits from the divestments in non-core <mark type="ph" /> assets as far as the strategic plan 2008, 2010 and lower as our tax rate. If we take a look at the pro-forma income statement, look at the mark-to-market at ScottishPower we have the double-digit growth at operational level, both in terms of basic margin 13.4% and EBITDA 11.3%. And now if we excluded the exchange rate effect we will have EBITDA above 16%. This is shows the very positive evolution of the Group in operating performance.</p>
          <p>Now, if we take a look at the different parts of the balance sheet, we have a growth up to &#x20AC;17 billion. Energy in Spain, we have a 57% growth this is due to greater or higher prices increase and demand at 2% and production growing at a rate of 4.2% in the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>Now ScottishPower contributes 5.5 -- &#x20AC;5 billion, 31% of the total of the Group contributing in this nine full months compared to those five months as in the first nine months of 2007.</p>
          <p>In Renewables, we may continue to grow at 177% growth in Latin America. There is a positive effect by the growth of Tamazunchale which began its activity in June 2007 and it grew by 26.5%.</p>
          <p>Non-energy as its grew by 4.2% due to the engineering business in terms of procurement there is a growth of 76.9% reaching &#x20AC;9.96 billion with greater expense associated to fuel cost at world level. More turmoil production mixed the consolidation of ScottishPower and the production of Tamazunchale.</p>
          <p>The gross margin grew to &#x20AC;7.38 billion and international and Renewables contribute 51% of the gross margin of the Group, contributing also in a very important way to the -- to growth. This is 72% ScottishPower accounts for 25% of the gross margin of the Group with &#x20AC;1.84 billion and Renewables 15% with more than &#x20AC;1 billion in terms of this traditional business in liberated energy is 26% with &#x20AC;1.89 billion and the regulated 16% &#x20AC;1.17 billion.</p>
          <p>So can you look at the net impact of the emission rates, we have a 34.3% growth, five points above growth of the 29% of growth in gross margin. That is only it takes into account the negative effect of the allocations that consumed, which was a negative &#x20AC;455.5 billion, 196.2 billion in Spain and 259.3 billion as ScottishPower.</p>
          <p>We also have a positive effect of &#x20AC;317 billion driving from the income from the free allocated rates, which we see in under balance sheet with lower operating cost. So the net effect due to the mission rates during the period is negative &#x20AC;435.5 million compared to the figure for gross margin.</p>
          <p>Now I'll see presence say the operation net operation cost without taking into account the CO2 rates grew by 29.3% reaching to 2.2 billion, five points below basic margin in line with the efficiency policy of the cutting other positive evolution of net operational expense as due to traditional business in Spain and ScottishPower, where improve efficiency is very good.</p>
          <p>Now getting into greater detail, the net operating cost grew by 15.8%, reaching &#x20AC;1.36 billion in the period including the updates -- update due to the collective bargaining side in October 2007. Additionally, we have to bear in mind that in 2007, there was a non-recurrent revenues of &#x20AC;45 million due to the restructuring plan.</p>
          <p>Now as SpanishPower contribute 25% of the net operational expenses of the Group with &#x20AC;562.3 billion contributing these nine complete months. So growth is 36.1% due to the equation of 2007 from April and now 2008 by the end recurring terms the operating expenses fell by 10%.</p>
          <p>Renovables increase 131.4% reaching to the &#x20AC;296.4 billion due to the expansion of this activity, especially internationally and also the different perimeter of consolidation due to the inclusion of PPM and Renovables in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of Levies, this is strong write-through to the &#x20AC;301 billion due to the clawback in emissions rates cross line to 2007. Now this provision refers to both -- this within application in 2008 of Royal Decree 11-2007, which extends to the clawback of the rights deal end refers back to Royal Decree 3-2006.</p>
          <p>Now the estimates is based on the implementation of Royal Decree 3-2006. In the case of Iberdrola, most of the provisions to further rights clawback correspond to non-company plans that have not signed these rights.</p>
          <p>Now in Land, this -- there has been an appeal made up by Unesa due to these Levies. Now, ScottishPower contributes &#x20AC;20 more billion in those first nine months and activity in renew -- in business like Renovables and the increase in the IBI, kind of the &#x20AC;332.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, our consolidated EBITDA grew by 29.1% reaching &#x20AC;4.92 billion. And traditional business in energy in Spain contributed to 1.8 billion with growth of 11.3%. Now the internationalization process of the company that we have talked about was strengthened and that ScottishPower and Renovables also the main factors, responsible for the growth of group EBITDA which account for 90% of the Group. Renovables more than doubled this EBITDA reaching &#x20AC;767.9 billion or 114% more than ScottishPower &#x20AC;1.37 billion in the first exercise -- in the first period that it contributes from the very beginning. And it has making up positive contribution Latin America Group by 2.8%. Where there is tariff collection in Brazil and greater strength is our taking business in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Non-energy fell 17.8% affected by the lesser activity of the real estate business. Group -- EBIT grew by 31.5% reaching &#x20AC;3.31 billion, in line with the development registered along with EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Now the D&amp;A grew by 24.5%, reaching &#x20AC;1.6 billion. This raise is attributable to D&amp;A 27.5%, reaching &#x20AC;1.48 billion. While the D&amp;A from the acquisition ScottishPower totaled 486 billion, including 166 billion due to the price purchase allocation.</p>
          <p>Now the financial result of the Group increased by &#x20AC;139 million, reaching 759 million. Now this rise is first of all due to the increase in the debt during the period as from the tariff deviation during the period, and the most of the growth is due to lower financial income, and lower -- to derived profits. The average cost of the debt remains stable despite the debt in terms by ScottishPower and the tax equity.</p>
          <p>Now the before tax profit grew by 47.7%, reaching &#x20AC;3.19 billion. And the development of EBIT and the financial cost we have also had the non-recurring result of &#x20AC;353.6 billion, reaching 567.4 billion basically coming from the divestment. And the capital gain of 386 million obtains from the sell of 4% of our stake in Galp, this was done at the beginning of the year. We should also point out the increase of &#x20AC;23 billion in the result of the competitive results due to the participation -- due to greater participation in Gamesa.</p>
          <p>The net profit grew by 53.8%, reaching &#x20AC;2.8 billion. Now this growth is greater than the before tax rate given the lower tax rate which is around 20%. This is due to the reduction of the corporate tax rate. This is reduction in the tax rate in the Spain around 30% through deduction, exceptions coming from the different regional legislation around 28% and the tax rate in the UK which is around 28%, than the deduction due to reinvestment and the diverse method, also and non-typical revenue for the fiscal reversion in ScottishPower with a net value of &#x20AC;205 billion. And finally as you point out, the increase in net profit is also resilience to profit per share, which is a &#x20AC;0.50 per share, which is equivalent to the net profit to earnings of course over the period.</p>
          <p>Now taking a look at the by business analysis beginning with liberalized business in Spain, including generation and non-regulated gas results are, we have a 28% euro -- 28% growth to 65.5% of the 2%, from demand this is together with the 2.8% registered in the production of the ordinary regime. Thanks to standardization of nuclear station, which is 19%. And the important growth in generation through combined cycles, which grew by 58%.</p>
          <p>Now the mix, production mix in the nine months of 2007 and the increase in the production and nuclear have been partially offset by reduction by 38% in hydraulic and 63% in thermal production.</p>
          <p>The average cost of thermal, conventional thermal fuel grew by &#x20AC;51.6 per megawatt hour, &#x20AC;14.6 which is above the 2007. Also CO2 prices grows from 1.4 to &#x20AC;23 per ton and this rise in the fuel, the system is the reflection of the rise in the cost of fuel, as well as the rise in the cost of CO2 emission. That increase in the gross margin of the regulated business in Spain of 20 -- 16% to &#x20AC;1.169 billion is due to the growth in the revenue -- cost of generation. And the strong activity in the commercial activity, which is greater than the rise in the cost of procurement, and the change in the mix of production, and the rise in cost of fuel.</p>
          <p>The operational -- net operational cost increased by 15.2%, following the efficiency of the group and this increase is much -- a little bit below the gross margin. This is system of the increased pressure activity <mark type="ph" /> and the layers. As a results of all of this, EBITDA for the liberalized business has been grew by 16.3%, reaching &#x20AC;1.69 billion affected by -- and were also affected by the drawback in CO2 rates. And our gross margin and regulated grew by 5.7% to &#x20AC;1.17 billion. This is result of the positive effect of the increase of the contribution of regulated activities.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew by 7.9% improving by from 3.6 that was growth in -- up to June. That is positive evolution of EBITDA is a result also of the important improvement and due to development of -- our net operational costs were grew once again by below gross margin. Now with the greater efficiency and efficiently compensate the impact from September 2007 due to the atypical revenue that we already talked about.</p>
          <p>And external services also have significant fall by 4%, and so the evolution of this is EBITDA has always been above our gross margin and better than the initial forecast made and this is really the development throughout entire period.</p>
          <p>Now the result of Renovables. We have an increase of 70% of the installed power and with the increase of power of -- the increase in the average price is 10.9% and the production has reached 83.3. With a greater production and a higher prices in gross margin of the business grew by a 119%. The operational costs grew by 131% due to the expansion costs and at the international level that contributed 100% to sales. Also the change in the consultation period with a new business, which account for 42% of the operational cost.</p>
          <p>EBITDA as a result of all of this grew by 113.7% reaching &#x20AC;767.9 billion where the contribution of international business is more than 14% of that figure. Now the contribution of ScottishPower to the new Group in terms of gross margin is 1.27 billion and basic margin -- and this contribution now is up to more &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBITDA the contribution of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, which is almost 28% of the Group EBITDA despite the fact that the impact of the exchange rate has taken away more than &#x20AC;200 million to the EBITDA of ScottishPower in into euro terms and mark-to-market is a positive and reached &#x20AC;166 billion.</p>
          <p>EBITDA excluding in mark-to-market reached &#x20AC;1.2 billion of which 368 million are from the Wholesale &amp; Retail, 556 to the Networks business and rest comes from the Gas business in Canada and the new Corporations.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Latin America grew by 3.8% reaching &#x20AC;672 billion in local currencies, this growth would have been 7.9%. And a good behavior of the business in Mexico was offset by the negative effect of the exchange rate coming from the depreciation of the dollar, but Brazil growth was more maverick, so it was positively effected by the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>We have growth of 4.4% in operating cost due to the Tamazunchale plant. Now by region EBITDA in South America reached &#x20AC;389 million with a growth of 2.7%, coming basically from the increase of 5.6% in demand despite the lower contribution of the distributors affecting especially <mark type="indiscernible" /> in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of Mexico, EBITDA reach &#x20AC;284 million growing by 5.4%. The positive effect of the greater production and contribution of Tamazunchale has compensated the negative impact due to the exchange rate, which was around 14%.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Non-Energy and Engineering grew by -- with a negative 70.8% to &#x20AC;190 billion. The lower real estate activity is a result for this fall. In generic, we've then made a small -- big contribution and is in contrast to the first semester. Real estate reached EBITDA of almost &#x20AC;78 million and net profit of 40, despite a worse market situation than expected that the very quickly how we're turning these market conditions and this has allowed them to continue to provide results which are very good in light of the current situation.</p>
          <p>Now engineering and construction continues to grow by 31% in terms of gross margin and EBITDA, well the growth is 2.2% improving this fall of 1.2% in the first trimester. In the third quarter, there was a continued recuperation which will continue throughout the fourth quarter in other perspectives, over the middle term further business are also very positive. The pipeline is close to &#x20AC;2.6 billion and continues to grow in relative way to international scene.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to finance we'll begin our analysis, when the financial situation of the group showing a detail of the balance sheet of Iberdrola. Now Iberdrola estimated tariff insufficiency of &#x20AC;1.3 billion at the end of the first half of the year. In July, we received the funds from the tariff &#x20AC;450 million. Now today the tariff insufficiency is at &#x20AC;1.9 billion which is taken <mark type="ph" /> by the first day and therefore is very solid.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet of the company continues to be very strong after the purchase of Energy East. The equity in September was &#x20AC;29.7 billion and this was greater than &#x20AC;28 billion in net debt. The leverage therefore including the debt is at 49% excluding the impact of the tariff insufficiency which undoubtedly will be liquid. The leverage is at 47.2% improving from 47.6% out from back in 2007.</p>
          <p>Now the rest of solvency ratios which we calculated also continuing the financial impact of the acquisition of Energy East put on the balance sheet and this in April improved significantly put in the calculation of tariff insufficiency or excluded and it's very much above the ratios required by the rating agencies for our rating level. We are reaching almost 20% ratios. Now the hedge also increased to almost five times and the cash flow over is almost -- is above 15%.</p>
          <p>And now in terms of <mark type="indiscernible" /> sources of financing, we can see that we have a tremulous diversification in market, loans borrowings IOUs and so forth and for each one of this different markets we also have a very high degree of diversification, geographical diversification both in Euro Bond and USPP be. Now this positioning allows us to balance the risk having the diverse financial markets right now. We are finishing the documentation for the American market use the 144A form. And in terms of the restructured foreign <mark type="ph" /> currencies including Energy East, which I point out that we have the percentage of that in the currencies to minimize movements inflow which due to the fluctuation of exchange rate and reduced the risk exchange rate risk according -- end of bottom line, in this position includes a very steadily following profitability criteria. And of course with the minimizing risk of the other companies, important to remember, and the currency risk has been assumed to mitigate, the financing or the risk of the international business at -- in local currency. In terms of these debt structure by interest rate to minimize our down nature, the greater percentage that fixed rate 66% only in 33% is at a variable rate in terms of the -- that due -- the average is 5.8 years improving from the five years in September 2007. After having a corporate Energy East and having carried out operations for more than &#x20AC;3 billion during the first nine months of this year. We should also point out that we do not have a high concentration of debt due this year given the structure, which is quite balanced and low risk maturity. We should also point out our position of liquidity as we can see continues to be very good after the closing of the Energy East, we in the first nine months of 2008 we have more than &#x20AC;9.2 billion of liquidity available and cash flow and cash 6.5 billion of these are at more than 24 months. This year we're also going to have an operational cash flow above 5 billion to give us a very solid financial position to face the economic crisis with great strength.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much. I am going to -- the Chairman now will conclude the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>To bring this presentation to close, I would like to highlight that the results were presenting today as my CFO has just mentioned, showed our Group, our further Group is not only shown in the growth in the net profit, but the fact that all our businesses are in fact contributing positively to our results.</p>
          <p>Even our real estate division which even not today start-up our real estate, profit in real estate is quite significant. I would like to highlight once again the growth in our additional business, particularly in the UK and even in the Minneapolis with only couple of months left to close this fiscal year, we can say that the growth in earnings per shares will be greater than 27%. And in dividend per share will also grow in line with that growth. So it could be &#x20AC;0.35 per share. So there will be a 27% growth over above last year</p>
          <p>So this is also show again that our model -- our business model and our growth and low risks becomes very attractive considering today's financial crisis. And not all businesses not all the -- and not all companies in the same industries are showing the same growth. On the other hand our business is developing in a very stable manner even in down turning economy. In recent years, Iberdrola has shown important growth followed by an increase in its geographical diversification business in markets. All that through by improving -- while improving our efficiency and having a leverage below 50% despite our investments, which extended the average life of the debt and which in fact 50% is at fixed interest rate.</p>
          <p>We've positioned ourselves in countries with AAA rating. We have predictable regulation that can be assessed and to expand <mark type="ph" /> and requires heavy investments in infrastructures and which we are also willing to motivate through adequate remuneration. We have steady cash flow and a balanced portfolio.</p>
          <p>In regulated or semi-regulated businesses amounted to 50% of our total. And we also have the regulated businesses where Iberdrola has a production structure based on clean energy. In addition due to the next years 70% of this production is already sold and are covered or hedged prices.</p>
          <p>In addition, Iberdrola have a very good track record of presumption, execution, and delivery of objectives. And we have adequate flexibility to add debt to the business scenario and adopt our investors of up to &#x20AC;2 billion without affecting our goals to the year 2010 of attainting those high records and profits.</p>
          <p>And now we are opening the round of questions and answers. Questions in the room first. I think there is question over here, <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Three questions. Could you give us details on those sales -- forward sales not only in Spain but also a breakdown on prices that you have managed for the 70% as you mentioned and also details please for Scottish Power? Second question is on the regulatory framework in Spain, can you tell us what a current situation is as it appears that the Government has called a meeting with the channels, on <mark type="indiscernible" /> 30th of October and in theory and as you mentioned well they are talking about is to remove that current short back or through <mark type="ph" /> fall to the year 2012, by 2012? And the third question is the flexibility of &#x20AC;2 billion per annum. A flexibility of investments, can you give us a breakdown on what criteria or what really did you -- to do there, with I guess, we are talking about cost of debt or difficultly to find took -- really to place debt in act and in adequate currency. Can you give us an idea what would lead you to lay an investments. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well perhaps concerning prices, <mark type="indiscernible" />, could you answer the question on behalf of Scottish Power and perhaps you can answer for Spain vis-&#xE0;-vis regulation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, it is public and we are not the secondary state for energy and ministry have also said repeatedly that their goal is to ensure that this tariff shortfall being through another way by the end of first half. They said in parliament. They've announced it everywhere. Now how they going to go about it, I think they have mentioned that too. All our work is to be done, obviously prices. Prices need to adjust to end customers. They have to be adjusted to reality to -- I think before you take you through first step, which is to remove the official rates to industrial customers. These official rates were levels of 50 years I think. And now the prices, which have been said, which we selling to those rates, correct me back if I am wrong. I think the prices are at around 80. And I think -- well there is price of <mark type="indiscernible" />, yes. Because everything is okay. Those are the prices which are market prices. That's what the market is charging. And I think we are doing basically adopting to real prices. So I think one say is to gradually remove all these official prices remove them in return them into real market prices, which is the case for so these regulated markets. Some exception, of course, and some models which are being introduced now. We have the official rate and tariff that will publish in June for lower income people. They would have a special rate, special tariff and with some sort of adjustment for also the case where there is very low consumption. For example for consumption of very low -- very low consumption, which you happy to take a lot of people where the consumption is actually very low. Third, about state budget will be in charge -- we'll take charges some of the items on the budget. For example, the tariff takes -- when you take -- when you saw an electricity and obviously that has nothing to do with electricity in fact. We have a rate about 30% as a VAT effect, for example, which is 16%. And then you have the different autonomous regions, taxes in municipal taxes, financing, electricity in the -- obviously that I will answer <mark type="ph" />. And historically all these taxes its I mean have been built in and I think its time to introduced that into right budget, into right in the budget. And also some of the issues that we are looking at, we need to solve and reduce the impact of some -- in the cases are consumers where -- so that -- forecast maybe affected. We need to look at a way, where we can minimize or contribute the impact on this Group. And all this being done in such a way that this can be done with growth in prices, in tariffs officially along their Renovables and of course gradually, but everything in the right place looking into looking to different cost. And I think government has also mentioned that its something we need to solve. Government, customers and suppliers that's fair much situation we're in right now as far as if team due to the investment. Looks like we can say that Iberdrola is a flexible company and it would ahead of issues -- of upcoming issues hopefully from where we are and I was just talking about last year, when we presented our strategic plan and the discussion we had on petrol prices. If you remember some of you criticize the same, being said in my presentation that oil was high and I was criticize for that. And that insight was right in the year 2008. Prices were far higher than we had in our strategic plan. The <mark type="indiscernible" /> the prices toward the end of the year. The prices, I mean, if I don't remember right, we have 68 and we have 66 point something. The strategic plan for next year, we have 63 and for the following year we have 51. So, I think, prices will be higher, in fact this is my personal view. But that's a little bit how things work in this company when we put -- we to make compatible news. So flexibility, that's what we want to do. We can't ignore current market scenario, current market situation, waiting for developing. And it's very different to what it used to be and so financing cost would be higher and just slightly. Some of them could be fix rates. And what we are going to do is basically demand higher returns from our investments, that's it. We're not going to remove here and over there. This can be internal competition, and we are going to look at those investments that gives a higher returns. In addition, like I would say that on long investments that in theory, are potentially can be affected. Does not that, that's say, but we would have maturity period, in those cases with those banks to -- lot of them will be in 2008, 2010. So any investments that we carry out, will normally takes years, especially when we're talking about those -- some of those plans that we are building in Spain, I think the first will start contributing in 2012, 2013. So as the end up, coming into production in 2014, this is not such a big issue. But you can somehow lower our investments for that period, if we feel those necessary. So again we're looking at investments that will not have an impact on our -- on our results for that period, going to be is flexible, if you are more demanding on return of gross. So return of at about gross. We are going to continue to grow as far as stock capacity goes, but we don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we are not looking carefully into kind of -- in the world. So we need to adapt to that. So -- and we need to do it and we will if it has to be. So that's the message I want to send on, but this will not a key, it does not going to affect our goal of obtaining 3.5 billion profits in the year 2010. As far prices of petrol, and Keith perhaps can you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick. Sorry, let me say Nick. Yes the range of sales that we have is quiet broad, so to focus on prices is quite complicated, because from the sales have been already hedged you know in that product. So to give you just a number is very complicated. But I can say if you just took a snapshot right now of our portfolio, I say the clean margins, which I -- the figure I am giving you of around 68, &#x20AC;69per megawatt, which is very consistent with these figures that I see, if I was giving out for the average, prices retaining for next year. If I remember profit is at 55. So it's very consistent to IT set vis-&#xE0;-vis 2009. Nick, as you know, he is a new Director of Scottish Power, the new CFO and my logic is he need to address this result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may -- I will try in English it's not Scottish, so that's okay. Sales in volume in terms held up well, the numbers are in the book. We've had a successful consumer retail price increase in September, and I expect that was hold through 2008 in terms of sales volume with regard to our customers. The numbers -- control growth which is in line with our strategy, the quality as the customer both in terms of margin over volume, and clearly -- and increasingly the cash contribution made by the customer and their credit profile. So forward sales have been good in that way and costs are fully hedged for 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to comment on -- as you add next comment. I just remind you that retail and wholesale business in managed in as a one, so whole business. The ScottishPower is quite balanced vis-&#xE0;-vis production and sale, retail production and retail sales. In 2008, we don't expect any additional changes in tariffs to prices, no major changes either in the average cost of input -- in the input cost. So it's very well hedged and I covered as I showed in that slide is of course of this presentation.</p>

          <p>Good morning. The first question for conference call is from Alberto Gandolfi from UBS.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alberto Gandolfi. I have three questions. The first, can you comment on what do you think on the growth of demand or change in demand for electricity with the GDP for Spain and England <mark type="ph" /> was quite different. Very different from what you have in your business plan and your strategic business plan and how would that impact your prices on generation in Spain? Second question on UK, when do you expect this scenario of commodity price is remain the same, what do you expect to lower the tariff and what are your synergies in that regard? Lastly, could you comment on what do you expect and just say will evolve for your debt in 2009? Thank you very much.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alberto, I believe that the interest rate considering credit spreads right now, to be go up. We'll have -- a lot of that finance already deposited <mark type="ph" /> nine and 5%, I think it's the rate. So my guess is that it will be 5.5, 6%. Let's see if interest rates go down, that will be good for us and I expect it will be 5.5, 6%. Concerning demand and demand trend, while in the Spain we are growing at available rate and GDP is growing, in some areas its negative growth in fact for this quarter. Demand growth in the first nine months is around 2%. So again we are growing over and above GDP. Our focus are in the plan, I was just asking some of the competitors remind me, our forecast is pretty much 120% of growth in demand in Spain. As the prices -- I think prices are far more sensitive to wind factor, hydro factor than to demand. Today -- yesterday in fact there is a very high wind factor and rain factor, so we dropped from 70 to 60. So, right now the element of fuel in prices is very much related to the element that generally production indicate the renewables, indicate the renewable that as planned to what demand is like. I think the average for the year is around 70, just over 70 in recent months. And then one day you get good wind and it dropped down to 55, because we've good effectiveness. And for the water factor, the hydro factor, good rain nor a present <mark type="ph" />. In UK the lower prices, I think oil prices just went down in today's day. So this is not necessarily just it don't take place on America, but perhaps Luis can give us more details on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say something about prices and also let me say something about ScottishPower's customer profile and its exposure to changes in the economy. In fact let me take that point first. The sort of exposure that we are seeing in regard to the downturn in the economy and demand we will -- we expect to see primarily reflected in the industrial and commercial demand, okay, and you will see in the UK press a lot of stories about manufacturing going to shorter week. ScottishPower is a company, is not so exposed to lot of competitors, to large industrial and commercial. Over the years, we have refined our portfolio. We principally concentrate in the smaller end of the industrial and commercial market and in the residential. So we are not see -- we are not expecting that to hit us in the same way. So that's the first thing I would say about GDP and demand. So far as prices in the UK are concerned I think there has been lot in the UK press about this. Let me cover power first. The system in the UK for power is extremely tight. And this assumption that there will be a reduction in power prices because there has been a reduction in commodity costs, I think, is completely misleading. As I explained the wholesale system in the UK is tight, there's a lot of issues with plant outages and I think that will carry on across the winter. And so therefore I think it is misleading to expect a reduction in power process based on that factor alone. In terms of the -- in terms of gas, yes, of course, there has been a reduction in wholesale gas costs and it's driven obviously by the linkage to crude oil. Commodities, our commodities, at the moment they are a lot softer in the energy economy, the energy commodities can go both ways. We don't know how the winter in the UK is going to play out, how tight the system will become in that. We don't know what the reaction of some of those countries on whom the UK now increasingly depends for imports, for example Norway. In the UK, all the suppliers of gas buy their gas forward, so that they are able to hedge their customers from the worst exposure to the wholesale market. And all those suppliers have bought forward and that portfolio has still to work through. So there are two things that I would say about. That is the first factor. The second factor is, of course, we would have to see a sustained period of wholesale gas costs where they are at the moment for that to be a reality. Of course, the UK press want to see a reduction in these costs. But I think also the UK press well understand the way in which costing and pricing is structured in the UK and in fact we pursue a mechanism that actually protects to our customers. But that has to work its way through. And we also have to see a sustained period of lower wholesale cost. Okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a few questions. First, for the CEO concerning the prospectus for 2009, in generation and in Spain where prices in there market -- in the forward market are starting to reflect the fall in the oil prices right now were at 57. So I just want your opinion on how generation will go for next year in terms of volumes and prices. And ScottishPower, they talked about the possible what could happen to prices, so we will leave that question. Now talking about the evolution in Spain, although some comments have been made about the effort of the contribution of electric companies to solve the tariff deficit. I wanted to ask you if this contribution will be done through a price contracts. And if you expect this contribution to be above the windfall tax that right now is effecting the sector at a rate of &#x20AC;1.2 billion? And also related to regulation do you think that the last reserve tariffs that the company seems that it will introduce in January of next year, if you expect this to resolve the -- this issue. And finally, although you have talked about the net profits this year versus you talked about at the beginning of this year of your objective of 7 billion in EBITDA and energy is -- has consulted later than we have. Do you still -- are you still holding to that figure? And do you think that your -- that EBIT figure is protected or have the change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Maybe you could talk about regulation the prospectus of production for next year. We'll start with that part of your question. Well, once again it is true that the forward prices are decreasing right now. They are just above 60 that's the last news that I have at least and in terms of perspectives of power generation. Well that will be depend as the Chairman said on hydraulic and in wind power renewables in short. But in our budget, we are looking at prices just below those of this year around 60, &#x20AC;65 per megawatt-hour. And in terms of regulation, I wouldn't talk about that excludes any customers. What we are assessing now and what the Chairman referred to was that there are certain consumers who are last -- energy consumers who are at the base and have a capacity -- a important capacity to collaborate in the operation of this system and we have to assess all these issues when we establish our price. Now, this price will also depend on whether its long -- short, medium or long-term and all these things have not been negotiated yet. Regarding efforts for such situations overall the Royal Decree on the windfall tax. Once again, nothing has been negotiated with the government and my hope is that not only the effects of this Royal Decree, but also other types of regulatory intervention, that have decreased the revenues in the sector are focusing on getting this agreement or this commitment to end this capacity during this political period. I don't expect any additional cuts in the electrical area, but valued just the opposite. Now in terms of the last resource tariff could not be additive, well I can't review anything, but my understanding is that there are solutions that are comparable with the establishment of a last resource additive tariff -- absolutely additive and that will lower the incentive too to resource to this or encouraging contracts with the commercial agents. And this within a major trademark agreement to eliminate this tariff deficit. I think there are ways to comparablize these issues. Pedro, can you talk about EBITDA place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue to work with -- 7 billion there is an impact of &#x20AC;200 million, because we have one quarter less and energy each and if the pound continues at these levels at the end of the year, we'll have more than &#x20AC;200 million impact into -- with exchange rate in ScottishPower, so we are talking about &#x20AC;400 million in EBITDA. Well, the dollar is rising we continue to working on this, but we have big target in mind that we have &#x20AC;400 million impact in compare to the figure, we did give at the beginning of the year.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. I have three questions. Begin with the UK following what was mentioned before if there is a loud noise in the UK about pressure for the utilities to lower their prices. There is also been talk about our contribution to an energy fund. Could you talk about your view, and if that's going to have an impact even though this may not lead to fall in retail prices in nuclear power in Spain the government has mentioned its going to continue to where are wear out the useful life of the nuclear power plants. Is this a positive, can we interpret this in a positive way in terms of useful life of the Catalonia <mark type="ph" /> plant and we also saw in Belgium proposals for taxes on nuclear plants. With this I -- is a way -- is this way to compensate for the added value of extension of the useful life of Catalonia and was putting tax on the nuclear plants. And the third question this flexibility in CapEx which you talked about, 2 billion would that include investment in Energy East or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. In response to the third one Energy East is company of the Group just say Iberdrola Engineering and Instruction <mark type="ph" /> or ScottishPower any other companies that it of course includes all of the Group at the general level. I also have to give new news about Energy East. There is -- there are interconnections that we are planning between Main and Canada that have modified reservation and have increased by 20% to provide incentive for this construction. So it's the comment we just made about the countries that we're working in and that need investment and the large investments have improved their infrastructures. And their first example we have right there to the retribution and the incentive for construction has increased dramatically for the construction of this interconnection. And this is going to be the general criteria. We will select those investments, which here within the Group are most attractive to us. Now these investments are the most attractive, we'll prioritize these in those countries and those markets or regions where -- we have -- where they are the most attractive. In terms of the nuclear, well we understand that we are working in this framework, making the adjustments in investments, so that the power plants continue to operate all the time that they are allowed to operate. And I've said this in several times. We've not just made people much workable than myself. Spain cannot give up its very safe power plants that are very well prepared to continue in operation. We have outside dependence of 85%. We're talking about power plants and this is also considered by the nuclear accounts. So we are making the investments needed. Within a scenario that these power plants can continue operating very safely which is the case of the -- the Spanish nuclear plants are absolutely safe with reliability indexes which are above practically all those outstanding <mark type="ph" /> countries and there is no reason for its not to continue as such. Now with respect to taxes I think that the model has been followed. And I think probably there is not -- is not looking at that possibility, but there are -- system is based on market criteria. Just there comment on this. The government can de-tax little bit once, but to put a tax on nuclear, the nuclear power plant in Garo&#xF1;a, as a compensation to for the extension of <mark type="indiscernible" /> in my opinion. There will be a similar too, very negative single tool in the market. I think that have a firm <mark type="ph" /> with the investment. And that implies our nuclear power plant is one of the most profitable investments that can be made in this sector. And this is investments -- they were made for the past 20 years and if you go against this idea by taxing then the rest of this essentially -- the nuclear power plants would had no incentive to invest as we are being asked to do. I think that in this environment now the keyword is investment. Any barriers to investment we do -- just wouldn't make sense. I was trying to be very clear, very transparent. So I believe that right now what we have -- is the request in other countries to invest more, to improve infrastructures and to move the industrial -- and I covered fabric <mark type="ph" /> of the country.</p>
          <p>Now the energy sector in our country if there are barriers to investment they will go somewhere else whether or not, no barriers. It's that simple. Now with respect to the UK, could you answer that question please?</p>

          <p>I presume the fund that is being referred to is the agreement between the six energy companies and the government for the increase in carbon efficiency reduction target measures, then a third which is a billion English pounds over three years. It's an increasable program that's already running and answer of the question these are costs we will have to be recovered now, it expect that all the supplies in the UK have the same thing, that they need to recover their costs and this will be part of the equation that is -- is worked out in any analysis of potential price reductions.</p>

          <p>Thanks again. Two questions for Mr. S&#xE1;inz Armada. I want to ask you question about the excess tariffs, where we have that tariff deficit of -- on those excess tariffs. I want to ask whether as you said because more globalize then we have fewer regulated tariff, it will be easy to raise excess tariffs? And the second question is, about whether in Spain we have engaging situations for -- to increase the impression of the forward market. What percentage of energy that to be produced in 2009 in Spain is already sold, is already -- resulting in better part the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first question first. The tariff deficit is regulated and is included in the regulated revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is at a 135 and the excess charges in that reason, the tariff deficits is included as our lower regulated cost for non-hedge regulated cost within the excess tariff. If at the end, we do achieve to end of this tariff deficits. As the government has stated with in this legislative period then we'll have no longer have the deficits. So, the excess tariff is although is to cover the total of the regulated price, and we'll have an elevation of the excess tariff. And this excess tariff just like the energy will continue the trends set by the prices of commodities and the infrastructures. Regarding the level of the hedge that we have right now, first of all there is very special term abilities, two months for the negotiating many of the supply contracts with -- in industries. And these are year contracts, so we have to bear in mind, or remind this is going to come up in the next two months. We have closed or contracted with close prices, approximately one-third of the energy that we are going to produce next year. Our hope for next year is to reach a level of sales to final customer of 50% of our production. Impart of this additional production or these additional sales will done over the next two months. Bear in mind that only is forward market, but also we have market like Armada said where we have tenders, or auctions. So our expectations is that are pushing for next year around, possibly 60, 65 or even 70% of the production to be closed in our forward markets. 50% to final customers in the rest two, there are other markets that we choose, talk about over the next few weeks, or the very first weeks of 2009 to have that -- before the closing settles.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Three questions. The first in terms of tariff deficit as the Chairman talks about. This is the responsibility of the CNE, the regulator. We tried to regroup all deficits for the companies. I just wanted to know, if -- we into the first quarter of next year if -- difference you know what is the deadline by which the government has to take a decision on this, provide income money to the companies. And this has to do with CapEx. There is 2 billion <mark type="indiscernible" /> after 2010, does that reform well to the renewable, or to the capacity and other business, because those types of businesses might have a more committed CapEx in terms of regulations and in generations plans and so forth? And my last question for Pepe in terms of the credit, unused to credit lines, can you give us some information, if you have a renewable of those credit lines? Is that automatic? Or where this is estimate in terms of this growth in this lines of credit. Now, with regard to the tariff deficit, I think that the security services, of course, have been later all this securities for all of the deficit in 2001 and part of the deficit for 2008, and the last option which was just -- it wasn't capacity week for those -- that type of product. Also I should mention that the -- generated pricing deficit, we got AAA rating from the government. So this is a very solid product and under normal market condition, this has always been an attractive asset. Also the Spanish Government decided to inject liquidity in the financial system, specifically to acquire very solid prices in with AAA rating that's what it is. I don't think we have to securitize these, I think this will be than just as was in the past. This year we did securitize an important part of 2008 that correspond to 2007. Now in terms of CapEx all we publish in the Group and clearly, you have mentioned that if the IF <mark type="ph" /> was -- did come to within, because the regulate -- and regulate in Spain and outside as Spain, the subject would be exclusively, if its one of competition between potential investment the loss of attractive potential investment. I think its magic that we need to adapt. If demand growth of the certain rate and we need to adapt to that increase in demand. There are plans that we could have up and running or they've been doing this plan. But it is dynamic it could be postponed and there are others that are under construction and we could tell you this speed to the respected demand. And in terms of new plans, new -- in terms of Renewables and that Renewables we just look at the criteria for greater -- look at the greatest, which are normally case of enough <mark type="ph" />. We have projects where the sensitivity of the regulators or the different state is such that rather than placing barriers or restrictions on investments they are going to provide incentives for that infrastructure. We will be happy to carry out -- this will probably serve our criteria and I think that this is going to happened. I can see that in the countries where we are working for our needs for growing it for investment. And in the different states, in the different regulators there will be incentives. I don't need to slowdown, but rather to speed up this type of construction. I've repeat once again that Iberdrola, it is flexible. And so if we need given the demands of the market we could inject up to 2 billion in our annual investments selected to -- selected up on criteria of return, if the net return for 2010 of 2.5 billion is not affected. So it is the criteria our profitability and we just prioritized and look at the most attractive investments. Now, in terms of the lines, I should mentioned that all of the lines that we have, our committed lines to banks, all committed to these lines to supply is capitalized until the maturity. Of those lines, the first major maturity is December 2009 and it was in 14 months. So, we're very comfortable in that sense. I should also mentioned that since we're company that makes just ahead of private at the end of this year, and the beginning of 2009 were renegotiate credit lines that will be for the further following, there are two things a year ahead of time to give ourselves, all these margins for liquidity. I should also mention that although we didn't mentioned this in the presentation, we have many banks, which I have mentioned that they are willing and open to this renegotiation. This renegotiation I am sure that recent agreement. I think this spreads were little bit expensive and there might figure that achieve, but I am sure that will reach at kind of middle ground, with the banks for reasonable price given the market separate sectors.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just a question regarding Union Fenosa Gas Company, I wanted to know what is the position of the -- considering possible competition problems that could arise with the -- from the purchase of Fenosa and if you think it is competition problems, should way to divestment and watch if that is the case, what assets would be sold on?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've said publicly. We are very respectful with any business decision taken. Companies are free to decide their future. So we don't have any comment there. And now in terms of competition, we're saying is that we have to be consistent with what has been regarding the transactions in this country over the past several years. So this will be putting on the table. If the reasonable issue or thing is to have someone control, 70% of the market has considered, but that will be valid for the future for any other transaction. That hasn't been the situation. So that's kind of our position. So we just repeat that this is something, the way we expect is a, our free decision taking by two companies. And we took the seven decisions and we think this is a very good idea and will make the <mark type="indiscernible" /> to defend the interest of our shareholders, as simple as that.</p>

          <p>Now we have the questions from the web. We have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to make one more comment about Raimundos question, there is 7 billion. We are not reducing 7 billion minus for 100 million. But we are working to reach that 7 billion. But we have to bear in mind that in the work that we are doing, there are 400 million that we weren't counting and so the objective continuous to be to try to reach those 7 billion. But the only thing that I did mentioned right now there are certain factors that we didn't count on at the beginning of the year. In another words the consolidation of once -- the quarter later of Energy East and the devaluation of the plant, which has been hedged as we mentioned before. So therefore we are now downgrading the seven billion to 6.5 billion. Our objective continues to be those seven billion. But just simply wanted to make it clear that there are certain elements that we are trying to offset by improving our operational business. Let's go to the web question now we have John Underday <mark type="ph" />, Chris More from the <mark type="indiscernible" />. Some of these questions have already been answered in terms of Union Fenosa and Gas Naturale. And the first question is from Alexandro <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the volatile situation in markets in terms of commodities and interest this could change your strategic planning in terms of investment growth and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking in account both of -- I probably reiterate into account. I think we already answered that. We if you look at energy prices or the commodities we have in our plan and the business plan that I already mentioned. I think Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro was quite right from this conservative point of view. The price we have is actually lower to the price of oil to wanted have the net with higher. But right now plans that we have I will lower in our strategic plan and our investment also we still -- we still have our plan where it was but we're being flexible looking at how markets evolve to adapt our investments accordingly to market environment that is different to what it was a year ago. And if we can just say we could lower investment by &#x20AC;2 billion and that would not affect our outcome for the year 2010. That is the expected profit for that period. To Alexandro, I think in account of volume of debt <mark type="ph" />, if you are going to speed up in deficits and also here your stake, the government <mark type="ph" /> have to pay another, BP that was. I think our level -- our leveraging level is very reasonable, its 47%. It's quite reasonable, I believe. The level of liquidity and the availability -- cash availability that we have, as stated by our CFO is good enough to meet our commitments. Our cash flow is growing five to six billion per annum. So that add a flexibility to be able to do these things and the divestitures will take place. Maybe with this regard, we might -- others <mark type="ph" /> when we deem appropriate. This year we conducted some divestments and this is not something that will limit our operations. And as I said giving our good liquidity and our good cash position and the cash flow that we are achieving, we can very easily conduct the investments that we want to do with the added flexibility. That is if the market scenario changes or the return on investments are not where expected, we can lower those investments by two billion without that affecting our 2010 goal. <mark type="indiscernible" /> from Dresdner has two questions related to market of the Spain and the UK. One -- the trend of the spreads I mean for both Spain and UK in 2009 and also the reserves margins for Spain and the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On spreads in the year 2009, it's difficult I can give you some information that we have to in the year 2008 and for the combined cycles considering the average price that we've had in the some of markets that we operates in the cost of provisioning and without taking to account the guarantee of powers about &#x20AC;11 megawatt-hour, coal very much of the few you mine perhaps slightly higher. In the UK, we have done calculations considering the average price of added sales in wholesale market and the average price of fuel, particularly gas also gas prices and I guess as it spread always in the same line Spain about the &#x20AC;11 megawatt-hour for cycles and &#x20AC;13 megawatt-hours for coal. And by 2009, I'm afraid its difficult to give you the forecast, but I expect them to be pretty much along the same inline. On the reserve margin for Spain and UK, this margin is the term that depends on the plants that we have the guarantee what is the high drove factor, what is wind factor, what is production needs plants and in 2008, for example, the winter we had a moment where in Spain, we're a 100% our plants were generating. So I think Iberdrola margin, average could be 50% more or less. And for the UK, I think Nick <mark type="ph" /> mentioned this already that the reserve margin is somewhat lower, perhaps you want to comment Nick. Do you have any comment to make?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The comments I made earlier that the system is tight and largely driven by the number of plant outages in the age of lot other plant in the UK. And we expect it to remain tight across the winter.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From the three securities, the interest rates are for enormous period and can we have can you elaborate perhaps on interest rate being stable. And given you use all the lines credit, also 33% on debt is very well. How that the fact an increase as 200 basis points, if this go up by 200 basis points, how will that effect 30% fix -- sorry variable that they have? And one of the financial terms for your credit lines and you have not withdrawn yet taking into account interest rates and what have you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While the credit lines I would not use are variable. That's variable three as for six months in the spread of credits active spread. The prominent now is the market discussion right now the year vis-&#xE0;-vis this 375 <mark type="indiscernible" /> and for a year, the Europe is set now at five. We think this is just circumstantial. I think we have to be careful here, because the market is behind the walls We've to be very careful in the planning. And so now, I think short-term rates, I think we're talking about 5% plus or minus, which are very much consistent with the levels that we have and our financial costs, our interest rates have been charged 5.1. The refinancing that we conduct in the course of this year, usually long time to keep our long-term debts over five years. So right now refinancing terms, most of them are fixed -- in fixed terms, more the spread of how much -- what we've seen. So that's what we have to stimulate into our financial projections for financing costs of that for coming years. So, we are conducting an analysis, a careful analysis and we are now understanding that our financial situation will improve. But the cost of credit will be still be high.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can also email. I didn't quite understand the question. So it is going to be 7.0, because the customers that we've -- for that group in the wholesale, we saw over the margin. So no impact and neither insistent, because the customers that are buying from the distributing question, and if they're buying from market, they buy at market prices. So no impact there. As far as the transition to the competition, I think, it's great, because the President, the Chairman, Management, the customers are buying. And this shows that there is no problem with that. And given the -- even considering current financial crisis. Now I think they are working fine and succeeded, no problems there. In fact it does has matured that over -- that is other 120 days is down vis-&#xE0;-vis last year. We haven't -- had a negative impact like Armada saying. Is what he means it's under regulated tariff had a lower price than we have run the market within that haven't effected us because we were selling at market prices. And the differential vis-&#xE0;-vis the regulated price that was -- that was giving us distance. So the difference of bringing into people market, lower than adjusted, that doesn't really affect. I mean the payment by nothing. What I said for 40 minutes and if there is no other questions. Well, thank you very much. This meeting is adjourned.</p>
