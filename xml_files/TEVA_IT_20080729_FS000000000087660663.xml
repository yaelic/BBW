          <p>Greetings and welcome to the Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Second Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Miss Elana Holzman. Thank you Miss Holzman, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diego. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Teva's second quarter 2008 earnings call. We hope you all had the chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Shlomo Yanai, President and CEO; Eyal Desheh, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva North America; and Moshe Manor, Group Vice President of Global Innovative Resources. Shlomo and Eyal will begin by providing an overview of our results. We will then open the call for question and answer period.</p>
          <p>Before we proceed with the call, I would like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and webcast. Shlomo?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased to report that Q2 was another excellent quarter for Teva, both financially and strategically. Teva's net sales in Q2 reached a record-breaking $2.8 billion with gross margins of 53.3%. Our operating profit was $638 million with net profit of $539 million. And all of this ultimately brought us to diluted EPS of $0.65.</p>
          <p>Strong contributions from Teva's many businesses and geographies drove our results in Q2. It was an excellent quarter for Teva USA. We launched nine products in Q2 and have launched 18 thus far in 2008. And we have expanded our leading market share in the U.S. among all pharmaceutical companies, both generic and brand, to 12.6% of total prescriptions. North American sales were driven by our major launches of Risperidone and Bupropion XL 150. In addition, we continue to enjoy strong sales of our recently launched Amlodipine/Benazepril capsules and Alendronate Sodium. And our sales of base products grew by more than 7% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Outside the U.S., in Europe, sales were up 25% over Q2 '07. It was an especially strong quarter in Hungary and in France, where Teva increased its customer base and market share in a growing generics market. Clearly, although we benefited from exchange rate in the European markets, our growth was still positive, even in the face of short-term issues in the UK and the Netherlands. Our international business had a record breaking quarter, with sales up 38% over Q2 '07, supported by especially strong results in Russia, Latin America, and Israel. Our international business is composed of many high-growth markets, and we are very enthusiastic about opportunities that lie ahead for us in these regions.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our global respiratory business, sales were down slightly year-over-year. However, we are very optimistic about growth in this business this year. The EPA, in concert with the FDA, has clearly communicated that no CFC-based inhalers may be sold or dispensed after December 31. Healthcare providers are facing off a corporate test to ensure that approximately 40% of patients still using CFC-based inhalers make the switch. We expect our ProAir to remain the market leader and are preparing for the anticipated increase in demand as CFC-based products go off the market entirely.</p>
          <p>This was an outstanding quarter for Teva's innovative business, with record-breaking in-market sales of Copaxone growing 29% over the second quarter of 2007. In the U.S., in-market sales increased by 17%. Outside the U.S., in-market sales increased by an extraordinary 53%. This is the first quarter in which Copaxone led the market in U.S. net sales, where it also leads in terms of both new and total prescriptions, and the second quarter, in which it lead in global sales. Copaxone continues to outpace the market's growth, and we expect it to remain the leading therapy for MS and continue to grow.</p>
          <p>This was also an outstanding quarter for Teva's second innovative product, Azilect, sales of which rose 50% over Q2 '07. Last month we announced the successful completion of ADAGIO, the phase III clinical trial designed to test Azilect's efficacy in slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease, one of the most critical unmet needs in the treatment of Parkinson's patients. Azilect met all the study's three primary endpoints. And the study also confirmed Azilect's safety and tolerability.</p>
          <p>The results of this study will be presented at the 12th Congress of the European Federation of Neurological Societies on August 26 in Madrid and at the American Neurology Association Congress in Salt Lake City on September 21. We believe that the promising results of this trial may lead to a significant increase in Azilect's market potential, leading it to become another major Teva drug for neurological disorders.</p>
          <p>And now, before I turn the call over to Eyal for a more detailed financial review, I would like to briefly update you on the progress that we have already made in implementing Teva's strategic plan to double our business by 2012.</p>
          <p>Among other things, we have significantly increased our production capacity, which is now up to an annual run rate of 47 billion tablets, and is expected to reach a run rate of 53 billion tablets by year-end, allowing us to meet the growing demand from our largest customers and provide them with even better service.</p>
          <p>We have increased our R&amp;D investment from 5.7% to 7% of total sales, which has already allowed us to substantially increase the number of products under development and on their way through the pipeline. We have set ambitious goals for R&amp;D output and are well on our way to reaching them.</p>
          <p>We have acquired CoGenesys as part of our long-term commitment to becoming a leader in biologics. And we acquired Bentley, which provided us with a strong platform in the fast-growing generics market of Spain, a deal which closed a week ago.</p>
          <p>We are extremely pleased with the progress we have made in the short time since we launched our strategic plan, and there is tremendous enthusiasm inside of Teva to keep the momentum going strong, as we head towards the next phases of the plan. And of course, this is all without the addition of Barr, an acquisition which I discussed with you last week, that will provide us with great strategic and economic benefits, and allow us to exceed our 2020 targets.</p>
          <p>Based on our strong performance during the first half of the year and our positive outlook for the second half of 2008, we now expect EPS in the range of 2.69 to 2.75 versus the previously announced range of 2.60 to 2.75. It should be noted, though, that due to the uncertain timing of several key product launches over the next two quarters, our revenue stream may not be linear. And it is likely that the strength of the second half will be most visible in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And now we will turn the call over to Eyal. Eyal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone. I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today. This was another excellent quarter for Teva, and I would like to review with you the results in detail.</p>
          <p>As Shlomo mentioned, we had record revenues in the second quarter of more than $2.8 billion, an increase of 18% or approximately $437 million compared to Q2 last year. About one-third of the sales growth was due to currency appreciations against the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, the Israeli shekel, and Canadian dollars, with $11.5 million adverse impacts to operating income. Another third was due to the assumption by Teva of the distribution activities of Copaxone from sanofi-aventis in North America, with organic growth accounting for the balance.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceutical sales in North America grew 12% quarter-over-quarter to $1.5 billion. Generic sales in the U.S. were slightly down from Q2 '07 levels, which as you remember benefited from particularly large new product launches. Pharmaceutical sales in Europe grew 25% to $762 million and represented 29% of total pharmaceutical sales for the company. European generics in dollar terms grew approximately 16%, while in local currencies, growth was a modest 3%.</p>
          <p>International pharmaceutical sales totaled $400 million, growing 37% quarter-over-quarter. This growth rate is significantly higher than the group average, mainly due to the acceleration of sales in Teva's main international geographies, including Russia, across all of Latin America, and our business in Israel and Turkey. 11% of the international growth was attributable to foreign currency effects.</p>
          <p> We're deploying an innovative business for Copaxone at another record quarter, with global in-market sales of $563 million. This is a 29% increase over the comparable quarter, with very, very nice growth in the international markets.</p>
          <p>Just to remind everyone, on April 1, 2008, Teva took over the distribution responsibilities of Copaxone in the U.S. and Canada from sanofi-aventis. According to the agreement, we'll record, as of this quarter, full in-market sales of Copaxone in North America as compared to booking the sales at a transfer price to sanofi-aventis prior to that date. Also for the next two years, until Q1 2010 inclusive, we will book under SG&amp;A a 25% payment on total sales in North America, payable to sanofi-aventis. In addition, sanofi-aventis no longer participates in our Copaxone sales and marketing expenses in North America that were credited against our SG&amp;A in previous quarters. These changes had a positive contribution to Teva net sales, gross profits, and gross profit margin. However, the increase in net sales is offset by the increases in SG&amp;A expenses, resulting in a negative negligible effect to operating income and a negative 1.5% impact on operating margin.</p>
          <p>Our global respiratory business, which is included in the North America and European and international sales figures, the total of which I've already mentioned, had sales of $168 million, compared with $181 million in Q2 '07 but was flat compared to Q1 2008.</p>
          <p>Our gross profit margin reached 53.3% in the reported quarter, higher than the 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2007. This quarter's gross margin was positively affected by the termination of the agreement with sanofi-aventis in North America. Net R&amp;D expenses increased quarter-over-quarter by 45% to a record of $198 million, or 7% of sales. As previously indicated, this increased investment is a direct reflection of the increased efforts in generic and biogeneric R&amp;D, and is consistent with our strategic goal to double R&amp;D spending by 2012.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, which was $669 million in the quarter, represented 24% of sales compared to 20% in Q2 2007. The higher SG&amp;A is in line with our plan and as already mentioned, resulted primarily from the termination of our agreement with sanofi-aventis regarding Copaxone in North America, and to a lesser extent from the weakening of the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Operating profit this quarter amounted to $638 million, similar to the comparable quarter in 2007. As percentage of sales, operating profit margins were 22.6%, 4.1% lower than the comparable quarter in fiscal 2007. Here are the main factors contributing to the percentage change &#x2013; and here they are. The end of the agreement with sanofi-aventis had a 1.5% negative impact on our margin. Foreign currencies impact had 1.6% impact on our operating margin. And last but not least, our increased R&amp;D investments, which reduced our operating margins by 1.3%. Let's not forget, though, that R&amp;D investments are expected to contribute for our future growth.</p>
          <p>We recorded $28 million of financial expenses in Q2 2008, compared with $8 million recorded for the comparable quarter of 2007. Finance expenses this quarter include a charge against our portfolio of auction rate securities, amounting to $25 million before tax. While we did not adjust this charge in a non-GAAP report, this amount represents approximately $0.03 per share.</p>
          <p>As in the past two quarters, this charge was calculated based on an internally developed model, which evaluated every single security in the portfolio. The principal amount of our auction rate security portfolio remained $445 million, whereas the net amount of this portfolio as of June 30, 2008, stands at $274 million compared to $334 million at the end of March. The June 30 balance is after giving effect to a cumulative total of $77 million P&amp;L charges and cumulative total of $94 million provided in our balance sheet under other comprehensive income.</p>
          <p>Provisions for income tax this quarter amounted to $68 million or 11% of pre-tax income. This provision is based on our best current estimates for our expected annual tax rate for the whole of fiscal 2008, which now stands at 13% on an adjusted pre-tax income. The reduction in effective tax rate from 17% in 2007 to 13% in 2008 reflects mainly the already executed, as well as expected, launches in the U.S. during the year, which to a large extent were developed and will be produced in Israel. However, as we've previously indicated, we're not in a position at this point to assure you that this rate is sustainable for future years.</p>
          <p>All this leads to our net income of $539 million in total, up 5% from last year. Earning per share based on this income works out to $0.65 per share, up 3% from the comparable quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flow. As you have already heard from Shlomo, we had record high cash generated from operations, amounting to $806 million, while our free cash flow, after capital expenditure net of $132 million in dividends, of approximately $106 million amounted to $568 million. Free cash flow was used primarily to reduce short-term bank debt obligation by more than $500 million.</p>
          <p>The record cash flow from operation resulted from a very strong collection of previous launches, mainly in the U.S. DSO, days sales outstanding, amounted to 54 days this quarter, down from 62 days in Q1 2008. The decrease resulted mainly from strong cash collection this quarter, as well as the termination of the agreement with sanofi-aventis, which had a small impact. Inventory days remained essentially flat, down to 192 days from 193 days in March. We increased inventory levels earlier this year in order to improve service levels to our customers.</p>
          <p>We have calculated the DSO, as we always do, after netting out from the receivables, the sales reserve and allowances, the so-called SR&amp;A. To remind you, we record receivables on a gross basis and record the SR&amp;A under current liabilities. But in order to facilitate a more meaningful comparison with some of our peers, who record receivables net of these reserves, we have used the net figure.</p>
          <p>Total SR&amp;A at June 30, 2008, amounted to $2.1 billion, an increase of $140 million from March 2008. About 91% of total reserves are from the U.S., up $137 million from March 2008, most notably due to provisions for charge-backs for new products. Gross capital expenditure reached $202 million this quarter, 68 million higher than in Q1 2008. We expect CapEx to continue to accelerate as the year evolves, exceeding $700 million for the full year, mainly reflecting the recently announced plant capacity expansion to support our strategic growth plan.</p>
          <p>As for our debts, $3.3 billion or 70% of our total interest-bearing debt at June 30 is long-term debt, of which $1.4 billion is in our converts and $1.9 billion in a straight fixed or floating interest debt. Our leverage, measured as debt to debt plus equity as of June 30, 2008, stood at 0.24, compared to 0.27 at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity at June 30 reached $15.1 billion. Of the increase from the end of Q1 of $679 million, $146 million or 22% represented the increase in our global net assets due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>For the convenience of our audience, I would again like to mention three figures relating to our share count, so that we are all on the same page. For the second quarter of 2008, our average share count for the purpose of calculating fully diluted earnings per share were 836 million shares. The share count at the end of the quarter for the purpose of calculating fully diluted EPS going forward is the same, approximately 836 million shares. While the share count for calculating our market cap &#x2013; it is approximately 779 million shares.</p>
          <p>Dividends. Yesterday the Teva Board approved a second quarter dividend amounting to approximately $106 million. On a per-share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels remained 0.45 shekels per share based on the rate of exchange on July 28, 2008, of the shekel to the U.S. dollar. This translates into approximately $0.13 per share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for the questions. Eyal, just initially on the update to outlook, I assume it's fair to say that absorbs the $0.08 in year-to-date auction-rate security write-offs and the lower tax outlook. But can you also maybe help us with how you're thinking about Risperdal and the exclusivity length in that updated guidance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, would you like to start with the Risperdal, and then we'll pass to Eyal for the rest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Randall. Just to be clear on the Risperdal. We have oral arguments scheduled right now for September 12. And we would anticipate a decision some time after that. And we've fully contemplated this so far in our guidance as it is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to take the auction rate security question. I hope I understood it well. We're continuing to write off additional $25 million, which is what our model shows us that we have to reduce through our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're continuing to reduce the value &#x2013; to adjust the value through our balance sheet. We have no idea whether this is going to continue in this quarter, it depends on market condition. I want to remind and to reiterate that this is a &#x2013; kind of $0.03 per share, which is not related to our current business. And this is &#x2013; in total from the beginning of the year, almost $0.08 per share that could have improved our bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Bill, just on the Risperdal, is it fair to assume there's something less than six months right now factored in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as we think about the stocking, obviously, you had &#x2013; I think it was less than half a day on the June 30 launch. How do we think about the &#x2013; let me phrase it this way &#x2013; the normality of the launch as it falls into 2Q versus 3Q going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's &#x2013; we don't get into specific guidance, Randall, on individual products. I guess the way you'd want to think about that is we had a good launch for Risperidone, but obviously only &#x2013; to a lesser extent did it get in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then just last one related to this. As you think about the split between 3Q and 4Q from an EPS perspective on the new range, which I think is implied at 1.40 to 1.46, how do we think about 3Q versus 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, because of the uncertainty of some of the expected launches, I think that we're going to see more materialize in Q4. But again this is still on ahead of us, and I won't bet on numbers on three or four. But as we see it now, probably the fourth quarter is going to be stronger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Okay. First of all, I'm very pleased with what we are achieving in the European region, which is a very promising region for our future of our business. Due to the European &#x2013; a very interesting, different kind of market, there is &#x2013; very common that in every year there is another player with a different kind of business structure or transferring the local market to a different kind of ideas or whatever. So this time, it's about the Netherlands where they have started to switch to a certain degree &#x2013; I won't say that the whole market has been switched yet &#x2013; to the tender system which took the prices of those products who were on tender to a very lower prices.</p>
          <p>We faced, by the way, a very similar situation last year in Hungary. But we managed to turn the short-term problem to a long-term success, as we see now this year when our Invarian market share is growing. And we believe that we will overcome the Dutch or the Netherlands as well.</p>
          <p>In UK temporary &#x2013; I believe it's a temporary issue &#x2013; when we have some resellers slowing down their purchasing, but this is again a temporally issue and we believe that all in all, the European business is in a good shape.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you give us an update on the German AOK tender? When is it coming up next for bidding? And do you expect to bid for it with Barr or separately? And then on the pricing, if you can just give us an update on the base business? And also the pricing for Lamictal. Is it being set according to your initial expectations such an auction off point to discounts that are greater than 50%? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ricky, I &#x2013; sorry, I couldn't hear the second part of your question. But let me take the first one on Germany. In Germany, we expect the tender system to start again somewhere around September or maybe October. This is by the co-decision that the previous tenders should be terminated and they should go back to square one. We are preparing ourselves, as you know, we did very well in the previous tenders. Unfortunately the court dismissed these tenders. But we believe that we will find a way how to manage in the second tenders as well. It is going to occur probably before we close the deal with Barr. So I don't think that we could benefit from the additional Barr product in the German market. And if you'd be so kind to ask your second question again, I'll try to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The second question was around pricing, specifically for the base business, i.e., the older generics and also for Lamictal and also what are you seeing in terms of pricing? Is it meeting your initial expectations?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Ricky, it's Bill Marth, good morning. Hey, on the first question, you're asking about the base business. Our base business, we've had no notable change on the rate of price erosion for the last couple of years. So, we feel pretty good about that at this point in time, although I can't make any predictions moving forward. With respect to your question on Lamotrigine, Lamotrigine is launching exactly as we had expected, and the pricing is coming in where we had it planned for.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, the tax rate that you were talking about, is that 13% what we should be thinking about when we blend the two companies together for '09? You mentioned on the call something about base business being up 7%. Can you go back and just make sure I got that number right and maybe just elaborate on what are you referring to as the base business that was up 7, if that is the right number? And then third, on Copaxone coming back on the income statement with 100%, can you give us an idea of how much that impacted SG&amp;A in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first answer the first one, because I think that we have to clarify what Eyal said about the tax rate. The 13% is Teva standalone. And 2009, that is a different ballgame because we believe that at that time it will be after the closing with Barr. As you well know, Barr tax numbers &#x2013; now totally different numbers, so definitely is not relating to a '09 tax level, and you should not assume that this is going to be the tax level after '09, which is a different game and a different situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you were not buying Barr, would the tax rate be that low, or should we be assuming a higher tax rate for Teva alone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer that. Obviously, Barr's tax rate is higher than Teva's. I want to repeat that 13% &#x2013; the 13% is our provision for tax rate for the first half of 2008, and this is what we expect to show also for the second half of this year, based upon our best knowledge of the business mix. When you add Barr, Barr has a basically higher tax rate. It's a smaller company with less profit, so the blend should have a few points higher than what Teva is showing today, definitely above that 13%. I would be careful but to give you a number at this point. We'll analyze this, and I will discuss this later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Eyal, I understand that part. What I'm trying to understand is, should we have been thinking 17, 18% before you just announced -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On Teva going forward, we believe that our long-term tax rate is higher than the 13%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You should factor for the long term something between 15 to 17%. And, again, it's highly dependent on mix.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just have a quick question for Eyal on the debt paydown schedule, very aggressive this quarter. Just trying to get a sense of if you're going to continue to use free cash flow this aggressively on the debt paydown? And then for Bill, Bill can you give us a sense on the ADAGIO study and any conversations you've been having with managed care about moving this product from tier 3 primarily down to tier 2, if that's under way already? And what the status is from some of those conversations?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. All right, regarding free cash flow, we'll be using it to reduce short-term and long-term rates in the future if necessary. Right now, close to the end of the year, we believe we're going to have a pretty large payment for the acquisition of Barr. So you should not expect to see this in the second half of the year. But later on, in '09 and beyond, yep. We'll borrow money, we'll use cash flow to reduce it. Bill?</p>

          <p>Yeah, Ken. It's Bill. Hey, listen, on the ADAGIO, around the &#x2013; with respect to ADAGIO, right now, as you may know, per the month of June, Azilect became the most widely prescribed MAO-B inhibitor on both TRX and NRX volume. But your question, I think was more on formulary access. At this point in time, formulary access at tier 2 is very, very good. And we haven't had any change at this moment. There's nothing to update yet.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Bill, could you comment a little bit about your expectations for pricing in the respiratory side of the business in the second half of the year? It seems like the conversion's moving along, but is price coming down in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, with respect to the pricing on the respiratory side, the pricing has been stable and we expect it to be stable. What you're seeing has just been CFC flowing out of the system. I think as providers realized that regulators were going to be very, very tough on CFC usage after the first year, it's very logical that they would get as much of the CFC out of the system as possible, and that's what they've done. So, that's why you've seen the effects that we have seen so far. But again, we're already beginning to see some spot shortages pop up just in the recent weeks. So, we &#x2013; expecting to go pretty much as we planned, albeit a little bit later.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up. Shlomo, you've had incredible growth in Europe. I mean, is there something particularly in the second quarter that you can sort of attribute this type of growth to? Is it new product launches or is it really grabbing more share geographically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mixture, because the Europe, as you well know, are not like United States. It's a very un-homogeneous region. Each country has a different story. So, it's a combination or, if you wish, a mix of products that we sell to ramp up our numbers in all the different countries, part of our major effort to register many more products in different European countries, leveraging our portfolio in the European region. And with an intensive effort to increase our market share in key countries, and I would point to you, for example France, where we are doing very well and we managed to ramp up our market share. And actually we're now having the fourth place or the fourth position in this very big and promising country.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Shlomo. Eyal, just one last question for you. Given how fast Copaxone is growing, is it pretty much a given that you're going to buy back the international rights that you don't own on Copaxone around 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Moshe, maybe you can take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We cannot buy back the international rights, in that we have a contract with sanofi-aventis, and commencing on 2009 and mainly on 2012 period, the responsibility will be transferred to Teva in the European and the international markets. In some international markets we already have the responsibility. So, it's mainly about Europe and Australia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah, thanks. First one is on the Copaxone ex U.S., you talked about the second quarter and some of the extraordinary growth rate you're seeing. Can you give a little sense of what countries specifically have been adding to the growth rate? And for 2009, where you may see an anniversarying or lapping of the launches in some of those countries? And for Eyal, can you talk a little bit on the financial income? You called out the auction-rate securities charges for the first half of the year. What's been the trend in currency gains or losses, or are any of their items in there that have been positive the last couple of quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I must say, we have calculated Copaxone, actually if you look at the sales in the Europe and international, we see the growth actually occurs in both. And let me give you some example. In Canada, there was significant growth, while we moved to the number one position. In France, we are moving to the number two position. We have significant growth in Germany. And actually in all countries we see a significant growth in units, where Copaxone in every market is improving its position based on the launch rate in every market. So, all in all I think that we expect this market to continue to grow, as well as other international markets. We are growing our business in Russia and in LatAm as well.</p>

As far as the ability to provide, through this example, the understanding of the strength and the commitment of Teva in biogenerics I think this will be well demonstrated in Europe with this product.</p>
          <p>As far as additional product in our pipeline, we do not disclose it because they &#x2013; it mostly deals with patent litigation, similar to what we see around Paragraph 4, until we have a complete filing situation, we will not disclose it, which we had to really not to include it.

      <speaker id="13" type="a">

          <p>Well, I think in Azilect, as Shlomo mentioned, we are going to publish the data in all presentations, both in the EFNS in September &#x2013; in August, sorry &#x2013; and September is the ANA. And follow it with more detailed information about the &#x2013; to share the data and the finding and the result of these interesting studies. All in all, we see that there is a lot of enthusiasm and anticipation from physicians. And we historically be enrolling activities, evolving activities based in the field and with congresses and we're going to embark on that and focus on that in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Once we have the publication in activity a year from now &#x2013; we're going to us that in our field activities as well are called abroad on a a global basis. And we are very optimistic with the initial reaction of neurologists to the datum, the result of this study.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, I cannot get into these details, or these specifics. But again, we are positive and it's &#x2013; and I'm saying it loud and clear.</p>

          <p>And one question for Bill Marth. Bill &#x2013; and I know on your last conference call you mentioned the possibility of partnering with another generic company or generic companies on first-to-file opportunities that Teva might not have in its own pipeline. With the acquisition of Barr, is that still a possibility or might the acquisition of Barr in fact replace that need or desire to partner with other generic companies for first-to-files?</p>

          <p>Thank you. As you have heard, this was another excellent quarter for Teva, and we are very enthusiastic as we look ahead to the future. And I just told Rich in answering his question, we are optimistic, we have a positive outlook, and we are having a very simple and crystal clear message to you guys: This is going to be another good year for Teva, and I believe that the result towards the end of the year will prove it. And again thank you all for joining us today.</p>
