          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Total Earning Results for Q3 2010 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would like to hand over to the Chairperson and CFO, Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and thank you for calling.</p>
          <p>Most of you met recently with Total management during our strategy presentations. So, I will make just a few comments on our third quarter results and operational highlights and then we can spend our time mainly on the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We reported another good quarter. Compared to the second quarter we are down slightly because of lower refining margins and the reclassifications of Sanofi from equity affiliates to other investments. Year-over-year our adjusted third quarter results in dollars are up by 20% and if we exclude Sanofi we are up by 33%. Looking at the environment, the dollar has weakened against the euro. Oil prices have been strong and this is in line with our macro view.</p>
          <p>For natural gas, the third quarter reflects stronger prices, mainly in Europe and Asia, and refining margins in Northwest Europe were significantly weaker in the third quarter than in the second quarter. Our Upstream production of 2.3 million barrel of oil equivalent per day reflects a strong 4.3% growth versus the same quarter last year. This is among the best of the majors. And it confirms that 2010 should be our best year in terms of production growth over the past 5 to 6 years.</p>
          <p>Compared to the second quarter production was down by less than 1%. Seasonal maintenance was slightly higher in the third quarter. The Cupiagua license in Colombia expired at the end of June, so that was 10,000 barrel per day. And the continuing ramp-ups of new projects has essentially offset the normal decline on the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Upstream profitability is good. The annualized royalty for the third quarter is 20%. Even though volumes were a little lower and the contribution from gas marketing and trading was not as high as in the second quarter. Globally the Upstream is performing well.</p>
          <p>And to illustrate this point, notice that our year-to-date average oil equivalent price increased by 24% in dollar compared to the same period last year. Our year-to-date net income per barrel increased by 29% and our Upstream net operating income increased by 39%. So, our Upstream profitability has increased by more than the oil and gas price. And this shows that we are adding new high-quality production that is delivering higher returns.</p>
          <p>For the Downstream, European margins were very weak at beginning of the quarter, but recovered slightly in September. Refining was negative, but marketing and supply optimization performed well. We did not have any exceptional items this quarter. As a reminder, we benefited from $60 million inventory gain in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The Downstream segment is sensitive to the environment but, as we said in our strategy presentation, we have taken steps to strengthen the underlying profitability here.</p>
          <p>Chemicals were essentially stable despite the slightly lower petrochemical margins in the U.S. and continue to generate good returns of around 14%.</p>
          <p>For Sanofi, effective July 1, we have changed the accounting treatment for Sanofi-Aventis. It is now treated as a financial investment, not as an equity affiliate. For comparison the non-cash contribution to net income from Sanofi as an equity affiliate was &#x20AC;141 million in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our remaining 5.7% stake in Sanofi is worth about $5 billion, and we expect to complete the progressive sale of these shares by 2012.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate increased by 56% in the third quarter, mainly due to a mix effect among the different segments, so no significant change here.</p>
          <p>Adjusted cash flow from operation was $5.6 billion, reflecting the generally positive environment.</p>
          <p>CapEx including acquisitions was $5.3 billion. Excluding acquisitions and investments, we are in line with our 2010 budget of $18 billion.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have become more active in using acquisition and investment to upgrade the portfolio. So far this year, we have announced about $6 billion of acquisitions, including mainly a deal in Uganda that is pending, the GLNG deal in Australia, the UTS acquisition in Canada that closed last month and the Barnett Shale joint venture at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Asset sales, including the ongoing sales of our Sanofi shares, have generated $3.6 billion so far this year. We recently finalized the sale of Val and disposed of 15% of our share in the Nogat pipeline in the Netherlands. We also announced this quarter the sale of our 5% interest in the Block 31 in Angola. I will not go into detail, but I will say that we plan to continue divesting material amounts of non-core assets and to reinvest the cash into new projects.</p>
          <p>Looking at the balance sheet, we are in good shape with a net debt to equity ratio of 18%. Our giving at the end of the third quarter does not take into account the interim dividend. We will pay the interim dividend of &#x20AC;1.14 per share on November 17. This will increase our giving by 4 to 5 points, but we expect to remain comfortably in our 25% &#x2013; 30% target range for giving at the end of the year. Also regarding the dividend, we announced that we will begin paying the dividend for the year 2011 and thereafter on a quarterly basis starting in the second-half of next year. This will provide more frequent cash distribution to our shareholders and it will make our cash flow and giving easier to compare with the other majors, who pay their dividend quarterly.</p>
          <p>Before we go to the Q&amp;A, there are a few points that I would like to make. First, we are reshaping our exploration program and we are beginning to see some positive results. We have expanded our exploration portfolio by adding new acreage in Ivory Coast and Indonesia. We are now able to resume exploration in Brunei in the promising CA-1 Block, formerly known as Block J, with two new partners, Petronas and Murphy. And recently, we have announced discoveries on Block 15/06 in Angola, in offshore Vietnam and on Block B in offshore Brunei.</p>
          <p>Second, we have launched four major projects so far this year, Surmont in Canada and Laggan Tormor in the U.K. we are launching in the first-half. CLOV in Angola was sanctioned in August. And the development plan for Alfaia has been approved, so it is launched as well. In addition, the operator of GLNG in Australia has received government approval. So, we should be able to launch it by year end.</p>
          <p>Third, we are continuing to implement our restructuring plans for the Downstream. As part of major modernization program, we anticipate the start-up of a new cooker at the Port Arthur Refinery early next year.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have strong cash generation and we are well positioned to maintain both the dividend policy and the investment program over the long term.</p>
          <p>This ends my comments on the third quarter results and I am ready to start the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. There will be a short silence while participants register for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Kessler. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Simmons &amp; Company. Hi, Patrick. A question on buyback potential, I know you guys haven't done it in some time. I know you perceive your shares as being at a fairly good discount to where they should be and you've got a strong balance sheet. Why not buy back a little bit of stock here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Robert for your question. Several years ago, Total was very active in share buyback, but there were no policy in share buyback actually. As of today, I think we have a pipeline of projects which will give more value to the company than share buyback. And of course, yes, you are right, we have a strong balance sheet but by year end our giving will be back in the 25% &#x2013; 30% range. And then we have the pipeline of projects which will continue to be financed and honestly, I'd rather to have good projects to finance than to share buyback.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Patrick, and then just if I could ask for an update on your thoughts on Uganda. It seemed on the one hand like some progress had been made, but then the &#x2013; perhaps a little bit of pushback from the government, but your perceptions on the state of affairs there and likely timing for full resolution of that allowing you to progress forward with the project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know that we entered a final agreement with Tullow by which we &#x2013; each of us have one-third of the project. This contract is pending to the approval of the Ugandan government, which is itself I think pending on the solution to be found on the tax battle between Heritage and the Ugandan government. Currently about a few weeks ago a proposal was made by Tullow to the Ugandan government and Tullow is currently handling the matter. And I'd rather not to comment any more on that subject.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from the line of Theepan Jothilingam. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon Patrick, it's Theepan here, Morgan Stanley. A few questions please. Just firstly on exploration, it seems you've put together some quite substantial acreage this year. I was just wondering whether you could talk about spend for 2011, whether there is a material ramp up or not. Secondly, just in terms of production, significant momentum in 2010, if anything it looks like you might be ahead of schedule. Does that have any implications for the sort of flat production outlook that you provided for next year? And then perhaps any quick comment on the impact of the strikes in France at the moment for your Downstream profitability in Q4, that would be great?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Theepan. Usually it's two questions per person, Theepan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let's talk firstly &#x2013; your first question about exploration. Yes, we added a few acreage and I think the Ivory Coast and the Sebuku-1 in Indonesia are very promising acreage. And I am quite happy to have that in our portfolio. As far as the exploration budget for 2011, I think it will be in the same range, let's say around $2 billion dollars more or less.</p>
          <p>About production, there is obviously currently very good production growth delivered by Total. And I am also happy to say that yes we do deliver what we've said we will deliver. Basically, this will have no indication on our position in 2011. Our position in 2011, as you know, we do not anticipate a big growth and it will be depending mostly on OpEx cuts and the situation in Nigeria &#x2013; and the price effect of this.</p>
          <p>Then, the situation with strikes. How many &#x2013; how long do you have, half an hour, 15 minutes? It could be a long discussion. But basically we have six refineries in France. This morning at 10:00 a.m. I make a point with the people in refining and three refineries had already decided to start again and go back to work. I think for the three additional refineries we shall wait for the afternoon because the union has meeting among themselves to decide what they want to do, so I cannot comment on that. I can give you an estimate of the cost of both strikes for Total; roughly it has a cost of &#x20AC;5 to &#x20AC;6 million per day and our current estimate is an overall cost of about let's say &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, Patrick. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Theepan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from the line of Mark Gilman. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, good afternoon, it's Mark Gilman from Benchmark. Let me if I could just follow up on your &#x20AC;100 million comment on the strike cost, is that an opportunity loss or is that cost in terms of actual outlays and then I'll have a follow-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>An actual cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I also noticed, Patrick, in the quarter in terms of the 2% production hit associated with prices, if I'm doing my math correctly, the production sharing contract sensitivity to changes in price and spend has moved up again to a little bit over 5,000 BOE per day per dollar of price change. Can you comment on what's driving that and whether the sensitivity on that subject is likely to remain at that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me think about &#x2013; the sensitivity &#x2013; the price effect on PSC is about 2,000 to 3,000 barrels per day per dollar per barrel. That's basically what we have.</p>
          <p>In 3Q, 2009, I remind you that we had official defect on Block 14 with the profit oil coming from 40% to 20%. And we had another one last quarter, 2009 on Valhall with the profit oil going down from 60 to 40; that's the comment I can make which is coming on my mind now. In first quarter 2010 we also matched the first threshold effect I think on Rosa, with the profit oil coming from 80% to 60%. And depending on oil price, we could have an initial threshold effect on Rosa late this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, thank you very much. That helps a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you Mark. Bye bye.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patrick, it's Michele from Goldman. Just two quick questions; first of all you had a relatively high tax rate in E&amp;P this quarter, could you give us a guidance going forward. And secondly in terms of the major start-up that we've seen in the last 12 months, could you tell us how much more upside could there be to plateau after Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, on the tax rate itself it's a matter of mix between positions, between high-tax countries like Nigeria, Norway and other countries. In the Upstream, our guidance is to be 58% to 59% tax rate. Of course it will change according &#x2013; exactly on the precise production from one country to another.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the start-ups, we have a few start-ups which are still ramping up; start-up in 2009 still ramping up, which are Yemen LNG, Buonandana and Mobilundo. That basically is the three projects which are still ramping up at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you quantify how much further upside that could give in terms of production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This &#x2013; honestly no I can't, I don't have a figure right now. You may have a look to our September presentation with the sensitivity we gave about our new projects. Keep in mind that currently Yemen LNG is at 70% &#x2013; from 70% to 80% capacity, will give you some magnitude of what could be the effect of the ramp up of Yemen LNG.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon Patrick. It's Lydia Rainforth from Barclays Capital here. Could you just talk about the outlook for the dividends? You said you moved to quarterly payments to reflect more the other majors. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on how we should see the dividend progression.</p>
          <p>And then just secondly on production and for next year what are your thoughts about where Nigeria volumes could move for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the last question because we didn't get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure; I'm just wondering what you've included in the flat production guidance in terms of Nigeria volumes for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the dividend, first the beauty of our dividend today is that you can divide it by four, so you can pay it in four installments. This is not a joke because we wanted to match the use of the market and all of our competitors who are paying dividend on a quarterly basis. And we wanted to be in line with the use of the market.</p>
          <p>And on top of that this was requested by some of the pension <mark type="inaudible" /> and I can understand from where they were coming from and for us it was making no difference so that was fine and we were okay to suggest that to the board.</p>
          <p>We will start &#x2013; by the way we will start the quarterly payment dividend scheme, the first payment will be in September of 2011. So, I think we give sufficient forecast to the option market, so that they can adjust themselves.</p>
          <p>On Nigeria, we had a very good recovery if you compare 2010 &#x2013; third quarter 2010 to third quarter 2009, because basically we had an increase of about 30,000 barrel per day coming from the SPDC joint venture. We have made no further predictions for 2011. So, we keep that level maintained at the same level for 2011 in our forecast.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Paul Spedding from HSBC. I had a question on the performance of your Upstream associates, which seem to have improved quite remarkably compared to the second quarter of 2010. But in contrast the non-associates, the consolidated subsidiaries, seem to have shown quite a marked deterioration. Perhaps you could give us a little more detail behind why that has occurred?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, this is quite simple, is that in 2009 a few projects like Qatar, Yemen LNG started and increased the value of the net income coming from equity affiliates. On top of that as I was just mentioning before there were recovery in Nigeria and as a consequence, the Nigeria LNG company is making a better profit today with higher capacity use up to 80% to 90%. That's basically the main reason why our equity Upstream is going up.</p>
          <p>For the non &#x2013; for the other line keep in mind that in &#x2013; the second quarter of 2010, we had a very good market in gas. And I was mentioning that at the last Q&amp;A, that we had a very good result in our trading in gas. This is not anymore the case this quarter; it's more in line that with the usual level we have and that's the main difference we have on this line of the books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I may, could I ask a follow up question is to what your experience of the Asian LNG market is at the moment, whether it's improving in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you an idea, so we don't have the figure for September, but have the figure in August.</p>
          <p>In August we diverted eight cargos from the Atlantic Basin to Asia. It shows I think how strong is the Asian market today for the LNG. And currently we are negotiating the long-term of state contracts with the Japanese buyers for the active project and the Korean buyers for the LNG project in Australia. And for both projects we are still negotiating contracts with oil price &#x2013; with gas price being linked to the oil price.</p>
          <p>Just to give you a precise figure, last quarter the spot price in Asia were up by 18%, from $8 per million Btu to about 4.9 &#x2013; sorry, $9.4 per million Btu at the end of September.</p>
          <p>So I think the market in Asia is quite short and many, many volumes are diverted, many cargos are diverted, which show I think in my view, a strong recovery in this part of the world.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jon Rigby from UBS. Hi Patrick. Just one question; it's on Sanofi. Does the fact that you've now left the Board and I guess the reduced absolute size of the stake make you re-examine the methodology by which you're disposing of this, i.e., will you consider doing something other than the ongoing dribbling of the stake into the market and maybe monetize it rather quicker? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Being frank with you, we are still insiders, as is said by the lawyer, because Thierry Desmarest is still a member of the board of Total and member of the board of Sanofi. We are currently reviewing this situation so that we could have a Chinese wall between Thierry Desmarest and myself so that there is &#x2013; we are not anymore an insider. But this is not how it used to be implemented , that's the first comment.</p>
          <p>The second comment is that we are not in a hurry to sell our Sanofi shares. There is no emergency. You see our cash balance today is very high. I don't know what do with the cash. I know what to do with the cash next quarter, but I have &#x20AC;$18 billion of cash now and adding more cash, well honestly this is not very good for me. So, I try to make my life easier and continue in sales of Sanofi shares gradually.</p>
          <p>But I would say that if there is an opportunity for us to sell at a very good price for both deals for instance, I am open to that. There is no reason for us not to be, but currently the share price is quite low, I would say.</p>

          <p>Hello, it's Bertrand Hod&#xE9;e from Kepler. Good afternoon Patrick.</p>
          <p>I have a follow-up question on Nigeria. We heard from Shell that Train 6 now was working at full actual capacity. And given the improvement in the situation there, do you see a possible &#x2013; I would say resurrection of your LNG options there, naming Train 7 or possibly Brass LNG? And what's your current thought on those projects right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are still positive that there is room enough for additional train of LNG in Nigeria. Now, it is &#x2013; the question mark is where do you locate this train.</p>
          <p>It seems that politically speaking Brass LNG is more favored than the 7 train of Nigeria LNG and this is fine for us. So, I would say that Brass is on top of the list today. The CD is completed, the Code 400 has been launched already. So, this project is quite advanced in comparison to Train 7, I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since we enter into this play beginning of 2011, our intention remains the same, to increase our production from the current production which is about 30,000 barrel of oil equivalent to 45,000 barrel per day of oil equivalent within 3 years. That's the idea.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>On Block 15/06, I think the best thing you have to do is to refer to the operator, which is Eni. Sorry for that answer but I think it is the only answer I can give you.</p>
          <p>On Block 32, let's meet by 2012, something like this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil, good afternoon, Patrick. My question is on the joint ventures you've done in the United States, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and then the onshore conventional &#x2013; unconventional gas with Chesapeake. I am just curious, is the intention there to simply gain exposure to those regions or is the longer term goal to actually become more of an operator in those areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can notice that I am talking about the situation pre-Macondo, that our intention was to withdraw from the Gulf of Mexico as an operator.</p>
          <p>The question mark in the joint venture we have with Cobalt in the Gulf of Mexico is will Cobalt be in a position to continue and be the operator. I don't have the answer at that stage, and we will see how to manage the operation according to the situation. I'm sorry, but I don't have the situation exactly today, and I don't know if Cobalt will be able to continue and operate.</p>
          <p>On the Chesapeake play, I'll remind you that our objective was to get some experience in shale gas and to further have some development or at least some exploration in other areas than in the U.S., namely in France when we have an acreage both in Montelimar and we also have some acreage in Argentina. And that was the idea, to get some experience and then to develop this experience in other fields. And we also &#x2013; sorry, we also have an acreage in Denmark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but it doesn't sound like your intention was to necessarily become an operator within the North American portion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everybody, Sergio Molisani from UniCredit. Two questions on the Upstream, if I may. The first one is, it looks like you recorded an operating expenses increase in the Upstream division in U.S. dollar. Can you tell me if there is something that related to the technical cost or non-operational factors.</p>
          <p>And secondly can you give us an update of the numbers you gave us on the update on the second quarter results. In particular, the net profit per barrel of the five start-ups compared to the average of the same portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About our technical costs, for the nine first months of 2010, our technical costs are up about $1 per barrel of oil equivalent compared to 2009. And this is mainly due to higher DD&amp;A; we were investing more in the past, and higher exploration costs. In 2010 technical costs should increase as we do not anticipate further OpEx reduction. And that DD&amp;A will continue to increase.</p>
          <p>On the second question you asked, on the profitability of our five major projects, last quarter Upstream adjusted net operating income per barrel was close to $13 barrel of oil equivalent. And in aggregate the five major projects had on this third quarter adjusted net operating income of more than $20 per barrel of oil equivalent. This clearly shows that our projects are contributing to our profitable growth.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, all of you for your interesting question, and I do appreciate the Lucas question on top of that. Now let me summarize with you a few final comments. First, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. In terms of delivery the most important part is combination of the year-to-date production growth and the increase in unit profitability that I was just explaining you. Second, the pace of development is improving. And I'm referring to the new projects that we are launching including the acquisition we've made and also to the increase in asset sales that will be used to help fund this activity. And as a last point, particularly for the perspective of the Q4, we are confident about the future in large part because the balance sheet is very good at that time. So, thank you very much all of you and have a good weekend. Bye-bye.</p>
