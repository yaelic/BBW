          <p>Good day and welcome to the Interim Report January to September 2011. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christine Ritz, Head of Group Investor Relations, Volkswagen AG. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Volkswagen's conference call on the results for the period January to September 2011 based on via talk and the interim report we published this morning. Joining me today are Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Finance and Controlling; and Christian Klingler, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing.</p>
          <p>You can follow the webcast and download the chart from our website, www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by email or called in. Following the presentation, we will first take questions from analysts and then at the end, we will make sure there's time for questions from journalists.</p>
          <p>Let me now pass you over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and allow me to add my warm welcome to those of you joining this call today. It is my pleasure to be able to report on a strong performance over the first nine months of this year.</p>
          <p>We delivered more than 6 million cars for the first time, an increase of 14.1%, which equates to just over 2.5 times the rate of the global market. The volume increase drove sales revenue up 25.6% with operating profit up just over &#x20AC;4 billion to &#x20AC;9 billion and beating the full-year figure for 2010.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax more than tripled to &#x20AC;16.6 billion, benefiting as well from strong earnings from our equity investments and also from our revised valuation of the put/call rights we hold on the balance of Porsche Zwischenholding.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, this was necessary as the Board of Management had concluded in September that the planned merger cannot be implemented within the timeframe provided for in the comprehensive agreement.</p>
          <p>Automotive net liquidity ended the quarter at over &#x20AC;21 billion. We had a busy quarter with regard to the regulatory reviews on our offer with respect to MAN SE. This process has moved forward as scheduled. As soon as we get the last required regulatory approval, we will then move to settle the offer to the shareholders that tendered their shares.</p>
          <p>Full consolidation of MAN's results within the Volkswagen Group will begin from closing of the transaction. We will come back to the operational point concerning our results in more detail a little bit later.</p>
          <p>For now, I would like to hand you over to Mr. Klingler, who will take you through our excellent sales performance.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to the conference call from me also. This first chart shows development of the world car market by quarter in comparison to the same quarter of the previous year. The growth recorded last year was mainly due to recovery of the economic environment on the one hand and government support measures in many markets from the other.</p>
          <p>In some markets, the support measures expired last year, which explains declining growth rates. Therefore, on a quarter-by-quarter comparison, we see that the global market lost some of its growth momentum in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Despite a high comparison base from a year-ago and a more challenging economic environment in many countries, the global market recorded further positive growth rates in the first three quarters of 2011. However, in order to evaluate the relative development of the global market, in comparison to the last so called normal year of 2007, is appropriate, what you see at the next chart.</p>
          <p>The positive influence of the support measures by the government in many markets led to significant market rebound in the second half of 2009. As the incentives in many markets, essentially in Europe, were phased out, the rebound continued on a slower pace through 2010.</p>
          <p>Improving economic conditions in the major markets as well as a strong increase of demand in China and India lifted the market above the normal year 2007 during 2010. Continuously improving conditions in major European markets and expiring incentives in China for the strong fourth quarter in 2010.</p>
          <p>In early 2011, the market lost some of the positive momentum as some of the emerging economies increased interest rates in order to prevent the economies from overheating. Some support programs, like for example France, were phased out. Conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the situation in Japan, resulted in some negative impacts for the market.</p>
          <p>In addition, the industry struggled with supply shortages due to the disruptions in Japan. As a result, the market growth slowed in the second quarter. In the third quarter of the year, despite the great relief in supply chain, the market for us remained muted with the sovereign debt crisis dominating the news, especially Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Consumers are more and more unsettled, putting the markets under increasing pressure. However, the effects differ by region. While the German market remained strong, markets in Southern Europe are weaker. In addition, growth in some emerging markets has cooled. So, we continue to closely monitor this elevated level of market risks.</p>
          <p>For 2011, our latest forecast suggests the global market will remain above the pre-crisis level of 2007, around about 5% higher than 2010. In the last quarter of this year, the projected improvement in the major growth markets are likely to remain muted. However, we are confident that the year 2011 will have an all-time record level in market conditions.</p>
          <p>If you now go to the next chart and turn to our own performance, in the first three quarters of 2011, our deliveries to customers have shown a double-digit growth. The Volkswagen Group continued to outperform the overall car market in the third quarter of 2011. We gained global market share in the first three quarters of 2011, supported mainly by the group performance in China, Russia, India, as well as in Germany and the U.S.</p>
          <p>You can see in the next chart the market performance of the regions around the world in direct comparison to the performance of the Volkswagen Group in the first three quarters of 2011. With the exceptions of Central and Eastern Europe as well as South America, the Volkswagen Group has outperformed the market in all other regions worldwide.</p>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe, we increased our market share in many markets, including Russia. The remarkable growth of the Russian market led to an increase of its relative weighting within the region. However, as our market share in Russia is below the Group's regional leverage, the overall market share in Central European &#x2013; and Eastern Europe, sorry, declined.</p>
          <p>In South America, our market share declined slightly. The Brazilian market increased in relative terms more than our &#x2013; the deliveries. Currently, the competitive situation there is challenging with new players in the market and strong marketing activities of our competitors.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, despite the market contraction of 1.1%, the Volkswagen Group recorded a positive result as we achieved an increase in our deliveries of 8.6%. As already mentioned, some of the major markets in the region still suffer declines following the end of the support measures and generally weak economies. In particular, the Spanish market contracted heavily by 20.7%.</p>
          <p>Now, on the next page, we will take a look at the performance of the individual brands of the Group. In the first three quarters of 2011, all our volume brands achieved an increase in terms of sales. And for the Group, total deliveries to customers exceeded last year's level by 14.1%.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Passenger Car deliveries were up by an impressive 12.3% to more than 3.8 million cars, driven by strong demand in China, India, the United States, as well as Russia.</p>
          <p>Audi deliveries rose by 17.4% compared to last year to 973,000 cars. &#x160;KODA expanded deliveries up to 656,000 &#x2013; 665,000, sorry, cars mainly due to the strong demand in China and in Russia. SEAT as well as Bentley have also managed to expand deliveries. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and Scania have benefited from pent-up investment demand in many major markets as businesses renew fleets in 2011.</p>
          <p>Let us now take a look at a few highlights on some of our new models, which will provide a good base for our sales performance in the coming months.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen up! is a small, great car for Volkswagen, good value, and likeable, intuitive and simple, pure Volkswagen all worth makes sense. Shown at the IAA in Frankfurt, the Volkswagen up! will hit the roads in November this year.</p>
          <p>With introduction of the new Audi A6 Avant, the exquisite driving experience of the A6 Saloon is enhanced yet again, but innovative features such as dynamic steering and quattro with sport differential. The Audi A6 Avant was introduced on the markets last month. We already launched Volkswagen Amarok. It's enhanced by a single-cab version. Moreover, an 8-gear automatic gearbox combined with the 132 kilowatt bi-turbo TDI engine will be launched for the double-cab version in 2012.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Amarok is ready for all terrains, tested by Dakar. The &#x160;KODA Rapid is a value-for-money car with high build quality for the Indian market. It is comfortable car for the family with an elegant design and an efficient drive. The Rapid will be introduced in Indian market by the end of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Klingler. Now, let's switch back to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch for some more details on the key elements of our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first nine months of 2011, sales revenue increased by 25.6% to &#x20AC;116.3 billion. Higher volume was clearly the most significant driver at &#x20AC;19.3 billion, which also includes the impact from the inclusion of Porsche Holding Salzburg from the 1st of March.</p>
          <p>Pricing improved by &#x20AC;0.3 billion for the first nine months. Mix, including both product and country mix, contributed &#x20AC;1.7 billion to our performance. Exchange rates continue to trend from the half year report with a year-to-date negative of &#x20AC;0.8 billion having turned from a small plus at the start of the year. Scania reported a &#x20AC;1.5 billion improvement in revenue. Volkswagen Financial Services also improved, up &#x20AC;1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The increase in sales was also the major factor behind the improvement in the operating results, which increased from &#x20AC;4.8 billion to &#x20AC;9 billion in the first nine months. Volume, together with price and mix effects, came to a total positive of &#x20AC;4.7 billion. Key drivers were volume and the higher mix of cars with the benefit of a richer equipment content.</p>
          <p>Currency, after hedging, was a net &#x20AC;0.3 billion headwind. While the U.S. dollar was negative, positive contributions from other currencies reduced the impact. For the first nine months, we were able to reduce our product costs by &#x20AC;0.8 billion; thanks to the efforts of our global purchasing teams in association with their engineering colleagues.</p>
          <p>Fixed cost and depreciation increased by &#x20AC;1.3 billion, as the ramp up of the additions to our production network, including the first cars from our new plant in Chattanooga and higher engineering costs as we invest in our future, continued.</p>
          <p>Scania increased earnings, after purchase price accounting, by &#x20AC;0.1 billion, building on an excellent 2010 result. And finally, our Volkswagen Financial Services division added a further &#x20AC;0.2 billion. In total, the operating result came in at &#x20AC;9 billion for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash flow in the Automotive Division. At &#x20AC;12.4 billion, operating cash flow was up 7.9% over the first nine months of 2010. On the investment side, cash invested increased to &#x20AC;8.6 billion, which includes &#x20AC;3.3 billion for the purchase of Porsche Holding Salzburg activities as well as the stake in SGL Carbon as we announced in the first quarter, as well as the increase of our voting rights in MAN to 30.47% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are investing in the MQB Toolkit, focused in particular on the first models that will be launched in 2012 as well as booking investments in our new small family of cars, where we are in the ramp-up phase right now.</p>
          <p>Excluding one-offs, cash invested increased by &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;5.3 billion. Our CapEx ratio at 4.1% was just over the 4% we recorded last year. As the year closes, the ratio could rise to between 5% and 5.5%.</p>
          <p>Despite the strategic investment I just mentioned, net cash flow over the first nine months for the Automotive Division came in positive at &#x20AC;3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Staying with the Automotive Division, net liquidity is up a rounded &#x20AC;2.5 billion on the year-end 2010 to a new record of &#x20AC;21.2 billion. This strong financial foundation supports our steps along the Strategy 2018 path and ensures we have adequate liquidity to pursue our strategic goals, including the integrated automotive group with Porsche in combination with a strong financial rating.</p>
          <p>Please also bear in mind that we expect an outflow of around &#x20AC;3.4 billion in the fourth quarter through the settlement of our offer to MAN SE shareholders. And, while commenting on the settlement after transaction, I would also like to add that in the coming quarter, we expect to see a three-digit million non-cash charge in the profit and loss statement from the reclassification of our equity stake to a fully consolidated company. This charge, in essence, relates to the current market value of the existing stake we held in MAN before the tender offer.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the financial performance of our brands. For the first nine months, the Volkswagen Passenger Car brand posted earnings of &#x20AC;3.3 million, more than double the prior-year period. The brand achieved a strong 4.7% margin in the third quarter and 4.6% over the nine-month period.</p>
          <p>Audi's margin too impressed at an excellent 13.1% in the quarter, meaning that the margins has been over 10% in every quarter this year. A &#x20AC;4 billion operating result year-to-date further cemented Audi's excellent earnings track record.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;575 million, &#x160;KODA once again banked a very good performance. SEAT's loss halved the teeth of a very tough Southern European market. Bentley improved markedly with a second quarterly operating result in the black. The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles more than doubled their result anchored on solid growth.</p>
          <p>Scania reported a good result of just over &#x20AC;1 billion. The other line in the chart includes the elimination of inter-company sales as well as the purchase price accounting charge with regard to our consolidation of Scania. In addition, since March the 1st, the results for Porsche Holding Salzburg, net of PPA charge are included here too.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Financial Services reported an improved result of &#x20AC;876 million, up &#x20AC;200 million resulting from a higher number of contracts and an extension of activities. Combining the Automotive and Financial Services divisions gives a total operating profit of &#x20AC;9 billion for the first nine months. This brings me to the financial result, which for the first nine months came to a positive &#x20AC;7.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now given the magnitude of the result, allow me to take a little time to go through the key drivers in detail. To begin with just a short reminder that here we include the results from our equity-accounted investments, changes in the valuations of derivatives as well as interest-related costs.</p>
          <p>The company's consolidated equity recorded a strongly positive result, reflecting again the excellent performances of our Chinese joint ventures, which reported a proportional operating profit of &#x20AC;1.9 billion as well as our 49.9% holding in Porsche Zwischenholding, which after PPA reported a clearly positive net result.</p>
          <p>The respective put and call rights, with regards to our planned integration with Porsche, are valued as with any derivative instrument on a regular basis. At the end of Q2, evaluation stood at &#x20AC;3.9 billion, primarily based on strong underlying earnings projections for Porsche AG and a merger likelihood of 50%.</p>
          <p>In September, we announced that the merger of Volkswagen and Porsche SE was no longer expected within the timeframe of the comprehensive agreement. As a result, the likelihood of a merger for the purposes of the put/call rights valuation was reduced to zero. This had a significantly positive effect, which was further boosted by lower interest rates. The impact in the third quarter financial result is a positive &#x20AC;4.7 billion, giving a net positive &#x20AC;6.8 billion for the period January to September 2011.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, the Board of Management is currently analyzing whether other potential courses of action exist for achieving the goal of creating an integrated automotive group of Volkswagen and Porsche, in addition to the put/call options laid down in the Comprehensive Agreement. The result of this examination will be presented to the Supervisory Board before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2010, we purchased the stake in Suzuki of 19.9%. In the course of the third quarter, we have reclassified our stake in Suzuki from equity to fair value, reflecting the announcement by Suzuki of its intention to terminate the master agreement and the lack of progress on co-operation.</p>
          <p>This change in accounting treatment should in no way be taken as a softening of our position and we have no plans to reduce our stake. This accounting charge change had a net negative impact of &#x20AC;263 million in the financial result, based on our mark-to-market valuation.</p>
          <p>So, to bring this part of the call today to a close, just a few words on our outlook statement, which you can read in the interim report in full, with deliveries and revenue after nine months already close to the full-year 2010 numbers and operating profit already ahead. 2011 will clearly be a record year for the Volkswagen Group.</p>
          <p>What makes our Group unique is our brand portfolio. This and the management model, which underpins it, is one of our key competitive advantages. Our growing presence in all key regions of the world is another, particularly as some of the older more mature markets have been slowing.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, the modular toolkit system is having an increasingly positive effect on the Group's cost structure. This does of course take some not inconsiderable effort and you should expect some upfront impact in the coming quarters. At the same time, our brands are continuing to introduce fascinating new models, thus further expanding our strong position.</p>
          <p>As we move into 2012 in the midst of a global economy facing uncertainty with a strong balance sheet and improved cost structure together with high flexibility in production and a strong product portfolio. With the leading edge in technology, we consider ourselves well prepared for the challenges ahead. Our performance in 2011 provides us with an excellent platform to continue on our Strategy 2018 path.</p>
          <p>We aim to be the leading automotive group in the world qualitatively, quantitatively and, of course, financially.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, thank you very much. We will now begin with the questions-and-answer part of today's conference call, starting first with the questions of analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will now take our first question from Jochen Gehrke from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just three questions, if I may. First of all, with regards to the Porsche option and the communication that we should expect in the coming months, does the fact that you have booked now a multi-billion profit change your thought process versus exercising the goal towards second &#x2013; continuing to pursue some sort of merger. Does this have any impact at all? And if not why are you just not exercising the goal now, this is so deeply in the money, also three years down the line?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with regards to pricing, yesterday, one of your competitors noted the change in the pricing environment in September. When we look at Q3, obviously, Volkswagen didn't have a major sequential change. Can you confirm this that the European pricing outlook is worsening and should we, therefore, expect negative impact from the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then finally, with regards to MQB, I think you were rather cautious, most recently, when it came to whether 2012 would have a net positive impact with cross positives on the cost side being potentially compensated by the start-up costs. Is this still true or as we are approaching closer to the launch of this project, have you become more comfortable with the impact in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jochen. You have three questions for us. The first refers to the put/call option and the structure for &#x2013; in using a put or the call option, if this has any impact, because the call is in the money, if that has any impact on exercising actually, the call option?</p>
          <p>The second question refers to the pricing environment in Q3, if we can give there some details and also a little bit on outlook with regard to the fourth quarter, and if we can confirm that pricing is worsening and if we do expect here a negative effect coming.</p>
          <p>And the last question is with regard to the introduction of the MQB. You are mentioning that we were quite cautious, if we can expect a net positive impact in 2012 due to the ramp-up costs with regard to the MQB. If we can give here a little bit more insight or how it will &#x2013; what can we really expect next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, if you allow, I would start with the question about pricing. It is true that the European market in 2011 were shaped by the phase-out of several environment incentive programs. So, for example in France and I think some of the French manufacturers have particularly insisted on the pricing issue. However, sales promotion activities within the competitive environment have been stable in major markets of Southern Europe as well as for example, in Germany.</p>
          <p>If you come to the third quarter, the feeling from us and our talk about general market is that, yes, there has been a more insecurity in the market; yes, the customers have had more concerns about what will happen; and yes, some of the competitors had, in some of the markets, much more efforts to do in the pricing.</p>
          <p>What is concerning us, we have increased our prices in the third quarter. If you now come to the perspective with the fourth quarter in general about the market, we believe that there is a strong impact in Europe about the concerns of a possible debt crisis. So, some of our customers are a bit worried to buy the cars. This is much more true, by the way, for so-called end-customers, by the way they are the same than the others than fleet customers.</p>
          <p>So, we believe that the conditions will stay more complicated in the last quarter 2011 than it was even in the third quarter. These market conditions will be impacted by general solutions on this debt crisis issue and we feel that we have relatively good base for continuing our way, which is in pricing, let's say, keeping the prices on a reasonable level.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we are working like everybody in market conditions or in the market itself and therefore, if it's necessary, we also would have to think about if we go to some pricing activities. But as you know, we are always prudent on the pricing issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me continue with the question on Porsche and whether our thought process got influenced by anything &#x2013; like the numbers I was just introducing. Let me, first of all, just to avoid any misunderstanding here say that essentially all parties remain committed to the goal of creating what we call the integrated automotive group with Porsche and we are absolutely convinced that this will take place. That's, first of all, the fundamental point.</p>
          <p>Secondly, for the reasons mentioned, the merger cannot go forward 2011 with &#x2013; which was one of the options sitting in our Comprehensive Agreement. So, as long as it stays within the Comprehensive Agreement, it's clearly now on the side of this put/call option scheme, clearly carrying the disadvantage, which you are aware of, which is that for either company, it means that realistically execution can only happen in the year 2014.</p>
          <p>Now, I think this is a situation where for a reason, management has taken a decision to enter into this thought process to try to identify alternatives to that if there are alternatives available. And this is still a process, which we do execute. There is, so far at least, no new information I can feed into this.</p>
          <p>Second question on the MQB, the platform, and also there &#x2013; just to make sure that there is not any fog created, you're well aware that we are committed in terms of one-off expenditures in terms of unit costs, in terms of engineered hours to achieve pretty ambitious target and fortunately, I can say that after most of the process has gone its way, we will reach these targets.</p>
          <p>Now, the reason why we are, take your word, cautious for 2012 is a very simple one. First of all, we're talking about almost a group-wide introduction of this platform, which, of course, is having a very major effect to a lot of production plants in the Volkswagen Group. So, this is one important point to have in mind. That's also why I hinted towards some upfront costs until we start producing the cars on that platform.</p>
          <p>The second reason being that the volume, which we can produce of cars sitting on the MQB platform in 2012, is rather limited. Now, this will change in 2013 and already 2014, we will pass over the two million mark in terms of cars built on the MQB platform. So, cut a long story short, we are very much looking forward to see this becoming effective, also to read the effects in the P&amp;L clear, there is some way to go. And again in 2012, the effects for the reason that volume will be limited can only be limited.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions from my side. First of all, it strikes me in your others line that the others &#x2013; that the burden in this line is getting higher. Is it due to higher inter-segment revenue just or is there anything else included? And should we expect also in the next few quarters a similar high burden in this line?</p>
          <p>Then the other issue is on provisions. I am seeing that you have increased again provisions in Q3. I think it was in other provisions, &#x20AC;1.2 billion, and also you have increased again your pension provisions. So, what is the precise reasons behind it and I assume that the pension provisions have been booked against equity directly and not &#x2013; that's not effective in the result right? And, yeah, and then the last question is with regard to MAN, you say also that you expect approval from China in the next few weeks, so that means that we probably see in Q4 already full consolidation of MAN. Could you tell us &#x2013; could you give us already some hint on the potential negative impact coming from the PPA amortization? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Horst. You have three questions for us. The first one refers to the line other and the higher figure there and if we can expect a similar high burden in the coming quarters and especially you would like to see some details what is behind that figure.</p>
          <p>And then, the second question refers to provisions and if we can explain some reasons for increased provisions.</p>
          <p>And the last question refers to the MAN offer and the expected approval by China and if we can here give you some details, which refer to the impact by the expected PPA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's get started with the other line in the operating result. And, of course, there are a number of effects included. One being the elimination of inter-company profits. Second, also important point is the PPA charge on the Scania and the Porsche Holding Salzburg. I think the second point stands for itself. So, let me have a little comment on the first point.</p>
          <p>I think what needs to be understood and if you run your models, which you should build into these models is that if you look back a year or so, it's very clear and we clearly said this always that the stock situation is far too low relative to the intended volume development. Though essentially this means and fortunately we're able to help my colleague a little bit, in the meantime still we run a bit short of operating at an, what we call, ideal level of stock. But there was some stock built up, which is absolutely necessary to support the level of volume, which we execute in these months now.</p>
          <p>Clearly speaking, if you produce to keep cars on stock, it means that finally the margin sitting on that car is not being realized with the third party. And this means, very clearly in the consequence, it's increasing into company profits, which needs to be eliminated. That's one part. The second, as I said, is the PPA charge sitting on that line. Also consequently, as we &#x2013; if ever, then only slightly we'll continue to build up stock, the incremental development on that line should remain rather limited for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So, on the second question, provisions built-up, if you allow me to stay very short there, it should also come with no surprise that as we are building up volume and as a number of provisions, just simply speaking, proportionally built up with the volume, it reflects to a quite decent part the volume development.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pension provision, as you already rightly said, the development does reflect a change in the interest rates we underlined for the pension provisions. And the system we have in place means that this is being reflected in the equity. It doesn't have an effect on the P&amp;L side.</p>
          <p>Fourth question, yes, we do expect, still within this year in the next weeks to come, the approval &#x2013; the final approval on MAN. So, we have then complete merger control clearance, which leads to the full consolidation of MAN. And consequently, there is a new purchase price allocation to be done, which is going to hit on a 12-month basis, our P&amp;L next year then with a three-digit amount.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a small follow-up on inventories. You said you reduced a bit under-stocking. I remember in previous conference calls, you have stated you are under-stocked by around &#x20AC;150,000, &#x20AC;200,000 excluding China. So, what is the remaining under-stocking now still that is left?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Firstly, just on a point of information, the reason that the related company line is so weak in the third quarter, it's down on 2010, is due to that charge against the Suzuki valuation, right, of &#x20AC;260 million? And I think I heard you say that you would do something like the same in the fourth quarter for MAN, assuming that that one got away in that time.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is, if I look at the related party disclosures, the supplies and services rendered by you are now running at well over &#x20AC;3 billion per quarter. I wonder if you just be able to say, is that driven more by higher parts export sales to China or is it some &#x2013; simply parts for Cayenne and Panamera building up, in the current term, boom in Porsche sales? Thanks. Well, they've lost me.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, there. Michael Tyndall from Barclays Capital. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions, the first actually relate to the Korean manufacturers. Your CEO seems have taken out a bit of an interest in Hyundai and I note that we've now got a free-trade agreement with Korea and Europe. I'm just wondering whether or not you've noticed any change in the behavior of the Korean OEMs over the last quarter and whether you are changing your opinion of them going forward in terms of seeing them as being a tougher competitors going forward?</p>
          <p>The second question just relates to the up! Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, you mentioned recently that the costs were extraordinarily low. I just wonder if you could give us some feel for what the profitability looks like and whether or not that profitability is a function of you reaching full volumes and when you might expect to reach full volumes on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Michael, you have two questions for us. The first one refers to the Korean manufacturers and if the change in the free-trade agreement, if that has any impact in the behavior of such competitors.</p>
          <p>And the second question refers to the profitability of the up! If we can give you some more details and then when actually we have &#x2013; we see the full volumes there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll try to answer the first question about the Hyundai. I think we have, since a certain time, mentioned continuously that clearly one of our main competitors is Toyota and clearly one another is Hyundai. And if I talk Hyundai, of course, it's Hyundai Group integrating Kia.</p>
          <p>So, what we can see on the worldwide level is that they do a pretty aggressive job that would bring a lot of new cars with good quality into the markets and that they take a very strong advantage from a little bit bizarre situation, which is in Korea itself, as they have a more or less protected market essentially with bigger cars and the market share is a little bit higher than 70%. So, it's a 70%. So, the majority of the money they make there and as a consequence they have a good possibility to export it on the low cost price.</p>
          <p>So, I now come to Europe, let's be honest, we have not seen a dramatic change in the last quarter due to the change in the import duties. We have always said that we think that it is, for the automotive business, maybe not the wisest position to open up the European market for Europe &#x2013; for Korean manufacturers and not being &#x2013; having the same opportunity and possibility to have an open market in Korea, which is pretty evident as I would say so. The import market in Korea is still extremely limited.</p>
          <p>We do take them very serious. We see that &#x2013; we see &#x2013; we believe that it will come more aggressive to Europe and we believe as well that it will take advantage out of this new import duty situation. We are very prudent on that. On the other side, we are lobbying as well that European governments to understand that automotive business is one of the key and core businesses in Europe and there is some needs to defend as well the interest as long as it's a, let's say, an equitable partnership, which means if we open us, they have to open as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the up! model, which we are very proud about it, has been one of the, if not the star, on the Frankfurt Motor Show. I said that the &#x2013; following a question on the margin that I am not afraid about this, because our engineers managed to establish, let me call it, adequate cost. Now, as the guy here responsible for finance, you should not expect me to say job done. I would say there is still a good potential to move to cost further down.</p>
          <p>I think essentially speaking, it is a true Volkswagen with the right positioning and we are able to make money with this that I think is a very key point and I know that few of you have been doubtful on this.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of when will we be able to reach the maximum output there? First comment here, which also should not come as a surprise in similar ways with the other cars also with this car, there won't be any compromise on the quality side. So, this is very clear, quality comes first. So, limitation will not come by the market, because the model was extremely well received. But we will build up volume following the achievements in terms of continuous top quality for this car.</p>
          <p>Then, we should not forget we're looking at a six-digit amount of cars volume wise. So, it means this will take several months down the road until we are there, but I think we all feel very excited, very comfortable that we'll get there. But still, there is some way to go</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, good afternoon. Stephen Reitman from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, I'm in London. Two questions. Could you, first of all, comment on China, particularly you've seen a growing number &#x2013; growing share of sales from Audi coming from imported cars, which are presumably higher price and higher value. Do you see that trend continuing over the next quarters in terms of forward orders you are seeing?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you comment as well about how the Chattanooga plant is bedding down and what implications that has, plus the new models you're launching there and Beetle and others for the profitability of the North American region 2012 onwards? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have two questions actually, Stephen. So, the first one, you are asking for comment on China. You are seeing an increasing share of imported cars from Audi, if that is the trend or if that trend would continue, if we can give you some more insight.</p>
          <p>And next question is with regard to the U.S. How Chattanooga is bedding down? How the new models and profitability is developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if we talk about China and the Audi sales there, in general, the Chinese market is still on the reasonable pace and we see in general an increase of the, so called, premium brands there. So, this is, I think, the first remark, which is important to keep in mind.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you look for the, so-called, general businesses, the CKD business, which is the locally produced one, we have had a very strong performance from 2010 to 2011 and we're keeping on at a good pace.</p>
          <p>It is true that the, so-called, FBU business, which is the import business, has seen nice &#x2013; very nice growth rates, which is as well, but not only due to the success of A8, which has been introduced there &#x2013; which is very much accepted by the Chinese customers, but as well to the other cars we have, like the Q7 and so forth. This is on a very strong demand. And coming back to your question, we believe that tendency could pretty well continue in the last quarter as well.</p>
          <p>It's important to understand that the competitors like BMW, Mercedes are as well strongly present. And therefore, we will do two things what we need to do to keep our position on a high level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we now come to Chattanooga, the Chattanooga plant is the home of the American Passat, which we have launched in the end of September. This is a model which has been particularly made for the North American region, but we have worked a long time to be very much in fit of what the customers want and as well as to have a base, which is in a sweet spot of the competitors.</p>
          <p>So, first, just for the understanding, this segment is one of the biggest segment in the United States. It's developing reasonably okay and is basically one of the core segments of passenger cars. So, we have seen a very good ramp-up curve up to now from the Chattanooga plant. And I have to admit that from the results of the first weeks, we are extremely positive. We have a very good launch made in the first three weeks and we have done there &#x2013; we have received that the acceptance of the customers for the car is good.</p>
          <p>So, we are winning tests against our direct competitors like Toyota and we're gaining a strong sales momentum as the car and its advertising campaign is very well accepted. Maybe if you remember that we have had through the Super Bowl, our small spot with this Darth Vader. It's the, by the way, the most successful sport ever done in any media since the beginning and we've used it, of course, as well here for the launch.</p>
          <p>So, if you ask us how we are seeing the tendencies after these three, four, five weeks, first, we see dealers in full enthusiasm. Second, we see customers, which are really liking the cars. And third, we have to admit that the &#x2013; at least from the starting point of the car, we have a very good feeling about the prospectives.</p>
          <p>In the same time, we are having to say that we will launch &#x2013; we have launched the Beetle in the United States and up to now, we see as well here a very good acceptance from the first glance, knowing that there is a period of time where the market &#x2013; where the cars in the market is a little bit smaller. So, in general, Volkswagen in the United States seems to be back. The customers are there and we get, let's say, good signs of getting comforted in our goals, which we have in our 2018 Strategy.</p>

          <p>We'll now take our next question from Fraser Hill from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon. I actually have two questions. First question was also on the Audi imports. Could you actually give us a number on the imports? I mean as far as I can see it, looks to me as if maybe 10% of your Audi units sold in China last year were imported. Just wondered how that progressed and particularly whether you've seen that growth rate pick up significantly in the third quarter. I know that you mentioned in your statement an 80% growth in those imported units, but could you just actually give us the number of units that you are now actually importing?</p>
          <p>And would you agree with an analysis that you're making certainly somewhere closer to a mid-to-high teens, I would say maybe a &#x20AC;15,000 to &#x20AC;20,000 per vehicle profit on those imported units, if I just look at your pricing differential on something like the Q7 relative to a typical Audi margin? And that being the case, does this explain why you're seeing the Audi margin continue to progress so well in the third quarter?</p>
          <p>The next question I've got is on your China business as it relates to the associates line. Obviously, you had a pretty good pick-up in the proportionate operating profits that you disclosed. And again, if I look at that, I think it was something like &#x20AC;746 million of proportionate operating profit in Q3 versus &#x20AC;600 million in Q2. So, again, you are adding profits at a rate of about &#x20AC;3,000 per vehicle, where typically that business of yours in terms of just the core VW business in China tends to contribute somewhere closer to &#x20AC;1,000 per vehicle. So, what was really the factor behind that sudden leap in profitably per unit through your associates line? Was it just economies of scale or pricing or what was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Fraser. You have interesting questions for us. And I can assure you that we cannot answer all your details you want to know. And good, first question refers again to Audi imports, if we can tell absolute number of units we have imported in the third quarter and you are also interested in the margin we achieve with these cars.</p>
          <p>And the second question also refers to the China business and the earnings per unit we do achieve and if we can also give you some more details, which are the reasons behind, at least, your calculation you did for the earnings per unit, if we can give you some more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you were expecting already the answer that we cannot disclose these details. I only can say, to give you a little bit of a support that compared with last year, Audi's imports will be significantly higher on the basis of stable pricing. It's clear that we're trying to keep the balance of serving this important market, but, of course, also to continue to serve well other markets, which is to say that the fundamental potential for Audi would be much greater. But for a number of reasons, we do not want to explore 100% of that potential. So, our policy is very clearly to maintain a stable price environment, not only for Audi, but also for Audi.</p>
          <p>Then to your second question, I can only say also, without giving the details here, but fundamentally speaking, it's clear that between the quarters, there is always some fluctuation based on the fact that looking at a model portfolio of somewhere over 30 different models, it goes without saying that it's heavily influenced by new model introductions by the facelifts being done, production shutdowns to build the framework for new models coming in. If you recall the situation we had for Audi, for example in February, where we had to prepare for the launch of the new models.</p>
          <p>So, that's the kind of things, which do influence the quarterly development. Otherwise, again, we fortunately can say that the volume development is very stable for Audi and for Volkswagen in China and the same holds true for the pricing side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. This is Thierry Huon speaking from Exane BNP. Two question if I may. First of all, according to what you said about the up!, my understanding is that the up! will probably giving birth to a family of products. Is that means that we'll have another modular toolkit specifically for this family and this type of car in the future? And second question, could you give us some details about the contribution of Porsche distribution we had in the third quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Thierry. We didn't get your last question actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, my last question was about Porsche distribution, Salzburg, and to know what was the contribution in Q3 numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Okay, so you have two questions, whereas the last question is the Porsche distribution, Salzburg, PHS, what was the contribution in Q3?</p>
          <p>And then you were asking about the up! and the family of possible products we are maybe thinking of and if we have &#x2013; are thinking of a modular toolkit for this type of cars that we want maybe to develop such a toolkit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, maybe, I'll start first with the up! And the question is there a thinking about of making a toolkit comparable to the MQB or to the MLB. First, as you know, we are in direct launch activation of our up! as well as the launch of the cars of the other brands. Of course, if you have a nice concept like this, you think on two directions. One is the internationalization of the concept. So, we do not exclude, for example, to have a thinking about South America on that kind of car.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we always said that it's a family. As we have seen as well in the [IA] I don't know if you have been there, so you have seen the several possibilities for this kind of cars. And we believe that in the next years, we will have one another idea based on the technology to bring additional models to the market.</p>
          <p>The up! is from our feeling right in the &#x2013; first is right in the time. Second, it is for us coming back into a segment, which is very important in Europe and where we have left essentially the place to other manufacturers, mainly Italian and to some extent French as well Japanese ones.</p>
          <p>And it will give us, at least, in our feeling a good possibility to come back into that segment and having a good attractiveness for our customers. It's as well important from the strategic orientation as it's an entry car, but not an entry car, which is not a Volkswagen, it is a Volkswagen and gives us the possibility then for selling up! to other models. So, we are happy about that. Directions of our customers is, up to now, very good and we will launch the car in the market in the next few weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, if this car is not based upon MQB system, so on which system is this car is based on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a separate toolkit, but as Klingler explained, there will be, looking forward, several derivatives sitting on this toolkit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if you look at the scale effects possible, we'll also have another important instrument to play with. And then to pass on the number for the Porsche Holding Salzburg if that was the question...</p>

          <p>We'll now take our next question from Stuart Pearson from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I just had some, I guess, two or three questions. Firstly, just on the European premium car market, historically, demand of premium cars in Europe does show a relatively strong correlation to the stock market. So, I guess, the dealerships are doing well today, but in general, have you seen any change in premium car demand or the pricing environment in recent months and would you expect that to take place in 2012?</p>
          <p>The second question, actually on used vehicle pricing, I guess as Volkswagen, you have the most complete view of almost any carmaker on those used vehicles projects around the world. Have there been any notable changes in trends in any particular segment that are worth highlighting as we start to see confidence wane? Have we started to see those prices come down at all?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just on Brazil, this is an area you mentioned increasing competition in Q2 and I guess we have seen a lot of news flows of varying type over the last two or three months. I wonder if you could just update us on how the competitive environment has developed there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Stuart. Yee questions for us. The first refers to the European premium car market, if there is any change in demand or with regard to the pricing, also in Germany and if we can give you an outlook also for 2012.</p>
          <p>Then your second question refers to the used vehicle prices, are there any changes, trends also we do see?</p>
          <p>And your last question is related to Brazil and the increased competition, if we can give you an update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, maybe, I'll start with the second question, which is the question, what is happening in general with the tendencies on the used cars market? I would guess if I concentrate in Europe, you feel okay. It is very positive that the used car market over the, let's say, 12, 18 months has developed strongly, path into the right direction. So, we had an increase of the residual values over the last, I would say so, 12, 15 months. I'm now talking about the market. Of course, our branch has been absolutely impacted to that as well positively.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are always very much concerned in keeping residual values stable. So, we try to be as reasonable and as logic in all measurements to do that as well for our brands. If I come now to the development over the last few months, we see that the very positive tendencies, that means the increase of residual values, is now not more on the same level. This does not mean that they have fallen down significantly. It just that means that now they come to a normal pace and, of course, we are very much looking forward how the development will come. There is, in general, a small increase of stocks in the dealer level. So, this is always a first sign that if we want so, the pool market will come to a different situation. And I just feel that now we have more or less a normal situation in the used-car market.</p>
          <p>We are very sensible on the used-car market. We do have a very, I would say so, clear monitoring system and we're really looking into all of the possible first indicators so that we keep on being prudent there. But up to now, at least in the last quarter, we cannot see significant negative impact on the used-car market.</p>
          <p>If I now come to the question about Brazil, it is true that the Brazilian situation in terms of competition is getting rougher. This has several reasons. One is that the growth of the market has gone down in percentage, essentially due to measurements, which have been put in place by the government to reduce inflation. So, therefore, for example, the interest and essentially &#x2013; not only the interest rates, but the interest rate conditions for an end-customer have been changed. So, the cost of a new credit has been increased by more than 20% for a customer.</p>
          <p>We see on the other side an acceleration of new competitors come into the market. We're just giving you an example, I don't if you have heard about the Chinese competitor with the name [Yak]. So, he set into the market through an FBU, which means import business and had a very successful launch there.</p>
          <p>We see as well that our core competitors like, Fiat in that case and General Motors, of course, as well as fighting and we see that the plants of the other manufactures, which has been announced one, two, three years ago will now come to end of construction and the cars are coming step by step into the fields, like for example Toyota and as for Hyundai and Kia.</p>
          <p>So, yes, the market conditions are getting rougher. We will have this certainly, at least, now feeling over the next months to come, the market will go a little bit more soft. And, yes, we are keeping on going to be in the market on a reasonable level without getting an exposure, which is not reasonable on the incentive. So, this is a more or less what I would like to say to Brazil.</p>
          <p>Now, if come to European car market, on the premium car market was essentially a question, I would say so that, as I've said before, the European car market in general has a little bit softened over the last few months. And the consequence, of course, in premium market has had as well, maybe, a small softening tendency. We do not see an important impact up to now, but I will give you one example.</p>
          <p>It's much more localized in regions. For example, in Italy, of course, the actual situation, which is not really very funny for the customers has an impact on the premium market, by the way as well on the volume market on the same level. So, therefore, what we could say is because I think you've said there is a direct relation between stock market and premium markets, this maybe we cannot 100% confirm. Of course, if the stocks are fine, people buy cars in that level have more money. But that is not always the case, because in Europe, for example, a good portion of these cars are company cars. So, it's not only depending on the level what somebody is earning on the stock exchange.</p>
          <p>So, in summary for the European car market, we believe that on the premium level over the last quarter, there has been some softening on some regions and the others none. And as I said before, we are keeping, having &#x2013; we keep having an eye very close to the market conditions, because, of course, there will be maybe some impact over the next few months to come, which are not extremely positive.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Ranjit Unnithan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. So, I'll limit it to one, in terms of cost for next year, if you were to look at the two components of your operating bridge, which is product cost and fixed cost, this year, it's a negative, I think, of &#x20AC;0.5 billion this year, probably annualizing to about, maybe, &#x20AC;0.7 billion for 2011. How should we think about this for 2012? How much is this number dependent on car volume outlook for 2012? Should we expect something in a similar region or higher? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So, you are interesting in our &#x2013; in an outlook for our expected product cost and fixed cost in 2012, if we can give you some first indications, if you have to expect a similar development or similar range you have seen this year so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, I think we need to have in mind that by external factors, we will see the cost increases on the tariff side, on a full-year basis going forward, it will be also some effect coming in on the raw material side and certain commodities.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, as you are well aware, we have been pretty successful in amortizing on the scale of the company. So, if you look at the swing factor analysis for the first nine months in 2011, then we were able to turn up with an $800 million improvement in terms of product cost. And I think we can be very confident that we'll be able to achieve also something sizable going forward, which will compensate part of the external cost factors coming in.</p>
          <p>On the fixed cost side, we have to bear in mind that we are still building our global footprint, which means we should be &#x2013; we should have passed over the peaks in that development, but still something has to come as we build the new manufacturing locations to full capacity. This is specifically related to the plant in India, in Russia, in Chattanooga, in Mexico and a few more. So, we have to expect a negative swing also on the fixed cost side, probably slightly less than what we've seen this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I can quickly follow-up, are you saying that the two factors netted together will be a less negative number in 2012 versus what it is in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We take the last question from an analyst then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now take our next question from Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. So, I am lucky. I just have a follow-up question on the Porsche options. You said that basically the options could only be exercised or realistically be exercised in 2014. Why is that? Is that purely related to the tax issue or is there anything else that it would keep you from exercising the options earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Christian. You would like to know when actually we can exercise our call option on the remainder of the Porsche AG. I guess we can answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're well aware that there are execution windows before 2014, but there is a significant tax burden potentially sitting on this. And that's why I use the term realistic. So, realistically, an execution from the &#x2013; today's point of view is only possible in, let's say, the framework of 2014, which is quite long way to go.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, and good afternoon. I would like to just ask two questions, if I may. The first is to get a little bit more about Suzuki. You spoke about that it won't reduce, it won't change the stake in Suzuki, so what are the next steps you are going? When do you think &#x2013; do you give any chance for peace talks with Suzuki?</p>
          <p>And the second is to get more about 2012, how long does the order book takes you into the next year? And looking to the market conditions, where will the growth come from and which regions do you expect them? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. We have two questions from Christian and so this is one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not Christian, it's Jan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Jan. I'm sorry, Jan. And he refers to Suzuki, if we can give an update here. And then the next question refers to 2012 order book and if we can explain the growth regions or the development of the markets next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I take the Suzuki part, which is easy, because unfortunately I've got to say that you should be well aware that we've taken as a company a position with the clear statement that we will not be making any changes to the shareholding in Suzuki, but that the discussions between the both parties will be exclusively conducted internally. And, of course, we would like to stick to what we said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if we now come to the question about 2012, we do have a reasonable order bank and we are still believing that we could come into the year 2012 with a reasonable order bank. Interesting on that is &#x2013; or interesting &#x2013; important is that in 2012, the tendencies in the market seems to be different per region as you have mentioned. There are more growth potentials in one than in the other regions, so I will explain a little bit later. We believe that 2012 on the market, in general, could exceed 2011, but we are prudent, because, of course, we need to understand how economical situations will go further on and how the confidence of our customers will be impacted by this economical situation.</p>
          <p>Growth regions in 2012, in our feeling, will be essentially outside of Europe. So, we see some signs that the Americas will have a cross orientation, maybe, to a smaller level, but to a level so South America for example.</p>
          <p>North America as well we believe that there is the potential, which is essentially due to the very low &#x2013; still very low market in the United States. You should not forget that this market used to be 116 millions, 117 millions of cars alone. And this year, we are still far away from any of this kind of peaks.</p>
          <p>We believe as well that in Russia, the situation continues to be favorable. We believe as well that in India, there could be some &#x2013; have further growth potential and China could have a further growth certainly on the lower level, but a growth over 2012.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we have a differentiation. So, I would say it's pretty easy there are some regions, which gives us either stable or a growth potential, which is more in the north or in Germany. And we see more issues in the southern part of Europe, which is logic due to the discussions as well, like in Italy, certainly Spain and maybe to a lower extent in France. So, this is what we could say about our prospectives in the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, gentlemen. A quick question, a newspaper reported this week that Volkswagen would overtake Toyota as earlier this year as the world's biggest car maker. Officially your goal is still to overtake the top spot by 2018. Is there any need to revise this call? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
