          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the TJX Companies Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, August 14, 2012.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of the TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, Sherry has a few comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including without limitation the Form 10-K filed March 27, 2012.</p>
          <p>Further, these comments and the Q&amp;A that follows are copyrighted today by the TJX Companies.

Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript.</p>
          <p>Please note that the financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis. Also, we have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sherry. So joining me and Sherry on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg. I'm happy to say that once again I'm extremely pleased with our quarterly top and bottom line results. Our 24% increase in second quarter earnings per share significantly exceeded our original expectation. This marks the seventh consecutive year that our adjusted second quarter earnings per share have grown by 20% or higher.</p>
          <p>Consolidated comp increased 7%, also well above our plan and on top of a 4% increase last year. It is great to see our momentum continue and be so broad-based. All of our businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe are on track and delivering excellent results. To underscore that statement, let me give you a quick week recap.</p>
          <p>At Marmaxx, segment margin was up 150 basis points; at Home Goods, it was up 280 basis points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, TJX Canada's adjusted segment profit was up 80 basis points and TJX Europe was up 240 basis points. Customer traffic was up significantly over increases last year, which we believe speaks to the strength of our brand, fashion, and values. These strong results year-after-year in good and bad economies demonstrates the sustainability of our sales and profit growth.</p>
          <p>I will keep my comments brief today and take a somewhat different approach. We believe the numbers speak for themselves, so rather than reviewing divisional results, I will leave more time for Q&amp;A. I will share with you a few points that may be less visible externally, but internally give us great confidence in our belief that there's still substantial near and long-term growth in front of us. We remain as convinced as ever that TJX will grow to be a $40 billion company and beyond.</p>
          <p>But before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our second quarter consolidated results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Now, to recap our second quarter results. Net sales reached $5.9 billion, a 9% increase over last year. Consolidated comparable store sales were up a very strong 7%. I should point out that this was on top of Q2 comp increases of 3% to 4% in each of the last six years. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, a 24% increase over last year's $0.45 per share and well above our original guidance of $0.47 to $0.50.</p>
          <p>In terms of the underlying growth rate, it's important to note a couple of factors. Foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on EPS compared to a $0.01 benefit last year. In addition, a higher tax rate in this year's second quarter negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. The consolidated pre-tax margin was 11.5% for the quarter, well above our expectations and up 130 basis points over last year. Foreign currency had a 10-basis-point negative impact on year-over-year comparisons, again &#x2013; as Carol mentioned &#x2013; excluding the impact of FX, pre-tax margins increased significantly at all divisions.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin increased by a very strong 80 basis points over a 70-basis-point increase last year, driven primarily by higher merchandise margins as well as some buying and occupancy leverage. SG&amp;A expense improved 40 basis points to 16.5%, which was very favorable to our plan. We continue to see very high flow-through to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense on a dollar basis was in line with the high end of our expected range despite sales being about a $130 million above plan. Further, the incremental investments to support our growth, including talent and infrastructure &#x2013; which we have discussed on prior calls, negatively impacted SG&amp;A by 20 basis points, which is slightly less than we expected due to the above planned sales.</p>
          <p>As to inventories, at the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were down 12% versus a 16% increase last year. We are extremely happy with our inventory levels. We enter the back half in a very strong position to buy into the terrific opportunities we are currently seeing in the marketplace and continue shipping fresh merchandise selection to our stores.</p>
          <p>In terms of the share repurchases during the second quarter, we retired 7.1 million shares, buying back $300 million worth of TJX stock. Year-to-date, we have retired 13.6 million shares, buying back $550 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of TJX stock this year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call back to Carol. I will provide details on our third quarter guidance and recap guidance for the full year at the end of the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Scott. So moving straight to the first major point. I want to underscore our deep belief that TJX's business model makes us a company with tremendous strength and for both defense and offense. While we believe the defensive elements of our model are well known, I will spend more time on our offense, which may be less evident.</p>
          <p>On the defensive side, I'll just say &#x2013; briefly highlight consistency and the flexibility of our model. In good economic times and bad economic times, we have executed well. When we execute well, TJX has thrived. In our 35-year history, we have only had one year with a negative comp. In the last 14 quarters, we have had only one month with a negative comp.</p>
          <p>We believe that the flexibility of our business model, which we see as the most flexible in the world, is at the core of our success. We offer customers tremendous variety in a single store with a consistently changing mix of products and merchandise categories at extreme values. We have built a sourcing machine over 35 years with a universe of over 15,000 vendors. This flexibility allows us to respond to the market conditions, weather, and current fashion and consumer trends. Further, with our broad U.S. and international reach, we believe our demographic audience is the widest in retail.</p>
          <p>Now, to our strengths in offense, which I believe are not as well understood as the defensive story. It starts with our customers. We are convinced we will continue to attract more U.S. and international customers with our values. Our customer traffic is up mid-teens over the last three years and continues to increase. While we have made significant market share gains, enormous opportunities remain. Our customer reach indicates that our U.S. penetration is still well below most U.S. department stores.</p>
          <p>In Canada, we are growing Marshalls, and in Europe, we have vast store growth potential. Additionally, our research tells us that we are doing a good job of attracting younger customers, which bodes well for the future. Our job today is to continue working at attracting more new customers and keeping them coming back to our stores, and I believe we're doing a good job of this.</p>
          <p>Next is the power of our banners and being global. We have built a business that's on track to be over $25 billion company this year and we believe we are far from the end. As we raise the bar and execution across the company, we have huge opportunities to better leverage all of our businesses. Further, I'm not afraid to say, like most companies, we have made mistakes along the way, and the beautiful thing about TJX is that we have shared our knowledge among our businesses and learned from those mistakes.</p>
          <p>As our banners become bigger businesses, we gain even greater leverage. The more global the world becomes, the more powerful our banners are. It's important to understand that when we say "global," we are not just talking about our stores. With our sourcing capabilities, we truly are a global company.</p>
          <p>So moving to our supply chain. As good as we are, we believe we still have significant room to improve. We are investing significant dollars in our supply chain system to run even leaner and faster and become even more pointed at shipping the right goods to the right stores at the right time. It's about lean in-store inventories, freshness, exciting merchandise and faster turns, which help drive stronger sales and margins. We are taking our time with this and we'll be extremely careful in its rollout. So we are not anticipating the full benefits from this initiative for several more years.</p>
          <p>We are also taking great advantage of today's real estate landscape, which is certainly right for TJX both in the U.S. and internationally. We are capitalizing on high U.S. vacancy rates and other retailers closing stores in Europe and see plenty of growth ahead in Canada. With our flexible store formats, we can open stores in a variety of sizes and configurations. We also have the choice of which banner to open in a given location. Combined with our wide demographic potential, this gives us the flexibility to open stores in a variety of locations.</p>
          <p>Now I'll pick up the point of growing our customer base and keeping our new customers coming back. We are using our marketing to attract new customers and we are working to retain them by providing a great shopping experience through our store remodel program and in-store initiatives.</p>
          <p>We're leveraging our global marketing abilities across our banners and have made our marketing messages more powerful, emphasizing current fashion. We're also aggressively engaging customers through social media. In terms of our marketing plans for the fourth quarter, I'm very excited about the creative, but you'll have to wait and see. Our store remodels are succeeding in lifting sales. We are on target to have about 75% of the Marmaxx stores and the new prototype by year-end and approximately 300 stores across the company remodeled during 2012.</p>
          <p>Further, we have many ideas for improving our shopping experience even more, but again I can't share those with you. Just know we never stop raising the bar.</p>
          <p>I'll wrap up on the theme of attracting and keeping new customers by saying that at the end of the day, our execution of giving the customer the right brands, fashion, and the right value is paramount and we are laser-focused on it every day.</p>
          <p>Continuing with our strength in offense, I want to spend some time on our huge growth opportunities in the U.S. and internationally. Importantly, as a management team, we are focused on fewer bigger businesses, all with a very wide demographic reach and very strong short and long term economics.</p>
          <p>We believe Marmaxx will be an even bigger business with the potential to grow up to 2,400 stores. Marmaxx's new store performance has been phenomenal over the last three years. Further, as we have worked to widen our demographic reach in all directions, Marmaxx has been very successful in moderate income markets and in both densely populated urban markets and rural areas. As I mentioned, our ability to open stores in a variety of shapes and sizes adds to our confidence that our largest division continues to hold significant store growth potential.</p>
          <p>We also see HomeGoods as single even bigger business with the potential to expand to about 750 stores. Other U.S. home retailers are more than twice the size of HomeGoods, speaking to the size of our opportunities for this chain. We are also seeing strong store performance in new markets we opened last year, which is extremely encouraging. Anecdotally, I can't tell you how many letters we received from customers asking us to put a HomeGoods in their city or hometown.</p>
          <p>In Europe, where we are the only major off-price retailer, we have vast opportunities and see the potential to grow up to about 875 stores with just our current banners in our current country. I want to make an important point about our performance in Europe.</p>
          <p>As we look back, we believe what hurt our results a few years ago was our own execution, which got off track when we grew too fast. We had been doing extremely well previous to the first quarter of 2010 as the economy in the UK worsened. Then we stubbed our toe and got off balance with our mix and the customer let us know it. We worked to right the ship. We are back on track and we can more effectively take advantage of the opportunities that the macro environment provides for us. While we have clearly exhibited improvement in Europe, we believe we are just scratching the surface in terms of further improving this business.</p>
          <p>In Canada, we see another big growth catalyst with Marshalls, which we believe has the potential to grow up to about 100 stores. We're very pleased with our Marshalls stores in Canada, which is very promising for our future growth in that country.</p>
          <p>We view e-commerce as another major growth catalyst, an opportunity to increase our customer base for the future. We are not ready to talk timing yet; we are taking our time to get it right, and the good news is that we believe we can afford to do that. We have a ton of growth from other places and do not believe we are suffering from not being in e-commerce at this moment, and we will keep you posted as to our progress.</p>
          <p>Another important point that I'd like to make is that while we are making strategic investments for the future, we're maintaining our 10% to 13% annual EPS growth model. As always, we'll strive to surpass our goals.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I'll spend a moment on our financial strength and shareholder returns. Our business model delivers outstanding financial returns and generates enormous amounts of cash and we remain committed to distributing excess cash to our shareholders. In the last 14 years, we have bought back over 10.6 billion of TJX stock. For 16 consecutive years we have raised a dividend and over that same time period have delivered a compound annual growth rate of 23%.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our capital spending for the current year to approximately $1 billion versus our prior guidance of $875 million to $900 million due to the purchase of our Home Office property in Framingham this month. We are very pleased to have made this purchase, which along with the building we recently purchased in Marlborough, will provide TJX with the space we need to accommodate our anticipated Home Office growth for many years. Even with this increase, we expect to end the year with $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in cash, which is more than we originally expected. This is after reinvesting in our businesses and returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend and buyback program.</p>
          <p>So summing up, in the short-term we significantly outperformed our expectations for the first half of 2012 and enter the second half with great momentum in all of our businesses. August is off to a good start and we see plenty of opportunities for the back half. Our inventories are in excellent shape and turning faster than last year. This puts us in a terrific position to pursue opportunities in the marketplace, and our customers are seeing extremely fresh and exciting merchandise in our stores. We plan to be extremely focused on gift giving in the holiday selling season again this year and have many exciting initiatives up our sleeves.</p>
          <p>I believe our brand penetration, merchandise mix and values will only get better. Our marketing campaigns for the back half are the best I've ever seen and I'm confident we will drive more new customers to our stores. In the long-term, we believe our global business model offers some of the best defenses and offenses in retailing. When we execute well, we can succeed in virtually all types of macro environments. We are leveraging our four powerful divisions more and more every day and have confidence in ultimately growing TJX to the $40 billion and beyond.</p>
          <p>And now, I will turn the call back to Scott to go through guidance and then we will open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carol. Before I get to guidance, I first want to provide some detail on the impact of FX on TJX Canada's profit margins in the second quarter. On a reported basis, TJX Canada's second quarter segment profit margin was down 50 basis points versus last year. As Carol mentioned, on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of FX, segment margins were up 80 basis points over last year, which is more than we would typically expect on a 5% comp. As a reminder, tables are available on our website which lay out the impact of foreign exchange on our international businesses as well as our consolidated results.</p>
          <p>Now to fiscal 2013 guidance beginning with the full year. As we noted in our press release today, we are raising our guidance for the full year by $0.01 to reflect our second quarter earnings per share. The new guidance calls for full-year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.39 to $2.45, which would represent a 20% to 23% increase over the adjusted $1.99 last year. As a reminder, we had raised our full-year EPS guidance when we announced July sales a couple of weeks ago. That raise was driven by our outlook for higher comp sales for the remainder of 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me recap the key changes versus guidance we provided on the Q1 earnings call in May. We now estimate consolidated comp store sales growth of 4% to 5% for the full year compared to our prior guidance of 2% to 3% growth. Also, we now expect pre-tax profit margins of 11.6% to 11.8%, which is 90 basis points to 110 basis points higher than last year's adjusted margin of 10.7% and better than the guidance we provided in May of 11.1% to 11.5%.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, our guidance includes a 53rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar, which we expect will benefit the full year and the fourth quarter by approximately $0.07 per share. On a 52-week basis, excluding the $0.07 benefit, full year EPS would be $2.32 to $2.38, up 17% to 20% over the adjusted $1.99 in fiscal 2012. Our plan assumes a negative $0.02 a share impact from a higher tax rate of 38.5%.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss the back-half guidance. We expect EPS to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.34, up 11% to 17% over $1.15 in the prior year. This guidance is now based on comp store sales growth in the 1% to 3% range versus the outlook we provided in May for comps to be flat to up 1%. We're planning pre-tax margins to be 11.5% to 11.9%, up 10 basis points to 50 basis points over last year. This includes an estimated 10 basis points negative impact from foreign currency.</p>
          <p>Now I'll move to the third quarter guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.59, a 6% to 11% increase over last year's $0.53 per share. Some of the components are as follows. We are assuming a third quarter top line in the $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion range. This is based on consolidated sales growth in the 2% to 4% range, both on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group. As to monthly comps on both a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group, we are planning comp sales increases of 5% to 6% in August, 1% to 3% in both September and October.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit margins for the third quarter are planned in the 11.2% to 11.6% range, down 30 basis points to up 10 basis points over the prior year. This guidance includes an anticipated 30 basis points negative impact from foreign currency, so excluding FX, pre-tax margin would be flat to up 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>We are anticipating third quarter gross profit margins to be in the range of 21 &#x2013; 28.1% to 28.3%, flat to up 20 basis points versus the prior year. We expect mark-to-market adjustments on the company's inventory-related hedges to negatively impact gross profit margins by approximately 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>In terms of SG&amp;A as a percent of sales, we are anticipating a rate of 16.5% to 16.8%, which is flat to 30 basis points higher than last year. This guidance includes an approximately 30 basis point negative impact from the incremental investments to support our growth, which I mentioned earlier. Assuming foreign exchange rates at current levels, FX would have a neutral impact on EPS in the third quarter versus the $0.01 positive impact on Q3 EPS last year.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.5% in the third quarter, down 30 basis points versus last year. Net interest expense is estimated to be in the $8 million to $9 million range and we anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately $747 million. Our full-year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.75, compared with $0.62 last year. This guidance reflects comp sales to be flat to up 2%. We will provide detailed fourth-quarter guidance on our third-quarter conference call. Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.</p>
          <p>Now, we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. We appreciate your cooperation with that. Thanks and we will open it up for questions now.</p>

          <p>Well, we are very pleased with both Germany and Poland and the UK. Obviously &#x2013; honestly, all three businesses are doing extremely well. So today we put out there 850 stores. We absolutely think we can be 850 stores. We are taking things slow and carefully and then we will see where it leads at that point and, obviously, that's just with our current model in those three countries today, but we are pretty excited about it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning. Question for Scott. Scott, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the general corporate expense increase year-on-year. I understand you're making some investments for the future, but I'm wondering if you could perhaps be a little bit more granular in terms of kind of ranking the initiatives, what they are, and should we expect that year-on-year increase to subside at all as we move into the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't gotten into any of the detail in terms of ranking them. The major pieces of the corporate expense increase have been what we stated before: e-commerce; investment in systems, as Carol talked about; our new data center; and increases to support our growth, primarily in talent.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; we are on plan on a full year for the corporate expenses we laid out for those items. The only change &#x2013; significant change from the first half to the back half &#x2013; which it is moderating as we said on the last call &#x2013; is the increase in our incentive accruals because of our above-plan results and that makes up the majority of the difference between our original plan and our full-year plan now.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me, so I am going to be going through the full-year guidance. Just as a note, all the numbers I'm going to be going through are on a 53-week basis. So let me start. I'll just go through each division starting with Marmaxx.</p>
          <p>Marmaxx comps for the full year are 4% to 5% with a pre-tax margin of 14.3% to 14.4%; it's against last year's 13.6%, so a pre-tax margin change of plus 70 to 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>HomeGoods' full-year comps: 5% to 6%, 11.8% to 11.9% against last year's 10.6%, so an increase of 120 basis points to 130 basis points. Canada: 3% to 4% comp, 13.5% to 13.6% ex-FX, so ex-foreign currency, against 12.8% on a comparable basis. FX last year were up 70 to 80 basis points. Europe: 6% to 7% comp, 5.5% to 5.9%, again all in FX &#x2013; ex-FX, against last year's 2.4% comparable number or up 310 basis points to 350 basis points. And again, just repeating what we said earlier in the script, a 4% to 5% full-year comp where 90 basis points to 110 basis points, again, over last year, and it's the same on &#x2013; with and without ex-foreign currency adjustments.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Good morning, Carol. You've been saying in past quarters that your comps have been driven by very significant increases in customer traffic. Did that continue here in the second quarter? I think you had been indicating that ticket was sort of roughly flat. And are there any places in particular where you think you're picking up traffic and what are the initiatives to sustain that here through the back half of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kimberly, you know I won't give you all the initiatives. It's mostly driven by customer traffic again in the second quarter, which is great. And our ticket is pretty much flat, very, very slightly up. But what's even more exciting is the new customers we're getting. We're seeing a lot of younger customers, which is really going to bode well for the future. So we've got some great marketing plans for the back half. I think it's going to be absolutely traffic-driven, so we're pretty excited. I don't see our ticket increasing substantially. We're going after giving extreme value.</p>
          <p>In terms of just traffic &#x2013; where is it coming from? We are straight across the board. There isn't an area that isn't &#x2013; it's the flattest I've ever seen it across the board in terms of where our comps are. So there's no particular area or region or demographic driving it really across the board.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the topic of the offense, you talked about the offensive side of the TJX story. How do you think about the productivity opportunity long run? Even if it's on kind of a theoretical basis, how much higher can sales per store go on lower inventories per store? And is there eventually an inflection point where you're going to need more inventories to continue to drive the comps and the sales and the productivity? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Omar, it's really not about the level of inventory. What we're trying to do is speed up, almost on a daily basis, freshness into the store. So when we look at the initiatives that we have in place for the future, we don't look at it as, here's the inventory level. We really look at it as that speed to store.</p>
          <p>So I don't know &#x2013; it's a great question you just asked in terms of productivity per store, because I don't know how high is high, and we ask that question because we're just &#x2013; we're at the beginning and obviously every day we see more and more opportunity. So the idea of speeding up that freshness and every day, and in some stores even twice a day, delivering to the store plus the in-store initiatives of treating our customers better, we're going to continue to improve the remodels and the things we have to do within the store. So I don't have the answer to the end game.</p>
          <p>And then the third element to that is we're still not sophisticated to the level that we think we can be in terms of categories to the right store. So for example, we have certain stores that are just much better in juniors and a younger customer. We're not great at targeting that perfectly yet. So there is just lotta, lotta opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just regarding the new customers that you've been getting, is there a particular ramp in terms of they're much stronger in their second year of becoming a TJX customer versus their first? And then just dealing with those systems that you were talking about, is that &#x2013; are we going to see incremental gains along the way or is it the type of thing that in a few years, the whole thing is plugged in and that's when we start to see the gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to &#x2013; it's just going to keep eking. As I said, what tends to happen with us is we try something, we see it, and then we're like, huh, this is interesting, we may have some other opportunities. But this is &#x2013; we have two big initiatives in place in terms of systems and they're not going to be simultaneously. We're going to be doing one first and then the second one.</p>
          <p>In terms of the customers, the second year, I don't &#x2013; we don't have data on that, but we just know that we're keeping our customers and they continue to come back. We're also &#x2013; when our customers learn more and more about us and they shop more than one brand, we really see incremental spending. And that's what's exciting about our marketing game plan going forward is getting more customers to not only find us, but to find all three brands, let's say, in the United States, like a HomeGoods, a Marshalls, and a T.J. Maxx.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. One of your off-price competitors, Daffy's, is currently liquidating. Can you just talk about the implications of this on your business? Do you see this as a big market share opportunity for you either from a sales or merchandising perspective? And secondly, can you also talk about any real estate opportunities that emerge from this around the New York metro area? Is this a region where you'd be looking to increase your store base further?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks, guys. Just wondering if the higher merchandise margin that you saw during the quarter was more a function of initial margins or was it more of an issue of having lower markdowns? And I guess I am also wondering which of those pieces do you kind of view as more sustainable, if in fact, they came from both? And then also just curious about where you are today on pack-away levels versus same time last year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we gained a lot in markdowns and I think we gained a little bit in the merchandise margins, but, again, that all comes back to turning the business a lot faster. Ernie, do you want to comment on our pack-away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pack-aways have been kind of in a similar realm to where we've kind of had them in the past, maybe they've beefed up a little bit, I'd say, but nothing substantially different. The only thing I would say is the quality of the pack-aways has been &#x2013; a lot of opportunities, so where we're very happy with the content and the excitement there. The brands that are really in the pack-aways this year feel like a notch up from where we've been in the past, so we're looking forward to the future on that. That feels good.</p>
          <p>And in total and generally pack-aways reflect that there is just a lot of desirable goods in the marketplaces, and that's all the different families of business. And that actually applies, as you can see from the results, in Europe or Canada or the U.S. and in the home categories as well, HomeGoods is feeling it. So again, we're very happy with what we we're finding in the marketplace out there.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats as well. Was wondering two things, I guess. Maybe can you talk about the lift you are seeing from the remodels or the prototypes? Can you maybe talk about how much that might be contributing to the above planned sales? And then I think, Carol, on the last call, you might have mentioned from a flow-through perspective, normally you guys think of one comp point equaling about $0.05 and I think this year you thought about $0.02, so just wondering as some of the initiatives &#x2013; e-commerce, et cetera &#x2013; roll off, can we look back or look ahead to next year, will every one comp point get back to equaling $0.05 of earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, first of all, for each comp in the back half, it's equivalent to about $0.03. And we really don't discuss our lift for our remodels, and we'll just continue to look for the next initiative. So, Scott, you wanted to make a comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, certainly it's something we've been &#x2013; as you know, by the number of remodels we're doing in that 300-plus range this year and we always try to get &#x2013; we feel real good about the remodels and we try to get them done early in the year in terms of that capital spend. And thus far, year-to-date, we have completed the majority, almost 275 of our remodels, so that's something &#x2013; and that's usually how we plan it every year, but we still &#x2013; we haven't given out plans for the future, but it's still a big part of our capital spend program for the next few years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I just want to make one other comment just on the flow-through and going forward. Omar asked a great question in terms of the productivity per store. So again, we don't know the end game. We just know that we've got &#x2013; we execute and we keep the flexibility and our ability to find ways to keep driving sales is just going to keep moving us what we feel in a positive direction. We have lots and lots of seeds. So I really don't know the end game of the comp and the flow-through, but we just see tremendous opportunity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning. A two-part question on Europe. As your comps improve, what's your thought process in terms of the timing of returning to higher square-footage growth there? And the second question is the segment margins are mid single digits, significantly below obviously U.S. How much of that is just scale? Because it doesn't look like a sales productivity issue. Is there a merchandise margin structurally lower in Europe or is it almost all scale issue? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the majority of it is a scale issue. We've always put the model out there. I think we put an 8% model out there and, obviously, as we grow, we hope to beat that. Ernie, do you have a ...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll address it &#x2013; Evren, I'll address &#x2013; on the scale, we were at a higher margin at one point before, and as Carol mentioned in the script, the growing too fast we've learned from and so in the growing too fast, it really became an issue of we needed more experienced people in the right jobs and in the right country. So with that, I think you're going to see the margin continue to get back, go back towards that higher level that Carol just talked about. And on the square-footage growth, I think that's really one step at a time, so we've learned our lesson when we too aggressively went after the square footage growth before the infrastructure was there.</p>
          <p>We're happy with the business right now. As you can see, we're happy with the top-line and the bottom-line directionally is really, as you know, a couple of hundred basis points up. So that all feels good, but we don't want to ramp up the square-footage growth until we have consistency.</p>
          <p>So again, one step at a time. Yes, we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us there, but we're taking it slow and steady.</p>

          <p>And then just a real quick one on the month-to-month guidance for the quarter, for the third quarter &#x2013; August 5 to 6 and then September and October 1 to 3, is that largely the comparisons, the cadence?</p>

          <p>Part of it is a comparison and again we want to build our plans and work very hard to beat our plans on; that's how we run our business. We try to keep them lean and always strive to beat if we can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thanks, guys. Maybe Carol, generally speaking you can &#x2013; can you give us an update on your marketing plans for the fall season, whether you are spending more this year for fall over this last year, or whether your TV impressions will be up versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The impressions will definitely be up. We're being pretty aggressive on TV, so you're going to see our tri-branding all three businesses coming together. You are going to see gift certificates. You are going to see the ability for the consumer to have this choice when they do gift cards, so we're pretty excited about all of it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations, everybody. I am curious about that gift cards that you can use across the brands; that sounds very interesting that you just mentioned. But my question was: you have a younger shopper coming in and I was curious &#x2013; this was across the brands and if due to this you are seeing any segments distort sales-wise and growing at a faster pace and are you able to chase those businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not going get into specific businesses, but we are seeing a younger customer without a doubt, HomeGoods is probably the one business where we don't have that young teen customer, but don't put it past us to not have things up our sleeves. So our goal is really to keep our customers in that average &#x2013; we always ran in the average, in the high 40s age-wise. Our goal is to keep our customers &#x2013; all ages &#x2013; and to gain new customers and have them for the future, and we are pounding away at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. And the gift cards, you'll be able to use them across all of your brands? Is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, so if you get a gift card, you can use it at a HomeGoods, a Marshalls, or a Maxx.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from David Glick [Buckingham Research].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I've got just a quick question on the incremental investments you are making in your growth initiatives. So, I was just wondering if you could quantify those this year and whether going forward we should still expect you to make those investments and do you still anticipate being able to leverage SG&amp;A in your long term, 10% to 13% EPS growth model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of the investments for this year, again, we haven't specifically addressed all the details, but on a full year they are impacting us approximately 30 basis points this year. In terms of going forward, we expect them to moderate, I think, as we've called out before. In terms of investment &#x2013; in terms of us on our SG&amp;A rate on our model which we do on a 1 to 2 comp, we expect to be flat to slightly leverage, if we beat the 2 comp, then we will leverage on &#x2013; leverage the SG&amp;A. So, that's no real change there, other than we expect to moderate our incremental investments going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just one follow-up on &#x2013; your free cash flow in the first half was very powerful from lower inventory levels and higher net income, among other reasons, and you referenced, Carol, pretty high excess cash levels or total cash levels. I mean, do you think any differently about how you return cash to shareholders going forward? I mean, you are already buying back well over $1 billion in stock; do you think more about the dividend or just kind of continue on the same path?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are going to &#x2013; obviously, we look at that every year and we want to keep giving cash, but dividend &#x2013; increase our dividend each year. So we look at that every year and we'll evaluate it, but we always want to, obviously, have a good amount of cash in case something interesting comes up in the future. Scott, you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, again, we certainly love having the flexibility of slightly more cash than we might need, but we, I think, over time we have &#x2013; as Carol has pointed out; it was in the script &#x2013; increased that dividend, and also that we've been over time increasing the shareholder buyback, so I think we remain committed to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, there. Good morning. So I have a quick follow-up on inventory levels. One, the inventories on a dollar basis were down 12%. If you could help us understand what that was on a unit basis?</p>
          <p>And then also as a follow-up I wanted to ask from a very high level, if you could tell us has your buying organization expressed to you any sort of change in where they've seen the best opportunities over the last, say, three to six months to buy the fashion and also how they see that evolving over the back half of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, no in terms of buying organization change, I mean, understand we really buy from over 15,000 vendors and we are all over the world. So we continue to try to just spice it up and make it very exciting. So they are just out there paving the pounding &#x2013; pounding the pavement every day. In terms of our unit basis, we really don't give the &#x2013; we don't go into our units by store or unit basis. That information is a little bit on the competitive side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you guys talk a little bit about the productivity of maybe some of the new stores in Canada and Europe versus some of the established stores and whether or not it's been more difficult getting established in new markets versus the ones that you are in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you, Jamie, our &#x2013; every &#x2013; all of our new stores are very highly productive as well as &#x2013; that's where our comp is coming from. Number one, our comps have been terrific, and our new store performance across the board has been above plan. So we are just seeing the overall business very strong.</p>
