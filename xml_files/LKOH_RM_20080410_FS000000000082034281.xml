          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I find many benefits in my work, but there are some disadvantages. In the last week -- well let me start again then, just a second, I find many benefits in my work but there are also some downsides. In the last seven days, I had to travel from Baghdad to Western Siberia. It was plus 40 degrees in Baghdad and minus 40 in Kandym. So, I do apologize for my voice. Just back from Western Siberia, so on my behalf Mr. Fedun will make the next presentation. Everything else will continue as planned, and I will be ready to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you on behalf of the company. For the last 10 years we have been meeting every year to discuss financial results. And you know, over the period of the last 10 years neither Vagit nor myself had any difficulties with presentation because during those 10 years we always started with the same statement. We meet the expectations of the market that the market has towards our company, and sometimes we even surpass those expectations. You have already seen our data. You have seen our performance. Let me just say that LUKOIL remains the most profitable Russian oil company. We are company number two in profits in Russia just after Gazprom.</p>
          <p>2007 was the third year in a row of records in our activity and we also hope that, the upcoming years will be as favorable to the development of our company as the past three years. And you can see that our results again exceeded the expectations that the market had with one exception; for objectives and sometimes also for subjective reasons we could not meet the expected the level of production of oil but I will say about this a bit later.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. If we look at 2006 and 2007 if we were to compare these years and if we look at where the company developed from 2002 you will notice that the company achieved very good performance. Basically in five years all key financial indicators grew by around 400% more than four times in revenue, in net income and net cash flow. The oil prices over the same period only doubled. LUKOIL keeps a risen position in the world in proven reserves, although production is growing every year we maintain the good level of our P ratio, and we are also optimistic in terms of production of oil, marketable oil and gas. We also put special emphasis on oil refining, especially this Russian segment, which is quite profitable for us. We are still number one in Russia in the number of gas stations and retail sales of oil products. This is also a very lucrative segment in the Russian economy.</p>
          <p>So what were the main events that took place in 2007 and beginning of 2008?  We launched the biggest projects in production of gas abroad in Uzbekistan PSA Kandym-KhauzakShady started operating this year, and this year we expect production of 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas. Last year, we bought SNG Holding Limited with a pre-design level of production of $3 billion and we also went into negotiations with the government, president, and the Ministry of Oil and Gas of Uzbekistan to get access to several more projects. And today Uzbekistan will become one of our largest provinces in production of hydrocarbons both gas and gas condensate. Another important discovery that hasn't been announced yet was made in 2007 in Timan-Pechora, Varandeiskoye oil field was discovered. The first well tells us that the reserves are around 300 million barrels. We continue operations now on the second well and again the prospects are very optimistic, the flow rate about 5000 barrels per day this is unique for Russia. The field itself is not very deep. And it has very good infrastructure in that region. So in 2008 and 2009, we will be able to share some good news with you in exploration that we conduct and this very well-known and very well developed Komi region of Russia.</p>
          <p>We'll also continue work to expand our refining and the processing capacities.  There will be a separate presentation of the subject, Mr. Mueller, the Head of the Main Division for Refining will make the presentation and we are also -- we take much care about the segment, it will be said today that refining in Russia as well as aboard will be the locomotive of revenue growth for the company.</p>
          <p>2007 was also unique in terms of acquisition of new assets in magazine of oil products, you know that we acquired the former console, that's called Jet. It has stations in six European countries and also four of the most powerful and the most interesting gas stations network in the Moscow region market is called Grad it used to belong to Rosneft and now we own also that network of gas refinery, overall gas stations.</p>
          <p>Looking at the main the performance indicators and the key financial covenants of the company, LUKOIL was not adequately valued by the markets. In capitalization levels and its correlation with oil prices as well as the P/E ratio, Price to Earnings Ratio, in all these indicators we are behind our main competitors although we constantly demonstrate growth of production profit and growth of reserves. What are the main reasons of that?  We believe is that there are several negative clich&#xE9;s that exist with respect to Russian oil companies. And these stereotypes also the price of oil for the company, high tax burden and we've believe restricts profits and the oil prices do not increase capitalization of the company and the value of the company.</p>
          <p>In my presentations today, in our presentations today we'll try to demonstrate to you that this is not in fact a fact there is a direct correlation between the growing oil prices and improving value of the company, you will see that. And net income is intensively growing the company increases its investments, it grows into new regions of development and at the same time we are paying high dividends. We are paying the highest actually dividends and one other oil company is in Russia. You must also be aware of the full impact and we can say with high certainty that the government will be offering in the near future considerable reduction in taxation on oil companies and this will open new opportunities for LUKOIL</p>
          <p>Another clich&#xE9; that is quite widespread is that Russian companies are characterized by overall cash flows and unreasonable capital expenses and this does not create long term value potential, but we can show to you in our report that this is not the case. Yes, today oil is highly taxed, but oil in this respect is considered as an export product, but refining of oil and production of oil products opens new opportunities and the sale of petroleum products that were produced by our own refining capacities in Russia and abroad creates additional value and creates high profit. We put there some production of gas and you can see that every year we increase and we accelerate gas production rates. The gas prices are growing fast and we expect that it will double and then triple pretty soon and gas problem out stop that. The level of succession on a gas industry is several foot lower than for the oil industry.</p>
          <p>Building a gas and oil company out of  local cooperation opens very good prospects for creating better value. And another opportunity, we entered the power supply market. This is a very fast growing, very dynamic segment of the market, where increased cash flow and asset value is expected. And the last thing, over that period of time, we managed to prove and I'm talking about the late 1990s, the time of the crisis and today where the oil prices are very high, we managed to prove that the company keeps its costs under control. We spend only as much as is necessary to ensure gradual development of the company whenever <mark type="inaudible" /> like our competitors when in early in 2006 were the period of oil reserves. So we were pretty conservative although some people criticized that for it and now these assets are losing in 10 15% of growth, we continue to grow very steadily and efficiently. We will try to prove that under any circumstances, under any taxation, our company will remain a profitable one and a growing one.</p>
          <p>This slide shows that our profit grows adequately in the current circumstances. Please notice that the oil price in the last period grew by 156% than its own net income is 157% so there is that correlation. Let we explain how this correlation is achieved, and please also notice that the taxes grew by 335%, so the taxes grow at a rate twice as high as oil prices.</p>
          <p>At the same time, government owned oil companies came into existence and this created a very good ground to reduce taxation. Today, the government owns 60% of oil in Russia and its production and refining and the government now realizes that high tax burden on owned companies' results in this revision of production rates in Russia. Three or four years ago the rate of production was growing at a rate of about 10%, last year was almost zero and this year probably there will be no increase in the rate of production.</p>
          <p>So the government has already taken some steps towards optimization of the tax burden, and the first thing that they did was to release the produced reserves from the tax on the extraction of natural resources. In a similar way, this tax is also reduced for oil fields with high viscosity oil. So, only this year we will be saving about $100 million in taxes, I'm talking about LUKOIL only. In 2010, when we do proper accounting of those fields we will be getting up to $0.5 billion in such savings in 2007 prices. When Yareg Square the large field will be put into operation and when <mark type="inaudible" /> will be put into operation this figure will be even higher.</p>
          <p>LUKOIL today is the probably the only company that is actually developing deep and high viscous oil, and the taxes will be stimulating these operations even further. And you also heard probably from our Ministry of Finance, that the Ministry of Finance used to object to any changes in the taxation regime agreed under the pressure of selling companies to reduce the taxation burden. In particular what is suggested is to increase the minimum level of the tax on natural, on extraction of natural resources raised. And it is also suggested that the excise taxes on petroleum products be corrected, be modified. So as soon as this takes place LUKOIL will be getting up to $870 million a year additionally. And taking into account other changes in taxation regime our company can save as much as $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In the other slide, you have just seen the movie that describes the operation to launch the largest oil field into a commission we'll build the northern most terminal that offloads 12 million tons of oil and does recreated a very efficient system of work in Nordic conditions. And we have not increased the tax burden on the company not by single a cent, and that's extremely important.</p>
          <p>So this year in June, this summer we expect to launch the other oil field. We will be inviting the press to this event. And this will confirm that private companies in Russia such as LUKOIL is capable of the most advanced and sophisticated technical operations you have just seen in the movie. The technology that was used to build this offloading terminal, and this is a unique case and such technology has never been employed in the world ever before. And this justifies that to the fact that our engineers have a very high intellectual level and this is also a proof of the financial capabilities of LUKOIL. Right after we launch our Northern field we will start conquering the Northern Caspian, you know that exploration was very successful there, six large fields were opened, one of them was one of the largest opened in the <mark type="inaudible" />. This field is at shallow water, it's not very deep it's not more than 15 centimeters of water so it's very convenient, it will be easy to have production there. The Karachaganak field that's the one I'm talking about, we will start from there. And the current fields will result additional exploration and will give us about 300,000 barrels per day in production. There is also huge potential for additional exploration.</p>
          <p>LUKOIL has one big advantage; its resource base does not require any additional expenses. If you compare the performance of our -- reserves of our resources with the performance of one of the international oil company, you will see that we do not have basically any deepwater fields. We are only beginning exploration in the Ivory Coast and in the best case scenario; this fields will be put under operation sometime after 2010 even after 2015. So most of our offshore fields are shallow water and we will start producing them relatively heavy oil in Yareg and in course it is much lighter than some fields that are located in Canada for instance. So you can see that average production costs in our company are much lower than in case of our international peers. This is one of our competitive advantages.</p>
          <p>I have already mentioned that LUKOIL will be the first Russian company to start a major gas project abroad. Already this year we will start production and delivery of marketable gas and since the countries of Central Asia have a common position on the prices, we believe that the gas prices will actually be higher than what we forecasted before. We did the case study on the $40 per barrel and now we are discussing 200 pound, $260 per 1000 cubic meters. This is a different scenario and of course this creates additional potential for the profitability of these projects. We will also believe that we will get additional capacities in Turkmenistan and we are in active negotiations with Turkmenistan.</p>
          <p>The LUKOIL gas strategy is one of the priorities in production for the company and only several years ago when we started looking towards gas, many analysts had questions why do we need that. But, we were looking ahead and we realized already several years ago that Gazprom will be creating a good platform for their existence in Russia, and that will be a ground for other Russian companies. Three years ago the gas prices were 10, $15 per thousand cubic liters, but are rated today in the independent Russian market such injections where the prices up to $100 per cubic meters $150 in Russia today is not realistic.</p>
          <p>So you can see again that the fields that we have. We in terms produce large volumes of gas from these fields, 50, 65 and maybe even 70 billion cubic meters of gas even under Gasport's forecast. This will give us about $2 billion of operating income in 2007 prices. So if you look at the prices that are forecasted for 2010, 2011 this forecast should be increased considerably. The government until 2010 does not intend to revise taxes on gas and I believe that this situation will be stable for quite a long time.</p>
          <p>The Central Astrakhanskaya field is yet another interesting site. One of the restrictive factors for its development was a high CO2 with a high <mark type="inaudible" /> content. And now there is a very interesting situation in sulfur market in Russia, the sulfur prices have gone up 10 times in the world the prices have gone up three times. It's around 200 perl ton and one looks at separate revisions from the past we've created negative value for us, but in fact now the sulfur from the Central Astrakhanskaya field they will be getting about three million tons of sulfur. This will be an additional source of income for the company.</p>
          <p>An important factor that provide additional income for the company is growing refining because margin in refining is high. Today the taxation legislation in Russia is such that refining is stimulated and crude oil deliveries are destimulated, so that's why are trying to load our refining capacities more and more and we are looking for more opportunities in refining. The refining segment in Russia becomes one of the driving forces of earnings for our company and it does not really depend on the price situation in the global markets.</p>
          <p>If you look at the next slide, you will see that in coming years we intend to grow our refining by another 200,000 barrels in the Russian Federation. We will be investing into quality of production and this will give us an additional 2.5 billion of revenue a year. Mr. Mulyak will speak on that subject in greater detail later. And the new area for us that was established in 2007, the energy section. You know that was the efforts of Mr. Shubais. One of the national monopolies was demonopolized and was broken down into several segments and LUKOIL managed to acquire one -- probably one of the most attractive and strategically attractive energy supply system in the south of Russia. It's called TGK-8 and it is important for us because we'll be placing the gas production there regardless of Gazprom and we get fair value on our gas. The prices, the tariffs in the emerging market are now being liberalized. The prices grew 15% last year and the energy sector will continue to stay one of the most exciting segments for the company <mark type="inaudible" /> in the power supply sector in the world, and the Italian companies and the latest transaction by Finnish port for everyone is offering very good money for Russian energy assets.</p>
          <p>LUKOIL's are more on petrochemicals and petrochemical plants and we have potential. Not to waste your time, we will discuss that at a different meeting. Let me just emphasize once again that LUKOIL has always strived to be a leader, to stay a leader and I hope very much that in the future, regardless of the turbulences in the world, regardless of the changes in the world, we'll also be aspiring to global leadership in Russia and abroad. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>To begin, good afternoon, it's really my pleasure to be here this afternoon. I want to leave you with really two major points that I will try to make in this presentation. One is in the area where we are trying to improve the business of refining and secondly we have a strong portfolio of investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>First, let me start with Russia in general, the refining business. I think when you look at Russia, it's an extremely large refining business, in fact its second in capacity only to the US and first as far as how much actually was run in refining. But at the same time there has been a substantial number of issues in refining in Russia, one of which has really been the low quality of the assets, low conversion. In addition, because of the tariffs, certainly there is high export tariffs and this has made an impact on the refining business. And there is really been low investment, I think in general, in Russian refining it has not been invested in, its not been modernized relatively low energy prices meant that almost all of the refineries in Russia did not conserve energy, were not energy efficient , but the good news is that gives us a lot of opportunities.</p>
          <p>So let's talk a little bit about LUKOIL. In this slide, really it's trying to give you a feel for the scope and the integration of LUKOIL in total. We all know that we have large reserves, we have lot of production, we also have a substantial amount of refining. In fact I think if you look at us relative to any other Russian oil company, we have the best integration from upstream through refining and also importantly into marketing and what that does is it gives us an opportunity to leverage each part of the value chain, and we'll talk about that in a few minutes. So, what is our objective in refining? Well, obviously we want to be a top refining company in the world and I believe we can do that. But, we have several tasks ahead of us in order to accomplish that. First, we're trying to increase our refining capacity of our existing assets. We want to get to 65 million tons or 1.3 million barrels a day, but in our existing facilities and we do that because economically we have the infrastructure to expand and it's the lowest cost opportunity for investment.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have an opportunity to expand our conversion, our depth of refining capacity. Certainly in west each refinery makes the most out of every barrel of crude oil and yet in Russia we are still do not upgrade like we do in the west. But this gives us a great opportunity for the future and it's probably the way we sustain ourselves over the long-haul. The next one is really in the premium products market. We believe that LUKOIL, particularly in Russia, has a great brand recognition and we're recognized as producing quality products and it shows up in our market share. But we also have to have the manufacturing capabilities in order to make the high quality gasoline and diesels that is demanded in Russia and is demanded in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Next on our list is improving our existing performance. I am a firm believer in benchmarking. We have been benchmarking using the industry standard Solomon Associates study, which has about, I think essentially every Western refinery participates. There is 113 refineries in Western Europe and so we compare each of our refineries to Western Europe, where we stand and then that gives us a good roadmap for the things we need to improve upon. And I'll show you some of that in a few minutes. I don't think a refiner could get up here without talking about reliability. It is really the important thing that is what -- just the fundamentals of the refining business. You have to operate safely and reliably and we have a major focus on that as well as optimizing our turnaround cycles.</p>
          <p>Next is to really to integrate some advanced automation and management techniques into our system. We had not invested, as a country, in advanced process control whereas most of Europe and United States, Japan has done so. This gives us an opportunity. We're going to skip a couple of generations of technology and we're going to automate and improve our efficiency of our operations. And then lastly, most importantly to me is sustainable performance. I think there are many, many opportunities that are -- that we have, but if we can't deliver year-on-year improvements it doesn't do any good. So, we're also setting up the work processes, export networks in order to share best practices. So, the things that we do are sustainable year-after-year.</p>
          <p>So, our strategic path; first is really to utilize our existing capacities. It sounds fairly simple, but it is take some effort and it does take a lot of focus. We are certainly improved our -- focused on our improved reliability and optimizing our turnaround cycles, that is the downtime, how often we have to take units down for maintenance. World standards are four to five years. We typically are in the two-year range. So, by extending our turnarounds we are able to get additional capacity relatively quickly. We also have a wide range of investment opportunities and we look at these really on a portfolio basis. I think there -- we have four categories. One is things we call kind of quick wins, things that we can do to invest in efficiency areas, energy conservation. Another one is basically the quality that I talked about before and obviously we have quite a few opportunities to invest in conversion and most importantly today is crude capacity increases. I think and the reason for that is as Mr. Fedun suggested that the tax regime really focuses on running crude. It's much better to export the products than to export the crude. So, there is a huge economic advantage that doesn't exist in the west to basically run crude to make all ranges of products.</p>
          <p>Benchmarking; I'll take a moment just to explain this slide. The dots are various refineries. This particular slide is cash operating cost and what it does try to compare is the cost of running each barrel of crude on an equivalent complexity basis. Having said that the important thing is the two lines and what they basically represent are the break points between the quartiles for Western Europe. So, the bottom line is if you're better than that line you are in the first quartile, you are the top 25% of all refineries in Europe. If you're in above the top line you are in the fourth quartile or in the worst 25%. So, what matters to us is where we stand which is the LUKOIL or the dots. As you can see most all but one of our refineries are at or in the first quartile and what this means is that we have a competitive cost advantage relative to refineries in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>This one is maintenance index. Same story, we're basically first quartile. Next one is utilization. Again I think that relative to Western Europe, we have very competitive and very reliable assets. So next, this slide was actually -- Mr. Fedun showed but I put on an extra line here which was our utilization. So you've already seen the capacity slide, but this shows the focus that we've had over the last several years to actually use the assets that we do have and so we can at the same capacity we keep increasing the utilization of our assets.</p>
          <p>This is just a comparison of 2007 versus 2006 results and this is on an EBITDA basis. And refining has improved about $900 million and the reasons for -- are varied, but primarily a small amount was because of new investments, 8% or so. We also got the benefit of global market being better. That was about 21% or so. But the other key ones that I really want to talk about for just a moment is one is capacity utilization. We now use more crude capacity, but we used all of our other units substantially more and that ended up with &#x2013; to be 16% of the $900 million. The biggest chunk, 31%, was what I called market and logistics optimization and what this is, is that Russia has become a premium market. Products sold in Russia are substantially more valued than exporting and we, and this shows the power of LUKOIL, it's not just a refining thing but between marketing, commercial and refining we were able to optimize our channels, so more products in Russia and make a lot more money. Most Russian companies couldn't say this because they simply don't work together within the company. This was a joint effort refining got the credit here but it was a LUKOIL effort and that shows you the power that LUKOIL has; and then lastly, some optimization between products particularly between naphtha and gasoline and gasoil and resid.</p>
          <p>Looking at our investments, again I said we have our portfolio of options and each of them have different economy drivers. I think that's the strength of this portfolio. We have certain small amount that is just in efficiency items that will be profitable under any market scenario. We have some that are crude throughput related which are probably short-lived but we can make some money here quickly in the short-term. We have a large chunk that are conversion related, which again will be I think be very profitable and lastly the quality, which I referred to you earlier that I think us being able to make Euro-3 in Russia and Euro-5 eventually and Euro-5 in Europe is very important.</p>
          <p>I won't to dwell on these, but we have a wide range of products -- projects planned, advanced process control. The product quality I talked about is primarily marking sulfur on gasoline and diesel and then increasing refining capacity and then many conversion projects we have available that will have good economics and geographically diversed, so that we can meet the market demands. And then in the end this is where we end-up with. We end-up with a very strong, in 2017, complex refining system that has high conversion.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, Russia is a very good refining market and LUKOIL is no doubt probably best positioned in that market. We also have in place plans to improve our efficiency and we have some very attractive investment opportunities as well. So thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Fedun presented to you the most important results of the year 2007 and I would like in my presentation just to stress-out or point-out the most, the quantitative qualification of these results. You see that as it's already been explained that 2007 environment was very, very specific. From one stage positive results is a growth of the crude prices. The other side is inflation of expenses, Ruble appreciation. These factors are the more driving factors in our growth results and expenses results. And also the government, the Russian government still use the oil companies as a main cash cow currently and that's full of the increasing of exporters, increasing of taxes like oil replacement tax and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>And I would like that in my -- in the numbers in financial statements just to show how the company reacts on these challenges. And first of all, I would like to say, first of all, that the growth of production, you see, active expenses control switch of the production to the most profitable business segments like refinery as already you've been told and internal markets and also discussion with the governmental oil companies, with the government concerning the tax optimization, which would give the oil companies the chance to increase the production to move further to the undeveloped region of Russia for oil extraction.</p>
          <p>But first of all, I would like to say it's our belief, strong belief that LUKOIL is still substantially under-valued. You can see that we took the numbers of the years and if you compare that the extra LUKOIL income during the last three years, which was on average 29% higher than consensus forecast of the investors at the beginning of the year. And you see that at the same time LUKOIL's net income, as you can see, considerably higher rate than other competitors. And at the same company capitalization decreased as you see in this slide, compare with the global oils that means we have good growth in price earning ratio we have good growth in net income but at the same time, market values as differently. And we would like to let's say pay attention at the activity of the company which would try to change these market perception of the company LUKOIL. As I have already tell you at the very beginning, if you see at the macroeconomic and tax environment you can see that crude prices has been grown up to 30%, natural gas 68% and you see all revenue factors have good substantial growth. At the same time, expenses also grow dramatically.</p>
          <p>First of all, that energy tariffs, transportation tariffs, huge growth of producer prices up to 25% which for us means that we have to buy for example pipe and so on twice -- 25% higher compared with last year. And the most important issue is ruble appreciation which has growth we have a different calculation but in our final presentation you will see that ruble appreciation is up to 20%. At the same time as I already told you taxes have been grown at 16% mineral extraction tax and export tariff up to 5%.</p>
          <p>You can see that the price of crude and the dollars and euro evaluation correlate like 95%, that's why we follow this correlation and based on these macroeconomic results you can see our major operation results. Oil production has grown 1.4%, gas production plus 2.5% and the total hydrocarbons production up to 1.5%. At the same time, the refinery throughputs up to 6.7%, gas processing 25% and as I told you at the very beginning we also switch all the segments of our business, crude export has been declined up to 4.5%, because, say, the efficiency of the internal market, the efficiency of refinery has been grown dramatically, that's why from our point of view it's much better to get more profits and not just export the growth and pay the huge export tariffs.</p>
          <p>Retail sales have grown 14.3% and at the same time the average sales per filling station also has been increased up to 10%, which what means that the most important and the most profitable channels of sales has been used by the company and we have been limited only our refinery capacities and our &#x2013; let's say capacities in the development of a retail network. That's why next year this has already been explained by Mr. Fedun, the company would follow the same strategy which is driven by mostly macroeconomic factors and tax specific in Russia. And I also would like to mention that the company would try to not to be so dependent from Russia, that's why it's also growing the business outside of Russia both in our upstream involving in new projects and the last one was the gas projects in Uzbekistan and also in refinery and retail market it's like development of the refineries outside of Russia, grow the business of Burgas gas refinery and acquire the network of gas station around Europe to be able to sell all the products which has been produced by the company by itself and just to have got complete vertical integration chain.</p>
          <p>If you look at the marketable, hydrocarbon output reconciliation, you would see that production grow 6.7%, 1.5% that means 33 barrels per day from 2.145 to 2.178. At the same time as a reaction of the grown expenses one of the I think good example, best example is the development of these energy sector and the construction of own gas turbine power stations. You see that the price for energy has been grown up to 15% that's &#x2013; and also there is a huge sufficient deficit of the power energy supply. That's why LUKOIL already built in the year 2007 its own gas turbine power station with capacity of 72 megawatt in Western Siberia. And first of all, it gives to us the control of expenses. Secondly, it allow us to develop the business in Western Siberia in spite of the fact the lack of available energy supply. And the third one, we let's say increase the usage of our associated gas, which the government now looks very attentively and would like to impose some even some fines and penalties for the not appropriate using of associated gas.</p>
          <p>Crude oil refining. It's the most profitable &#x2013; as I already told you the most profitable business segment this year that's why all refining capacity are both in Russia and outside of Russia has been used by the company just to avoid simple crude export, avoid the paying additional export tariff, because export tariff on the products are significantly less compared with the export tariff on the crude. The company tried to use all these channels. That's why also the investment program, I will tell you later about the investment program. It also would allow the company to increase, first of all, the quantity of the products and the quality of the products which would be put on the market and we think it would give us more efficient financial results next year.</p>
          <p>A few words about market expansion, last year has been acquired 735 new filling stations, a few foreign facilities and which gives us volume, potential volume for retail sales 2.7 million ton per year, and we increased the retail sales of petroleum products up to 21% last year. The beginning of next year Mr. Fedun told you that the company acquired big stake in the Moscow market, which is the most profitable market in Russia which would put us in one of the leading retail companies in Russia and which would allow the company to let's say, sell all the products through the individual retail channels which would give to the company the additional efficiency and which would allow us to have vertically integrated chain from extraction till filling station.</p>
          <p>And now let's say the -- some sort of summarizing financial results. You see that based on the attempts management of the company done, you would see that revenue increased up to 20.7%, EBITDA 25.1%, which now $15.388 billion and net income increased up to 27.1% to the level of $9.511 million, which is the, as you know that's the most net income ever company has ever had. And as I tried to show you in this presentation that's not just on the results of the just price growth, but that's the result of the excess management, that management is trying to focus on the key areas and try to follow these strategy within a year and follow it we hope also the next year.</p>
          <p>Just a few typical numbers if you see at the sales reconciliation that you see that 21% of growth has been resulted mostly change in price, but also change in volume sold, increasing of sales mix, which would show the result of the management.</p>
          <p>Sales breakdown you again may see that our sales of products both internally and in Russia increased roughly 25%, which gives this additional efficiency to the company numbers.</p>
          <p>Operation expenses, you can see that the company could control operational expenses a little bit higher compared with last year, but at the same time we need to take into consideration that if lifting cost increased up to 16% roughly, all the ruble appreciation for us means 20% and all -- almost all our expenses, 95% of our expenses are made in rubles, because the most operating zone in Russia is operation zone for the company is Russia. That's why we bear all the costs in the rubles, but even with this ruble appreciation, the company achieved the increase in expenses, less compared with the increase in rubles appreciation that also shows that company try to control these expenses. I should say on a daily basis, currently and is developing end use special program, which would allow the company to put the more efficient control of expenses and the result of this program I think would be presented early next year.</p>
          <p>Next, I already told you the drivers of OPEX you know, that's inflation at there is and all of these numbers you can see every year, but last year it was really tremendous result especially with ruble appreciation. Selling, general and administration, SG&amp;A and transportation expenses driven by the same logic, you see that transportation tariff for the aerial route has been grown up to 35% and you can see that it was the main factor of the growth of transportation expenses this year. But company now you saw it in this presentation, Mulyak trying to find out the more valuable, more efficient channels and one of them would be this Varandey terminal, which would decrease the transportation cost especially rail-road cost, cost related with transportation of crude from North part of Russia to the broadest and to -- and for the export, which we think would allow us little bit control also transportation expenses.</p>
          <p>Tax burden that's the most interesting topic, which has already been discussed for I think for the last three years every time we say that the government tries to use the company's cash curve and that's the normal position in this environment. We try to focus on alcohol and concentrate how we can develop the business take into consideration this restriction of the State and one of them is going outside of Russia trying to find out the projects in the countries we are more tax favorable to some extend. And second one try to be the tax adjustment not means collecting, that's also part of the policy of the government, which try to switch on the and oil companies from just crude production and exportation to internal refining and to developing of an internal capacities to develop the internal markets. And we try to follow this strategy and develop these areas.</p>
          <p>But you see that 16% growth in mineral extraction tax and 5% growth in export tariff comparison, which results for us that from each dollar of growth of the crude price, we can get only $0.09 in profits that's 9%  is now collected by the taxes, but as Mr. Fedun told you we are with the other oil companies and first of all the governmentally owned oil companies, state owned companies we have already started discussion concerning some changes in tax regulations. One of them and in this next slide, you can see that one of them already been implemented that means that some tax reliefs on the heavy crude on the subsoil already used wells has been improved -- declined and we think that in next year it will give us 500 millions of additional effect. Currently Minister of Finance already announced the idea to decrease the non-taxable level in export tariff tax from 9 to $15 per barrel which gives us additional efficiency roughly $900 million. New legislation concerning the differentiation and excise tax which would allow the companies which might use the ecological and high quality products to pay less excise taxes which we are of course we plan to use the best quality products in Russia we think it would gives us additionally $200 million and unfortunately it would lead to increasing of profit tax, but we believe that the total growth of net income could be, if all these things would happen, would be over a $1 billion. That means that the government also thinks about some additional tax incentives for the oil company to give them a chance to develop the fields and new regions in Russia.</p>
          <p>EBITDA reconciliation, you can see that exploration, production is the most driving sector, but what's the key and after the presentation, it's not easy to present financial results after presentation just the one business segment, but this downstream business segment you can see was the most developing segment next year. You see that refining and marketing accounted for about 35% of EBITDA growth in 2007, that means the company is concentrated on the development of the appropriate downstream business, which now leads to that, now at least has the magical effect in the numbers.</p>
          <p>Net income reconciliation, you can see that the total growth of net income is now 27%, but for me it will be just for the comparison, to compare the results of the fourth quarter of 2006 and fourth quarter of 2007, it's retail prices, but annually that if you compare these results you will see the growth 208% in net income.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, in this slide you can see that free cash flow increased up to 34.4% and I think one of the interesting slide shows of the future of the company is CAPEX breakdown. You see that LUKOIL CAPEX increased up to 36.1% to a level of $9.372 billion. Most of them, 75% has been done in exploration production and the rest in refining and marketing. That gives that the company put a lot of efforts, a lot of all available cash flow to the development of new, potential fields and what's the most important that you can see that the only privately oil owned company in Russia could get excess with the State owned oil company to the fields which has not been developed yet.  That's a good chance for us and the company would like to use it because otherwise it would be very difficult to find out where to develop the business and that's based on the appropriate relationship between the company and the government.</p>
          <p>Next slide shows that LUKOIL company with rapidly grown cash flow and really it creating and using the market opportunities. You can see on this slide that CAPEX into the future growth account for about 40% of the total company CAPEX. What does it mean?  That means that approximately 50% of cash flow -- has been used not for the maintenance of the current oil production. Yes, so 50% has been &#x2013; or used for the development of the new fields and I think currently, the management of company believe that the potential for the growth of the company because these opportunities maybe will not be available in the foreseeable futures. And that's why company believe that currently taken it into consideration the option of paying just dividends and developing the new projects which are available for the company. Company says that it is concentrated potentially on the future growth. That shows that 50% of CAPEX would be used for these new areas for the new fields.</p>
          <p>This slide shows that the company has very stable financial position. First of all, it has investment grade rating from all three major agencies, all key agencies, now have got investment grade. We got it in 2000, -- '07 and I think we will follow it that also we have got a very strict financial discipline. You can see the financial covenants that the total debt of company is roughly $6 billion including the internal over a $1 billion alone from ConocoPhillips. We should do what considered really is a loan, it is considered is this just for the accounting purpose, because we have got as far as you know, we have got, joint venture with ConocoPhillips in the Northern market region. And we invest in finance this joint venture through the inter-company laws. From our point of view it's just a equity, but for the tax reason it has been arranged as a loan, but you, the current accounting regulation says that it has to be considered as a loan. But, take even with this 1 billion, the total debt portfolio is less than six, it's roughly $6 billion, which for the company with equity which is close to $40 billion. I think it's a very positive result and which gives us this special ability that in the case the company finds out the target for huge and efficient acquisition the company may use this spare capacity for this acquisition. That's why we are still really ready, we don't use the chances just to borrow all the cash for the current projects that means the level of development currently is based on our own internal cash flow, which <mark type="inaudible" /> gives us, I think, very good opportunities for the M&amp;H in the future, and we think that this future may come.</p>
          <p>And just in conclusion, I would like to emphasize that we think that the company is developing, developing appropriately. And at least based on the market expectation, we think that its even exceed little bit market expectation, which doesn't unfortunately reflect in our market capitalization. We think that with the future decreasing of tax burden, accelerated refinery throughputs, expanding gas processing, and let's say new discoveries which been explained in the presentation of Mr. Fedun, the company could achieve more positive results and we will have chance to discuss it with you in the next meeting. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>The presentation is going to be concluded by Mr. Vagit Alekperov, the President of LUKOIL. So please switch your -- earphones in Michigan.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have listened to three presentations that together presented to you the activities of the company in 2007. Today we have clearcut plans that have been approved by the Board of Directors until the 2017 and we are in the process of implementing these plans. I believe that the company's main objectives today is to keep the costs under control. Another task is to efficiently and speedily put into operations the assets that the company has already acquired and that are today in the stage of development. We should continue with modernizing our refining capacities, and we should develop a new business for us, the gas business and the energy market. Mr. Mueller who is the Head of the Refining in the company participated in this meeting. This is the results of the joint's program that we have been implementing together with ConocoPhillips. This is a training and retraining of personnel program, this is exchange of experts between the companies. Not only Mr. Mueller works in our company from ConocoPhillips, we have many more people from ConocoPhillips now, so this program is underway, it is advancing and this gives us new perspective on the activities that we conduct.</p>
          <p>2008 for us will be a turning point in terms of introduction of the automation and information management system of the company. In 2008 SAPRC will be installed in the company and will cover all enterprises and local. We believe that it will give very good results. There will be a possibility to reduce the staffing levels, so all of this, all this opportunities makes us believe that we are one of the best companies in Russia. So after these presentations we will answer your questions. Hopefully through this answers you will get more information about our clients, you will learn more about the actions that we are undertaking with just one view in mind to improve the efficiency of your investments to increase the shareholder value. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The company is actually exploring. It has been already mentioned in the presentation last year, we found -- we drilled first wells on the new field <mark type="inaudible" />, field in the Komi Republic. The first well was drilled and the second well is being drilled and the whole set of exploratory works have been scheduled for that field and we expect discoveries there. We continue exploration and we drill and also deeper well in the oil field in the Astrakhan oil base. In Astrakhan region this is a part of a major gas field that is operated by Gazprom, here now that we created a joint venture with Gazprom NEFT with a share of 49% for LUKOIL and 51% for Gazprom NEFT. This company in 2008 will start active work on new sites. The purpose for the establishment of this joint venture is to participate in tenders and to launch new fields into operation and well operation of these wells. We continue exploration in the Caspian region, in the consortium, KazMunaiGaz, Gazprom and LUKOIL a deep well is been drilled in the central parts of the Caspian Sea and according to preliminary data, we can be assured that this will be a productive well. It is on the border between Kazakhstan and Russia. There are several other projects that the company is implementing in Uzbekistan too, and you have already heard that I have just traveled to Iraq as a number of our small delegation headed by the first Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We gave an address from the President of Russia Vladimir Putin to the Prime Minister of Iraq. I spoke to the President of Iraq, Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister, Minister of Oil and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. And this time, I felt a great desire of the Iraqi party to have close cooperation with our company and next week a working group from LUKOIL will go to Baghdad and they will be engaged in details, negotiations on west corner to our projects and I hope that this will be worth a chance, this will be a good outcome.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Merrill Lynch. You, throughout your presentation today you highlighted refining really as a key driver of profitability growth in 2007. Can you just give us an update on how you expect to increase utilization rates in the coming years, where that's going to come from, because utilization rates already look quite high?  And secondly, how you think the refining sector in Russia is panning out at the moment and whether we're going to see further increases like we did this year?  And thirdly, if you can just give us an update on the progress you're making with your refinery upgrades that you are talking about in terms of sourcing the upgraded that the units that you are looking to order, the compressors and everything else that you are looking to order and are we going to see these coming on stream in time as you've described?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first part of your question, and I will &#x2013; leave all the technical details to Mr. Mueller. Two weeks ago the company signed a contract with Grands NEFT to increase utilization of our refineries in Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod. Basically, we will talk about additional capacity by 2011 to grow by 200,000 barrels per day. Two days ago &#x2013; I signed an agreement with the Russian Railways for transportation of that volume and to increase the load of our terminal in our resorts up to 14 million tons. So this is a complete technological chain. There is an agreement to increase the load to increase utilization and there is an agreement to transport that load. And yes, refining is much more profitable than export of crude oil. LUKOIL is the only non-government owned company, a private company that has its own terminals to export crude oil that we've just presented to you, the Varandey terminal. This terminal has all the functions boundary posts, the customs clearance. We also have terminals in the Caspian and the Baltic and in Kaliningrad, and these terminals are efficiently employed today. They too have all the customs, and the boundary clearance. So we have established an infrastructure that instills comfort in us, in terms of our future of refining, and I give the floor to Mr. Mueller now for technical details?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To add to that I think -- absolutely, that is absolutely right, I mean our first issue is logistics in market. We have the capacity, if we can get the logistics in the market, we're in much better shape. Secondly, on our projects essentially we've implemented some new discipline in the way we do projects. We -- all new projects go through a gated process to ensure that all input has been received by all parties so that we do the right projects. For projects that are currently ongoing, we do detailed reviews as well and the big issue, as you alluded to, is around procurement. We are working with vendors to come up with what is called the West Master Purchase Agreements so that we can negotiate prices upfront and then contract terms upfront rather than doing it for each project, and that has just started. And I think that's going to be a major help to delivering our projects on time and on budget. We are really focused on discipline on projects. The only way you can deliver the project on time on budget it is to go through a disciplined process. So and that is what we are doing. I guess that was -- was that hit all your questions, or was there another...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty much, this is a follow-up, you were also mentioning looking at opportunistic expansion, can you give us a bit more clarity around what sort of assets you would be looking at in the market, what regions you would be looking at and whether this would complement any sort of your upstream expansion plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean you answered your question, thank you. I mean it is about where geographically it makes sense, I mean we are an integrated oil company. So we want to -- we obviously want to make money in refining, but we want to do that by complementing our other assets, so if you look around the natural supply lines is where we would want expansion, where we have markets obviously we want expansion. So it has to be aligned, the value chain is the most important thing because that gives us the most opportunity to make -- to have a competitive advantage and to make the most amount of money.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ms. Hagen from World's News Agency. Your financial report mentioned the significant loss in derivative turning. I was wondering if you could give us some detail as to how that occurred and whether you have taken measures to prevent that this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me explain at least you see that's it was the part of the strategy of our trading company to be involved in hedging and you see that if the price goes up they try to control their trading, additions and that's a result of that. But based on this current development the company now is in the process of complete reviewing of the hedging strategy. That means this reviewing would mean first of all that the company would not hedge the basic operational risk which means the basic risk of the own production crude and the products. From that point of view we think that we would achieve the positive results and also it would concentrate on the hedging of the non-core risk like financial risk, like ruble dollar evaluation or euro evaluation and also a currency risk and interest risk.</p>

          <p>Numacha Gordon from Goldman Sachs. Could you maybe talk a little bit about your production growth profile this year you are not putting on a chart of the typical report, so I'm just curious whether any of the numbers that you were putting out before have been changed?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2008, and also I think you used to give like a five year view and maybe a ten year view 2012, 2015, so if you can give a short-term and then a long-term and also a break-down for gas and oil?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The focus for long-term have not changed. You know that this year there was a delay in our part in Yuzhnaya Khylchuya field into operation because the last two years have been too warm, we had only two months each year to do the work, but this year we managed to complete this works and on the 10th of June of this year the first oil will be delivered through the Varandey Terminal will be offloaded on the tanker. So hopefully this will happen around the 10th of July. As to the forecast, we, this year we forecast the growth and production of hydrocarbons. We take technological and administrative measures to stabilize oil production and its growth in long-term in Western Siberia. And new person, Mr. Shamsuarov for the Executive VP is now appointed. So Western Siberia, he, for seven years he used to be VP in LUKOIL overseas he was in charge of international projects, and he displayed the best qualities of a competent administrator and true professional. So our forecast that we made earlier will until 2009, will stay within the previous projections that we saw in the earlier presentations.</p>
