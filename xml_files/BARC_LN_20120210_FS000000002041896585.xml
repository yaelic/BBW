        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Full Year Results. You will see this morning that our performance in 2011 was reassuring in a very challenging environment. We delivered profits of &#xA3;5.6 billion for the year. The contribution from our businesses in Retail and Business Banking broadly balanced those of Corporate and Investment Banking and revenues were well-diversified geographically, demonstrating the strength and diversification of the Universal Banking model.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our major businesses also improved their market share. While top line income was down 8% in a difficult environment, income grew in five of our seven businesses and impairment improved 33%. We controlled costs tightly, so that we now have the confidence to double our cost reduction target for 2013 to &#xA3;2 billion.</p>
          <p>We reduced performance-related pay by 25% while profits were down just 2%. At the same time, our capital ratios have continued to strengthen. We have a deep pool of high quality liquid assets and we have good access to a range of funding markets. This financial strength gives us a significant competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>We recognize the importance of dividends to shareholders and we are pleased that we're able to increase the dividends by 9%. We have delivered these results by playing an active role in the real economy. Let me give you a few examples. Our lending to U.K. businesses exceeded targets set under Project Merlin by 13%. And within that, we exceeded our lending targets for small businesses.</p>
          <p>We supported more than 100,000 U.K. startups in 2011. Bank of England data showed that U.K. net lending was down 5% on 2010; our net lending to companies in the U.K. increased 3% year-on-year. Not surprisingly, our four main execution priorities, capital, returns, income and citizenship, continued to be our major focus. I'll talk later about the progress we've made on each of these, but before that, Chris will take you through the numbers and we'll take questions at the end.</p>
          <p>We have a very strong team. This team has been together for many years and we are united in our commitment to delivering on our execution priorities. It's good to have here with me, Robert Le Blanc, Tom Kalaris, Antony Jenkins, Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier have joined Chris and I on the stage. And we have Maria Ramos on the phone from South Africa where Absa is also announcing their earnings this morning.</p>
          <p>Chris, can you take us through the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. We delivered adjusted profit before tax of &#xA3;5.6 billion in 2011. This was well balanced across the group. Statutory profits were broadly similar at &#xA3;5.9 billion. The adjusted numbers principally exclude gains on own credit and debt buybacks of &#xA3;3.8 billion, impairment on our stake in BlackRock of &#xA3;1.8 billion, the &#xA3;1 billion provision for PPI and almost &#xA3;600 million of goodwill write-offs taken in the fourth quarter, mainly in Spain.</p>
          <p>I'm going to use adjusted numbers throughout my presentation because I believe they give a better understanding of the operating trends and performance. We have of course provided statutory numbers in our announcement.</p>
          <p>Turning to the headlines for the Group, income declined 8% in a very challenging environment. Impairment improved 33% to &#xA3;3.8 billion, and our annualized loan loss rate reduced to 77 basis points from 118 basis points last year. We reduced costs by &#xA3;869 million or 4% to &#xA3;18.9 billion, excluding the bank levy. Profits declined just 2% as a result of our focus on cost control and strong risk management. Our return on equity was 6.6%, and return on tangible equity was 7.9%. We recognize that this is unsatisfactory, and Bob will talk more about returns later. Earnings per share were 25.1 pence, and as Bob announced, we have decided on a final dividend of 3 pence, bringing the total dividend for the year to 6 pence.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the performance of the individual businesses, I'll start with U.K. Retail and Business banking, where profits grew 60% to &#xA3;1.4 billion. Income increased 3% mainly in mortgages and personal savings. Impairments improved 35% as a result of lower unsecured lending charges and costs were down 4%. This delivered a return on equity of nearly 15%, up from 10% in the prior year. Total loans and advances to customers increased 5%, driven by mortgages. Europe Retail and Business Banking reported a loss of &#xA3;234 million. This included &#xA3;189 million of restructuring, principally in Spain, where we've closed 20% of our branches and reduced head count by 18%. Impairment in Europe improved 17%, reflecting our relatively conservative risk profile. Africa Retail and Business Banking profits increased 26% to &#xA3;908 million, with improvements in income, impairment and costs, despite depreciation of the rand against sterling.</p>
          <p>At Barclaycard profits grew 53% to &#xA3;1.2 billion. Income rose 2% while impairment declined 25%, as arrears improved in all of our major markets. Return on equity rose to 17.4% from less than 13% last year. Barclays Capital reported profits of &#xA3;3 billion. Income was down 22% to &#xA3;10.3 billion in difficult market conditions. Impairment was less than &#xA3;100 million and expenses decreased 12% to &#xA3;7.3 billion as we exercise tight cost-control. This included a reduction in both performance and non-performance costs.</p>
          <p>Income in the fourth quarter was down 19% on the third, FICC revenues decreased 32%, Equities and Prime Services were down only 10%, which is a good performance compared to the industry. Our revenues in our M&amp;A Advisory business increased 30%.</p>
          <p>We've continued to grow market share, which Bob will talk about later. The cost to net operating income ratio was 71% as a result of weak market conditions in the second half as well as ongoing investment in the business. This compares well to the industry, though it's above the target range of 60% to 65% to which we remain committed. Despite market conditions, Barclays Capital generated a return on equity of 10.4%.</p>
          <p>Barclays Corporate delivered profits of &#xA3;126 million, compared to a loss of &#xA3;388 million last year. The U.K. business reported profits of almost &#xA3;750 million while lending in the U.K. increased 5% to &#xA3;66 billion.</p>
          <p>Performance outside the U.K. improved dramatically. In Europe, losses reduced 39% to &#xA3;524 million driven by improved impairment in Spain, which halved to just under &#xA3;500 million. This shows the benefit of the early action we've taken to recognize impairment in 2010. Losses in other corporate markets reduced 74% to under &#xA3;100 million.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Wealth, we continue to invest in the business and profits increased 27% to &#xA3;207 million as income grew 12% and exceeded cost growth.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to talk briefly about margins across the Retail, Corporate Banking and Wealth businesses. Our overall net interest margin was broadly flat year-on-year which is a good performance given the environment.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, the continuation of low interest rates will result in a lower but still significant contribution from our structural hedges. You'll find more detail on margins in the results announcement. Gains on own credit and debt buybacks are now accounted for in the head office, and the impairment on our stake in BlackRock is in investment management. Adjusting for the bank levy, head office losses of about &#xA3;780 million are broadly flat year-on-year.</p>
          <p>I'd like to give you now more detail on costs, capital, liquidity and funding. I'll start with costs.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the breakdown between statutory and adjusted costs in 2011, excluding PPI and goodwill, costs amounted to &#xA3;19.2 billion. The U.K. bank levy of &#xA3;325 million also affects the year-on-year comparison. But excluding this, costs were down 4% to &#xA3;18.9 billion. As you know, we announced plans last year to achieve a cost reduction of &#xA3;1 billion by 2013. This slide gives a more detailed breakdown of the reductions we have made.</p>
          <p>Costs decreased by &#xA3;1.4 billion after adjusting for year-on-year changes and a one-off pension credit. The reduction breaks down into performance costs of &#xA3;823 million and non-performance costs of &#xA3;592 million. Again, you'll find detailed disclosure on performance costs in the announcement.</p>
          <p>The target for 2013 is based on non-performance costs. These are being reduced through actions such as rationalizing our locations across the business, sharing infrastructure between Barclays Capital, Barclays Corporate and Wealth, integrating global support functions such as IT and property management and challenging all additional spending.</p>
          <p>Having started to make these changes, it's clear that they will deliver more savings than we initially expected. And as Bob has said, we're now increasing our non-performance cost savings target to &#xA3;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to look at the balance sheet, total assets grew 5% to almost &#xA3;1.5 trillion. I know this is a large number, so I want to spend a few minutes looking at this in relation to our funding requirements. Approximately 1/3 of the gross balance sheet is accounted for by broadly matched derivative assets and liabilities. Most of the total asset growth in 2011 relates to this part of the balance sheet were 7% growth in derivative assets is matched by equal growth in derivative liabilities.</p>
          <p>A further proportion of the balance sheet is reverse repos. These are used to either settle short inventory positions or to provide customer financing that's collateralize by highly-liquid assets. Customer loans and advances are largely financed by customer deposits. A substantial portion of our liquidity pool is funded with wholesale funding that has maturities of less than one year. And all short-term liabilities that we raise are put directly into liquidity pool.</p>
          <p>The remaining assets on our balance sheet are primarily funded by longer term wholesale funds and equity. Analyzing the balance sheet this way, shows there's only &#xA3;265 billion of our total balance sheet relies on wholesale funding. We've raised &#xA3;30 billion of wholesale term debt in 2011 against maturities of &#xA3;25 billion.</p>
          <p>Our wholesale funding maturities for 2012 are &#xA3;27 billion and we've raised &#xA3;5 billion in January at highly competitive rates reflecting the strength of our brand and credit quality in the market. Most of our outstanding term debt is unsecured and the level of encumbrance on our loan book is approximately 10%, so we have a lot of flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>Despite stresses in the funding markets, our liquidity remained strong throughout 2011 and at the year-end, our liquidity pool stood at &#xA3;152 billion, most of which is in central bank deposits and high quality government bonds. We're confident that we will meet the Basel 3 liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios in the timescale required.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to capital. We've strengthened our core Tier 1 ratio from 10.8% to 11%, retained profits added 70 basis points to the capital ratio during the year, which more than offset pension fund contributions and other movements. Adjusted gross leverage was stable at 20 times and risk-weighted assets were slightly lower at &#xA3;391 billion despite absorbing a &#xA3;30 billion increase in market risk, RWAs, resulting from the introduction of CRD3.</p>
          <p>This reduction was the result of management actions as well as lower business volumes in Barclays Capital during the second half.</p>
          <p>We continue to work on the implementation of Basel 3, but the way in which we managed Basel 2.5 demonstrates how we're able to respond to regulatory change. Pro forma calculation show consensus-retained earnings delivering an increase in our capital ratio of 150 basis points by the end of 2013 on a Basel 2.5 basis.</p>
          <p>We estimate this increase will be offset by Basel 3 impacts on capital and RWAs mitigated by management actions such as further reductions in legacy assets, tight management account party risk and reductions in securitization positions.</p>
          <p>This takes us to a pro forma core Tier 1 ratio of about 11% at the end of 2013. This allows capacity amounting to about &#xA3;50 billion of RWAs above a 10% core Tier 1 ratio. We view this as a suitable buffer to manage business growth, regulatory uncertainty and volatile market conditions.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to comment briefly on the outlook for 2012. The performance of RBB and Corporate Banking in January was consistent with the good performance achieved in 2011. Though it's too soon to suggest a trend, improvement in market conditions has resulted in an encouraging start to the year for Barclays Capital.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize, we delivered profits of &#xA3;5.6 billion with income growth in every business except Corporate and Investment Banking. Impairment improved 33%. We've managed costs down 4% excluding the bank levy and we've increased the dividend by 9%. Our capital ratio increased to 11% and our funding and liquidity strength continues to give us a competitive advantage. Thank you very much indeed. I'll now hand back to Bob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. We've been focused on our four execution priorities for a year now, so this seems like a good moment to stand back and look at what we've achieved. Let me start with capital.</p>
          <p>You've heard from Chris that our core Tier 1 ratio stands at 11%. This is even after absorbing the full impact of CRD3. You've also heard that our capital position will remain rock solid under Basel 3. When I look back over the last few years, one of the best decisions that we have taken at Barclays was in October 2008. When regulators told us that they wanted banks to raise the bar for equity capital, we decided then to raise capital swiftly and in scale to put our ratios ahead of regulatory requirements. We wanted to put a sign up, a metaphorical sign for our customers and clients saying very simply that Barclays was open for business.</p>
          <p>Today, we're recognized for our strength in terms of capital, liquidity and funding, and as a result, we're seen by our customers as a safe haven in times of stress. And that is why our competitive position has improved during the difficult markets in 2011. Our competitive position has improved in U.K. Retail and Business Banking. It's improved in Africa. It's improved in our Cards business. It's improved in our Corporate, Investment Banking and Wealth businesses. This strength in capital, liquidity and funding gives us a very real competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to returns. We continue to believe that return on equity is an appropriate target. As you would expect, we also use other metrics to manage our business and to measure the business. Measures such as return on risk-weighted assets, leverage ratios and cost efficiency. But return on equity is the financial measure that correlates most closely with shareholder value. So, it's extremely important to us and more importantly it's extremely important to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We also know that our returns today are unsatisfactory and that we have a lot more work to do. But let me take you through what we've done in 2011. We told you that we would either exit or improve those businesses with the returns below our cost of equity. We closed our business in Indonesia; we refocused our businesses in Russia and India on Corporate and Investment Banking. We restructured our business in Spain and we closed Barclays Financial Planning in the U.K. We now offer retail investment services online instead of through our branches.</p>
          <p>Two of our biggest and most important businesses already deliver return on equity above our target. U.K. Retail and Business Banking returns were almost 15%, up from 10% last year. And our Cards business delivered returns of 17.4%. Investment Banking made profits of &#xA3;3 billion, representing a return on equity of 10.4%.</p>
          <p>While this does not yet meet our goal, it is a good performance relative to the industry. We were one of just a few firms able to deliver double-digit returns in a very tough environment. We reduced our credit market exposures by 37% during the year, so they now stand at &#xA3;15.2 billion.</p>
          <p>This brings the total reduction since 2008 to 64% or &#xA3;27 billion. Risk-weighted assets reduced 2% year-on-year despite having absorbed a &#xA3;30-billion impact from CRD3. This was in part the result of lower business volumes due to lack of confidence on the part of clients in an uncertain economy.</p>
          <p>The reduction in RWAs at Barclays Capital over the last three years amounts to &#xA3;41 billion. We've also been building areas with low capital consumption and higher returns such as our Equities and Advisory businesses. I'll talk more about those later.</p>
          <p>We continue to examine each and every part of the business to ensure success when changes in capital treatment are brought in under Basel 3 and we'll talk more about this at an Investor Day in the fall when we have even more complete information on CRD4.</p>
          <p>In those businesses where we have been investing, returns strengthened to 10% in Africa and to 11% in Wealth Management where the Gamma Plan will deliver a business with high returns and low capital consumption.</p>
          <p>Then we have two businesses that we are fixing, Corporate Banking and Europe. Corporate Banking made a significant move from negative to positive returns during the year. In Spain, we wrote off goodwill which decreased returns in Europe in the short term. We have a lot more work to do across Europe to return that business to profitability. Given their significance, addressing these businesses is an important priority.</p>
          <p>Our 13% target has been a vital factor in making disciplined choices over the last 12 months. Since we set our target last year, however, we have faced some significant external headwinds. The Eurozone crisis has impacted confidence and resulted in much lower levels of client activity in the second half of 2011. We face the challenge of a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. There have also been new political and regulatory constraints. These include the introduction of the U.K. bank levy, the subsequent increase in that levy, the treatment of our BlackRock stake and European stress tests, as well as cumulative calls to hold additional capital.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that a return on equity of 13% is the right goal and is achievable. But given the impact of these changes, we may not be able to achieve our target in 2013. Timing could be affected both by the macroeconomic environment and by any unexpected changes in regulation or in its implementation. We continue to focus on those factors within our control and expect to make steady improvement in our return on equity going forward through our combination of capital discipline, controlling funding costs, restructuring or exiting businesses, growing revenues and reducing costs. Let me talk about costs as an example of the action we're taking.</p>
          <p>This time last year, we told you that we planned to reduce costs by &#xA3;1 billion by 2013. We have now doubled that target to &#xA3;2 billion. We're able to do that because we are operating in a much more integrated way across Barclays. We now run our support functions, finance, human resources, legal, compliance, risk in a much more integrated and a much more efficient way. An outwards manifestation of this integration is that we are now moving to one global brand and consolidating suppliers. This integration is not just about delivering efficiencies. It's also improving our ability to serve customers and clients in order to support the real economy.</p>
          <p>Our Corporate Banking business brings this to life. We have integrated Corporate and Investment Banking and they now use a shared infrastructure, which is both more efficient and enables us to serve our clients better. Our Investment Banking clients increasingly turn to the Corporate Bank for cash management and trade finance. And our Corporate Banking clients gain access to capital markets and risk management through the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>The closer integration of these businesses led to an increase in revenues last year of 14% from sales of corporate products to Investment Banking clients and vice versa. We introduced our Wealth Management services to the people who run these corporate businesses. Last year, this resulted in the introduction of more than &#xA3;1 billion of new client funds, double the previous year.</p>
          <p>We're delivering payments expertise from Barclaycard to clients of the Corporate Bank. Barclaycards signed up 70% more clients from these referrals than the year before. This is a tangible example of what we call One Barclays, where our people work together collaboratively to ensure that we deliver the best services to our customers and to our clients.</p>
          <p>Given the difficult economic environment, we're pleased that we're able to grow income, underlying profit and market share in so many of our businesses.</p>
          <p>In U.K. Retail and Business Banking, net operating income grew 11%, adjusted profit was up 60% and our customers grew 700,000, as we continued to grow market share across all of our product offerings, current accounts, savings, mortgages, loans, and general insurance. We were named Best Current Account Provider in the Consumer Moneyfacts Awards and we were ranked as the Best Mortgage Lender for the second year running.</p>
          <p>In our Cards business, net income was up 21% and adjusted profits were up 53% to a record &#xA3;1.2 billion. We won 3.4 million new accounts organically, 5 million if we include acquisitions. The Corporate business is a priority, it grew 25%.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we continue to drive innovation for our customers and our clients. Our mobile and contactless payments technology won several awards for innovation and we continue to deploy it across Barclays.</p>
          <p>Barclays is now responsible for over 90% of the contactless merchant terminals in the U.K. We launched the first U.K. mobile phone payment scheme in 2011 and we have widened access to banking through mobile phones in Africa, which include tap-and-go and cash send payments.</p>
          <p>In our African business, net income grew 11% in local currencies. This translated into strong profit growth of 26% in sterling, despite adverse currency movements. We now have a single management team driving our One Africa strategy and that is clear, to become the leading international player in the third fastest growing region in the world.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, this is the third consecutive year of double-digit income growth. Profits grew 27% while we continued to invest. We're now in year three of a five-year program, which will position this business in the top tier of its industry and is a much more meaningful contributor to Barclays' results.</p>
          <p>Income and profits were down in Investment Banking in a tough market but we continue to have real momentum. This is clearly evident in those areas where we have been investing. We ranked number three in U.K. mergers and acquisitions with a 20% market share. And we advised on nine of the top 20 global M&amp;A transactions.</p>
          <p>Our Equities business was involved in each of the top five IPOs globally as well as the top IPOs in Japan and in India. And in 2011, we won 17 new corporate broking mandates in the U.K., bringing our total to 25. This is a significant achievement for s business that started in 2010.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we remain number one in global fixed income, one of our traditional strengths. We have a market share in global fixed income of 11%. Remember, fixed income is a client-driven business serving pensions funds and insurance funds; in other words, managers that help people save for their retirement.</p>
          <p>Barclays Capital was also awarded the IFR Bank of the Year last month, and in so doing, was recognized for growing market share across the board and becoming an increasingly go-to-Investment Bank. In a world where the industry is polarizing, these results are indicative of our relative strength and ability to maintain our position as a top tier player. As regulation results in further polarization, we believe we will continue to gain market share as weaker players withdraw from the market.</p>
          <p>I want to turn now to citizenship. You've heard me say that banks need to become better citizens. Our ability to do this is critical to creating long-term value for shareholders. This is not about philanthropy. It's about delivering real commercial benefits in a way that also creates value for society. For me, becoming a better citizen means three things. It's about how we behave especially with our customers and clients. It's also about what we do, helping those customers and clients create jobs and drive the real economy, and it's about how we contribute to the communities we serve in so many other ways.</p>
          <p>Let me talk first about how we behave. We recognize that we have to win back trust from the public and from our customers, and an important step in that process is improving standards of service. One way we track this is by monitoring the number of complaints we receive. Our U.K. banking complaints fell 30% year-on-year. The changes we've made were also recognized by the U.K. consumer group, Which? Which? gave us their Positive Change Award for 2011. We know we have a lot more to do but we have the right strategy and we know we're moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>How we behave also includes how we manage difficult issues such as compensation. In compensation, we have to balance our obligation to recruit and retain the very best people we can in order to remain competitive and to drive results. We need to balance that with the need to be responsive to our shareholders and sensitive to public opinion. The 25% reduction in performance-related pay at Barclays was much greater than the 2% fall in profit. We placed a cap on cash bonuses of &#xA3;65,000 and more pay is now deferred and paid in shares so that employees are even better aligned with shareholders. This represents a significant change, not just in structure, but in quantum and as you'd expect in a where both income and profits were adversely impacted by the economic environment.</p>
          <p>I know that tracking conversation has become &#x2013; excuse me, I know that tracking compensation has become more difficult with deferred payments because there's a difference of timing between when an award is made and when it appears in the cost line. So, we are giving more information today to make it easier to follow the component parts of performance-related pay.</p>
          <p>As you would expect, we give a great deal of thought each year to getting the balance right between being responsible and remaining competitive. That's exactly what our shareholders expect of us.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the real economy. Supporting customers and clients has been one of the most important priorities for our senior management team in a challenging environment. We exceeded our targets under Project Merlin by 13%. We did this by lending &#xA3;44 billion to U.K. businesses, including &#xA3;15 billion to small and medium-size businesses.</p>
          <p>We didn't just wait for customers to come to us. We ran over 800 seminars and lending clinics around the U.K. in order to help businesses find the funding that they need. Lending clinics help attendees to create a business case, to think about the best way to use a loan and to decide how to manage repayments.</p>
          <p>We've also empowered relationship managers to make a lot of local lending decisions immediately. These kinds of initiatives resulted in us supporting the startup of over 100,000 new businesses in the U.K. last year. We approved a new loan to a small business every four minutes. Our U.K. Retail Bank helped almost 10,000 customers buy their first home and gave over 100,000 new mortgages during the year. Let me be clear, lending is what we do. So going forward, we will continue to do everything we can to support customers and clients and expect that lending will continue to grow as a result. We intend to remain leaders in this space.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking also plays a part. Investment Banking helped clients raise over $1 trillion of financing through the capital markets. Of this, almost $400 billion was for governments in the public sector. Helping the public sector to raise finance is another way in which we support the real economy. Barclays also made a contribution by hiring 1,500 graduates in 2011, 24% more than the previous year. And we have just announced a new scheme to create 1,000 apprenticeships in branches throughout the U.K. in order to help tackle youth unemployment. We believe giving young people their first job opportunity is one of the most effective ways we can contribute to economic growth. We'll talk about this scheme in more detail at a Citizenship Day later in the first half.</p>
          <p>We know we have a responsibility to help generate economic growth and create jobs. And I hope you can see from these examples that we are fully committed to playing our part. As I look back over 2011, while we made good progress in a number of fronts and our results are good in relative terms, we recognize that in order to achieve our return target, we need to improve profitability substantially going forward. And we are determined to do that. We will use all the means within our control to continue to drive the business.</p>
          <p>Turning to the external environment, I think it's fair to say, that we feel a bit more sanguine about the outlook than others. In the U.S., we're seeing positive signs of economic recovery; importantly U.S. Treasury funding is cheaper now than ever before.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets continue to grow at a faster pace than developed economies, while in Europe there's been a real slowdown on economic growth, which we believe will be short and shallow rather than deep and prolonged.</p>
          <p>Of course, we recognize that we're still operating in an environment with significant event risk from both a political and macroeconomic perspective. We also face ongoing regulatory challenge, and as you would expect, we're engaged with regulators to ensure implementation that balances, making the system safer and sounder with a need for economic growth and job creation.</p>
          <p>We have more clarity about the impact of Basel 3 and the Independent Commission on Banking than a year ago. And we will continue to adapt the business in order to adhere to the new rules. In the meantime, we believe that we have the right model. We know we have the right strategy and we have a very strong management team, a team that is wholly focused on execution in order to deliver sustainable returns over time for shareholders.</p>
          <p>When we are at our best, we serve the real economy by doing our best for all of our stakeholders, for our customers and clients, for the communities in which we live and work, for our people and our shareholders, to be anything less than our best is letting all of those people down. And that's why we aspire for Barclays to be one of the best organized, best managed and most productive private sector banks in the world.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll start with that. A very strong cost management in the fourth quarter, I think, in the face of difficult revenue conditions in Barclays Capital. Even so, if you take the second half, the cost ratio for the second half of the year is still running above 80% and obviously the return on equity consistent with that is not as good as the full year sort of 10%. So, what I'd really like to get is some thoughts on the outlook for revenue in Barclays Capital going forward and what plan B might be if you don't see any meaningful recovery from what is obviously a very soft second half of 2011? And my second question would be on Basel 3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first, we'll come back on Basel 3. Let me kind of give some context in my mind and then pass on to Rich and Jerry. I think you would have been surprised given some of the comments you've made recently in your research about the tough environment. The second half is about as tough as it gets and I think a 10.4% return on equity shows how well this business is being managed and also shows how it is in a premier position in terms of market share and client flows. So we think a 10%-plus return in that environment is actually a pretty positive sign, but your question was more on how do Rich and Jerry feel going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tom. I think that if I take you back to the Investor Day we had last June, we talked about a revenue profile of somewhere between &#xA3;12 billion and &#xA3;14 billion as being what we believed is a rational view of what our franchise can deliver given a more normal environment. That's not talking about a big robust environment taking us back to 2009. In fact, it looks a little bit more like the first half of 2011 or the second half 2010.</p>
          <p>I think in the first half of 2011, as an example, we printed &#xA3;6 billion of revenue. So there's no doubt that the second half of the year was difficult. But we look at that as more of an anomaly, and think that &#xA3;12 billion to &#xA3;14 billion allows us to deliver 15% plus returns over time to the shareholder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would just add, Tom. On the kind of the, well, what if the market doesn't recover &#x2013; I mean, we have clearly seen a return to a more normalized conditions, although event risks are still clearly there. And as Rich says, we're certainly not planning a very &#x2013; for a buoyant environment.</p>
          <p>I think the key is not about having a plan B, the key is actually about kind of being consistently focused on and disciplined on cost and capital management and that's what allowed us I think to outperform. And it's something that you've heard from us before, the ability to outperform in challenging markets, the fact that we have scale presence in all of the kind of the key markets, businesses, the balance of the U.S. and of our European franchises with strong and growing presence in Asia is the key to kind of continue out-performance. And we won't lose that focus on discipline regardless of what's happening in the underlying market.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the second question was, sort of on slide 19, the Basel 3 slide, and it's a similar question, I think, I asked you at the Strategy Day, the &#x2013; the mitigation of the risk-weighted assets. Can you give us an update on your thoughts on what impact that might have on revenue or the P&amp;L in general actually putting those initiatives through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, do you want to start and Rich and Jerry want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working pretty hard on it and part of the reason we wanted to give you an update was to show you where our thinking is going. It has to be said though that when you take the fact that the rules are still being written, there is still significant amount of variability in the results of the application of the rules.</p>
          <p>It's pretty hard to land to a spot example or a spot answer. What does give me comfort though, if I think of the Basel 2.5 experience we had, when we first gave you some numbers, I think the impact in RWAs was about &#xA3;70 billion.</p>
          <p>And when we finally implemented, that was about &#xA3;30 billion and that was through a whole series of actions including pricing, modeling, waivers from regulators, and a whole range of things &#x2013; sale of assets, and I think we're in the middle of doing the same piece, the same activity. The sale of the assets, sort of assets that have high risk-weighted asset &#x2013; components actually are generating relatively small amounts of income. So we think that it is possible to work down without having a massive loss of income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit tricky, Tom, when we don't have all the final rules, which is why I mentioned, we will come back in the fall when some of it is more clear and do it again, not because we want to kick it off, but because I think we'll know a little bit more. But I would go back to what Chris said. We have always said, Rich and Jerry and Chris and myself, that the starting position is 15% returns over time in the Investment Bank. Frankly, I know our shareholders have said it if we can return 10% in environments like this, they know we'll be returning 15% in more normalized environments.</p>
          <p>I hope you take some confidence on how well we've managed the capital and the RWAs day-to-day because a lot of this is kind of day-to-day combat. But the big picture of that success is because we're seeing customer flows at the leading end of the market. And I think when you have those client flows, even in slower markets, it keeps the returns at these kinds of levels.</p>
          <p>Now, I didn't say it when I started but one question each. Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Manus Costello from Autonomous. I have a question, for Chris, I think, on the net interest income outlook, please. Chris, I think that you changed the wording slightly around the impact of the structural hedge to highlight that it will decline year over year. I wonder if you could just give us a bit more color, would you expect the impact of the product hedge to be bigger, a bigger delta in 2012 on 2011, than 2011 on 2010?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the equity structural hedge where you saw an &#xA3;824 million impact in 2011, how much of that was capital gain and would any of that be repeated because there's clearly some headwind on LII going into this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is. And that's why we've changed the wording to reflect that. I think if I look at it and we can go through with you, the different components, but when I look at the impact of hedging on what I call the banking businesses and that's &#x2013; by that, I take the structural hedge move, the equity hedge move, and the gains on sales of hedging instrument sales. All of that has a positive impact of about &#xA3;100 million year-on-year. So, therefore, what we've been able to do is manage a declining contribution from the hedges, but that won't go on forever, and I'll leave it to you to work out what is the level of decline but we are definitely seeing some headwinds.</p>
          <p>My final comment will be again when I look at the net interest margin across again the banking businesses, it's flat year-on-year. And I think that's a pretty good achievement and a pretty good management of margin in a difficult environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to be clear on the equity structural hedge, of that &#xA3;824 million, how much related to capital gains and can you foresee similar actions happening in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the net year-on-year impact of gains on sales across the Group is about &#xA3;500 million. We would expect that to be &#x2013; there's always going to be an element of it &#x2013; there's always going to be an element of it and therefore we would expect there to be some reduction but not a complete reduction. That gives you the sort of flavor of the capital gain.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Hi. It's Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital. I just wanted to ask you about the LTRO and your thoughts in terms of pros and cons of using the LTRO when it comes about the end of the month?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm happy to talk in general about the impact it's had on the market, which I think is positive. I think we've had a policy of not disclosing our activity and things like this over time, but what has been the impact on the market? I think it was very positive and I think in many ways, the actions of Governor Draghi were very positive for a market that was very skittish on funding. So that was a &#x2013; it was a real relief to the market. But I think it had with it aspects of quantitative easing, aspects of buying the periphery, aspects of confidence in the banking. And I think the fact that they're coming back to the markets in February with unlimited three-year 1% funding is very positive in Europe and so it's &#x2013; I think it's part of the reason that we've seen investors confident to come back into the markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think there's any stigma attached to strong banks like yourselves using it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think a number of people have talked about this, and I think it's kind of been a good debate, but I think any bank that doesn't worry about issues of stigma given what we've been through over the last three or four years &#x2013; of course, we have to think about brand and reputation. In our case, being rock solid in funding, capital and liquidity is our number one priority, and you could imagine that was a big part of our thinking. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Michael Helsby from Merrill Lynch. I see on the risk-weighted asset reduction in the fourth quarter that about &#xA3;37 billion of it was due to FX and just lower market risk/VAR counterparty risk. On that basis, given that activity levels have bounced back a bit in Q1, should we expect the risk-weighted assets to jump again in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>And I guess if you could &#x2013; therefore, should we expect the previous RWA guidance that you've given for Basel 3 to still hold in terms of the absolute levels?</p>
          <p>And just attached to that, I was wondering, based on the full-year balance sheet that you just reported if you could give us any idea of what you see, Chris, as the fully phased in impact of the deductions from 2014 to 2018? And if you let me, I'd love to ask Antony a question on credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try to start. You're absolutely right. There was a reduction at the end of the year. My numbers which are year-on-year show a reduction of about &#xA3;30 billion business adjustments, and about &#xA3;10 billion FX. If I look at the &#xA3;30 billion, of course, some of that will spring back as volumes increase. We're absolutely delighted when they do that because we make a better return and net-net we're better off.</p>
          <p>It's difficult to say how much of it springs back in which sector. What I would say is that of that &#xA3;30 billion, about &#xA3;10 billion is a permanent reduction in underlying assets, particularly some of the credit market exposures. And that, we won't see come back, that is a permanent saving.</p>
          <p>Mike, I'm going to duck at this stage on the sort of fully laded Basel 3 numbers. We know you're interested in them. We've got a lot of work to do and we'll come back to you in the fall. But I do reiterate my previous comments that if I look at the performance in terms of our Basel 2.5, I'm pretty confident about the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the only other thing I would add, Mike, is that as &#x2013; yes, generally speaking, activity picks up, you would &#x2013; as a general statement to say that RWAs would follow. But the other thing you have to consider is that the pace of our ability to sell down legacy assets and manage it the balance sheet also slowed down in the &#x2013; in Q4 as a result of what was going on in the market. And we would expect to see that, again, pick up back to levels that we saw earlier in the year, so that's kind of an offset as well. You have better conditions to be able to continue to manage down your exposures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mike, truth be told, I said just one question, but I also had a side bet with Antony before we start it. I said that the results in Barclaycard are so strong that you're going to get more questions than Rich and Jerry. And since we have that side bet, I'll allow the question for Antony. In fact, you can have two more for Antony if you'd like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. How about three? Yeah, no &#x2013; I guess, I was just looking at the credit metrics at the back and it looks like from certainly, from the half year, you've continued to see an improvement in certainly 30-day arrears and everything that looks like on a forward-looking basis, things continue to improve. So, I was just wondering, given people are still quite concerned about the outlook for the economy, I was wondering if you could like to draw out some of the trends there and give us maybe, Robert, you could help and give us a more of a forward-looking view from how you see 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, why don't I talk about the RBB businesses and then Robert can talk more generally. The first thing to note is that as we've discussed in the past, our businesses are generally quite conservatively positioned from a credit point of view. So, our mortgage book is relatively low LTV, our credit card portfolios are at the higher end, the prime, super prime space. And so, we are well-protected from any potential downturn. That would be the first point.</p>
          <p>The second point would be as we talked about at the half year, what we've seen is that the rate of improvement has been slowing over time from the sort of 2008, 2009 position. But really, if we look at the forward flows across any of the businesses, we're not seeing marked deterioration at all. We're seeing broad stability. And our view is that that will largely continue through this year. Now, the exception to that will be if we saw a major downturn in the U.K. economy or a major downturn in the Eurozone.</p>
          <p>But again, in that circumstance, I would refer back to my first point, which is because of the relative conservative nature of our books, we'll be able to manage through that volatility. And the second thing is as we demonstrated in the sort of 2006, 2007 downturn in the Cards business and in 2008, 2009 downturn across the piece, we are skilled at managing our collections and so on through these difficult times when they come.</p>
          <p>So, I'd say in summary, for the Retail and Business Banking franchises, we're cautiously optimistic for this year. I wouldn't expect to see very dramatic improvements, but I don't expect to see a dramatic deterioration either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add, thank you. There's a lot of detail we could get into, but won't get into that. I'll try and just do the big picture, but as a point of context, which is certainly true for the U.K. and for our Retail businesses also in Europe and the U.S. and other areas, a couple of factors just to mention very quickly.</p>
          <p>Households are being very careful about their spending and they are reducing household debt and that can been seen in a lot of statistics. Now, that has a couple of effects. One effect, of course, is that the economy is slow. The other effect is that debt performance is better and our credit portfolios can improve and have improved and that's really a big factor that has driven it.</p>
          <p>Unemployment, of course, is always the most difficult factor for a credit portfolio and unemployment has stayed high, particularly youth unemployment. But, of course, not many young people have mortgages with us or anyone and not many young people have large loans from us. Antony runs a very client-driven and client-focused business. And I think the target criteria we've been able to apply for our loan books over the last several years have really driven the improvement in credit performance has been very steady.</p>
          <p>So, if you look forward, it's always best to sort of look at what happened last year to understand what'll happen next year. And we had a 33% reduction in credit impairment in 2011 year-on-year, and that was very broad across virtually all of our retail books and all of our wholesale books internationally with a couple of exceptions.</p>
          <p>And when we look at what it means for next year, I think we can see &#x2013; for this year I should say, I think we can see some further improvement in some books because of the circumstances that are playing back and forth. And I think probably most of our books will be steady performers rather than seeing a significant increase like we have seen for the past few years.</p>
          <p>One thing to note, for example, is that in the Investment Bank, our loan loss rate was only 8 basis points last year and our models would tell us that we shouldn't expect that to reoccur but we don't expect it to jump up significantly. So, there will be different parts moving back and forth.</p>
          <p>If you look at the analyst consensus for us for impairment for next year, it's about the same as last year. So, in other words, about &#xA3;3.8 billion, and I think that's a reasonable place in a tight range and wouldn't want to steer anybody away from that. And, of course, if we do see things changing, we'll update you for the half year.</p>

We always have the Absa results the same day. So, keep in mind, &#xA3;1 billion in earnings from Africa, almost 20% of the Group, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, a real important part of the earnings.

          <p>Hi, it's Ed Firth here from Macquarie. Just a couple of points of clarification, actually. I mean, the first one is just in terms of your answer to the last question. If I look at U.K. Retail, it looks like in Q4, the performance was well down on Q3, is that just a seasonal issue, is that just a seasonal issue &#x2013; was there some sort of seasonal variation there rather than, I think, income was down and provisions were up?</p>

          <p>I wouldn't read too much into that. The trends on impairment are as we've said and &#x2013; on the income side. I would go back to the discussion that we've had since the mid part of 2010 where we believed at that point that the economic environment where we did business was going to be quite challenging. We did not expect to deliver very significant income growth. We were orientating the business towards that, so focusing on costs and sadly, we proved to be right about the economic environment but the income performance that you've seen in the Retail Bank, I think last year was good in the circumstances, very good actually. And I think we feel pretty confident that that's about where we are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And sorry, just my principal question, on note 15 on page 75, you've given us a lot of new disclosure about pension liabilities. And I think you disclosed the &#xA3;5 billion deficit at September 2010, I think that's the first time you've disclosed that. You've also given sort of quite detailed guidance about contributions you're going to make right up to 2021. I guess, my question is, do any of these have P&amp;L impacts? You're talking about making additional &#xA3;500 million next year and then I think &#xA3;650 million from 2017. But I guess my question is, is there an P&amp;L impact to that? And what is the rationale for starting your contributions in 2017, not somewhat sooner? And I guess my last point is...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll grab the first two bits anyway. The result &#x2013; this is the result of the formal triennial valuation that you worked through, and as we saw and as you quite rightly point out, there was a deficit on the pension fund valuation.</p>
          <p>We then go into a process of agreeing a repayment schedule with the trustees, which we have done, and that here comprises some quite significant upfront payments this year and last year to work the deficit down, then a gap and then some further committed payments in 2017 and onwards.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, what happens is you do the next valuation before the 2017 payments ever get made. So, to a certain extent, the ones that I really look at are the ones that are committed short term, and that's what you've done. So, you see the valuation of the scheme at 31 December after the payments is actually in asset rather than deficit. So, of course, the trustees are fine.</p>
          <p>The funding bears little resemblance to the profit and loss account charge, which as you know is only to do with service cost and the service elements of the people who get pension benefits. So, this is important because it has an impact on capital, but is less important in terms of P&amp;L, but I hope that helps just set out some of what's happened.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can I ask questions? Just two. One is very short. On fixed income, I'm just trying to compare you with your peer group and it looks to me like you've been somewhat weaker than some of the others. And I just wondered if you could talk about where you think you've outperformed and underperformed? And secondly, on this issue of pensions, you used to adjust the pensions in Basel 3 and now you don't, yet I read that there's a &#xA3;1.7 billion adjustment to equity happening. So, I'm trying to understand why that's not about 30 basis points? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to have to admit, the deduction from capital is because of the contributions we're making and that's reflected there, you can see it. Beyond that, I think there's no further adjustments because you'd have to take the deficit reduction program for five years into capital and what we've actually done is taken three years, which we have then a two-year gap. So, we have taken into account the contributions we make up until 2013. And that's what you see in the capital calculation.</p>

          <p>On fixed income, actually, we wouldn't see underperformance. On the contrary, we're actually very pleased with how the businesses have performed relative to competitors. What we can say is that within the fixed set of businesses, the &#x2013; our rates, credit and commodities businesses had a more challenging year than they did in 2010 and that was somewhat offset by a very strong performance in foreign exchange, which saw a significant increase in market share and given the volatility in the market, actually had an outstanding year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter Toeman from HSBC. I can appreciate that you have a positive view about BarCap's future returns, but when I look at the numbers, if one assumed that that sort of quarterly revenues got back to &#xA3;3 billion and you apply the 65% cost income ratio target, you then end up with sort of post-tax profits of about &#xA3;3 billion.</p>
          <p>And when you last updated us on the Basel 3 consequences on BarCap, you spoke about &#xA3;270 billion of RWAs. So, it seems to me that on these numbers, BarCap would be a 10% or 11% return business and that's before factoring in, let's say, the higher cost of unsecured funding which could be a consequence of the ring fence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if there's much to add. We've given you a pretty clear guidance on we've managed Basel 2.5 and the returns in this environment on a 15% outlook going forward. Maybe we just agree to disagree.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going into fourth quarter of flexibility around cost and being to deliver. So, using a 65% &#x2013; we saw a range of 60% to 65% depending where we fell in that revenue spectrum, I think we've demonstrated a capability to be pretty nimble around driving returns.</p>
          <p>So, again, in that range of &#xA3;12 billion to &#xA3;14 billion, we remain pretty confident given the efficiency we've shown, the sureness of foot, the nimbleness, our ability to reduce RWAs that we can get to the returns we've committed to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Happy to spend time off &#x2013; it's tough to follow when you do some kind of numbers on the back of an envelope and calibrate them all. So, happy to take it offline, but we feel really confident. And I think as Rich said, it's &#x2013; our business has increased market share in almost every area. It's 11% market share in fixed income. Fixed income might be a tough environment which it was to be number one with customers and clients with 11% market share when you know the business will come back.</p>
          <p>And I think the progress that we're making in the Advisory business and in the Equity business, having --- being on the lead of Facebook, being on the lead with Xstrata. These are big, important transactions, where we're newly placed with the acquisition of Lehman Brothers' business and then the build-out in Europe and Asia. We would have love as many people would have &#x2013; for better market conditions last year with the pipeline we have, but that will come &#x2013; but again, happy to take it offline.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, could I invite you, absent volatility or unexpected events, to give us some kind of quantification of the kind of progress you'd expect given the moves that you are &#x2013; that are within your control that you are planning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I made clear last year, that we would expect 13% in 2013 so what happened since last year? We've had some things that are outside of our control and I kind of listed of them, so let's go through. A bank levy was not in the 13% numbers, that's easy to adjust for. We're running our core equity at 11%, we're expecting 10%. We think that comes back; that's one &#x2013; probably 1.4%, 1.5%. It's going to be a zero interest rate environment in terms of flows, a bit longer than maybe we expected.</p>
          <p>And it's possible we moved back from the kind of slowdown that fear of European contagion caused. What's in our control to be perfectly frank? Most of that operated better than we had expected. We're going to hit &#xA3;2 billion in cost savings, not &#xA3;1 billion. Barclaycard for the first time, over &#xA3;1 billion in earnings. Africa for the first time over &#xA3;1 billion pounds in earnings. We now have four businesses at that level.</p>
          <p>A lot more work to do to fix Europe and Antony and I are on top of that. But if it were not for those, we would not be backing off 13% in 2013. So, another way to say it is if we had a faster normalization of those things, we'd be sticking with 2013. So, don't treat this as anything other than we are very committed to both the 13% as the right target but also very achievable, but we need to be honest, some of the external environmental factors out of our control could affect the timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say your &#x2013; the return at the moment is probably somewhere around the 7% level or something of that sort of order, do you expect you can improve the ROE 1% a year, 2% a year? I'm trying to get some.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving to the second area, it was really on the information you've given on the hedges, could you comment on what the unrealized gain is on the product hedges at this point and how it's moved over the last 12 months, and obviously as interest rates and long yields have come down, it's going to be more difficult to replace that with the same kind of duration. Would you consider going out on the level of duration to improve or sustain the income or would you consider going out too on the risk curve in terms of the assets you hold in that portfolio to sustain the yield?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suspect I know Chris's answer, but I'll give him an option, which is we've given a lot of transparency around this. We probably said as much as we can. You touched the risk thing. Whether it's the hedge or anything else, the one thing we're not going to do is increase our risk to hit 13% returns. It's our underlying core businesses. And we're going to continue to drive and that's why it's important for us to say, if the macroeconomic environment &#x2013; if the regulatory capital environment is different than we thought, what we're not going to do is do something silly. We're not going increase risk in order to get to 13%. It's going to be our core underlying businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if there's anything I would add to it is these are hedges, so therefore, we don't have complete freedom in moving the duration off that. It has to bear some resemblance to the underlying assets. But we have extended them, as you know, which realized some quite significant profits and if the opportunity remains or appears within the hedging requirements, you should expect us to do more.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Quickly, Bob, just looking for some clarity on the cost target, actually the &#xA3;2 billion by the end of 2013, I think you said that is, if I'm reading this correctly is all in the non-performance area which was a &#xA3;592 million reduction in 2011. I'm just trying to sort of really get a measure of what is the &#x2013; what is the starting point now going forward as to how we would sort of look at the cost reduction over 2012 and 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of calibrating, Chris, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me have a go. The way I look at it is we made a saving and I'm just talking gross numbers here before restructuring costs. We made a saving in non-performance costs in 2011 of about around some &#xA3;600 million. If you annualize that, that's about &#xA3;1.2 billion. So that is my starting place for 2012. And what I'm expecting is there to be about a &#xA3;400 million increase in 2012 and another &#xA3;400 million increase in 2013 getting to that &#xA3;2 billion.</p>
          <p>The start place is our plans, which our board agreed medium-term plans, which have in there costs of somewhere between non-performance costs, &#xA3;15.5 billion and &#xA3;17 billion, that sort of number over &#x2013; per year, over a three-year period. So that gives you the starting place and the projection I see of gross savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think importantly that the work we did last year gave us such confidence that we can become more efficient in the way that we operate. That it was &#x2013; it was a quite comfortable leap if I can say it that way from &#xA3;1 billion to &#xA3;2 billion because we could see it developing as we worked through it.</p>
          <p>Let's go right here and then right next door. You guys decide the order.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey. So, I had just a couple of questions, the first one was on Africa. I mean it looked like a pretty decent result despite the rand. Are we looking like this business could generate &#xA3;1 billion of PBT going forward? And maybe, I don't know if Maria is on the phone, but just to comment about loan growth because it looked like it was negative, even excluding the rand impact in the year.</p>
          <p>And the second one was just on the fight for retail deposits. Some of your competitors are indicating that competition really is stepping up there. Is that something that you're seeing and will that be one of the crosswinds in your RBB margin as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that a general deposit question or Africa?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that's the, well, more of a U.K. deposit question issue?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry. We'll start with Maria. Let me just &#x2013; because we can be confusing. You saw &#xA3;900-odd million in PBT in for RBB Africa. We're over &#xA3;1 billion if you look at all Africa including what's happening in Wealth, what's happening in BarCap. So that's why I say two different numbers. I think you're saying, can RBB Africa be over &#xA3;1 billion? Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maria, did you &#x2013; were you able to connect? I hope.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bob. I'm on the line. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perfectly. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. In total actually, PBT is closer to &#xA3;1.3 billion, so &#xA3;908 million of that is in RBB, but if you add back Cards which is about &#xA3;233 million, which has seen strong growth for the last year, it's also been a very big contributor to the numbers. I think going forward we do see good strong opportunity for growth across the business, across RBB, across Card and in fact, across Corporate.</p>
          <p>So, I think we are looking for good growth on the income side. We've also seen good progress on the cost side. So, for last year, we saw costs down 1% in the business, both across the entire spectrum so for the whole of Africa including Absa. And we've seen strong improvements in impairments. So impairments are down 17% for the region. So, I think this is a good story going forward as well. We expect to see contribution to PBT strong in the year ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things we're finding so exciting about this is the more time you spend in Africa, you realize the incredible connection between what's going on in Africa, with China and India directly. And it's not as we traditionally thought going through New York and going through London. It's really a direct trade relationship.</p>
          <p>And it gives us a real competitive advantage. Even here in the U.K., as John Winter would tell you that the U.K. businesses are increasingly having trade relationships not just with Europe but also with Africa. So it's &#x2013; we think it's pretty exciting. It's one of the fastest growing regions in the world from a GNP point of view as, well which is &#x2013; it's nice to have that position in an area with above developed economy growth. Antony, on the deposit question? Thank you, Maria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Chris, on deposits, of course, it's quite competitive out there in the marketplace as people seek funding and seek funding relative to their other choices in terms of cost. But actually as you'll see in our numbers, our numbers of savings accounts increased significantly and our overall deposits increased 3%, which I think is a fantastic performance in a very challenging market.</p>
          <p>And the way we've been able to do that is firstly because we focus on the customer and the customer relationship. And secondarily because we've been able to launch innovative project &#x2013; products like our flexible bond where our customers can take a proportion of their money out of the bond even before it expires. So this is about how we compete day in and day out on the High Street, the quality of our people, the quality of our products, the quality of our brand.</p>
          <p>So, while we think the market will be quite challenging, we think we'll be able to deliver a very strong performance in the market going forward into 2012.</p>

          <p>Hi. Chintan Joshi from Nomura. First question would be on just digging into the credit trends in the peripheral Eurozone countries, if you could elaborate on how we should be thinking about your corporate exposure, particularly in Portugal and Spain.</p>
          <p>And second question is on equity.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you. Looking at the peripheral countries, let's focus on Western Europe, on the Retail side, we've seen good performance there, a slight increase in early and late cycle delinquency in the mortgage books of Spain and Italy, which I wouldn't call peripheral, but let's just talk about them as they're part of Western Europe. And &#x2013; but those are increases from very low levels. We have very conservative LTVs there in the range of 40% to 60% across those two countries and the performance there is good and the other Retail performance has been improving.</p>
          <p>On the Corporate side, we saw our higher level of impairment on the Corporate side back in the first half of 2010. And the impairment charge for Corporate exposure in Spain has been declining every half and declined again through 2011. And we're not worried about a reversal of that this year.</p>
          <p>You'll have seen some significant impairment charges for Spanish corporate being taken around the industry in other banks. We think we were recognizing those problems very early. We got something like &#x2013; I'd say 58% coverage ratio of our non-performing loans in Corporate exposure in Spain. And we don't think we have got any big moves ahead of us there.</p>
          <p>The one more difficult market there right now on the Retail and small business side is in Portugal where the economy remains very weak. And we saw some increase in Retail and Wholesale impairment in Portugal and we'll see probably another increase this year. It's a small part of our overall book for Western Europe where the trend remains positive.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks, it's Ian Gordon from Investec. Just one question from me, please. A follow-on from Peter's. On ICB, you referenced in your remarks that there's improving clarity. Can you share any update on your remarks to the Parliamentary Select Committee in December on the quantum of impact, the time scale of impact and do you share the views of one of your peers that there will be an enduring negative impact on achievable ROE in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There hasn't been anything really new since the Treasury Select to your point. I guess the bill goes before Parliament or is prepared for Parliament this summer. That will be next new thing. For us, preparing for this and all the things we're doing around resolution and recovery are somewhat similar. So, we think of it as, how do we best prepare ourselves, Barclays, for the new world where resolution and recovery is important. But there's nothing specifically new. And there's not a lot to add to the fact that this would not have been our first choice. It does add costs to banking in the U.K. But the decision is made and we're getting on with it. Yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Andrew Coombs from Citigroup. Just two questions, one on Absa and one on Barclays Capital, please. Firstly on Absa, it was mentioned that volumes have been a little bit weak. I think the market share with Intact with new mortgage issuances has been down. And my understanding is that that's due to a change in the mortgage distribution strategy that has now been reversed. So, just a thought perhaps on when volumes pick up in terms of Absa mortgage lending there.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is with regards to the outlook statement on page seven of the report. You talk about the start of the year in January being in line or consistent with 2011 in RBB and Corporate. Whereas for Barclays Capital, you talk about an encouraging start to the year, but you don't say it's in line with 2011 where you're making a commentary on those lines. So, does that mean we should think about a meaningful uplift in Q4 but perhaps lower than Q1 of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any idea how careful we are with every word that's in that? There's a lexicon I think that gives you exactly that. Why don't we go to Maria first to answer the question on mortgages in Absa and then to Rich and Jerry on how it's going in BarCap to start the year. Maria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. Yes, we did pursue for most of last year a strategy where we used our own internal channels for mortgages and that was really very much a strategy that was focused on serving our own customers, keeping costs down, utilizing our own distribution points. I think that that's worked and it did &#x2013; it did achieve what we wanted to achieve. We've improved the quality of our book significantly.</p>
          <p>What we have, though, recognized is the fact that a lot of our customers' feedback was that they also wanted to be able to use other channels, including mortgage originators. So, we've now taken the decision to use mortgage originators. Again, we've renegotiated fees with mortgage originators and what we have not done, however, is change our credit policy. So, we're using mortgage originators, we're using for our own customers. We have started to see volumes increase again in the last quarter of last year. And so, I think it's a strategy that we're going to be pursuing but we're not opening it up significantly outside of our very large customer base.</p>
          <p>I think it's important &#x2013; it's worth noting that Absa remains the largest bank from a customer point of view in South Africa. We've got 11.6 million customers on the Retail side and we've grown our customer base by 3% to 12.1 million customers last year. So, that's the perspective that we've taken on it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On Barclays Capital &#x2013; Bob wasn't joking. We do look at these words very carefully and I think that we wouldn't be saying encouraging if it certainly wasn't better than the fourth quarter. I don't think anything that we could say about the fourth quarter would have the word encouraging in it. Certainly, it's been a big start to the year for us. We're ahead of where we were last year at this time. But six weeks don't make a year and we're cautiously optimistic. We talked about the year, hopefully, being more like the first half of 2011, second half of 2010 rather than the second half of last year.</p>

          <p>Thanks, I've got a question for Tom actually and then I just want to pull out on bonuses, because I think that is very topical. Tom, Wealth clearly going okay, but the revenue trends have been pretty flat quarter-on-quarter throughout the year. There's a lot of change going on in the Wealth Management industry at the moment. I was wondering if you could just comment on what you think you can do in the next couple of years. And then just on BarCap comp. The pay numbers that you've disclosed actually probably over inflate what you've actually achieved, because I noticed that your current year bonus is down 68%, which is quite phenomenal really. So, I guess the question is, could you give me a equivalent for it was in the third quarter? I'm just trying to gauge what the clawback was in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really do things like that. So, the bonus discussions are at the end of the year. Trying to compare quarter-over-quarter just would do no good. So, we'll go over that one. But it's good to wrap up with Tom, making some comments on Wealth and then I'll make a few comments before we cut it.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. It's pretty simple. We have laid out a strategy that is a five-year strategy. We're two years into it. We are &#x2013; we're exactly where we should be after two years in terms of financials and also in terms of delivery. So, we have a plan here, which we think is executable regardless of what happens in the environment. There's lots to play for here and we feel quite comfortable with where we are two years into the game.</p>

          <p>Thank you for coming. Just a couple of comments. We're really, really serious about &#x2013; although that was a tough environment in 2011, what made us so pleased is when you look at our &#x2013; the businesses, every one of our businesses is performing really well in an environment and in increasing its business and increasing its market share. Five of our seven businesses increased their income in that kind of an environment. We're also really serious about the real economy and doing everything we can to make sure that we're focused, both on how we behave and what we do and in terms of what we do, the impact we can make through our lending and through our Capital Markets businesses and helping the real economy get going and what we can do with graduate programs and apprenticeships to help get people back to work.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we're really, really serious about 13%. We're not wavering a bit on 13%. There are some environmental issues that will affect the timing, but they won't affect 13%. We're very convinced on it. Thank you very, very much for coming. We look forward to hanging out with you for a few minutes before we all have to go off. Thanks.</p>
