          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our Q3 results conference call and thanks for joining us. As you all know the financial crisis turned into an economic crisis. And that has created substantial uncertainties among market participants. That has also put a number of question marks over future economic developments. The resulting drop in the auto markets intensified as the third quarter progressed and it did so in a way we've never experienced before.</p>
          <p>We saw substantial declines in major European passenger car markets. In some markets such as Spain, Italy or the UK, the situation became very challenging. Since this summer, double-digit declines have been almost routine. In addition, the premium segment was and is being hurt by regulatory pressure in France. Since the <mark type="inaudible" /> emissions regulation, which penalizes larger vehicles, was put in place, premium sales in France have dropped accordingly. In the U.S. the passenger car market deteriorated further and the Japanese market remained weak.</p>
          <p>Turning to trucks, Western European markets continued at high sales levels in 2008, but incoming orders were declining substantially. And aftermarkets were still very weak this year in contrast to what was originally anticipated, and while Southeast Asian truck markets were above last year's level, the Japanese market has so far experienced another very weak year.</p>
          <p>All in all, what we've been seeing in recent weeks was more than just headwinds, it's dramatic slump in many of our major markets. No industry or business is immune to this and that includes Daimler.</p>
          <p>The consequences for our third quarter results on Group level can be outlined as follows. Revenues decreased 7% to &#x20AC;23.8 billion; adjusted for exchange rate effects and changes in the consolidated Group, revenue decreased by 5%. The Group's EBIT was &#x20AC;0.6 billion. This includes special items negatively impacting EBIT and demand of almost &#x20AC;0.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Our net profit was &#x20AC;0.2 billion and EPS came in at &#x20AC;0.21. Last year's figures were negative as they were heavily impacted by tax effects related to the separation from Chrysler. We had a negative free cash flow in our industrial business of &#x20AC;0.3 billion during the first nine months of the year. The net liquidity of our industrial business came down from 12.9 to &#x20AC;6.7 billion, reflecting our share buyback and the dividend payout as well as the negative free cash flow from our business.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to our division results. I'll quickly go through the headlines and what they mean for our projection for the remainder of the year. Bodo Uebber will then take you through the exact Q3 figures and further details.</p>
          <p>Mercedes-Benz Cars could neither expect nor escape the fallout of the financial crisis. Since our last quarterly conference call at the end of July, our assumptions for the second half of the year have been outdated by a dramatic slump leading to both lower sales and revenue. The latter was also impacted by a less favorable model mix, mainly due to next year's E-Class model changeover. In addition, we face burdens from the reassessment of residual values. As a result of all this, EBIT and return on sales were down sharply.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks on the other hand performed well. On the strength of higher unit sales and an improved model mix Daimler Trucks revenue increased. EBIT exceeded last year's level. Mercedes-Benz Vans and Daimler Buses benefited from the continued positive development of unit sales and they both achieved higher earnings. Daimler Financial Services slightly expanded its contract volume and earnings, also the cost of risk further increased.</p>
          <p>What does this mean for our projections for the remainder of the year? In light of the worsened financial market crisis and the resulting impact on future economic developments, forecasts in this environment are connected with a high degree of uncertainty. As we sit here today, it is not yet possible to reliably assess how quickly the action plans announced by various governments will contribute to the stabilization of financial and goods markets.</p>
          <p>We expect the slowdown in growth to affect nearly all countries in the industrialized regions. Therefore, we expect unit sales of Mercedes-Benz Cars in the full year 2008 to be in the magnitude of 2007. We also expect rising unit sales for Daimler Trucks for the full year 2008, reflecting positive development in important markets such as Brazil, Indonesia and the Middle East. We anticipate surpassing the 2007 sales for Mercedes-Benz Vans and we also expect Daimler Buses unit sales to mark a new record level.</p>
          <p>At Mercedes-Benz Cars, the changed market environment, in addition to ongoing burdens from high raw material prices, negative exchange rate effect and residual values result in an increased pressure on earnings. Our significantly improved efficiency cannot offset this burden. We therefore expect 2008 EBIT for Mercedes-Benz Cars in the magnitude of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, corresponding to a return on sales of 5% which is below our previous projections. Included therein are charges related to the reassessment of residual values in the amount of &#x20AC;449 million.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Trucks, we expect our positive sales development to largely offset higher material costs. Overall, we anticipate full year earnings of approximately &#x20AC;1.7 billion including charges related to Daimler Trucks North America of approximately &#x20AC;230 million.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Financial Services, we anticipate moderate increase in our worldwide contract volume in full year 2008. We expect to achieve a return on equity of about 14% in the full year. On the basis of those projections for divisions, we expect the Daimler Group in 2008 to post EBIT from ongoing operations of more than &#x20AC;6 billion. That does not include effects related to Chrysler.</p>
          <p>Before Bodo Uebber has the details for you, let me reiterate that these are extraordinary and unprecedented times. We've taken hits in our sales, revenues, margins and order book. And we recognize that the situation is very challenging indeed. You can be assured that that in 2008 beyond compensating the negative cost effects for instance raw material price increases we already defined and executed additional steps to offset some of the market induced revenue impacts.</p>
          <p>At the same time we are preparing within our existing programs for instance for Mercedes GO 410 a much more comprehensive approach to adjust ourselves to the reduced market potentials. One of the very first measures in this context is to bring inventories back to normal levels and thereby free the frozen working capital respective to cash flow.</p>
          <p>And we are confident that we've got what it takes to not only meet the short-term challenges of these uncertain times, but to successfully move beyond them and achieve our long-term goals. We continue to execute our aggressive R&amp;D and product plans.</p>
          <p>All in all our substance is very solid and that makes me confident Daimler can and will emerge strong. Bodo will now take you through the details and after that we'll both will be happy to answer your questions. Bodo?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dieter. Let's now turn to the Q3 key figures in our divisions starting with the Mercedes-Benz Cars. We experienced a 6% decline in unit sales compared to the previous year as our major market in the U.S., Japan and Europe weakened. In addition we faced burdens from the reassessment of residual values in the amount of &#x20AC;449 million. In the third quarter unit sales of Mercedes brand declined by 8% whereas Smart sales grew by 20%. Smart is very successful in the US where we have sold 20,000 units since the market launch in January.</p>
          <p>We also had a very good quarter in China where Mercedes-Benz sales were up by 57%. If we look at the first nine months of this year, total sales of Mercedes-Benz Cars division are still up 6%.</p>
          <p>Total revenue of Mercedes-Benz Cars was at &#x20AC;11.6 billion, that's down 18% compared to the third quarter of 2007. A combination of lower sales, the change in model mix and exchange rate effects, all contributed to this decline.</p>
          <p>EBIT of our Mercedes-Benz Car division declined from &#x20AC;1.3 billion to &#x20AC;112 million. In addition to the negative developments previously mentioned, we also suffered from higher raw material prices. And due to the severe deterioration of the used car markets and the residual values in Q3, especially in the U.S. and the UK, Mercedes-Benz reassessed its residual value risks burdening EBIT by &#x20AC;449 million.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we launched or introduced several new products. This last week we presented our new GLK at our German dealerships. The GLK extends our model range with a very attractive, smaller and fuel efficient SUV. In the third quarter, we also rolled out our latest generation M-Class. Our highlights at the Paris Motor Show included the public premiere of the new C250 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY Prime Edition and the S 400 BlueHYBRID models. The new S 400 BlueHYBRID will be the first series production, hybrid model with a lithium-ion battery. It will set a new benchmark in the luxury segment in efficiency and environmental compatibility.</p>
          <p>Last month in Berlin, together with RWE, we unveiled the world's largest joint e-mobility project for environmentally friendly electric cars. Daimler will provide more than hundred electric cars from Mercedes-Benz and Smart as well as vehicle service. RWE is handling the development, installation, and operation of the charging infrastructure with some 500 charging points. With this project, we will pass on more important milestone as we strive for leadership in green technologies.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to Daimler Trucks which performs solidly despite challenging markets environment in the U.S. and Japan. The Truck division increased its worldwide unit sales by 4% to 123,000 vehicles. Trucks Europe/Latin America achieved an increase of 12% to a total of 47,000 units boosted by extremely positive market developments in Western Europe and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Trucks NAFTA sold 26,000 vehicles during the third quarter. This was 7% higher than the previous which had been impacted by a very weak sales in the U.S. market. Trucks Asia posted a new international sales record, but our continued strong business outside of Japan could not fully compensate for weak demand in the Japanese home market, therefore third quarter unit sales slightly decreased. Asia now sells more than 75% of its trucks outside of Japan.</p>
          <p>On the strengths of higher unit sales and the improved model mix, Daimler Trucks revenue increased by 4% to &#x20AC;7.3 billion. Looking ahead, the division's incoming orders increased by 2% to 336,000 units during the nine months period. However, at Trucks Europe/Latin America incoming orders decreased by 23% and this was due to a strong decline in demand in Europe reflecting headwinds from the overall tough economic environment. Although incoming orders of Trucks NAFTA increased by 50%, we are still at very low levels. We thus expect the recovery to be less dynamic than originally anticipated. Trucks Asia increased incoming orders by 11% reflecting strong order intakes outside Japan.</p>
          <p>With EBIT of &#x20AC;510 million Daimler Trucks results exceeded their prior year level. The positive contributions from our increased sales volume, improved model mix and improved product positioning offset expenditures in connection with new and enhanced product development. That underscores the progress we have made with our management of cycles initiative, a pillar of our Global Excellence program. And we are acting decisively to improve the efficiency and profitability of our business with the repositioning of Daimler Trucks and NAFTA. We are focusing on a two-brand strategy with the discontinuation of the Sterling Trucks brand. We will consolidate our production network by closing the plants in St. Thomas, Ontario, and Portland, Oregon.</p>
          <p>As a result, we expect annual earnings improvement of $900 million by 2011, the related charges amount to $600 million in total, $350 million will be posted in the fourth quarter of 2008. In August, we rolled out the latest generation of our flagship Actros which features 37 major improvements. The Actros received the prestigious Truck of the Year award at the International Motor Show for Commercial Vehicles in Hannover in September. We also had the world premieres of three hybrid trucks, the Axor BlueTec Hybrid, the Econic BlueTec Hybrid, and the Econic CNG Hybrid.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., Freightliner launched the M2 Hybrid. With 10 Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid vehicles, Daimler Trucks put Europe's biggest test fleet of hybrid trucks into service in August. Daimler continues to set the pace with alternative drive options in commercial vehicles.</p>
          <p>Now lets turn to our Van operations. In the third quarter of 2008, the Mercedes-Benz Vans unit sold more than 73,000 vehicles, again exceeding the prior year level. This was above all, the result of strong demand for Sprinter vans which notched sales of 50,000 units. Vito Viano van models also recorded higher sales. Revenue of &#x20AC;2.4 billion were at prior year level.</p>
          <p>The success of our Bus unit also continued through the third quarter. Daimler Buses increased unit sales by another 15% to a total of 10,800 buses and chassis. All major market regions contributed to this success. As a result of our Bus business increased its revenue to &#x20AC;1.2 billion, 21% more than in the prior year. The EBIT development of the Vans, Buses, Other segment is shown on slide 19. The overall loss of the segment was &#x20AC;100 million compared to a profit of &#x20AC;319 million in the third quarter in the prior year. Mercedes-Benz Vans and Daimler Buses achieved an EBIT of 212 million and &#x20AC;92 million respectively, in both cases higher than the third quarter of 2007. EADS contributed minus &#x20AC;8 million to the segment's EBIT, slightly better than in the third quarter 2007 and further burdens on EBIT resulted from our stake in Chrysler.</p>
          <p>We took a negative charge for Chrysler's at equity result in the amount of &#x20AC;351 million. This amount includes special reporting items mainly from residual values in the amount of &#x20AC;248 million and due to our at equity losses the remaining book value of our stake in Chrysler holding of &#x20AC;171 million was completely reduced to zero in the third quarter. The at equity losses exceeding the &#x20AC;171 million had to be recognized by a reduction of the subordinated loan. We announced that on September 24 that we are in negotiations with Cerberus to redeem our remaining 19.9% stake in Chrysler to them. The date of the deal is still open.</p>
          <p>Turning to Financial Services, the contract volume of our business increased by 11% to &#x20AC;63.9 billion resulted foreign exchange rate effects and changes in the consolidated Group, the increase was 9%. New business in the third quarter amounted to &#x20AC;7.7 billion. This was 90% more than in the prior year. Customer funds invested with the Mercedes-Benz Bank in Germany rose sharply by 38% to &#x20AC;5.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Earnings of our Financial Services unit increased from &#x20AC;87 million to 173 million. The increase resulted partially from the expanded portfolio. In addition the third quarter 2007 had been heavily burdened by charges related to the de-merger from Chrysler. The set up costs for our new Financial Services organization in the NAFTA region has largely being absorbed. But we are not yet back to our previous level of productivity. The cost of risk was higher than in Q3 2007, while in light of the extremely challenging economic environment, it was still at a reasonable level.</p>
          <p>Returning to the Group level, let's take a quick look at the net profit and earnings per share. In Q3 2007 both metrics were heavily impacted by tax effects related to the transfer of the Chrysler majority stake to Cerberus. Third quarter 2008 net profit amounted to &#x20AC;213 million. This is after &#x20AC;504 million of taxes compared to tax expenses of &#x20AC;3.1 billion in the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>While the high prior year tax expenses was mainly due to an impairment of deferred tax assets as a result of the transfer of our majority in Chrysler to Cerberus, you might remember that &#x20AC;2.2 billion impairment charge. The relatively high tax rate in the third quarter of 2008 mainly reflects losses in connection with our stake in Chrysler for which a tax benefit could not be recorded. Earnings per share are at &#x20AC;0.21.</p>
          <p>Our key balance sheet and financial figures are shown on chart 24. As you can see our financial structure is still in good shape. At the end of the quarter, we had a gross liquidity of &#x20AC;10.2 billion largely cash at hand, that means we increased liquidity by &#x20AC;3 billion during the third quarter. The net liquidity of our industrial business of &#x20AC;6.7 billion is very comfortable. The decline against the year-end 2007 number is &#x20AC;12.9 billion. It's primarily related to the share buyback and the dividends payment. In fact it is higher than what we intend to hold in the long run. However, in the current environment we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity buffer. Our equity ratios both for the Group as well as for the Industrial Business are quite high.</p>
          <p>For the first nine months, the free cash flow of the Industrial Business was negative with &#x20AC;0.3 billion compared to &#x20AC;5.7 billion for the prior year. The sharp decline reflects one-time effects &#x20AC;4.5 billion from the 2007 transfer of equity interest in EADS and the sale of real estate properties by Mitsubishi Fuso. Cash inflows of &#x20AC;1.3 billion from the sale of the Potsdamer Platz real estate complex during Q1 of this year. And the acquisition of our share in Tognum and established credit line called by Chrysler which lower our free cash flow by 0.7 and &#x20AC;1 billion respectively. Furthermore in the year 2008, the free cash flow was impacted by the increase in working capital due to higher inventories. The higher inventories you can see in the interim report by over &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>As far as our funding is concerned, we have bond maturities in the fourth quarter in the amount of &#x20AC;1.7 billion. We will be a regular issuer in the bond market in the future and we are aware that the pricing will be higher than in the past.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have a balanced maturity portfolio for the fourth quarter and the year 2009. Regarding the funding of the group, we have a high degree of financial flexibility, our medium term note program and commercial paper program provide us with sufficient headroom for further funding measures. In addition, we have two unused credit facilities in the amount of more than &#x20AC;6.5 billion which serve as backup lines for commercial paper programs. We do not intend to use these credit lines. This is a pure liquidity reserve. The &#x20AC;3 billion facility was just agreed with a consortium of international banks two weeks ago and improves our access to the credit markets.</p>
          <p>It was very important for us, our financial services portfolio and the corresponding financial debts have the same liquidity profile. However, due to the current uncertainty in the markets we will temporarily suspend the further execution of our share buyback program and due to the suspension we might not reach our initial target to buy back 10% of the outstanding shares.</p>
          <p>Overall, we face a number of challenges of course the most of &#x2013; the most immediate is the international financial crisis and a degree to which it spills over to the macro economy. But we also have substantial opportunities. We continue to be well positioned in our markets. We have a promising product pipeline and we see potential for growth in both traditional and emerging markets. In addition we continue to make good headway with quality improvement and efficiency enhancement in all our divisions.</p>
          <p>Well this means for our projections for the remainder of the year has already been explained by Dieter, I don't need to repeat it. So let me just reemphasize one point while the environment, we're now operating in is determined by factors beyond our control, we're focusing our energy all the more on the things we can control. We continue to press ahead with the measures to improve our efficiency, reduce costs, enhance productivity in all our business. Thank you very much for your attention. Dieter Zetsche and I will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

I will identify the questioner by name, but please also introduce yourself with your name and the name of the organization that you are representing before asking your question. Two practical points, please avoid using a mobile phone as this distorts the quality of the call for everyone and secondly please ask your question in English.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon. Three questions if I may. First of all on Mercedes your guidance seems to imply pretty much a breakeven for Mercedes in the fourth quarter, I wonder whether you could just give us some details on what's the thinking process behind, how much production cut do you envisage in that quarter? Secondly in the third quarter you still continue to grow Financial Services, can you just clarify the situation on refinancing and how much in the quarters to go forward such trend might even reverse? And thirdly, Dr. Zetsche, the current financial crisis, how much is this putting your medium-term plan to come to a net gearing position on a structural risk, are you looking at this plan and could we see a scenario with Daimler going forward that's just willing to have a higher net liquidity position and not move into a small gearing position? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. As far as the first question is concerned, I don't think I have to explain how difficult it is at that point of time to give any future information making assumptions about the world, which nobody of us knows how it will continue to develop. We have made the most reasoned assumptions we could about the development of the markets which are in, as I explained, pretty bad shape at that point of time. We have assumed that we will try to reduce the supply of vehicles to the extent possible in accordance with the reduction of sales.</p>
          <p>In this regard let me tell you that we, as we informed, have decided about the first significant production cut in July this year. Unfortunately based on the logistical chain, we have to acknowledge the impact of that is basically or mostly in the fourth quarter. So all the production -- the sales reduction in the third quarter could not be offset by production reduction in the third quarter and therefore, we see this significant increase in inventories which affect our cash flow as was explained before. So we try of course by year-end to minimize ideally to avoid excess inventory, but that again of course depends on this development in the markets which only to some extent we can try to forecast.</p>
          <p>So we try, and you always try to do that, we try to be realistic in our assumptions for the fourth quarter or for the remaining part of the fourth quarter and we only know afterwards if that was realistic or optimistic or pessimistic, generally, as always but never in such a volatile environment as we are right now. So it's our best guess, what we have given you. And we will do everything to accomplish those targets but we cannot sign them in blood, in this environment we are in.</p>
          <p>As far as your third question is concerned, ask your colleagues. You have asked from us, six months ago, a very different attitude than you are today, for good reason. At that time, it was minimize your cost of capital and try to get to a slightly leveraged balance sheet. Now it's every cent you can keep in liquidity is a positive when we look at you. We do understand that, but those are the changes we are experiencing right now and we adjust accordingly and the decision to stop for that point of time our buyback program is one reaction to that of course, in our own assessment of course not just reaction to what you tell us. And at that point of time, of course, liquidity is key and cash flow is key and we will act accordingly and manage the company accordingly and a leveraged balance sheet is not a priority at that point of time.</p>
          <p>Bodo will add to that.</p>

          <p>Yes, to your question from the Financial Services part, I don't see &#x2013; of course we are following so to say also details development of the colleagues also in the fourth quarter, so that as a precondition for Financial Services what we take into our books, I don't see major changes of our let's say penetration rates in the different markets, but it also holds true for bus, van, trucks and for passenger cars. If you ask me right now, growth rates fourth quarter I would not assume the biggest months Q4 compared to the Q3 portfolio we have in our hands, so acquisition wise. Refinancing wise, we plan to be out in the market with a bond fourth quarter, maybe 1 to &#x20AC;2 billion. We don't need to. So, we have to &#x2013; we look at the development of the market and opportunistic-wise we will go out or not, seeing what the market is doing, some commercial paper but that's it for the fourth quarter 2008.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah good afternoon, it's Max Warburton from Sanford Bernstein. Inevitably I've got kind of similar questions on liquidity if that's okay. The first one on the write-downs in leasing in Mercedes could you just give us an explanation of the basis of that and the timing of it and what your thoughts are on, what would need to happen for you to need to take further write-downs? Related to that, from a company point of view or a credit rating agency point of view, at what point would you need to put more equity into Financial Services to compensate for this kind of activity? And then the final question, you've obviously improved your gross cash position during the quarter which gives you a bit of comfort, what is the minimum gross cash position the business needs for comfort? Obviously it can't go to zero, we need some money there for working capital purposes. But could you give us a feel for what the sort of minimum gross cash position the business needs? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all of those questions are best answered by Bodo, do you agree?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Who knows? Okay, let's go to the question &#x2013; the write-downs of course which we have made are based on our current assumption of future residual values at the end of the third quarter, so means end of September. So that takes into account for example AIG developments in the U.S., that's takes into account certain provider, Kett in the UK for example, and these are the major impacts we have in these both markets, of course we take into considerations.</p>
          <p>Yet on top of that you have to make an assessment of course what kind of pre-term maturities you get back so before the end of the term because these are good returns, because these are under the residual value in the contract, so to say. And based on these assumptions we have made our assessment which lead to the 449 provisioning what we did &#x2013; our leasing portfolio in Financial Services is 20 million; that might give you the wrong direction because you have of course to make the calculations what are these leases at the end of the term. And the Financial Services portfolio shows you the current book value, so you need to know of course the end of term projections and you have to look where you have all the guarantees from other third parties to grab the baseline of what you're doing, the provisioning.</p>
          <p>So even now to talk about percentages doesn't make sense. You can &#x2013; you know that you have a lease contract for example for 10 months in your scope or another for the term of 24, or 36 or it's all-in-all based on these assumptions, based on car lines  and single contracts, where you make these assumptions and then of course come up with these numbers. So at the end of the day, the next quarters and also 2009 depends on the future development on used car values in the market. That's it, that's only what I can tell you and we will see, and there is of course certainly the risks. I don't want to talk about opportunities. We might see a different world in three to four months. But of course today everybody would see that as a risk. But of course we are also somewhat far down with the residual values from this future expectations basis.</p>
          <p>You asked for the underlying equity ratio, we have today we have 7% in Financial Services. We are okay with that with the rating agencies. They are asking us how much equity we need for the Financial Services. You have to keep in mind that in our business model, the residual values are taken by the industry more or less as the extraordinary burdens. What we have some risk sharing which comes up with 1 or 2%, so it's a so to say tiny one, when you look at these numbers. And so for that risk, I don't need the equity, underlying equity in the Financial Services portfolio. So I feel fine with the 7% and that is also discussed with the rating agencies.</p>
          <p>Your third question was regards to liquidity which of course we did quite well with our 10 billion costs and liquidity on hand. Our target so to say or <mark type="inaudible" /> is that money we need minimum for the industrial business to manage is roughly 6 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could I just -- one follow up question. Dr. Uebber, you said that the credit line was there as comfort really rather than something you wanted to draw down. What would need to happen for you to draw dawn that credit line, or to phrase the question the other way, you are saying that this bond issuance in Q4, you don't need to do it, you'll review it based on rates. Can you just talk us through the trade-off between doing a bond issue or CP at a very high rate versus drawing down the credit line. How do you sort of make that decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the end we have to look at the financial markets, how they develop, and I do think it doesn't  make sense now to speculate when, what and if. We have to look at the development and then to inform you so to say. If we do, we don't expect it. We don't need to do it and I do think for the time being that should be the answer of this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please. Arndt Ellinghorst would you please ask the next question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Two questions please. Firstly do you see some suppliers struggling and could we see quite significant charges from Daimler helping struggling suppliers? We get basically a profit warning everyday from automotive suppliers these days. And the question, the second question is on Financial Services again, I mean I understand we are all looking at a doom or death scenario now regarding Financial Services and that it's all bad and nobody can ever do leasing and whatever again. I think if that's true, the industry cannot resell any more cars especially premium makers. So, my question is, isn't there also a chance for captive automotive financial services providers to potentially gain quite significant market share in financial services and from non-captive providers, i.e. banks, in this market and couldn't you really develop this business more sustainable. If you as a car maker are in charge of residual values and marketing used cars extending your business model down the value chain, offering leases for used cars and so on. So, isn't there quite a significant chance gaining market share in Financial Services in the longer run? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to your first question, of course, we do see that the pressure in the system is putting a high burden on suppliers and I would like to add on dealers as well, especially as far as refinancing is concerned, so in this regard we share the concerns you are mentioning, what is different from the past is that we have highly sophisticated systems to understand as early as possible kind of our own rating system which we established within &#x2013; between the OEMs, not to be surprised by what's going on with our suppliers. Those were the cases where we really bleeded heavily with surprise collapses of suppliers. When we work together with them on a day-by-day basis facing challenges together, the exposure is still there but it's much more limited and that's the situation I would see by today. We will see a number of collapses in some of our suppliers, but hopefully in a much more managed and controlled way than we have seen it in the past sometimes.</p>
          <p>But I would like to add this is not just a problem for our suppliers, but as especially as financing is concerned if you don't get some liquidity in the system altogether -- as an a economy altogether and automotive  industry as well of course we will face problems at many -- and more down and up the value chain than with us as far as timing is concerned and therefore it's really important for all of us that we get the system going again as far as availability liquidity is concerned.</p>
          <p>As far as Financial Services is concerned and Bodo will talk to that in a second. First of all I very much appreciate your attitude that all those crisises and doomsday scenarios always include opportunities as well and the stronger you are, the better your chance to leverage those opportunities while going forward. That's definitely our intention for instance as well as by continuing to invest into new technologies and be much better positioned in three years than potentially some of our suppliers, our competitors who might have a tougher time to continue to invest into those future necessities.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, especially as Financial Services is concerned nobody of us knows how the liquidity, the access to liquidity will develop going forward. And therefore, certainly the kind of exposure you're exposing as you're going for yourself, you have to balance opportunity against risk. And therefore, now let's say well that's great, let's just take all the financing into our hands and forget about our bad competition and have 100% penetration. I don't think that this would be a very wise move at that point of time seeing the kind of refinancing needs we would generate with that. But, I agree as well in that field there might be opportunities as well and Bodo you can be more specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I cannot anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You don't have to. So, let me do. Let's say only one remark on top of this, we were always and we will be always somewhat risk-conscious also in the business. And also we &#x2013; yes, there may be opportunities but on the other hand you don't have to forget that as long as you go in the direction of more percentages, you might make the mistake to deep, to buy deeper for example also in the rating of the customers and so on. And we have made this risk consciously in the past. We will do so also in the future and that leads me let's say more to the one, let's ask Dieter where we are right now, that is pretty okay, and let's optimize under this level instead of increasing the market share. Of course, we &#x2013; in this regard, we take opportunities yes, but we might not aim to increase our penetration at this point of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Bodo, could you remind us what your dealer financing receivables are at this stage and what the defaults on these receivables in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course these are, they are pretty low. I don't have the number available right now here, but the risk for the dealers is a far lower one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that's one element which is different for us than for most of our competitors which is Germany where we basically have agents and no dealers and we own the inventory anyway. So, in this regard specifically in our largest market Germany, we have no exposure in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have put it on the slides, you might not have seen it on slide 21 in my presentation, we have 7.6 billion in wholesale financing.</p>

          <p>Next question from Adam Jonas, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, afternoon, it's Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of questions, first, which foreign exchange rates concern you most right now? There's obviously been a huge amount of volatility. Just wanted to know off the top of your head, if you could give us the ones aside from the U.S. dollar of course working in your favor, which most concerns you? And which emerging market sources of demand concern you right now as you've been seeing how your business progressed there very rapidly up until the last few weeks? And then just a third just clarification, can you just confirm clearly whether Daimler is included in any German government bank rescue package? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Adam, so I most of all of course we have some opportunities all in this world, no doubt that you mentioned one is currency. Of course the U.S. dollar is I would say an opportunity right now and we did our hedging with options which is quite now a good position. So we try to work down so to say the average exchange rates so to say for these different currencies down to in this direction for example taking the options and buying other ones or buying forwards and so on to optimize a structure of our hedgings.</p>
          <p>We have currently in 2009 at roughly 70% with our hedging structure which we have, which as I said before not all are forwards in this regard. I would say the second opportunity is somewhat the yen, right now from a development point of view, there we had the same strategy as we had with the U.S. dollar and some opportunities. And we &#x2013; of course we are somewhat there in a netting position with Fuso to Mercedes-Benz which is also netting a kind of risk volatility what we had. And certainly of course the third biggest impact but and then it goes further down to the Brazilian market and to other markets, is the UK and there we closely to watch the development there and to take our actions if the markets are favorable. In the UK the pound is not as, let's say as good in the development as the U.S. dollar and that's it. So we take all opportunities what we can to get this opportunity so to say into our books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as emerging markets are concerned, still in September and ongoing in October, in China we have very high growth rates. September for instance was 67% or something like that. In Latin America or Brazil specifically we had similar positive rates even though at much smaller base. So, the absolute there are much less relevant. In India we did very well as well again on a small basis, but in Russia the 70% drop of the stock exchange has affected our customer base and we have seen in Russia, we still expect to meet our more recent sales expectations which were considerably higher than the original plan, but there definitely the dynamics have slowed down significantly and that is the market -- emerging market at that point of time, which seems to be affected by that time the most among the emerging market, negatively affected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam your last question from the action the governments take regarding the banks and of course in Germany we have a bank, it's called the Mercedes-Benz Bank and I'm happy to get your deposits. They are which is doing quite fine right now, but I do think this is a theoretical question. So, we are not doing any derivatives. We don't have any I don't know real estate stuff and what you have seen in some other banks in the world, so this is a theoretical question I do think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I only asked the question not because of your portfolio, because obviously the left side of your Financial Services balance sheet is -- were comparable with some of the things that we've seen in the banking side, traditional banking side. I only asked if we have a liquid &#x2013; from a liquidity freeze perspective, if we have where people were kind of fearing of this complete shut down, would then at that point theoretically you be a part of a government program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Theoretically we could, but as I said also right now we have the strong deposits there in the bank which is quite okay, developing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we had heard a comment of one of your colleagues that automotive companies basically are banks, which has not helped the share price development of the industry altogether, which is technically to part of our business correct, but certainly the specifics are pretty different as we just saw in this specific example.</p>

First of all I thought I caught something that Mr. Uebber had said about the potential or the negotiations about the Chrysler sale, it sounded like the agreement had in principle been reached, but that there was, the one thing that still had yet to be decided on was simply the date. So perhaps you could be more specific about that in case I misunderstood?</p>

          <p>No problem. I'll just move on very quickly. You had mentioned that these are unprecedented times for the industry, just kind of curious your core program had led to savings about &#x20AC;7.1 billion, do you expect that you may need to introduce a new core program at Mercedes or at Daimler Trucks and what kind of savings could you expect from that? And very quickly just maybe a statement about the overall production cuts for 2008, what they will likely be and if you expect any further ones for 2009, would that result in job cuts as well?</p>
          <p>And lastly, you had mentioned suppliers. I was just kind of curious, would you perhaps intervene were Schaeffler to try and break up Conti or whether Conti itself would try to split into a rubber and automotive group. Considering that there had been this attitude that there were additional synergies to be gained by merging Schaeffler with Conti and keeping that entire group in a sense as one big supplier. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. As far as your first part is concerned, we are very glad that we have successfully planned and executed the core program and the corresponding programs in the other divisions. And before the financial crisis took shape, we basically started further programs, which were not Core 2 or something similar in the other divisions. But a broader scope to address the strategic and the efficiency opportunities and challenges going forward in all divisions. On the Mercedes side, this is called Go For 10. And within this basic framework, which has been set, we are now, of course reacting to the increased challenges, which we are facing in order to define the scope and depth of those programs going forward.</p>
          <p>We are in the middle of this process and you can be assured that we will do everything necessary to make adjustments in accordance to the changes environment we are facing. You will always have a delay between the impact of those programs and the environment, especially when the environment changes as fast as it did in the last few weeks and months, but you're actually as we have proven with our announcement a few days ago as far as North American truck market is concerned. We will do what it takes in order to adjust ourselves to the environment. And I ask for your understanding that I cannot and do not want to be more specific at that point of time. And that very much applies to your question regarding production cuts as well. I told you that our objective is to keep or bring back inventories to the sound levels, and where they exceeded you obviously have to reduce production more than sales going forward, and where it's in line, we have to do the same.</p>
          <p>So the defining factor is sales, and sales is always an assumption going forward. And therefore we can't say anything specific and definite on the production either. And when you talk about production cuts about 2009, of course you have to ask against what. So we have to set a plan for 2009 with an assumption about sales and if this assumption is correct we will execute our production plan and if this assumption is too optimistic or too pessimistic, we will adjust production accordingly. Those are the principles and I ask your understanding that this does not lead to numbers or to employment impact or whatever.</p>
          <p>Schaeffler-Conti, I'm afraid they have their own call to discuss this topic; we are as much observers as you are.</p>

          <p>All right, Christoph Rauwald from Dow Jones in Frankfurt. Two quick questions if I may. First question is you said during the second quarter earnings release that the additional costs through raw material prices will exceed &#x20AC;500 million in full year 2008. Could you maybe give us an update on that which is maybe a bit more specific? And second question, given that September is almost over, how was the car sales development so far this month at Mercedes-Benz? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second &#x2013; based on the second quarter estimations what we saw in the markets, we had a burden compared to 2007 of somewhat over &#x20AC;500 million, that's true what you said. Currently, we are honestly in the last few months a little bit higher even than the number what I tell you right now. We're roughly right now from raw materials at 800 million roughly compared to 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I mentioned before, we do believe on the Mercedes side that we will be able to offset those non-planned &#x2013; out of those 800, the majority was not assumed and put into our plan for 2008. And by better results in the remaining bill of materials, we continue to believe that we would be able to offset that incremental cost increase within the original plan assumptions, or against those.</p>
          <p>As far as October is concerned we have seen &#x2013; we always see, but we have seen in more accentuated way in recent months that the kind of developments in the markets are very much defined by the last days and weeks, and therefore our days and weeks, and therefore an assessment mid-month, now we have the 20 something, is of limited value. Generally speaking it's fair to say that the markets have not recovered anywhere and that affects the sales of all manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Next question from Philippe Houchois, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>UBS. I had two questions please. One is going back on this leasing write-down and I think what's happening as you reprice your leasing in the US in particular, I was just wondering are you seeing an increasing number of customers putting down -- putting back the cars to you as a corporation at the end of the lease program and are you faced with an increase in the number of used cars you have to recycle and therefore more pressure to put them through auction which is kind of a negative cycle for resale values in U.S.? So, if you can comment on this? And the second one I want to know about is could you give some qualitative comments about the profitability of Smart, you seem to be selling lot of them in U.S. and generally speaking are you still happy with the development of Smart profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Philippe, your first question is regarding the repossessions, you asked are more cars getting back, of course a trend, as I said before cost of risk increased in the third quarter, that was true especially also for the Mercedes-Benz passenger car business in the U.S. and also the repossessions in that of course increased in September compared to August and July and the total third quarter average was higher than the second quarter of 2008. And just to add here something on the Truck side in the US even we had a slight better development in this regard. Overall taking everything into account Q3 was worse than Q2 in credit losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's not so much repossession I'm asking about as I'm asking about customers who have had a car on lease for a few years, comes renewal time, the price is going up and they decide that they are not going to be customers of Mercedes anymore. They put the car back to you and then you miss a sale and also you have to deal with an increase in your stock of used cars to have to recycle to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Philippe, these kinds of development we don't see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we &#x2013; sorry as we mentioned already in the last call, fortunately by the end of, or second half of last year, we established a new commission system with our dealers in order to incentivize their stronger participation in used car retail sales which helped us to significantly shift the percentage, even though the total volume increased by higher lease returns as well, to shift the percentage of cars being retailed versus cars to be auctioned significantly in our favor, that helps us in the current situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Smart profits, now you are happy with them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we were happy in the second quarter with Smart. Of course we said always that we are breakeven there so positive with Smart. You asked also the U.S. and of course, but, I don't know but this current exchange rate right now positive, does better than before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We sold 20,000 Smarts in the U.S. in the first three quarters which goes significantly beyond our original plan for the full year. We are making money with Smarts. Obviously not there in the magnitude of S Classes. But as we said before in 2008, we will be positive with Smart and that that's the facts in the case. And from a marketing point of view, it's a great success with Smart and from a reputation point of view of course as well, economically it's positive but it's not the biggest lever we have in our business system.</p>

          <p>Next question from Daniel Schwarz, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello, Daniel Schwarz from Commerzbank, one question concerning your mid-term target, specifically the 9% EBIT margin for the automotive business. Are these still achievable not in 2010 but in the longer term after you, for example, changed your long term assessment of the U.S. truck market. And second question is the write-downs of residual value, the 449 million, could you give a split, a geographic split for these write-downs? And just for understanding the basis of the write-downs is the deterioration in the third quarter and the assumption of stabilization going forward, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as far as your first question is concerned, we always said that for the respective divisions and for the Group altogether those financial targets, we have set ourselves are the average throughout the cycle. Obviously at that point of time we are either at the bottom or on our way to bottom of the cycle where obviously we never assume we could come to those numbers. I can't tell you when the cycle will be back to average, normal or to a positive side, therefore I can't tell you when, but I can clearly tell you that we continue to be committed to those targets and strive for those targets in an average market environment, which we don't have at this time.</p>
          <p>You mentioned North America. I think that's a good example. In North America, our assessment told us the average of the cycle will be lower than we assumed, structurally lower than we assumed a year or two years ago. And therefore we said we need an adjustment to our business model in order to be able in this new assessment for the average cycle volume to still meet our financial targets and that's exactly why we've made those structural changes to our business there in order to be able to continue to pursue our targets. So I think that's a very good example to explain how our thinking is in this regard. Bodo, as far as residual values are concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Daniel the &#x2013; to your question it's roughly two-thirds U.S. and one-third UK roughly. The split and you asked about on top of the &#x2013; on the basis on this of course these are the future expectations of course and what we saw of course in the market was in Q3 sales and markets were down, the channels were down. So to say and that is the same impact you can see then on the residual value sides on the expected future values that you take into account when you're doing your impairment tests and everything what you need to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello good afternoon. Just a follow-up first of all on the issue of residual value. I was wondering if you could comment on the specific situation of Germany, because our understanding is that BMW did mention not just the UK but also Germany and possibly Spain, as of possible risk areas for residual value risk going forward? And the second question on trucks, if you could be more specific on your view on the market trends for both North America and Europe, and also regarding Europe more specifically whether you think that the flexibility of your industrial footprint is strong enough to withstand a 20% drop in demand for instance in Western Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I start with the latter one. As I said before it's very clear to us that we cannot ultimately influence the overall world economy or the overall size of automotive markets. What we can do is try to adjust to a given environment which we find. In this regard of course our objective would be, let's start with your scenario of 20% if that were a case we would have to face our objective would be to adjust to that environment. The problem of course is that you can't do that in sync. So in these cases you do not talk about cutting some fat but you talk about significant structural changes which you have to apply and those you can't do from today to tomorrow.</p>
          <p>We, I think we have proven in the past, I hope that's your perception and definitely it's our clear commitment to act fast and decisively in whatever actions we need to do in order to make those kind of adjustments. That's our clear intention, and you can measure us against that in the future, but once again they will not be in sync with whatever developments we see outside, beyond that I think is speculative now to assume what might the changes we will face. Nobody knows, we don't. But we have to take them as they are and then do what it takes to adjust in accordance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're right of course I commented on the impairment side on the 449, of course we see also in these markets used car values going down, but we have no necessity to do any impairments in that portfolio. Of course the German market is a bigger portfolio no doubt, but the Spanish market for example is a very small portfolio with regard to leasing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, a couple of questions. The first one was just on the raw materials side and I was thinking particularly around steel pricing and where you stand with that, and at what point you are going to start to get some benefit from falling prices there? And my second question and I'm sorry to come back to it, but it's the issue of liquidity and funding and listening to you it seems that you are relaxed might be the wrong word, but certainly more comfortable on that front than perhaps the market thinks here. I take into consideration you've raised the 3 billion syndicated loan, but when you look at over 20 billion of short-term debt, I am just wondering what gives you the confidence that you are going to be able to finance that over the next 6 or 9 months, in particular maybe you could explain what you've been able to do in the last few weeks in commercial paper and other markets that, if we listen to people we were led to believe that they were all pretty much shut?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the raw materials side. We have firm scheme with most of our raw material suppliers, which basically on mathematical equation brings those changes, those spot market changes in a somewhat dampened way into our system.</p>
          <p>Sticking to that system means that we have some delay in order to benefit from the stock market, from the spot, sorry, spot market, value changes which we have seen recently. We do believe it's prudent to stay with the system and to accept the delay rather than first accepting all the increases start coming through that system and now stopping the system and be hoping that they really will see the benefits of the prices coming down as well. So, for that reason we will benefit from the positive developments we are seeing but in a delayed way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would take how long to see through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Six to nine months is the delay more or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bodo, you're ready?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, the number you mentioned of course is a 12 months number or a longer term number so for the quarter of course the amounts are far lower than you mentioned. So, I mentioned before the 1. 2 &#x2013; 1 to 2 billion in bonds and on the short term financing it's lower, far lower than the number you're mentioning for fourth quarter. In total of course you have to looking out to our disclosure, it is composed of the deposits from our Mercedes-Benz Bank in Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is somewhat increasing and might be we are in a better position than other banks, I don't know. And of course we have also to roll over our bank, bank loans of 7 billion, which is okay what we do each quarter. It will be &#x2013; it's unfavorable in the last couple of months and our commercial paper of course is something is a smaller part here where we do think we have excess through the commercial paper. And I honestly I think we are presenting here the numbers, so you don't, I don't know assumed to be relaxed, of course we are doing our business here and we are balanced so to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when you said environment, the 7 billion of bank loans that you're rolling over, is that a series of a bilateral lines and you -- that you're finding no problems rolling those forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean it just really come back to the question earlier, which was about whether if the markets remain -- if the markets fail to store at what point do you potentially look to benefit from the same type of packages to get access to finance that some of the other bank &#x2013; other banks have and I take your point this is not about asset quality, it's simply about access liquidity?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we take the next question from Daniel Sch&#xE4;fer, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hello Daniel Sch&#xE4;fer from the Financial Times. I'd like to ask three questions if I may. Firstly, your competitors Hyundai and Fiat have painted quite a gloomy picture of 2009 today, with Fiat saying that the demand could drop 10 to 20%. Do you expect a similar drop in demand for your products in 2009? And secondly, the write-downs on the residual values &#x2013; they are not included in your forecast for the EBIT for 2008. And I just wanted to know is that kind of a normal way to exclude it from the forecast, as it, as to me it seems that loan loss provisions seem to be part of the normal operating business of a company. And the third question's to Mr. Zetsche, you mentioned that there could be some collapses of suppliers and their severe strengths under refinancing, do you actually -- do you see something already happening among especially among like the second and third year suppliers as to, are there some of them already in deep trouble and what are you planning to do to actually help them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well to your first question, first of all as we discussed before as I too believe nobody is in a position to give a forecast how the overall financial market and the economy will develop going forward. Now we can compete who knows the growth numbers and see who is the best in that there. In that spot, I think we would contribute in the sense of a self-fulfilling prophecy to a more difficult future environment, because psychology and confidence and trust obviously are the key words going forward. And we want to rather be not by being blindfolded and not trying to have risks, but we rather do not want to contribute to this kind of environment in knowing the more gloomy picture than the other guy, but rather in building confidence and trying to help us all out of this crisis. And therefore, I would like to leave my comment about 2009 with that.</p>
          <p>As far as residual values are concerned, the observations are right. I would like to add that within their numbers and forecasts for Mercedes the write-downs in residual values are included as I do agree with you those are operational issues, but it's true as well that specifically within this year, based on the unusual situation with Chrysler, we gave guidance for Daimler with a clear definition on pure operations and that was the only reason why this number is not included in the Daimler forecast. But we have made it very clear and transparent at every point what is the number with and what's number without so it's up to you to add or subtract those values which are all transparent and available. We do not want to suggest that residual values would nothing have to do with operations, certainly not.</p>
          <p>As far as suppliers are concerned, there are one or two cases where we specifically work with the suppliers at current times. Obviously like in the case of banks or other institutions, it's not helpful to name those and then again create self-fulfilling prophecies. The way we interact depends on our involvement. In some cases we try to separate ourself and to minimize our involvement, in other cases we try to do everything to avoid collapse of the supplier to help them steer around it. That very much depends on the given situation and then our specific relationship to that supplier and our involvement.</p>

          <p>Before taking next question, just one remark. There are still many people on the list and only a little bit more than ten minutes left. So please limit yourself to just one question, hope also for a short answer. And we take now the next question from Thierry Huon please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thierry Huon speaking from Exane BNP Paribas. So I have got a question about the, what you intend to do in terms of CapEx and dividend. Are you planning to cut your CapEx program and maybe your dividend in order to save cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as CapEx is concerned we try to avoid every not really necessary investment and on the other hand we try to steer forward and continue in all investments which are made to build a more successful future. And I did already and repeat to mention CO2 as one of those elements which might potentially put us in a competitively better position in the future than we are by today. So in this regards minimize or avoid any unnecessary and use our strength to be able to invest into your future on an ongoing basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question regarding the dividend of course we will disclose this at the press conference in February based on our year-end numbers which we will then have achieved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question from  Gregor Claussen please. Sorry, we can't hear you. Okay, then we take Christian Breitsprecher, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim. Maybe you can help us a bit more to understand the operating leverage in the Mercedes business. I mean when I look at your volume outlook for the current year, you say roughly the same volume as last year so that would suggest for the fourth quarter volume declined somewhere in the region 12, 13, 14%. But, at the same time you suggest that you're just going to be breakeven in the fourth quarter. And I know there are lot of aspects, elements working in that number. But maybe looking back, taking 2007 as a starting point, what would you say is about your cost -- was your cost structure in Mercedes? What was the fixed cost and what is the variable cost? So what is roughly the operating leverage that we can see in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, beyond there are impossibility to answer that question within the short answering time I was given by our master of ceremonies here. I think we have to understand that those breakeven numbers always neglect the fact that typically not only volume and fixed cost, but pricing is an element as well and those tend to go together in up and down markets. And therefore I don't think that we gain a lot by entering into this discussion right now.</p>
          <p>What I can tell you is that with core and with our ongoing activity, we are able to maintain and reduce our cost structure fixed and variable, including additional content in our product till today and that's certainly a pattern we have to try to maintain going forward, CO2 being a challenge in this regard and we discussed that before. And as I said before, if we see volumes decline then we have to reduce our overhead and our fixed cost structure in order to keep a breakeven below the volume we can accomplish. So, those are &#x2013; there are no fixed costs in this sense other than amortization perhaps. The other fixed costs we have to correct to make them variables. That is the task for management, that's at least my understanding.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. A question on the Truck side, I noticed that your development in Western Europe was pretty better than the whole market. I was wondering what was different within the Daimler Truck division here and how will that continue, what about your flexibility especially in the Truck division here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean first of all I would like to thank for the way you put that question, I do believe that for the first three quarters the Truck division has shown impressive performance especially in Europe and Latin America. The main element certainly being very strong focus on efficiency programs and on cost avoidance, reduction, secondly we have tried to use the market conditions in order to have a positive pricing development in a successful way which we are benefiting from. Third, we have been relatively conservative in putting orders on our backlog and therefore we have seen less order cancellations. We have seen order cancellations but less cancellations than most of our competitors. Those might be three elements which are helping us today, but I do not want to deny and we said that openly there are obviously the incoming orders for the industry altogether including us are clearly indicating that we will not be able to continue at the same levels going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, gentlemen I have just, there is one question on the corporations BMW, I mean we don't hear a lot in the past weeks. So is it that the thing has really cooled off a bit compared to a couple of months ago or is it just because media do focus on many other things right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say the amount of stories you heard about that was to some extent an understandable media hype as well because it's an exciting story. On the real side, we have discussed in the past, we have discussed in more recent times, we have discussed specific issues and we continue to see opportunities in those specific topics to come to mutual agreement. There new news -- no new news and the discussions are constructive; nothing has changed in this regard.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Coming back to your better performance in the truck markets, have you just caught up the delivery bottlenecks in the beginning of the year or have you gained market shares and if yes, do you know whom from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have &#x2013; obviously we have over time recovered the loss from the foundry shortfall in supply. We were optimistic in the beginning of the year that we would have a chance based on very strong product for in the first place a very good performing Actros to gain market share throughout the year and at that point of time this seems to be a realistic expectation. So we were more hampered in the beginning, because of shortage of supply rather than obviously benefiting from that now today, I think that's our strength in the marketplace right now, which is somewhat better. We see at least a stable market share in 2008 versus 2007 and a potential improvement.</p>

          <p>Okay. Hi, good morning. Just another strategic question. In today's news, Nissan would be interested in a 20% stake in Chrysler, have they approached you or you have approached them or is it entirely a discussion Nissan is supposed to have with Cerberus?</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Dr. Dieter, Mr. Uebber, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the valuation of the Chrysler stake at zero, is it just a function of the market in the U.S., could you talk about that and also, is it an indicator of the price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a function of accounting, which led exactly to that result, totally independent of our assessment about the value of Chrysler or the stake or whatever.</p>

          <p>Wolfgang from US Wealth Management, Zurich.  I have just one question, I mean in Q3 it seems like you spent around 1 billion in cash for share buybacks.

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Henrick Zachman, Reuters. So one quick question, is it fair to expect no operating profit at all in Mercedes-Benz in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have tried and we explained the basis for that and certainly the environment we are trying to do that to give you guidance for Mercedes, and now it's an issue of mathematics to conclude an assumption for the full fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>We have now one very last question and hope a short one from Philippe Barrier please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon Philippe Barrier, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, just a quick  question regarding Chrysler, actually we don't know what would happen or when it will get an agreement with Cerberus, but a technical point of view now they could evaluate at zero actually and you obliged to put at equity for the next quarter, or actually you can stop the consideration of Chrysler on the topic? And the second point regarding the linked liabilities to Chrysler, see a valuation of equity at zero, doesn't take for you to push or to write-down the equities or to make a further write-down operations regarding all liabilities linked to the Chrysler stake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing you have seen that we have not only written down the book value to zero but we had then to account for the long-term assets which is a loan. So the $400 million loan we had to, or euro loan we had to reduce to 80 somewhat in book value and that would also further on regarding the equity consolidation of Chrysler. Your second one is something which we have to talk about in February year end when we do our evaluation, so I cannot tell you anything about future assessments of the assets here, we do so in February when we disclose all year end figures.</p>
