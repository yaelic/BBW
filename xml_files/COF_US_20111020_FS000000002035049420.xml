          <p>Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening to the call.</p>
          <p>Let me provide a few highlights in the quarter on slide three. Capital One delivered earnings per share of $1.77 or $813 million in the third quarter compared to $1.97 or $911 million in the second quarter of 2011. The linked-quarter decrease in earnings was caused by an increase in provision expense, which was only partially offset by higher pre-provision earnings. Loan balances grew in the quarter by almost $1 billion to $130 billion, driven by growth in our Auto Finance and Commercial businesses. While our revolving Domestic Card balances also grew, the reported Domestic Card segment posted moderately lower balances due to continued runoff in our installment loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Net interest margin remained strong in the quarter. It expanded 19 basis points to 7.39%. The combination of loan growth and margin expansion drove higher revenue in the quarter. Since non-interest expenses were only up modestly, pre-provision earnings were also up in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As overall credit trends are stabilizing after almost two years of rapidly declining charge-offs, our quarterly credit metrics are increasingly driven by seasonal patterns. Charge-offs continued to fall in the quarter, but a significantly smaller allowance release associated with stabilizing credit trends caused our provision expense to rise. The charge-off rate improved 39 basis points to 2.52%, while our coverage ratio of allowance to loans came down only 19 basis points to 3.29%.</p>
          <p>Finally, our capital generation capacity remained strong. Our Tier 1 common ratio was up over 60 basis points in the second quarter and now stands at 10%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide four, I'll briefly discuss net interest margin. Net interest margin grew as our average asset yield rose while our cost of funds declined. Loan yield was driven up by a variety of items, including an $85 million release from our finance charge and fee reserves, which I will discuss in a moment. The positive impact of loan yields on the margin was partially offset by the increased investments in cash equivalents, representing proceeds from the completion of acquisition related bond financing and security sales. The cost of funds declined modestly in the quarter as deposit rates fell and the proportion of wholesale funding was reduced.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five, let's take a closer look at the income statement. Capital One earnings in the third quarter were driven by loan growth and expanding margins, offset by higher provision and non-interest expenses. Total revenue increased 4% on a linked-quarter basis. About half of the revenue growth resulted from a decline in the level of revenue suppression in our Card business. This lower level of suppression was driven by an improvement in the estimated collectability of billed finance charges and fees on existing card balances. The improvement in the estimated collectability was in turn driven by a change in the way we calculate expected recoveries of non-principal balances to reflect our evolving experience in a period of highly elevated inventories of charged off debt in relation to the more recent level of finance charges and fee balances.</p>
          <p>The finance charge and fee reserve has now reached its historical low, and we expect it to remain reasonably stable for the foreseeable future. We would expect overall revenue suppression levels going forward to be more or less in line where they've been in the last several quarters prior to this one, but without the benefit of further reserve releases such as the one we had in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We experienced growth in both net and non-interest income. Net interest income grew as margins expanded and balances grew. Non-interest income increased slightly in the quarter, driven by the absence of the contra-revenue impact from the UK Payment Protection settlement that we recognized in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, there were two significant but largely offsetting items related to our balance sheet repositioning ahead of the pending acquisition of ING Direct. We recognized approximately $240 million of gains from the sale of $6.4 billion of mostly agency mortgage-backed securities. These sales, which benefited from lower rates, are intended to manage our balance sheet risk in advance of acquiring a substantial quantity of mortgage assets from ING Direct.</p>
          <p>You will also recall that in early August, we entered into a pay-fixed swap position as a partial hedge against the impact of changing interest rates on the value of the net assets we will record upon the close of the pending situation of ING Direct. At the end of the quarter, we record a $266 million mark-to-market loss on the swap. That position will continue to be marked until it is closed. As we stand today, the impact of rate movements on the value of the acquired net assets at closing, net of the swap impact, should benefit capital compared to our estimates at the time the ING Direct deal was announced in June. Much of this movement occurred by time we announced the HSBC U.S. Card business acquisition in August, so we have no reason at this time to change the estimated incremental capital for that acquisition of $1.25 billion.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense increased slightly in the quarter due to higher staffing costs as well as accruals against an earnout agreement related to a previous acquisition. Looking ahead, we would expect operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be similar to Q3 levels as run rate and year-end expenses are likely to make up for the assumed absence of the unique items in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Marketing expense in the third quarter declined modestly, mostly driven by the timing of several large marketing programs whose expenses were recognized in the second quarter. In line with usual historical patterns, marketing expenses should rise in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The higher loss in discontinued operations is largely attributable to a rep and warranty expense in the quarter of $72 million compared to $37 million in the second quarter of this year. This increase is partially the result of claims paid in the quarter and a $23 million increase to the rep and warranty reserve, which now stands at $892 million, representing what we believe to be probable and estimable losses.</p>
          <p>As a result of some generally increased activity by investors in the non-GSE and non-insured securitization categories, we would further estimate that the upper end of a reasonably possible range of future losses from rep and warranty claims beyond current accrual levels has risen from $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide six, let's take a quick look at our capital position. Strong business performance as well as the continued decline of disallowed DTA drove our Tier 1 common ratio up 60 basis points in the quarter to 10%, using Basel I definitions. Using known Basel III definitions, our Tier 1 common ratio would be approximately 10 basis points higher than that. We continue to be comfortable with our strong capital levels and our underlying trajectory.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich. Rich?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Gary, and welcome to everyone this afternoon. I'll begin on slide seven with a look at loan volumes.</p>
          <p>As Gary mentioned, ending loan balances grew by just under $1 billion in the quarter despite continuing runoff of home loans in our Consumer Banking segment and installment loans in our Domestic Card segment. Domestic Card loan balances declined modestly in the quarter. But excluding the installment loan runoff, revolving credit card loans grew by just under $300 million in the quarter, up about 0.5% sequentially and up about 4.5% compared with the third quarter of 2010. We expect seasonal growth in Domestic Card loan balances in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Beyond loan growth, there are continuing signs of traction in our Domestic Card business. New account originations continue to grow. And new accounts booked in the third quarter of 2011 were more than double the new accounts booked in the third quarter a year ago. Growth in purchase volume continues to outpace the industry. Our purchase volume grew 17% from the third quarter of 2010, excluding the impact of the Kohl's portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Consumer Banking, loan balances were up modestly, as strong growth in auto loans was partially offset by expected runoff of the mortgage portfolio. Auto Finance originations were $3.4 billion, up 17% from the second quarter and 40% from the third quarter of 2010. We expect that auto originations will remain strong and drive continuing growth in auto loans.</p>
          <p>Our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of steady loan growth. Ending loans were up 3% from the prior quarter and up 9% from the third quarter of 2010. Growth in loan commitments, an early indicator of future loan growth, was even stronger. Our C&amp;I and CRE businesses experienced the strongest growth in both loans and loan commitments.</p>
          <p>Loan demand is expanding beyond refinancing to include demand for new credit to finance growth for our commercial customers. Looking at the whole company, we believe the period of shrinking loans through the Great Recession has come to an end and we've returned to modest growth. We expect modest year-over-year growth in ending loan balances in 2011. Given the lower starting point for loan balances, we expect that average loans for 2011 will be comparable to average loans for 2010, even as period-end balances grow.</p>
          <p>Much of the growth we're delivering today is focused on franchise building customer relationships and accounts. These include Rewards customers and new partnerships in our Domestic Card business, Commercial Banking customers, and deposit customers and auto dealer relationships in our Consumer Banking businesses. While loan balances and revenues from these customers ramp up gradually over time, we expect the growth of these franchise building customer relationships to drive strong and sustained bottom line earnings and capital generation through sustainably lower charge-off levels, low attrition, and long annuity-like revenue streams that build gradually but stick around for years.</p>
          <p>Slide eight shows that credit results across our Consumer businesses are stabilizing at relatively strong levels and exhibiting expected seasonal patterns. Domestic Card charge-off rate improved in the quarter. About half of the improvement resulted from expected seasonal patterns, with the remaining improvement driven by strong underlying credit performance. We continue to see declining loss severity, strong credit performance in our newer vintages, and portfolio seasoning as older vintages mature. The delinquency rate as of September 30 increased from the prior quarter. The increase resulted from expected seasonal patterns and a change in the way we estimate recoveries related to our finance charge and fee reserve that Gary discussed a few moments ago. We expect that Domestic Card credit metrics will continue to follow normal seasonal patterns in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In our Consumer Banking business, charge-off rate improved in the home loans portfolio, while the delinquency rate increased modestly. In the fourth quarter, we're planning to move a portion of our mortgage loans from third-party servicers onto our own servicing platform. This move may create some noise in the fourth quarter credit metrics but shouldn't impact the underlying trends.</p>
          <p>In the Auto Finance business, charge-off rate and delinquency rate increased in the quarter, consistent with expected seasonal patterns. As you can see in the year-over-year improvements in both charge-offs and delinquencies, Auto Finance credit performance remained strong, with the most recent originations continuing to perform better than originations from 2007 and 2008. In fact, Auto Finance credit metrics are near their all-time lows, driven by the actions we took to retrench and reposition the business, tight underwriting and loss mitigation actions through the recession, and continued strength in used car auction prices. We believe we've reached the cyclical low point for Auto Finance charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Credit improvements in our Card and Auto Finance businesses have outpaced the modest and fragile economic recovery. Recent economic headlines have been full of bad news with zero job growth in August, the debt ceiling crisis and downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, continuing worries about the European debt crisis, and increasing stock market volatility. We continue to monitor our own portfolio credit performance for signs that the negative economic news is driving deterioration in credit results. We have yet to see any evidence of this.</p>
          <p>The choices we made in underwriting and managing our business through the Great Recession continue to drive strong credit performance. We made tough choices to tighten underwriting, focus on only the most resilient businesses, and aggressively manage and mitigate credit losses. As a result, our internal portfolio credit metrics remain strong, with normal seasonality reemerging after a long period of cyclical improvement.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows credit results for our Commercial Banking businesses. Non-performing asset rates improved across our Commercial Lending businesses as we continued to see slower flow rate into non-performing loans. Non-performing asset rate for the Commercial Banking segment improved in the quarter despite an uptick in the NPA rate in our runoff small ticket commercial real estate portfolio.</p>
          <p>Charge-off rates improved in the quarter for all of our Commercial businesses with the exception of the middle market C&amp;I business. The increased charge-off rate in C&amp;I was driven by one sizable credit. Charge-offs for Commercial Banking are at their lowest levels since the third quarter of 2008. Slower flow rate into NPL and stable property values are driving lower charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Commercial Banking credit metrics have stabilized and improved modestly over the last five quarters, and we believe that the worst of the commercial credit cycle is behind us. As I just discussed for our Consumer Lending businesses, we don't yet see any evidence of recent economic headlines impacting our Commercial credit results. We continue to expect some quarterly uncertainty and choppiness in our Commercial charge-offs and non-performers.</p>
          <p>I'll close this evening on slide 10. Strong third quarter results across our businesses demonstrate that we continue to emerge from the Great Recession in a strong position to win in the marketplace and continue to deliver shareholder value. Our Domestic Card business delivered another quarter of strong returns. The headwinds of installment loan runoff and elevated charge-offs continue to subside. The new account originations and purchase volumes are growing. And our new products, new partnerships, and great customer service are winning in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In Consumer Banking, our Auto Finance business continued to deliver loan growth, with strong credit and strong returns in the third quarter. And we continue to grow deposits and retail banking customer relationships. With the worst of the commercial credit cycle behind us, our Commercial Banking business delivered its third consecutive quarter of strong and steady profitability and continued loan growth. And commercial deposits and commercial customer relationships continue to grow.</p>
          <p>We remain on track to complete the ING Direct acquisition late in 2011 or early in 2012, and to complete the acquisition of the HSBC U.S. Card business in the second quarter of 2012. We expect that these acquisitions will deliver attractive financial results in the near term and enhance our ability to deliver sustained value over the long term to our customers, our communities, and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With the combination of Capital One, ING Direct, and the HSBC U.S. Card business, we're building a banking franchise that includes advantaged access to both sides of the balance sheet. Unlike other local and regional banks, we are not constrained by geography. Our strong national scale positions in credit cards and auto lending provide us with advantaged access to resilient loans with strong returns. HSBC's Card business will expand and enhance our already advantaged position in credit cards and establish Capital One as a leader in card partnerships as well.</p>
          <p>Our brand has achieved national scale and near-universal awareness. A brand is a promise. And brand strength comes from keeping that promise year after year with great products, great value, and great service.</p>
          <p>We continue to see and experience the power of advantaged local scale positions in attractive markets. Local branch scale is still, pound for pound, the most effective way to reach a broad base of commercial, small business, and consumer customers to build deep banking relationships with them. With ING Direct, we will add to our local banking capabilities to become the leading direct bank customer franchise with national reach and advantaged digital distribution capabilities in our deposit business.</p>
          <p>Our relevant scale provides us with sustainable economic advantages. For example, in our Card business, national information scale and our proven rigorous approach to credit risk underwriting have enabled us to deliver industry leading profitability with middle of the pack credit losses through good times and bad. And we expect that with the direct distribution and digital capabilities of ING Direct, we will be able to deliver sustainable economic advantages in our banking and deposit businesses as well.</p>
          <p>Capital One is already one of a handful of banks that's building a very large and loyal customer base. ING Direct has 7 million loyal early digital adopters with attractive demographics, and HSBC has 27 million active U.S. credit card accounts. So the acquisitions will strengthen and expand our combined customer base. Over time, these customer relationships are a tremendous source of value as we can expand and deepen customer relationships with new products and services.</p>
          <p>The market trends that have shaped banking and driven Capital One's strategy for the last two decades continue to play out, with banking going national one product as a time. The explosive growth in digital channels, capabilities, and access continues to fuel these trends. With the combination of Capital One, ING Direct, and HSBC's U.S. Card business, we are positioned at the forefront of where banking is going.</p>
          <p>For our shareholders, we're in an even stronger position to deliver long-term value through growth potential, strong returns, and strong capital generation. While expected runoff of several of our legacy and acquired businesses will somewhat mute loan growth rates in the near term, we can deliver solid long-term growth because of our advantaged access to both sides of the balance sheet. And our combination of businesses and the unique and valuable banking franchise we've built put us in a position to continue to deliver strong returns and capital generation.</p>
          <p>We expect that strong earnings and deep access to deposits will maintain the strength of our capital and our liquidity. Coupled with our rigorous approach to risk management, we expect our balance sheet strength will sustain our proven financial resilience and our ability to deliver shareholder value through economic cycles.</p>
          <p>With that, Gary and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Brian Foran with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You referenced normalcy now a lot. It has been four years or so since we've had to deal with normalcy now. So can you just walk us through the fine points we should look fork for, when delinquencies stop going up in the fall, how much charge-offs are expected to go up in 4Q due to normal seasonality, stuff like that? And I guess in particular, it would seem to me like the proof that the delinquency run-up has been normal seasonality would be early delinquencies should fall in November. Is that the right signpost to look for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Brian. First, so just talking about &#x2013; let me just talk generally about seasonality in the Card business, which you're really asking about. The second quarter is the seasonal low point for delinquent payments, probably because that's when income tax refunds are paid. The third quarter becomes the seasonal low point for losses as low delinquencies in the second quarter lead to low lower charge-offs in the third quarter. And just as a sidebar, by the way, auto has slightly different seasonal swings. We generally see the low point in delinquencies in the first quarter and losses in the second quarter. And auto, of course, has more pronounced seasonality than the credit card business does.</p>
          <p>I think it may be a bit of artificial science to be getting down to the month that &#x2013; we've studied delinquencies. I've been doing this 23 years, of course, and we've studied seasonality. And just when we think we finally can exactly describe precisely its effects, it tends to &#x2013; there's a fair amount of variation in it. But I think the important thing to understand is this seasonality is real in the Card business. And as we signaled last time, we expect the normal seasonality to return. And what we saw in our Card business in both the charge-off low point here and the uptick in delinquency is consistent with our own seasonal trends.</p>
          <p>We also &#x2013; one thing I've been a little struck by is our seasonality at Capital One is sometimes a little bit more pronounced than some card players are with respect to the seasonality of delinquencies. So this time, for example, with our delinquency increase, if we went back and when we normalized our own delinquency performance relative to the peers who have just announced, in fact, the delta between them is just about exactly on the average of our delta versus them with respect to what you see in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So if I pull way up, what we see at Capital One is seasonality that is exactly consistent with this huge decline in &#x2013; the huge improvement in credit basically running its course; and that now, while I don't want to declare a long period of stability, that's essentially where we are and what we see as we look out. That's essentially the word I would use. We see stability. We don't see indications of worsening, even though we read it in the paper every day. But I think our investors would be well served also to assume that the big credit improvement that has almost defied, pretty much defied the performance of the economy, most of that has run its course at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes sense. I guess for what it's worth, our data suggests your seasonality is 2x the industry almost and consistently happens one month earlier, and I'm not sure everyone gets that when they look at the data.</p>
          <p>Then I guess my follow-up, a lot of people are concerned. You're stuck in a rut of negative operating leverage, usually citing the expense numbers, but I guess there's also some concern. Even though you have great payment volume growth, your interchange is actually coming down a little bit, suggesting some pretty big Rewards numbers as well. Can you just &#x2013; how do we frame the push/pull between the expense numbers being higher than people would like versus the credit is great? You have extra earnings. Now is time to invest to produce future growth. And again, what benchmark should we look to, to get comfort that expenses are not off the rails here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Brian, it's Gary, happy to take that question from you. I would note there that your description of operating leverage, of course, we have seen our revenue moving up even without some of the one-time effects. And you did describe some of the situation with respect to revenues in Card, but you really have to take a look at the overall company when you take a look at our operating expenses.</p>
          <p>A lot of the investments that we have been making are obviously supporting not just the Card business, so a lot of new products, new product capabilities, and so forth, but also the continued build-out of our banking infrastructure. We're going to be a very significant bank and need to build the infrastructure that goes with it. Rich talked about some of the growth that you've seen in our Auto Finance and Commercial businesses and some of the investments we've been making there, geographic expansion in Auto, building out greater product capabilities for our commercial clients. We're investing across the board to find different growth opportunities and to make sure that we stay very much at the forefront of where banking is going in terms of digital capacity, customer experience, and so forth. And when you look at the overall revenue margin, you may not see positive operating leverage in every single quarter. But we're convinced that the investments that we're making are going to pay off, and you'll see that in terms of good returns over time.</p>

          <p>Hey, thanks. Just sticking with the delinquency question, I was just curious. Does the Kohl's portfolio also have an impact there in terms of roll rates given you do have a loss-sharing agreement there? If I understand it correctly, I think your delinquencies will be on the entire portfolio, but the ultimate loss will be shared. Is that right?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct, Mike, and it's unlikely to have a really significant amount of impact. Of course, you're now a couple of quarters into that business, so quarter-over-quarter change unlikely to be driven by that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And I just had a question on capital. Gary, I don't know if I heard you right in terms of $1.25 billion, if you continue to expect to have to raise that before the HSBC deal closes. And on that topic, just it has been a while since you guys talked about capital return. Obviously, you have two big deals that are pending, so maybe not the right time. But just was curious as to whether your views on that have changed at all given these two big deals that you're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've got it right, Mike, that now is not the time for us to be looking past the deals. We're very focused on doing what we need to, to get them closed and integrated. Obviously, there is some capital that we have raised and may well need to raise here for these acquisitions. But we believe that in due course, they will be highly capital generative and will be putting us in a position longer term to be able to generate capital and find ways to make sure that gets deployed in the best interest of our shareholders, which would likely over time include greater return to shareholders as well.</p>
          <p>If I could, Mike, I would just take the opportunity to indicate that we've got a lot of time here. We're a couple of quarters away from settling on HSBC as, again, Rich described. We expect to settle on the ING Direct transaction late this year or early next. It will be in the second quarter of next year for the HSBC U.S. Card business. And so it's very early for us to change our estimate about what the additional capital might be to support that transaction. Probably worth &#x2013; because there are a lot of moving parts and pieces, and we know what some of them are but we don't know what others are going to be. We still have another six months to go.</p>
          <p>So just to tick off the three big movers, so first you've got our underlying capital generation trajectory for Capital One. As I've said, that's strong and intact. You've seen it again this quarter. Next, there's going to be the impact of ING Direct on our capital. We already know what capital issuance there will be there. We've already done the forward sale of the $2 billion of equity. And of course, we have an issuance of equity pre-agreed with ING Group.</p>
          <p>Some of the elements that are in motion on the ING Direct impact is going to be purchase accounting net of the hedge position that I described earlier. That hedge was placed around the same time as we announced our estimated capital requirement for HSBC, so you can assume that we were already counting on some of the purchase accounting benefits of lower rates. And by the time we close, those could be higher; those could be lower. And so too we could see a bit of change in the non-interest rate purchase accounting effects as well as the impact of any of the other balance sheet repositioning we may undertake. I talked about some of the security sales. Even after we close ING Direct, there will be some timing and other factors that will affect the capitalization of HSBC. Obviously, we'll have updated internal capital generation estimates. We'll also update our stress scenarios to see what impact that has on our capital target and position. And of course, there will be some purchase accounting impact related to HSBC.</p>
          <p>So it will be a bit of uncertainty here over the next couple of quarters as to exactly where we land. What I would focus on with HSBC is that we believe that acquisition will be highly attractive across a wide range of outcomes with respect to the upfront capital. Once we're past that, we'll get down to the business of generating capital going forward of all of these combined businesses.</p>

          <p>Of course, we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. So just on the U.S. revenue margin, even after the accounting change, it looks like the revenue margin was almost 17%. I guess can you just maybe help us understand what's driving this? It seems like what we're all reading out there in the news is that competition is increasing, yet your metrics are improving. So is it something like a mix shift that's driving this, or is the competition really not as bad as we're reading? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ryan. So first of all, as we've stressed but just to stress it again, the revenue margin is, of course, getting a non-sustainable boost from the impacts on the decline in the fee and finance charge reserve, and I know you know that. But even when you strip out those effects &#x2013; and those effects, we always assume those effects are about coming to an end and then they've continued to have some legs to them.</p>
          <p>Even beyond that effect, the performance of revenue, and the revenue margin specifically in the Card business I think has, frankly, a little bit exceeded our own expectations, and it's not coming from a mix shift. Our mix is very stable in the business because, as we said, Ryan, while I think a lot of people changed what they did as a result of the Great Recession and the CARD Act, we're pretty much doing what we did before and on what I feel is a more level playing field and a substantially more rational competitor set. So I have many comments I can make about the Card business and specific characteristics of what's going on specifically, and maybe I'll save it for another question if people want to ask that. But generally, I think we are seeing, frankly, just a pretty strong performance of our customer base, very low attrition, and revenue strength pretty much across the board, in the face of strong competition.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I guess first on Durbin and the hoopla we have seen recently on charging for debit cards, I know it's not a big revenue stream for you. But have you evaluated or had any thoughts of changing your debit card pricing? And do you see this as an opportunity for Capital One to gain market share in banking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chris, how are you? Yes, just because that part of our business is a smaller part of overall Capital One, the Durbin Amendment is not as needle moving for us. It will though, just on a gross basis, reduce our revenue by about $70 million to $90 million, so it's not small potatoes. What we are doing is we are doing some changes in our branch bank. We have removed no-strings free checking, I guess you could call it, from our product set. But what we have done is we're going out with low monthly fees and some very reasonable hurdles to avoid them. So I think overall, it's a relatively benign change that we've done at Capital One, and I think early indications are I think a positive customer reaction I think on a relative basis.</p>
          <p>Partly to your other point though is I think there are many trends in the marketplace that I think argue for an acceleration of the move to direct banking and some of these things. So a company like ING that always represents the tradeoff between better deals but yet gosh, the switching costs associated with all the convenience of local banking, I think that in addition to the devastating macro trend of the digital revolution, the mobile revolution, some of the payment revolutions going on, I would add to that though, to where I think where your point is going, that the big noise about just how expensive banking is becoming for folks probably does play into the hands of the low-cost players.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then a follow-up, if you can talk about deposit growth you're seeing in the Commercial Bank. I think the Consumer Bank deposit growth has been good as well. But you're really starting to pick up some steam in deposit growth. And I just wondered if you could give us any color on some of the drivers there and whether or not you think it's sustainable, just given how &#x2013; I think a lot of it is macro based, but maybe it's also Capital One winning some market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the things beyond the strong macro effect is, I think it's the result of a real focus at Capital One on primary banking relationships and building. So what we've done, first of all, is we are &#x2013; so much of the growth that you see comes from really focusing on the identified areas where there are sustainable competitive advantages to be had and through the power of deep customer relationships. Now, I know in some ways that's a truism for what people pursue in banking, but we are very, very focused on this. So there's a lot of emphasis in and investment in deeper treasury management relationships, a lot of emphasis on certain commercial businesses that tend to be deposit rich. And those have gone very well as well as some of our investment in specialty banking segments.</p>
          <p>What you see though is not an anomaly. What you see is &#x2013; I think just about everything you see in Commercial &#x2013; in fact, we looked at it. I think some of the growth metrics, about two-thirds of the growth metrics that you see in Commercial, if you normalize for some of the one-time effects that happened a year ago, two-thirds of the growth metrics that you see are really sustainable across a number of metrics. And it really reflects a Commercial business that is not doing anything flashy. It's really just doing a lot of things well.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'll ask my two questions up front. I just want to make sure I understood the change in the recovery expectations for non-principal balances. I guess how did an improvement in recovery expectations actually take the delinquency rate up, and just how does that tie into charge-offs in the future? And just so I understand how that affects suppression on a go-forward basis, suppression will move up with credit eroding. I would assume so. The revenue yield all else equal should not feel the impact of suppression unless you see an associated degradation in credit quality. Am I thinking about it correctly?</p>
          <p>And then just secondarily, could you just talk about the rep and warranty increase on the liability and what was driving that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sanjay. I think you asked the questions on a lot of people's minds, so I'll try to give them a pretty fulsome answer but not go into all the gory details, as much as I'd love to, on the suppression.</p>
          <p>So let's take the first question, which is how can we be giving the good news of more collectible fees and finance charges and yet see an increase in the delinquency rate. So the first thing I'd say is what has been happening with the recoveries. As you know, recoveries of charge-off finance charge and fee balances, as with the recoveries of principal balances that were charged off, have been high for quite a while. And we expect that they'll remain that way for three reasons. First, we've got a high inventory of charged off, in this case, non-principal balances. And it's unusually high because we're in the aftermath of the Great Recession. So if things have improved very dramatically, the inventory of charge-offs is pretty high on which we can recover. Secondly, the cyclical credit improvement is raising the expected collectibility of charges and fees. And finally, this is more a structural change. We now have a structurally lower level of finance charges and fees.</p>
          <p>So if recoveries had remained pretty strong and high, what made things change this quarter? What has really changed is our assessment that almost all of these relatively high level of recoveries are coming from previously charged off non-principal balances. And that's what causes the release in our finance charge and fee reserve. It's based on existing non-principal balances. And we called it out because the proportional impact at this point was pretty high since we had already gotten to a pretty low finance charge and fee reserve balance. So an $85 million release is a little more than half of what the finance charge and fee reserve balance was.</p>
          <p>Okay, so why would this cause an uptick in the delinquency rate? It's pretty mechanical. The short answer is while we now expect that we will collect more, the increase in what we expect to collect is being added to today's delinquent balances. So what it effectively means is we're going to be increasing the numerator in the delinquency ratio, and we're going to be increasing the denominator. But because the numerator is much smaller, the addition of what we now expect to collect which is in the delinquency buckets goes up. So you have this one-time significant effect on the delinquency rate. It's always in the delinquency rate. This is why it's having a particularly big impact at this point.</p>
          <p>Now going forward, what you said, Sanjay, is very much the case. We're down to a relatively low level of finance charge and fee reserve, somewhere in the $60 million to $70 million range. We think that will be pretty stable. So suppression on a quarterly basis is probably going to reflect what's happening to the level of reversals. So it will be a lot lower than it has been historically because we're charging fewer finance charges and fees, but it should be pretty stable. If that is the case, then going forward what we'd expect is the suppression levels we've been seeing for the last year or so up until this quarter is probably what we'll see over the next several quarters, assuming that credit is more or less in line with what we expect. And to answer your question about whether this has any mechanical impact on the charge-off rate, the answer there is no. It only affected the delinquency rate. Hopefully, I made it clear why.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, what about reps and warranties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rep and warranty, thank you. So the increase in the reserve, Sanjay, which is probable and estimable, it's driven, again, largely by the level of activity that we're seeing. We did have one claim paid which affected the expense. Relatively two-thirds of the expense this quarter came from the payment of a claim rather than the increase in the reserve. And the small increase in the reserve is effectively just a reflection as we fill out all the cells in the spreadsheet. If we see increased activity among some uninsured investors, particularly in the non-GSE, non-insured securitization, or what we call our everything-else segment, even small changes in activity, we'll try and pick them up and reflect them in the reserve.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at what's going on in the environment around us as well, heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny and so forth, that's why you'll see a proportionally larger increase in what we consider to be the reasonably possible range, which doesn't meet, of course, the high standard of probable and estimable in the reserve. So I think it's a reflection of both what we have seen and what we're seeing more broadly and what that could mean over the long run and just trying to prudent around that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, in the mortgage business, our primary focus has been really absolutely dealing with some of the troubled mortgages that came through our acquisitions. And so as you can imagine, there is a big investment of infrastructure and all the things that go into that, and we're making great progress on that and I'm very pleased with that progress. Along the way, of course, we've been thinking about the mortgage business for 23 years. And it's notable in its absence from our national strategy as we've built national capabilities in some other businesses but have not been there.</p>
          <p>I think on a national basis, the mortgage business with one exception, which I'll tell you about in a second, I think still has a number of structural issues that make it not so attractive for us. The two places that we feel our advantaged mortgage origination business opportunities are, one on a national basis and one on a local. The national opportunity really relates to what ING Direct in fact has been doing with their very &#x2013; I think very well run national direct mortgage business. And we are impressed with what we see, and we plan to continue investing in that business. The other is that we continue to believe, like almost everybody in banking does, that regular old good old fashioned in-footprint mortgage origination, if not done in unnatural ways, can be a good source of moderate growth in the business. So all that adds up to a moderate mortgage origination business over time; it's not going to scare the other big players. But it has a role in our future, but it's going to be relatively more modest versus some of the really huge businesses that we have, Betsy.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. I wanted to ask you a couple questions on the Card business. One, actual account growth was very strong, as you alluded to. And we've seen that from a couple other players. Has there been a dramatic increase in demand for accounts? Is this something that the Durbin Amendment is driving as debit becomes more expensive to use? I'm just curious what's going on there. And then secondly, has there been any change to the run rates in October? Thanks &#x2013; in terms of purchase volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Craig. So first of all with respect to the Durbin effect, I think if there were a significant effect, we probably wouldn't see it yet. If we should be seeing it yet, I don't think we can with the naked eye. We'll continue to analyze for these effects. My expectation is that the Durbin effect on causing a switch between debit and credit cards, I'm still going to probably take the under on how big that effect is going to be. I've always been struck at how consumers use different parts of their brain for how they think about what they use debit cards for and what they use credit cards for. Furthermore, there are many, many banks out there that are not charging directly for debit use. So hopefully, maybe we'll find some upside surprise in that, but we're not counting on it.</p>
          <p>Demand, I think consumer demand, I'm glad you asked that point because while if you look at revolving debt growth, on a year-over-year basis it's still negative but it's trying to get toward zero. But the thing is, I think that if you look at the last couple of quarters, effectively on a seasonally adjusted basis, I think we're finally to the point where consumer revolving debt in the nation is basically flat. That's a big achievement relative to where it was. And so I think the consumer is coming back slowly but surely here.</p>
          <p>The most important thing by far with respect to new account origination for us has really been not the environment, but frankly the traction that we are getting on our own programs. All during the Great Recession, while we were dialing back on our originations, we were not dialing it back at all on our testing. And dislocation creates &#x2013; the flip side of that is opportunity. And so with all the seeds that we have planted here over the last couple years, we found some very promising growth opportunities that every month are getting a little more traction than they had the month before.</p>
          <p>So if you followed my comments to the marketplace, for most of this year I've been talking with quite a bit of passion about the feel that I have just meeting and spending all the time I do in the Card business, the feeling I have about the growing traction in the Card business. And as I've said a number of times, I think that traction is greater than you're seeing in the metrics. Because if you want to originate cards with big metric movements, do big balance transfer plays; that's instant gratification, instant volumes immediately. One minus, that is pretty much what we're doing, and so we're doing all the stuff that builds slowly and builds franchises over time. But I'm pretty excited about the traction that we're getting in the Card business. As I often say it, Craig, I think in terms of market share growth. And I think I really like our chances for market share growth. And if the consumer cooperates a little bit here, I like our chances for some real growth.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. The auto finance business, Rich, you've seen the auto finance cycles many times. And there are cycles and auto finance can be pretty pronounced. You're growing that business pretty quickly. There seems to be more competition moving in. What are your thoughts on how big you want that business to be? What is the mix of what &#x2013; are you subprime versus prime? How comfortable are you with that asset class, which has been pretty volatile, becoming a bigger part of your balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, one thing that I really want to not invest in is businesses that most of the time do pretty well. And if you just try to be smart about timing and avoid just getting whacked, you can do okay. I think that's a fool's errand in the banking business. And frankly, a lot of banks and a lot of bankers over many years have been on that errand. So our pursuit of the auto business is not driven by a belief that, most of the time, you can make money and just hang on, and the rest of the time &#x2013; and try to be smart about timing.</p>
          <p>We really like the structural characteristics of this business for us. So where is the leverage in this business? First of all, this is one of the businesses on little cat feet that has been a macro trend that I don't think people have focused on, but we entered this business in 1998 for this reason. And that is that this would be a fragmented business that would become national. It is on its course to doing that, Bob, but it still has quite a journey to have. So a business that's a fairly low growth business has a lot of opportunity for very successful national players because that's a macro trend in itself. Secondly, the leverage, especially in any area other than the absolute highest part of super-prime, there is tremendous leverage in credit and rigorous information based strategies and the scale that comes with that, which we've spent now 13 years building, and I think that's really paying off.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of this business that I think is profoundly important and something that we have certainly come to appreciate over the years of building this business, it is deeply about customer relationships, in this case the relationships with the dealers. And I know there's a perception out there of dealers just holding auctions and all this stuff. But dealers care about the value-added services and whether you're there in the downturns as well. So basically, we've had great traction, and it has shown up on J.D. Power metrics in terms of really improving dealer relationships.</p>
          <p>What has happened is when the Great Recession came along, and you may remember that we had some pretty challenging credit metrics as the Great Recession began. Auto is like in some sense the canary in the coal mine I think in terms of an early harbinger of credit. Additionally, we made a few mistakes the last time around I think in some of the expansions that we did. What we're doing now is a lot of the growth that's coming is doing the same thing we've been doing in some geographies and extending it to others. This is a business that I think can be over time quite a bit bigger than it is now. Almost all of the net growth will be in the upper part of the market because we already have a pretty sizable position in the subprime space. So I'm pretty bullish about it, and it's many years in the making and it's here to stay.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and the follow-up on the Commercial Finance business. Are you adjusting the strategy? I think you hired a team from the senior executives that used to be with Capital Source. So your middle market strategy, are you adjusting that and looking at accelerating the growth of that business with the people you're bringing in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are. I don't think relative to the size of Capital One that it's going to be massively moving the metrics. But I do want to say, I want to pull up and talk about the Commercial business. And that is that there's a lot of vanilla commercial business out there that has a rough time through cycles with all the oversupply that exists in banking, and I don't think the next downturn is going to be any different from that.</p>
          <p>Where we are focusing more and more is on the differentiated part of commercial banking, and I think that comes from very deep primary banking relationships that are driven by treasury management relationships and things like that and by very expertise driven specialty businesses. And if you think about expertise based credit management, in a sense that's what we've been building at Capital One; yes, mostly on the Consumer side. But what we're doing, still at a relatively small scale, but building out one executive at a time focusing very, very much on great talent and very rigorous credit management, specialized commercial business that I think is really much more differentiated from the vanilla thing that gets so whacked in the credit cycle.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good evening. Rich, I share your optimism around the consumer, at least as it relates to the credit card product. I would like you to maybe elaborate a little bit on some points you made earlier. You saw some pretty impressive growth on card accounts. I think you mentioned two times the 2010 third quarter pace. I'm wondering if you could give a sense as to where that growth is coming from, if it's in the more transactor based product or in the more revolver based product and how you're thinking about splitting the two. And then as a &#x2013; I guess maybe any observations you could offer around private label as an area for growth. Citibank had mentioned they have seen a significant change in consumer behavior around the private-label product and how you're thinking about that, please. And I have a follow-up as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Ken. So account growth is &#x2013; yes, first of all, given that we are avoiding the really balance heavy balance transfer type of business, almost definitionally we're going to be seeing a lot more progress on account originations than we're going to be on balance origination in that sense. And while we and no other player really gives out account origination detail on an apples-and-apples basis and all that, just suffice it to say that that's exactly the case. We're getting quite a bit more traction in account origination. And this is the beginning of the other good metrics that flow from originating these franchise-based accounts.</p>
          <p>From a mix point of view, the mix is so strikingly similar to what it has been. We're investing a lot in the &#x2013; at the &#x2013; you can see on TV we're investing a lot in the &#x2013; right at the top of the market against the leading transactor players and getting good traction with respect to account growth there. And we're also doing our normal strategy we've been done for 23 years of cherry-pick within the revolver market where the best opportunities are with respect to revenue and risk, and that continues to have account growth in a very comparable mix.</p>
          <p>With respect to the private-label business, the private-label business &#x2013; I think for a long time people thought the private-label business was going to get supplanted by the co-brand business, and I think its death has been greatly &#x2013; its demise has been greatly exaggerated. In fact to the contrary, there's more a macro trend back in the other direction. And I think retailers are finding that a well run private-label business is something that has a lot of great value and ability to really deepen customer loyalty.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure what Citi is referring to, the significant change in consumer behavior. I haven't seen any step changes in any of the metrics. The credit risk in this business has improved pretty much in lockstep with all the improvements that we've seen in other card businesses. What we're going to focus on in the private-label business &#x2013; and yes, it does represent a significant growth opportunity for us &#x2013; is still to be selective though and go after the partners who: one, have a very good sound business model in their own right; two, are very focused on &#x2013; that they have an objective function, and this is a really important point, objective function that the credit card program is not about how much money can you make, how many this or that can you do. The credit card program is about building deep customer loyalty. And when they have that objective, we want to be there as their partner. And third, we're going to be very sensitive to the auction price nature of how some these portfolios move, and we're going stay disciplined.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good evening. Gary &#x2013; and Rich, I don't know if this is a question for you. But through your accounting, you've spoken about the stability of recoveries on previously charged off accounts. I think we reached the peak in charge-offs in 2010. When should we reach the peak in recoveries? And should the slope of recoveries follow some sort of time pattern with what gross charge-offs do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, are we particularly focused on recoveries of finance charges and fees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, sir. We're focusing on &#x2013; just recoveries in general. Recoveries of principal charge-offs I thought corresponded to the same trend. And if I'm incorrect there, maybe you can articulate why it wouldn't be. I assume it's the same trend as recovering fees and finance charges because recoveries are so strong now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. It's strong for some of the reasons I described, which again, the speed of the improvements in credit has meant that there's a large quantum of charged-off debt from the charge-offs over the last couple of years. And when we recover against that, we obviously have a lower quantum today. It is exaggerated in the fee and finance charge area because relatively speaking, you've seen that we've moved. Our revenue model has gone more towards net interest margin away from some of the non-interest margin. So there's an exaggerated impact of heavy recoveries against a low amount of forward-looking finance charges and fees. Again, exactly when that settles out, again, we've seen pretty steady recoveries now for a while, but I think it's hard to know exactly when that's going to change. I think that may reflect more of the macro credit trends and statistics we see. So it's hard to call that particular top until we see how everything else plays out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think, John, to your point, even through the last quarter, recovery liquidation rates were still improving. And so look; again, we are of the view that in general, the great improvement that followed the Great Recession, the great improvement here probably means that recoveries pretty much would be stabilizing out. I'm not sure we've actually quite seen that effect yet, but we would expect it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then my follow-up question, I was wondering if you could share with us any deeper expectations for both business performance. And I guess with all the concern over credit as we're seeing a return to seasonality, what we should be thinking about with regards to the HSBC portfolio. I know you've made some comments about double-digit accretion relative to consensus estimates. But any details around that assumption for how we should be thinking about credit costs and potentially margins for HSBC would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a funny thing. The HSBC portfolio is pretty darn similar to our portfolio, even though much that's in it is different. But let me say what I'm saying. First of all, its mix along the credit spectrum is similar in the sense that it has so much of &#x2013; people sometimes think about some of the subprime branded stuff that HSBC does. It has massive prime and top-of-the-market business and some of it is partnership stuff, so bringing it on with that very similar mix to ours. They've had credit policies that are fairly similar to ours. They've had a conservatism about credit lines and pricing that's very similar to ours, which by the way is one of the reasons we did the deal because when someone has had appropriate conservatism on pricing and lines, you can deal with it. When horses are out of the barn, it's really hard to really get them back, which is why we've walked away from a number of other portfolios in the past. Revenue margins at HSBC are strong. And they're strong for Capital One, so I think things would look good there.</p>
          <p>The one thing I do want to flag is that even at the same time that we're creating quite a bit of value through the synergies and the things that we talked about when we announced the deal, I do want to say there are some parts of the HSBC business that are for them already runoff portfolios and maybe even some &#x2013; when we really get inside, there might even be some other parts that we would add to that in terms of what's a runoff. And so we will be initiating this annoying runoff portfolio headwind even at the same time I think that value creation and the growth of value creation will continue in a really sizable way with respect to this deal.</p>

          <p>Of course, we'll hear next from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wonder if you could just expand on what you were talking about with the auto business in terms of the growth and how much is attributable to that geographic expansion. Has there been some change in type of loans? Are you making more used car loans in the last year, longer terms, rates change? I guess it's also a question about competitive dynamics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So David, the growth is essentially coming in two ways. One is more up market, if you will, and more geographical expansion of exactly what we do. And much of the geographical expansion is, in fact, more up market expansion, and in a lot of cases with dealers where we were already there on the subprime side. So the thing that &#x2013; what makes me &#x2013; where I feel very confident about growth plays is when you have something that has already been validated and tested and you're rolling that out.</p>
          <p>Now classically for Capital One, that means test cells; and of course, that's what we do. We test everything and roll it out. In this particular case, what we're rolling out geographically and with respect to doing more of in the up market space is things we've been doing for an extended period of time with a very proven business and very relationship focused model. So that's why I speak with quite a bit of confidence about both the ability to continue to generate some pretty substantial origination numbers, but also very confident with respect to the performance of these.</p>
          <p>In terms of what's happening in the industry, competition is definitely increasing in the auto business. There has been &#x2013; there is some pressure to extend terms in terms of length of the loans a little bit on that, not much at all yet on the loan-to-value. But the thing that we have found is being very &#x2013; holding very firm to what we believe are the right credit standards. We found that there is continuing, a lot of continuing opportunity. But in terms of how much growth we get in the future, it's going to be the intersection of a very proven expansion play that we have and the absolutely inevitable increase in pressure competitively in the auto industry and inevitably some moves by some players to worsen credit. Net-net, it's still a pretty good environment to compete, but we're going to watch very carefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us some idea of how much the number of dealers you're working with has increased over the last 12 months? Has the mix of indirect and direct volume changed much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, while we are, by our tally, the leading direct player in the nation, our direct business is swamped by the indirect business. Because buying a car at a dealership is really a category killer, a good way to get financing. And so as you know, David, we've done everything we can to build a direct business there, and it's a nice relatively small business. So we will both grow the direct business and the indirect business. But if I were to predict, you're not going to see a massive devastating macro trend of direct taking over indirect anytime soon.</p>
          <p>You asked about used versus new. This is same mix here that we've had in the past because again, we're mostly doing the same thing that we did before. It's just that there's more growth opportunity at the top end of the credit spectrum where our share has been less and where we're growing it.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to revisit the purchase transaction volume. Historically, I know you guys have focused on driving transactors for a while, but this is the first time I think it has really outperformed relative to other Visa and MasterCard issuing peers, and I'm just wondering. Is it more the recent vintages that are performing better, or is just people are pulling their cards out and gotten &#x2013; Capital One has gotten top of wallet through marketing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, what was the first of your conditions? Is it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just which vintages have performed? Is it more recent vintages that are now transacting more versus historical, or is it more across the entire spectrum, but through marketing you guys have moved top of wallet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so first of all, I think for the industry, there has been pretty good purchase volume growth, as you know. But it is the case that for the third quarter in a row, Capital One has had the highest purchase volume growth, although for some players who have huge purchase volume numbers, we are coming off a bit of a lower base, so I think we have a bit of an easier job to do in a sense.</p>
          <p>The success is coming, Scott, from two things. One is we're investing very heavily, as frankly are Chase and AmEx in particular, in the real top-of-the-market heavy spender. And these are very expensive accounts to get, as everybody knows. When you get them, they tend to have great performance and very heavy spending patterns and they're long annuities. Anyway, you're seeing the results of a lot of hard investment by Capital One.</p>
          <p>Secondly though, this metric is actually something I would point at as in this thing where I keep saying look, I see a lot of traction at Capital One. Trust me; you'll see it in the metrics some day. This booking of accounts that are not balance transfer based but really, that build their balances over time; this is a manifestation of them starting to build their balances over time, so you do have some of that effect going on as well. But still, the biggest thing for all of us in the industry is not really anything we're doing individually here. It's the return of spending that is going on by consumers. But credit cards are getting more than their share. We are actually gaining share in purchase volume faster than retail sales are gaining because credit cards tend to be more &#x2013; the non-discretionary items tend to be purchased with a &#x2013; as consumers <mark type="ph" /> return from a (1:21:50) massive reduction in non-discretionary items and spend a bit more on that, you're seeing the share gains there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. As a quick follow-up, in the Commercial Banking segment, the loan growth was very strong this quarter. You called out I think C&amp;I and commercial real estate. Is there any regional area? Is it Metro New York that's driving it? It's the biggest part of the franchise. But in terms of growth, are you seeing any regional differences?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, one of the best ways to over-stereotype what we do, and once I tell you that, I'll say that's way too stereotyped. Why would you oversimplify like that? But in a sense, most of the CRE is in the North and most of the C&amp;I is in the South. And so when you think about growth there, New York, so let's talk C&amp;I. In many ways, it's really a story about New York. New York has certainly weathered the Great Recession quite well and has seen steady signs of recovery. And on most financial metrics from a commercial point of view, New York has been not a great performer but a better performer than a lot of the other markets out there. And so for quite a number of months, we've seen vacancy rates dropping and rental rates were getting some traction and property values strengthening and more activity by sponsors and so on.</p>
          <p>I just do want to caution though that the New York economy, certainly I think it's a plausible argument that it's going have some challenges here with respect to all the financial institutions and the job announced layoffs and stuff like that, so we're still cautious about that. The other thing I want to say with respect to CRE, a lot of our stuff is with respect to the multi-family part, which is a bit of a specialty business and one that has done quite well in the recession.</p>
          <p>With respect to C&amp;I, you're talking more in the South. For us this is &#x2013; and this is headlined by the growth in our energy business, which of course is booming at this point. But that's an oversimplification, but it will work for now.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir, and we'll take our last question from Don Fandetti with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, you talked about loan growth in Card, so I just wanted to follow up. As I look out to 2012, do you really think that there's going to be in the industry any meaningful, if any, real card loan growth? It just seems like consumer sentiment is still pretty soft. GDP numbers are not great, and you have what appears to be spending growth rates peaking. I was just curious if you think it's just going to be the main players fighting over market share, or if there's actual real growth in this business in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hard work of consumer demand in the Card business measured by revolving debt to even get back to zero, I think it feels exhausted just trying to get back to zero. So I think I'm in your camp. If I had to guess, I think this business is a GDP type of business or maybe even a little less than that in the near term. I see little to suggest that this thing would break away from the pack very much. I think the consumer delevering has been absolutely real. And by the way, it has been a very good thing, so we should all be careful of what we wish for from a bank in the sense of the delevering has had a lot of benefits with respect to credit quality.</p>
          <p>But there are parts of the market that are not returning. The credit card market as a whole is smaller as a result of the regulations that are there. That's something that still has to run its course with respect to the outstandings. The consumer, while maybe they're deleveraging, is reaching a stable point. I certainly don't see any evidence that it's returning. So I subscribe to your view. We should view this as a low growth business from an outstandings point of view. Where is there opportunity? There's opportunity to gain share. There's opportunity and there's a lot of opportunity to create real value, though, and real growth in value through the fact that at times like this, if you originate well, you can get sometimes spectacular credit performance. You can get a chance to build these annuities that last a long, long time.</p>
          <p>And so I would characterize the card market right now competitively as while you look at mail volume, mail volume is returning dangerously close to where it used to be. And by the way, that doesn't even show that a lot of the marketing has moved to the Internet. So in a way, it understates the return of marketing. I do think while our competitors are being very tough, at least they're being rational. And I think there's a lot of value, a lot of opportunity to create real value.</p>
          <p>And my last thing I would leave with you is there is the acid test as I would look at it. The total net present value that we feel that we estimate that we're originating in, we look at that every year, the annual tranche of originations, how much total NPV is being created. The origination vintage of this year I think is going to give a run for its money to some of our best years that we've had in the last decade.
