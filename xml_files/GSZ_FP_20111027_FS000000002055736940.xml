        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet. I am delighted to welcome you to this conference call, and I take also this opportunity to introduce Isabelle Kocher with me, our new CFO. We have decided to invite you this morning to this conference call to disclose our nine months results, to update you on some recent developments, to give you some trends on full year results, and of course to give you the opportunity to ask your questions.</p>
          <p>In general, we have decided from now on to have more interactions, more contacts, more dialogue with financial markets, adding regular conference calls for quarterly results or for specific news flows on the Group.</p>
          <p>So first let's have a look at our key figures. The nine months results confirm the robust performance we have delivered in the first half. The revenues are above &#x20AC;65 billion, growing up 8.9% compared to the same period in 2010.</p>
          <p>EBITDA is at &#x20AC;12.1 billion, up by 10.2%, and comparable to last year on an orderly basis despite a negative impact of around &#x20AC;700 million compared to last year due to exceptional unfavorable weather conditions and this difference of &#x20AC;700 million can be explained by minus &#x20AC;480 million from year-to-date 2011 versus plus &#x20AC;220 million for the same period in 2010 compared in the two situations compared to average weather conditions. So the winter has been very cold in 2010 and very hot in 2011.</p>
          <p>These results allow us to confirm our target for the full year, namely EBITDA between &#x20AC;17 billion and &#x20AC;17.5 billion, with average weather conditions and no significant regulatory changes. As of September the 30th, we estimate the negative impact on the 2011 EBITDA of the climate in France and Belgium at &#x20AC;480 million as I said, and the impact of the tariff freeze decided by the French Government will be close to &#x20AC;400 million for the totality of the year 2011 on EBITDA. It's around &#x20AC;70 million for Q1, zero for Q2, &#x20AC;35 million for Q3 and &#x20AC;290 million for Q4.</p>
          <p>Taking into account both effects, regulation and climate, applied to the initial range &#x20AC;17million, &#x20AC;17.5 million, the EBITDA range for 2011 would therefore stand between &#x20AC;16.1 billion and &#x20AC;16.6 billion. That's simply arithmetics.</p>
          <p>We are fully committed to continuing our effective shareholder return with a stable growing dividend in 2011 and to continue our &#x20AC;500 million share buyback program, of which &#x20AC;137 million has been realized as of the end of September. I would like to reaffirm this morning the priority that the Group gives to shareholders' returns and dividend.</p>
          <p>I also like to remind you that yesterday the Board has decided that an &#x20AC;0.83 per share interim dividend will be paid out on November 15 and that the total dividend will be decided at the shareholders' meeting on April 23, 2012.</p>
          <p>We are also aiming at maintaining our A rating, which is a strategic objective confirmed by the amounts achieved as of September the 30th. Net debt amounts to &#x20AC;41.7 billion implying a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.5 in line with our guidance. Before Isabelle comes back in detail on the business financial performances, I would like to address three important issues: the situation in France for gas tariff, the situation in Belgium for the nuclear tax, and also the CapEx program.</p>
          <p>So first, in France, the decision of the government to freeze the gas tariffs for the individuals clearly does not respect the law. On October 30, we have filed an appeal against this decision with the State Council. We have noted with interest that our competitors like Direct Energie, Poweo and others have recently filed emergency request for the same reason.</p>
          <p>For its part, the French Energy Regulation Commission, the regulator, has always requested a pass through of costs in the respect of the law and has mentioned that the prolonged tariff freeze was disrupting the market.</p>
          <p>We also have made proposals to the regulator with only one objective to reflect our supply costs on top of the agreed commercial margin, which is &#x20AC;300 million per year. We are ready to establish a new formula taking into account the results of our ongoing discussions with gas suppliers for the future results of these discussions. Let me remind you that we are working with our suppliers to improve the competitiveness of our contracts. Price revisions are ongoing, and we will be in a position to tell you more about the results during our full-year presentation.</p>
          <p>Now Belgium, as you know, in October 2009, we signed a broad agreement with the Belgian State, by interlocutor was Mr. Van Rompuy, the Prime Minister. This agreement, including the ten-year life extension of three nuclear reactors and also tax in a range between &#x20AC;215 million and &#x20AC;245 million for the all the nuclear power producers between 2010 and 2014.</p>
          <p>In this agreement, GDF SUEZ also undertakes to prepare a &#x20AC;500 million program of investments in renewable energies via Electrabel, to recruit over 10,000 staff in Belgium by 2015, to gradually create a permanent body of 500 training positions by 2015, and also continue to invest in research in Belgium.</p>
          <p>So we consider that this agreement is always valid. If the Belgian state does not respect this agreement, the Group will contest the decision by every legal means, including the international arbitration agreements to which the Belgian state has signed up and which protects investments made in Belgium.</p>
          <p>In case of review of these commitments, GDF SUEZ would also reexamine the investment strategy in Belgium, and in particular its readiness to extend the lifetime of the three oldest plants, Doel 1 and 2 and Tihange 1, given the substantial investments needed. We will obviously only decide these investments if we get a fair return on the business.</p>
          <p>As a protective measure, the Group has already taken a legal action in order to recover the amounts already paid in 2008, 2009 and 2010 that were imposed to the nuclear sector by the government.</p>
          <p>Let me also take this opportunity to update you on the stress tests, which are of course part of this reflection and we are aware that the government could decide only to extend the lifetime of the nuclear reactor after the end of this stress test period. A first progress report has been sent on August 15 to the government made by Electrabel, and the final report will be sent to Belgian safety authorities by end of October as planned.</p>
          <p>But more globally, we have decided that we will reassess our nuclear strategy of GDF SUEZ, not only in Belgium but for the whole Group, once the stress tests results are known, and therefore, in mid 2012, we will reassess and review the nuclear strategy of the Group.</p>
          <p>Now, let's focus on our recent developments. In Brazil, the river deviation in the Jirau hydro project has been successfully completed and the phased commissioning of units is due to start in H2 2012. As announced in August, the project is being expanded with six additional units to a total of 50 that will take the capacity, the total capacity of the project to 3,750 megawatt.</p>
          <p>In E&amp;P, we had announced extremely promising results in exploration on the Absheron license in Azerbaijan.</p>
          <p>In Services, Cofely has recently won five biomass projects in the latest call for tenders from the French Ecology and Energy Ministries. You have also perhaps noted that we have made no proposal for the EDP in Portugal privatization.</p>
          <p>We are performing well on our CapEx program with &#x20AC;7.6 billion spent at the end of September, and our recently commissioned projects are delivering as expected.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Isabelle Kocher, who will cover our figures in more detail. Isabelle?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard, and good morning, everybody. I am very pleased to be here today and to present our solid financial performance.</p>
          <p>Our operating performance first, it has been very strong since revenues increased by nearly 9% compared to the same period last year to reach &#x20AC;65.4 billion, that is to say accelerating versus first half results growth, which was 7.9%, accelerating thanks to the development of our international activities, to our E&amp;P business and to LNG sales and despite the unfavorable weather conditions in our domestic markets.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew by more than 10% to &#x20AC;12.1 billion, also showing an acceleration versus first half results. The growth was 8.2% on the first half. So in addition to the revenue elements given in the press release issued this morning, let me now give you more insight on profitability trends by business lines.</p>
          <p>Energy France first, the results were adversely affected, as you know, by exceptional climate conditions, mostly in H1, and affected also by the non-application of the tariff formula. At the same time, power generation activity benefited from the full effect of the commissioning of new CCGTs. As announced in August, the full year EBITDA should be around &#x20AC;500 million assuming average weather conditions for the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Energy Europe &amp; International results were up, benefiting from good performances in Latin America with higher average power sales price in Brazil, good performances in LNG and in retail businesses in North America and in Asia. Growth is also coming from the commissioning of new electricity capacity in Brazil, in Chile, in Panama and in Thailand. At the same time, Benelux, Germany and Europe results are resilient if we take into account non-recurring positive impacts totaling &#x20AC;180 million last year in 2010.</p>
          <p>Global Gas &amp; LNG results benefited from an increase in E&amp;P production and higher commodity prices. E&amp;P production is on track with our expectation for full year at 60 million barrels oil equivalent, mainly thanks to Gj&#xF8;a. The LNG business is performing well. And overall, Global Gas &amp; LNG 2000 &#x2013; sorry, 2011 EBITDA should edge up on 2010.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure results now, they are affected by the unfavorable weather impact and negative impact partly offset by the positive effect of the full commissioning of Fos Cavaou. So assuming average weather conditions for the last quarter, EBITDA should end at around &#x20AC;3.1 billion taking into account the contribution of the acquisition of gas storage facilities in Germany for around &#x20AC;30 million for four months.</p>
          <p>Energy services results are growing in all businesses, and full-year EBTIDA should reach roughly &#x20AC;1 billion, in line with the previous announcement.</p>
          <p>As Jean-Marc Boursier told you yesterday, Suez Environment had a good operational performance despite some difficulties in Melbourne.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, as G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet has already pointed out, we confirm our 2011 EBTIDA guidance assuming average weather conditions for the full year and no regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>I would like now to focus on the bottom line of our P&amp;L. On a full-year basis, depreciation and provisions should be around &#x20AC;7 billion, increasing by around &#x20AC;1.1 billion including International Power's PPA amortization which should amount to roughly &#x20AC;200 million, including &#x20AC;150 million negative one-off.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio optimization program stands now at &#x20AC;6.6 billion, including Bristol Water. We announced the disposal of Bristol Water last month. So we expect that these transactions will bring capital gains of approximately &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>The financial result should amount to roughly &#x20AC;2.4 billion for the full year, illustrating the financial synergies generated by the IP acquisition since pro forma 2010 financial result stood at &#x20AC;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Adjusted income tax should be around 35% on a full year basis, including the &#x20AC;212 million nuclear contribution in Belgium. The slight increase of the level of taxation reflects the increase of E&amp;P profitability. Associates should be at &#x20AC;0.4 billion, and minority interests should be around &#x20AC;1.6 billion at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, a few words on our financial structure. As G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet told you before, our net debt stands at &#x20AC;41.7 billion as of September 30. Since that date, we have closed the disposals of Rete Gas in Italy and of Bristol Water in the UK with a global impact of these two transactions for &#x20AC;1.1 billion. So we still have to close the sale of Elgin Franklin, the deal with CIC on E&amp;P and the disposal of Atlantic LNG before year end.</p>
          <p>At the end of September, the Group's liquidity is excellent at &#x20AC;22.9 billion, of which &#x20AC;13.9 billion in net cash. And at the same time, the average net debt maturity is high over 10 years. So the financial structure of the Group is very strong.</p>

          <p>Before answering your questions together with Isabelle, I would like to remind you of the strengths of the Group. First, the growth of the Group in international markets in gas market, power market, water and energy services, the growths which offsets the increase of the regulatory risk in our domestic markets, essentially France and Belgium.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the very good performance of our Global Gas &amp; LNG businesses with sustained demand in Asian markets. We will announce a new deal in LNG with a Chinese partner next week.</p>
          <p>Third, our CapEx program progressing well and delivering the anticipated EBITDA growth. Our strong financial structure, which will allow us to deliver our dividend policy even in the current environment. And finally, the confirmation of our 2011 guidance with the announced assumptions.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I will be very pleased to also to talk to you again on the December the 9th for our Investor Day in Paris. This will allow us to give you more information of our industrial development potential. On the day before, on Thursday, the 8th December, we will be pleased to host investors and analysts for a cocktail dinner and to take this opportunity to offer you the chance to talk informally with our management team.</p>
          <p>And then as you probably know, our annual results for the full year 2011 will be released on February the 9th, almost one month in advance compared to last year.</p>
