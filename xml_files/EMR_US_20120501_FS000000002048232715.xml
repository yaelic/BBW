          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 1, 2012.</p>
          <p>Emerson's commentary and responses to questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Vince. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2012 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter, as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation.</p>
          <p>Second quarter sales increased slightly to $5.9 billion, with mixed results across businesses and geographies. Underlying sales were up 2%, led by strong recovery from the Thailand flooding supply chain disruption in Process Management. Climate Technologies had another difficult quarter, but a recovery appears underway in the U.S. and China.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points from the prior year and expanded 80 basis points from the first quarter. Operating profit margin of 16.5% increased 330 basis points from the first quarter, which was a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior-year quarter. Earnings per share of $0.74 increased 48% from the first quarter and 1% from the prior year. After robust sequential profitability improvement in the quarter, Emerson's well positioned for a strong second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Next slide P&amp;L summary. Net sales increased 1%; underlying sales increased 2% despite continued product line rationalization in the embedded computing and power business. Operating profit decreased 1%, as volume deleverage, unfavorable product mix and other cost increases exceeded cost reductions and price increases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for $84 million in the quarter and earnings per share increased 1%.</p>
          <p>Next slide underlying sales by geography. Underlying sales in the U.S. grew 3%; Europe decreased 4%; Asia grew 2%, with China down 4%; Latin America grew 11%; Canada grew 10%; and the Middle East and Africa was up 5%. Total underlying sales increased 2%, currency translation deducted 1%, with total net sales growing 1%. We expect Europe to remain weak in the second half, while order trends suggest China sales will improve.</p>
          <p>Next slide, profitability detail. Gross profit margin of 39.5% expanded 10 basis points as cost reduction benefits and price increases offset unfavorable product mix and other costs. Price/cost was favorable in the quarter. Operating profit margin of 16.5% decreased 40 basis points from the prior year and expanded 330 basis points sequentially. Net other deductions reflected higher restructuring and lower gains, partially offset by lower FX losses and amortization. Pre-tax earnings declined 2%.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 6, cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow decreased 25% on lower earnings and higher investment and working capital to support second half growth. Capital expenditures increased 25%, reflecting investments in technology, growth programs and capacity. On the balance sheet, inventory peaked in February and is expected to continue to decline.</p>
          <p>Next slide, business segment earnings. Business segment margin of 15.3% decreased 20 basis points from the prior year and expanded 260 basis points from the first quarter. Corporate expense increased $19 million, primarily due to the gain from the Fisher Sanmar JV buyout in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 8, Process Management results. Process Management net sales grew 13% and underlying sales grew 14% as currency translation deducted 1%. By region, the U.S. was up 24%, Asia was up 10%, Europe was up 4%, Latin America was up 33%, and Middle East and Africa was up 5%. Strong demand in oil and gas and chemical end markets continued in the quarter with underlying orders up 18%. Segment margin of 18.3% improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 590 basis points from the first quarter as volume leverage and cost reduction benefits offset unfavorable product mix and other cost increases.</p>
          <p>Delayed sales from the supply chain disruption should be recovered by the end of calendar year 2012 as we balance recovering the sales with ensuring product quality is not compromised. Acceleration of backlog conversion and continued strength in new orders will drive sales in the second half.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net sales declined 2%, and underlying sales declined 1%, as currency translation deducted 1%. By region, the U.S. and Asia declined 1%, Europe was flat, Latin America decreased 5%, and Middle East and Africa grew 14%. Electrical distribution and ultrasonic welding businesses reflected strong growth and demand in the global power generating alternators business remains at a high level. The electrical drives, fluid automation, and HVAC related hermetic motors businesses were weak, and solar and wind energy end markets remained challenging as well.</p>
          <p>Segment margin of 15.8% declined 20 basis points from the prior year, as volume deleverage and materials cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and cost reduction benefits. Price/cost was favorable, and margin improved 100 basis points sequentially as restructuring benefits have started to flow through. Europe's softness will persist into the second half of 2012, but capital goods and markets should remain stable in other regions.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 10, Network Power. Network Power net sales declined 4%, and underlying sales declined 3% as currency translation deducted 1%. Geographically, the U.S. was down 4%, Asia was up 3%, Europe and Latin America decreased 13%, and Middle East and Africa was down 3%.</p>
          <p>Telecommunications and IT end markets remained weak, but second half improvement is expected. The global data center business was up, with strong growth in the U.S. and solid growth in Asia. Europe pressure continued.</p>
          <p>Segment margin of 8.6% declined 70 basis points from prior year as volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, and higher restructuring was partially offset by cost reduction benefits and materials cost decreases.</p>
          <p>Embedded computing and power business returned to profitability, and Network Power systems expanded margin from the prior year. Sequential margin improved 40 basis points despite increased restructuring, continued end market weakness, and aggressive product line rationalization.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies' net and underlying sales decreased 9%, with the U.S. down 11%, Asia down 9%, Europe down 12%, Latin America up 25%, and Middle East and Africa down 3%. U.S. residential end markets were weak, but growth in commercial and refrigeration markets was solid. China was soft, but other Asia sales growth was robust. Economic conditions remained challenging in Europe.</p>
          <p>Segment margin of 17.1% declined 130 basis points from the prior year, as volume deleverage and material cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and cost reduction benefits. Price/cost was favorable, but not enough to maintain margin. U.S. and China markets appear to have bottomed and should improve in the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 12, Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions net sales grew 4% and underlying sales grew 8%, as the divestiture of the heating products business in 2011 deducted 4%. By region, the U.S. increased 8%, Asia grew 3%, Europe was down 3%, Latin America grew 25%, and Middle East and Africa grew 85%.</p>
          <p>Commercial construction in the U.S. drove demand across this segment with very strong growth in the storage businesses. Segment margin of 21.0% improved 90 basis points from the prior year, as price increases, volume leverage and cost reduction benefits offset higher materials and other cost increases. Price cost was favorable and aggressive restructuring programs over the past two years are paying off. Growth should remain solid in the second half of 2012, as U.S. residential end markets improve.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 13, the 2012 outlook, the significant sequential improvement in the second quarter supports our expectations for record sales, profitability and earnings per share in 2012. Recovery of HVAC and telecommunications end markets remains likely, but the pace of improvement is occurring slower than planned.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. economic growth is positive, but is anemic compared to past recoveries and Europe remains weak and has no economic momentum. China, while stabilized and strengthening has been softer than expected as well.</p>
          <p>Based on current economic conditions, our revised 2012 outlook is as follows. Underlying sales and orders growth 3% to 5%, reported sales and orders growth 2% to 4%, operating profit margin 17.5% to 17.8%, and pre-tax earnings margin 15.0% to 15.3%. Restructuring expense approximately $125 million, tax rate approximately 32%, earnings per share $3.35 to $3.50, operating cash flow $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, and capital expenditures approximately $700 million.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to David Farr.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pat. Thank you everybody for joining us today. I appreciate that. First I would like to say that on behalf of the OCE and myself and the business leadership we are clearly not very happy or pleased with our first six months of this year. We've had to fight, as you all know, several both internal and external issues as we've gone through first six months and yet the second quarter results were not as strong as our expectations just three months ago. The first issue I would say looking at it, Emerson Process Management, we have begun a recovery. The order pace has been very strong. We have actually added to our shortfall relative to what we built in the first quarter from the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:36) in the supply chain, another $50 million, primarily because in the month end of February, early March we had to put several of our businesses back on hold as the supply chain basically had some quality issues that we refused to ship and we had to deal with those. By the end of the month and as we've gone through the whole month of April we're back up and running full out and we will recover as we look at it right now, we will recover the sales which is approximate $300 million that we missed in the first half of this year. Most of that will be recovered by the end of this fiscal year and we should recover the remaining part of that by the end of this calendar year. The key issue for me is we will not ship and create quality issues out there. So we're going to make sure that we maintain the highest quality and integrity of the product, but we are running at very high levels right now and should see a very strong third quarter.</p>
          <p>Just coming back from Europe and China, our European business has continued to weaken. Other than process business, I see continued weakness in Europe and I see no momentum. In fact, I see continued deterioration in the core marketplace, until we see some action I would say in the marketplace relative to the governments trying to get some economic growth back into Europe. But we've been looking at recession all year. The recession I think is a little bit deeper now and continues to impact us across our business space.</p>
          <p>In particular in some of our export business, which &#x2013; some of it would have been going into Asia and other parts of the world, that business is also very weak. China has had a very difficult first six months. We do expect that to recover. However, I do not do see it to be the same strength as we've seen in previous years. And Brazil has also slid back a little bit this quarter and has actually had a weak second quarter, though it should start turning around as the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:27) business starts shipping.</p>
          <p>And there has been no recovery at all in the Climate Technologies business in the second quarter. We did anticipate a little bit of recovery. We are now starting to see the order pace come back from North America. I'll comment further on that in a few minutes, but still for the last nine months this business has really struggled and hurt us both at the top line and at the profitability line as we've had to manage that cost structure with volumes being as low as they have been for the last nine months. But we did make progress on the positive side going from Q1 to Q2, not as much progress as we wanted, not as much progress as we expected, but we did make progress. The big issue that we face here I think in the next 6 to 12 months is the global economy continues to slide &#x2013; slide a little bit downwards, a little bit weaker. The U.S. economy is holding in at what I call very moderate growth; maybe 2%, 2.5%, and certain segments are not seeing much growth, but the U.S. economy is growing. It is the global engine of growth right now, and I don't see the rest of world coming back too much in the second half; some recovery in a couple of markets, but much weaker international growth than we have seen in the last several years; in particular, Europe, China, and Brazil, with some recovery in China and Brazil, but very, very little recovery, if any recovery, in fact I expect negative growth in Europe outside of Process in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, as we look at the business pace today, Process Management orders have continued to be strong. Their shipping has continued to ramp up. They are making excellent progress, and we have continued to make progress relative to the quality and a global supply chain, and I feel much better where we are today than just 45 days ago.</p>
          <p>Industrial Automation is starting to see some of its core markets recover a little bit after &#x2013; last year the Industrial Automation was up extremely strong; 20% to 30%. We were ahead of the recovery and now the order pattern has stabilized, and I think the order pattern is starting to give us a little bit of growth in the second half of the year, in particular, in the North America &#x2013; in Americas and in Asia Pacific, in particular China; and we're seeing that. I see no recovery in Europe in Industrial Automation.</p>
          <p>The Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions continues to grow nicely. The residential numbers and non-residential numbers in the U.S. continue to support that, and I expect that will continue for the second half of this year as those numbers continue to firm.</p>
          <p>Climate Technology which has had a very difficult nine months will start seeing &#x2013; and we are starting to see some recovery. I personally believe the recovery will not be as strong as you expect. After nine &#x2013; nine very difficult months, I believe the marketplace only have so much growth in it right now, I think people are going to be very cautious, though we do see the recovery but it's not going to be anywhere close to the type of recovery you would expect after being down as where they are. But the recovery is happening. I would expect recovery in Climate both in U.S. and in China, which we're already seeing for the last 45 days. So, that part are very positive.</p>
          <p>From my perspective, I expect the Network Power Systems will continue to make progress; they did &#x2013; they made progress this quarter. North America; our data center business was good, our Asia data center business was good, our European data center business was not good, and that markets driven primarily because of the weak European economy.</p>
          <p>The embedded power and computing continues to make progress in the turnaround. They went from a breakeven loss position in the first quarter to making money. The pruning continues. It's our estimate it's around $25 million in each of the quarters. It's the best way that that's what we can give at this point in time, but they are continuing to make progress. They've got control of the &#x2013; I would say the order and sales pattern right now and the profitability has continued to improve and will continue to improve in the second half.</p>
          <p>As we look at it right now, our orders, our current backlog, the recovery within Emerson Process Management which has begun quite strongly, and has continued well in April will continue. We are looking at around two $7 billion quarters, and relative to delivering our profitability in the second half of the year, we need incremental profitability of basically 40%. We just delivered 45% in the second quarter, so we're looking at much higher sales volume, around 40% incremental profitability.</p>
          <p>The company is geared up to that. I believe that we have the capacity right now. We have the capability. And there's obviously issues coming out, it's around the world; but I feel we have based on the new underlying sales growth of 3% to 5% because of the weaker Europe and China. And the profitability base-through &#x2013; flow-through in our cost structure and the restructuring efforts underway which will continue to be positive. I think we have this well and focused where we think the year is going to be at this point in time both from an earnings standpoint, underlying growth standpoint, and a margin standpoint. I feel we've gone through this in great detail as closed out the quarter looking at the plusses and minuses and looking at the momentum through April. So I feel after reviewing this report today that we have this pretty well boxed in and focused at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Again, I want to say that myself and the OCE and the business leaders are not pleased with the results in the first six months. No one's happy. We do not like to hurt our shareholder base. We take our shareholders base very seriously and we take this company very seriously and the performance of this company very seriously.</p>
          <p>We did have good improvement in the second quarter, but it wasn't as strong as we wanted, and we will continue to improve as we go into this third quarter and we already see it in the month of April.</p>
          <p>Relative to our cash management, we are online to generate somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow. From my perspective, the inventory performance is actually improving. We're sitting at pretty close to record levels of days on hand already. The inventory dollars are starting to climb or reduce, so that's good news. And we have from our standpoint the rest of asset management in pretty good shape.</p>
          <p>Payables will continue to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:40) to get weaker, because we are cutting inventory and we're actually starting cutting spending, and we have been cutting spending both in capital: one, for, I see a weaker global economy; and two, to make sure we keep our costs in line with the uncertainty of what's going to come at us in early 2013, both in Europe with very little recovery in sight, I think China will continue to weaken, and the uncertainty of North America with what potentially could hit all of those companies here in the U.S. with uncertainty relative to the fiscal and monetary policies coming out of Washington.</p>
          <p>Capital spending will continue to be a little bit under $700 million or around $700 million in that range right there. So, pretty much from the standpoint where we sit right now, we see what we have to get done. I feel confident the business leaders, the OCE feel confident we will deliver the second half, again after a very challenging first half, but we have things in line, things in order where we need to be at this point in time and we know exactly what has to be done from restructuring, from shipments, delivery backlog, getting inventory down and the cash management. And from the standpoint of Emerson executives, we know what has to be done and I feel confident they'll get it done.</p>
          <p>So again, I want to apologize for the questionable results in the first half of this year and I look forward to answering some of the questions and comments coming at us here in the phone.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll open the line. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just start off with question around the extra costs you actually had in the quarter on the supply chain and inefficiencies that how much was there really in that result? And how much do you expect going forward? So, in terms of expediting airfreight, line ramps things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try... it's a number we have, I don't have it on the fingertips of my hand, but I would frankly what I say that, about $35 million...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...around $35 million. So between $30 million and $40 million in the quarter. Oh, it's more than that. I'm sorry, it's about $12 million for the second quarter, I apologize. And about &#x2013; what's the number there in the first quarter? Frank's here showing me the numbers. And about $5 million. So it's around &#x2013; I'd say around $40 million for the whole year. Therefore, we're going to be running around $10 million, $11 million for the second half of the year per quarter. We'll be eating that cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So $10 million or $11 million run rate for the next two. And then presumably, you're saying then you're finished at that point, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, based on the fact that we put some things on hold, I mean, there is no way I was going to allow quality problems. We already hurt our customers once; I'm not going to hurt them twice. And so, I would say that we'll probably have that &#x2013; probably somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the fourth calendar quarter, too. It'll take us all way out to this calendar year to get this done. It's pretty even now. We're going to get the biggest chunk out in the first &#x2013; or the third and fourth, and we'll get some left over in the first fiscal quarter next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question is on the underlying core growth assumptions that you've talked about. My math tells me somewhere between 6.5% to 10% implied underlying growth for the second half to hit the 3% to 5% for the full year. So I'm not sure how close that is to what you're thinking, but if that's true, that's telling me I've got to have or you've got to have a pretty big pick-up in Climate, in Network; PM has got to continue growing strongly, and IA has got to be positive, I think. So, how are &#x2013; maybe you could just walk through your expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Frank, do you have &#x2013; you've got your charts there? Where's the number? I'll get the number here. I'm looking at underlying sales chart from today's board meeting &#x2013; right there. Give me one second here, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You're approximately right. It's going to probably be somewhere between &#x2013; it's going to average between 6% and 8%, depending which quarter. So one quarter it's going to be probably 7%, one quarter it'd be about 8%; something like that. I mean that's our current expectations; let's say 6% to 8% per quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And across the business units, what &#x2013; how you're sort of thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The big drivers are going to be, from our standpoint, you have Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions has been averaging about 7% in the first half of this year. Climate Technologies does go positive, and we see the order pace to have it go positive. I'm a little bit concerned about how fast and how sustainable, so and you're looking at mid-single digits here from my perspective. Industrial Automation is going to be low to mid-single digit. Network Power will actually stabilize and be in that mid 5%, 6%, 7% type of range and Process is going to be obviously very strong in the second half of the year, above where it was in the second quarter. So, I mean, in the second quarter it's around 14%, so it's going to be above that. It's going to be somewhere 15% and 20% somewhere in that range there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess I'll sneak one last one in, is just thinking about the last 60-plus days, and what is it that sort of &#x2013; what's been the most surprising to you both on your internal information flow and externally, if you think about where you sat then and where you're sitting now, that's sort of changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I &#x2013; from my perspective there's two things that happened. One, I did not plan to have to shut down some of my Process business again for a quality board. We moved a lot of boards, and the boards that go into some of the instrumentation businesses, and when I moved that board we had a very strict quality control on it, and unfortunately we had some time there that we &#x2013; they were producing bad boards, and I did not anticipate that, unfortunately. We've got that corrected, but when you move that many boards that quickly, one would have to expect that, but that hurt us. That was a surprise to us internally.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I did actually expect to see more &#x2013; I actually saw &#x2013; expected to see some recovery in the month of March. And typically, this industry has always built a little bit ahead of time, but there's been no build at all. In fact there's continued to be liquidation almost all the way up to the end. And so we're obviously operating in a different norm now. We're basically going to be operating as orders, book and go. I mean there's not going to be any build at all in this industry and the climate industry around the world.</p>
          <p>So those are the two different things really impact us in the second quarter, and that's where we are. It's just a fact of life that Climate business has had a very difficult year, and you would expect that with the consumer spending that we'd see more business spending in the climate area, which we have not seen. And now we're starting to see, some but the automotive &#x2013; if you look at what was reported in the second quarter, half the U.S. GDP was automotive sales, aka not housing or air conditioning for housing.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Dave, in embedded power, back in February you talked about launching a fix or exit strategy and hoping you could give us an update. We saw on the slide comments about aggressive product line rationalization, but any color in terms of where you are in that evaluation would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no change. The strategy right now is, we are on an aggressive restructuring fix-it business and that's where we are at this point in time, and there will be nothing other than that focused internally and with that operation. And so there's nothing new to add there at this point in time. The key thing for me is to fix this business, and I saw progress in the quarter, which is a positive, and I expect to see continued progress here, as we move into this quarter here. And so I &#x2013; we will start seeing a better result within that business, as we get into this quarter. That's where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then on the Process side, the recovery out of Thailand was &#x2013; just to clarify, has there been any cancellations of size in that backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In fact, our backlog and order pace has continued to be very strong. We've been working with our customers. We're spending an extraordinary amount of money to make sure we support our customers and shift stuff around and expedite. It's really difficult. Even though we have an estimate of like $35 million, $40 million for the year, of cost of doing this, it's really hard to estimate that. So the key issue to me is &#x2013; and that's why we put the word out very clearly, any question on quality you shut it down and confirm it, because you do not want to have two hiccups here, and we have not had any. And from my perspective that's very important in our backlog, and support happens to be very strong at this point in time. So we've got to keep executing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last question for me. On China you had talked earlier about an expectation of a soft landing, but then perhaps a reinvestment by the government in the second half. Are you seeing any of that? There's been some discussion about some investment in non-res and energy. Be interested if you're seeing it and how you might be positioned for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing some improvement in business environment spending right now, Deane. It's not nearly the type of recovery that we had seen historically when they turned this on. I think there's still lot of issues relative to the government, there's lot of issues internally going on in that country right now. And so from, I think, from the perspective of how much money can be reinvested and try to revitalize a weaker economy, I've not seen the magnitude of investments. Though we are seeing from an Industrial Automation, the Process standpoint, the Climate standpoint, the Network Power standpoint, the orders for the last 45 days and continued this month have been good. So I do anticipate a stronger second half, though I do not see the same second half that you would normally expect in the type of mode that we would see from a recovery standpoint in China. So, it's better, it's still growing, but it's not going to be anywhere close to what I thought it would be. Another reason to be taking the underlying sales down. I can't bank on this at this point at in time.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean we see that. We do see that benefit right now in the Process and also in the Climate area. So, the answer is yes. But it's not going to be &#x2013; the investment that's going in is not anywhere close to the magnitude of investments that we've seen historically.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julie Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Julian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. Yeah, I guess the first question is really on the incremental margins. I mean, you mentioned sequentially those were about 45% in the March quarter. That was a similar run rate sort of incrementally and decrementally in the prior two. So I guess if we think about the June and September quarters you're guiding for that to be about 40%. When you look at the next two quarters versus what you have seen in March, just looking at Page 3 of your slide, I mean you called out a bunch of factors there around the operating profit line. I guess volume deleverage we know goes away from the order book. Other cost increases you've already quantified that around $10 million, $11 million a quarter so there's no big change there. Cost reductions; those are sort of in the bag from prior restructuring. So, I guess the two things that are left unfavorable product mix and the price increases. So, could you talk a little bit about those two points, and how you think they're going to affect the second half versus the others that you just had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our price increases, and there're certain businesses we have from a price increase standpoint that goes in, in the middle or early part of the second quarter. So, our price increases are holding at this point in time and they are in. So we should start seeing the benefit of those in the second half. I feel very good about that at that point in time if the volume holds up. I mean clearly, if you don't get volume you don't get the price.</p>
          <p>Relative to &#x2013; from my perspective, mix, at this point in time, we are starting &#x2013; if you look at the various businesses that are going to start coming into play here, if climate technology turns positive given the fact it's around 18% profitability margin that will help us from that standpoint. The fact that they have been negative and they've held their deleverage reasonably well and the amount of sales that have been down but that's going to be a positive standpoint. Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions are going to be a positive for us from that standpoint and then Process Management will continue to be a positive for our standpoint.</p>
          <p>On the cost reductions and restructuring in the Industrial Automation, that benefit is starting to flow, we saw that in March and I feel better that we will continue to see improved profitability in Industrial Automation in the second half of the year which we forecasted and we will continue to forecast. I will update everybody relative to &#x2013; at EPG relative to the underlying sales and profitability of the segments when we're together at EPG and we'll stand relative to what we said in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks. And then just a quick follow up, keeping it at the overall sort of Emerson level. I mean your sales about flat year-on-year, your earnings about flat year-on-year. I mean does that &#x2013; when you see that does that make you want to accelerate the restructuring or accelerate portfolio chain? Because I guess you don't want to be a company that's just relying on volume leverage. With flat sales it would be good to have some sort of earnings growth through price or cost savings or &#x2013; are you sort of thinking about the restructuring and maybe trying to accelerate that or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the restructuring standpoint, we are accelerating already. We're trying to do as much restructuring as we possibly can, in particular, in Western Europe. And we've got some underway here in North America. But I think from a restructuring standpoint, we've not got it &#x2013; we've got it geared up at a level as we go into &#x2013; finish the second quarter, go into the third quarter, as high as level as we can handle at the company. Relative to sort of repositioning assets, at this point in time, I mean we've just gone through what I would call two or three very-challenging quarters. I want to see this thing stabilize before, I mean get a better sense of the underlying business before I make any more shock treatments. But I still believe the mix of our company still has a very good underlying growth rate, and we've just gone through a couple of shocks here so I'm not ready to overreact based on one or two quarters, Julian.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Process, I mean how far from optimal would you say was operating in the quarter? I mean, you talk about sort of being at full strength again in April. I guess one, how far were you from optimal in the March quarter? And what's your confidence that this April rate can sustain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if you look at optimal, we were probably $50 million to $75 million below where we should have been in the second quarter. I mean, it was a pretty good quarter. I mean we're up 14% and we had pretty good profitability. And so, from my perspective, if I look at the second half of the year &#x2013; if I look at third quarter, I mean, I feel very confident based on what I see right now, based on the plant structure, based on inputs going in, the order pattern which again continues to stay at high levels. I feel pretty confident that these guys are going to be running pretty close to full out. I don't think they're going to be running 100% full out, but I think they'll be running a lot closer than they did in the second quarter. But I feel &#x2013; I mean, everyone is focused on this, and we've got the management team focused, and the quality of the boards have held up, and the quality &#x2013; supply chain, we don't make them in Thailand anymore, we're out of Thailand. But we've got them spread around different places around the world, and so that chain is working pretty well at this point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hey, I wanted to ask you a question about taxes. I mean your tax rate's gone up another point, so you're at 32%. I mean, you're now about 7 points above the peer group average. I mean, do you have any updated views on corporate tax reform or if you plan to do anything to work on the tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's going on right now is our U.S. business is stronger. And from a standpoint if you look at our mix of business, our U.S. actually had a couple very good quarters here relative to our profitability, and some of the &#x2013; with, given China, and given &#x2013; some of our other marketplaces are lower tax rate like Europe, that's hurt us. Right now, we're very eagerly working with tax reform, because we clearly are a player that has been impacted by this, and we do not have offshore deals. And right now, we'll work with that, and we're going to keep working that, and that's where we are.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So first on the guidance, and just trying to parse out the downside from this quarter versus the outlook side, it certainly sounds like you're expecting &#x2013; still the acceleration in the back part of the year. How much of the downward guidance move is really just part of the 2Q underperformance versus actually pulling that down the back half of the year qualitatively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, from my perspective, in Q2, I mean the underperformance &#x2013; depends what you call &#x2013; I mean people have forecasts out there for us in Q2 &#x2013; that's not necessarily &#x2013; I don't give guidance forecasts and I wouldn't necessarily have picked an $0.80 guidance for the second quarter. So I would say that a couple pennies on average are from the second quarter, and the remaining comes from the second &#x2013; back of the year as I pulled down both China, Europe, and a little bit of Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. And then on the Climate Tech side of things, obviously you saw the improvement. Could you just talk a little bit about the inventory levels? And then also whether or not you're seeing similar trends on the hermetic side on your Industrial Automation business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The inventory levels in the channel are extremely low. Our inventory levels are extremely low. The order pace is extremely low. The order pace is picking up. And we'll see &#x2013; this is going to be not a one-month thing, we've got to see sustained improvement in North America, so I'm very concerned about how sustainable that is given that fact that the residential numbers have been improving, but it hasn't been improving all that well, and it actually has been kind of choppy. So we will see what happens here. And what was the other part of that question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talked that &#x2013; we've been doing share repurchase. As you know, we have a set formula-type based on where the stock price goes. As the stock price goes down, we buy more. And as it goes up, we buy less. So right now, based on our communication working with the finance committee today, we will be increasing it. And we will be increasing it here as we go into the second half of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Dave, I'm still trying to get a feel for how you feel about guidance, and maybe this isn't fair, but do you view it as realistic, conservative, optimistic? I mean it still feels like there's a back half recovery baked in, particularly in China, that may or may not come to fruition. So how do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've told you this before, my level of guidance &#x2013; I do not set guidance out there so low that I'm trying to &#x2013; that my dog, Zorro, can jump over. I set out a guidance what I believe based on talking to my business leaders in the <mark type="ph" /> OC (40:21) that I feel is a realistic, balanced guidance. That's the way it is. And I'm not a CEO &#x2013; I have never been a CEO that sets guidance so low that anyone can beat it. That's not the way I do it. I run the company based on pushing the guidance as hard as we can. Sometimes we make it; sometimes we don't make it. And so that's where we sit. And yep, the forecast is a second half recovery. Our business always has a second half recovery. And so from my perspective, a little bit more this year than normal, but I do not feel uncomfortable with this based on where I see the global economies both from China, Europe and the United States at this point in time. So we have to execute and so, do I feel comfortable I gave you a guidance that we can make? The answer is yes. Do I give you guidance that I think I could trip over? The answer is no. I believe that we have a fair, balanced guidance right now. That's where I am.</p>

          <p>No, there really hasn't been. From a price standpoint, we &#x2013; our pricing stays in line with inflation, and we price accordingly.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. So Dave, you &#x2013; I get the comment about the guidance being fair and balanced. But the achievability of the targets is important for a lot of the investors. Where do you feel most confidence in your guidance, is it top-line acceleration or do you feel most confident in the achievability of your profit &#x2013; of your margin targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel &#x2013; obviously, I feel very confident that we'll deliver the margin target. I feel pretty confident that we'll deliver within that &#x2013; obviously, margin is more confident than sales but within the range we're giving for the sales, I feel very confident we'll deliver that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just &#x2013; in the second half margins, my calculation suggests that margins need to be 19.5% or above at the OM level. We haven't seen that level <mark type="ph" /> fortunately before (43:01). What is driving that and I understand that Process Management is going to have a very strong second half of the year, but it seems that Climate needs to be in that range as well. Do you endorse that Climate in that 19% range and Process Management in the low 20s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I've not sat there and calculated the 19.5% range, so I don't &#x2013; I mean I can't tell you that's the right number or not right number. I mean I do know that our profitability will be strong in the second half of the year because of mix and because we're running basically $7 billion orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so &#x2013; from my perspective right now, the 40% incremental margin looks fairly realistic and I think that &#x2013; and so I feel very good that we'll deliver that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's good to hear. And then finally, Dave, you talk about inventories in the Climate business, could you maybe talk about where else you're seeing inventory headwinds? It sounds like Network Power has been an area that we've seen some of that as well. But if I look at Industrial Automation, U.S. down 1% versus IP growth above 4%. It sounds like you got some inventory issues there as well, could you maybe talk about that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the standpoint out there in the Industrial segment, I think they've been &#x2013; they are working some inventories off. Some of the issues have been that it was such a strong growth last year and I think now that's the slowdown in &#x2013; it's been a very spotty recovery and certain industries have done well. Certain industries have not done well. I don't sense though a lot, a lot of it in inventory and industrial areas but there is some and I think that's being worked off. From my standpoint, the Network Power business, I think that you're seeing the &#x2013; we had a strong business in North America. We had a strong business in Asia-Pacific. Europe is really &#x2013; is very weak and continues to weak and I think there's probably a little bit of capacity issue we have here in North America where people build up and if the economy continues to muddle along in this 2% to 2.5% range, I think you could see some issues relative to what I would think capacity in that industry at that point &#x2013; too much capacity.</p>
          <p>But the inventory levels are starting to come down across North America. I think they were built &#x2013; if you look at GDP in the first quarter, inventory did help GDP. I think industry will continue to bring some inventory down as we go into the next two quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>To dig in on &#x2013; not to dwell on U.S. HVAC but it seems like some of the OEMs there have been pretty positive exiting March and entering April and I understand there's a bit of a delay but some of them have been talking about orders &#x2013; order of magnitude strong double-digit 20% or more. And you seem to be talking about a more tepid recovery than that and inventories still being lean. Are you guys still waiting for those orders to come through further down in the supply chain or is there still an inventory draw at the OEM level and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no inventory draw at the OEM. I mean from our perspective, we work day-to-day with our OEM customers and you can go for a week, you know, strong 10%, 20% growth but then you could go for a week where there's no growth. So I want to see sustained growth in this invent &#x2013; in order pattern. Two weeks doesn't make a quarter to me based on after just the last nine months we have gone through this &#x2013; the OEMs. So from our position, we have a very strong position in North America and the industry basically performs so we'll be performing right with it. So I know what's going on in the industry. And from my perspective right now, the order pattern has picked up. It's gone positive and we'll see that sustained through May, June, July. The year is now shorter with March gone, the year what I'd call the AC year has now gotten shorter and that's one of the negatives &#x2013; someone asked earlier, that's one of the negative takeaways that we did not see any recovery in March. We saw the last couple of days going into early April. But we'll see how that &#x2013; those orders sustain as the whole quarter goes forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And you mentioned at the Analyst Day, maybe a bit of a pinch on that supply chain if the OEMs wait too long. Is that still a concern of yours?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only concern I had was if they try to turn on from zero to 50%. I don't think &#x2013; from the capacity, they have lot of extra capacity, and we have lots of extra capacity. They are bringing it up and we're communicating with them. They communicate with us very nicely. I commend them on &#x2013; towards the end of March they started talking to us about &#x2013; they're bringing line rates up, which is very important, and we start adjusting with them. So, I think we've been in sync, we've had our discussions, we're in sync and we're going up very nicely together. There is lots of capacity out there in North America. I mean the housing market and the investment in the housing market has got a long way to go before it comes anywhere close back to where it was just four or five years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And if I can sneak one more in on Process Management. Should we expect kind of normal seasonality in the 3Q to 4Q margin bump or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're going to be screwing up here for &#x2013; I mean I explained this to my Board. What's happened to us in the first quarter, what's happened in the second quarter, what's going to happen in the third and fourth quarter? Seasonality &#x2013; comparisons, unfortunately &#x2013; again, I apologize for our mess up in the first half, but it's going to be very difficult, and so you're going to see extraordinarily high probability coming through because as we've got things ramped up both on the Process side, and our total consolidated numbers that some &#x2013; I think someone &#x2013; Scott just pointed out to me or someone else just pointed out to me the question. And so, you can't pattern seasonality here right now. It's very difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I guess does that mean that in Process margin 3Q and 4Q should look similar or &#x2013; I guess I'm just trying to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends. Right now, I'm looking at pretty &#x2013; I mean the fourth quarter typically will be a stronger quarter for Process. I still think that will be the case. And the only thing will be different in the probability would be mix of any big systems or big projects that ship out the door, but typically Process has a stronger third &#x2013; fourth quarter. And I would expect that'd still be the case, but you don't &#x2013; it's going to be very difficult to pattern out the seasonality; typically, the fourth quarter profitability and fourth quarter sales for Process is bigger. It's the way it's always been.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Terry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...I appreciate that. Hey, I'm wondering if you might talk a little bit in terms of the second half improvement in organic revenues at Network Power; a little bit of color between what you're expecting for data center versus embedded versus telecom, and sort of any color in terms of the visibility you have on that acceleration, whether it's backlog in data center or just comps in the other businesses or whatever else has given you the confidence there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I look at the embedded, we are looking at some moderate growth from the standpoint that &#x2013; one, we've got some of the pruning done, and we actually have some underlying business as some of our customer base actually sees a little bit growth. But I'm looking at &#x2013; but I would say, low single-digit type of growth there.</p>
          <p>As I look at the telecom, we are starting to see some orders, though it's not been really strong. If you look at the telecom spend in the quarter that we just went through around the world, it was not good. We are starting to see some stability and some improvement there. So, again we're looking at some recovery in the telecom and I'm hoping it's going to be north of 5%.</p>
          <p>Right now we don't have a lot of visibility that that business is &#x2013; it's pretty tight from the standpoint of what our customer base does for us there, so it's very tight relative to 30-day, 60-day type of numbers and that's about all we get there.</p>
          <p>On the data center marketplace, I think that the U.S. will continue to do reasonably well. I think Asia will continue to do reasonably well. I think Europe will continue to weaken. And so we're looking at what I would say solid single-digits in the space with the data center being our best, telecom probably the next best, and embedded being the weakest of the three. The telecom right now, we need to make sure the telecom customers continue to order and build out their inventory, or their infrastructure and that they're just starting to do it. That's the wildcard there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Just couple of follow-ups there. Is there any inventory dynamic here in any of these three businesses, probably not data center, but maybe in telecom or embedded that is in the context here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The inventory has been worked out in both those spaces. The telecom has worked out over the last nine months and embedded has been worked out over the last nine months, big time worked out. So, I think the inventories are in pretty good shape in both of spaces and the data centers too. The data center capacity comes in place if they get ahead of what their needs are and the corporate world may say, slow it down, we don't need any more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's where inventory comes in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you remind us, how big Europe as a percentage of the data center business is now? Is it just the old chloride business essentially...?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; if you look at our European &#x2013; let me get a number here, I'll give you an idea, give me a number for the whole &#x2013; do you have the European numbers there, for the Network Power? I mean our European business...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I want to guess it's about a third, but...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's still pretty significant.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say getting worse &#x2013; I mean in terms of rates of change, are we going from single-digits to double-digits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I think you're looking at &#x2013; I mean if you look at &#x2013; yeah, I want to look at the total Europe for the second quarter, total Europe for the second quarter at Network Power. Network Power is around &#x2013; yeah, Network Power; it's about $200 million plus embedded. Yeah, Net was $200 million. It's a significant piece of our business. It's around $200 million in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you asked the question on &#x2013; pardon &#x2013; just ask it again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just where those rates &#x2013; where you see those rates in Europe going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just think that &#x2013; I thought &#x2013; from my perspective, we were looking at some improvements, so we're looking at moderate growth here. I think we're going to be looking at probably flat type of growth. There's been no improvement at all and it's been slight negative. I think Europe right now you're going to be looking at from zero, minus 5% to plus a couple of points in couple of our spaces outside of Process. It depends on a couple of orders, it depends on exports and stuff like that, but it is that type of &#x2013; it's not magnitude change if that's what you are trying to get at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then in your prepared remarks, you threw out a $25-million number. It sounded like that's where you saw profitability &#x2013; operating profits for the embedded power business in 3Q, 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What I threw out there was people &#x2013; what I call pruning. Now, if you look at what I would call underlying pruning in the second quarter of embedded power and computing sales that was about $25 million....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then just quickly shifting over to Industrial Automation and again, the same question; if we get a little bit of color on the segments with regard to the second half acceleration growth that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From our perspective right now, we're seeing our second half improvement in North America, Latin America, and Asia. In Industrial Automation, we had a very strong first half last year so the comps are very difficult. There is a little bit easier comps now and we are starting to see a little bit of order momentum. I look at Europe being down in the second half in Industrial Automation. I see no recovery from that standpoint. So....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was thinking about more the businesses so electrical distribution versus power gen versus fluid automation, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the &#x2013; I'm not going to give you specific &#x2013; I'm not going to give you numbers for each of those businesses but I would say the power gen business is going to continue to be pretty strong both in North America and in Asia. And, electrical distribution is okay because of the channel. So, I would say it's going to be a single &#x2013; a mid-single-digit number, and then automotive. So we have business that goes in automotive; that's doing pretty well too. So, Europe is the one area that is going to be negative. The rest of the world is going to be positive. So, I think it's going to be okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a question &#x2013; I obviously have to play with numbers. You took guidance down by a dime, of which it looks like the tax rate is a nickel. You gave us $40 million of cost associated with trying to catch up, which is another $0.03 to $0.04. You've got pruning of inventories and restructuring of businesses. Is it basically your whole guidance change reflecting these ongoing side costs embedded in U.S. profitability given your tax rate...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Eli, I don't know where you came up with those numbers. That's not how we built that. Our tax rate did not move that much to create a nickel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you went from 31% to 32% as guidance. And that's a nickel on a year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we didn't move &#x2013; yeah, I &#x2013; the numbers you're talking about, what the guidance changed &#x2013; and by the embedded cost, we actually had been looking at that cost ever since we started recovery so we had embedded in some of that cost already from the process standpoint, primarily the underlying sales, the lower sales, and with that lower sales, a tad lower underlying profitability from the business and a little bit of disruption in the business. That's how we got that and maybe a tad &#x2013; a little bit from the tax rate but it wasn't a nickel from tax rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we know Process &#x2013; your Process Europe is not a real threat but the rest of the business -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't call it a threat. I just don't see the recovery. I think that Process, the European business was down in the first half of the year. I think, excluding Process, it'll be flat or slightly down. Our total Process &#x2013; our total European business is how big; I'll get you a total number. $6 billion approximately and Process is &#x2013; $5 billion and Process is $1.8 billion, Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that $1.8 billion is in the $6 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$1.6 billion, yeah, the $1.6 billion is the Process. Yes, $1.6 billion of the $5 billion is Process. And so, if you look at the second half of the year, I think outside of Process it'll be flat to down as it was in the first half too. I just don't see any recovery. We did see some recovery but that &#x2013; I see no momentum and I see nothing in Europe that is going to give us that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, can you make some comments on Latin America and particularly Brazil. You said it was down but that's the one market that looks like it should accelerate in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a lot of big projects that were held back and we do expect those projects to come forward. The economy in Brazil has definitely weakened and &#x2013; but obviously, the impact of so much raw materials has definitely weakened that economy. So, I do expect &#x2013; Latin America we had a very good quarter and I expect us to have another good quarter, but I don't think Brazil's going to be playing as strong a role as it originally was so that's &#x2013; I think Brazil's economy is weak right now and I don't see it strengthening all that much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Dave, on the European outlook &#x2013; at the beginning of the year you talked about sales growth in Europe and the market is worse than what you originally thought. Based on &#x2013; I know some other people have asked questions and you've given some color around it. But &#x2013; so it sounds like though the market share gains that you were expecting in Process and to a lesser extent in Network Power, have those materialized? And, are you thinking just Europe's going to be flat for you for the year at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you the market share gains in a quarter. I think you've got to wait a year and you've got to wait for a little bit after the year to see if you actually gained share. But, right now if I looked at Europe, in total I do expect a little bit of growth because of Process, but not much. I expected some of our businesses that were export driven to have a little bit of growth coming out of Europe. That has not materialized because of the overall weaker economy so right now I would say we still are expecting some moderate growth in Europe and &#x2013; but not anywhere close to where it was I originally thought because I thought there would be more export but that's where it is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then on Network Power, are you seeing &#x2013; in Europe specifically, are year seeing any more competitive pressures there, or is this just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:23)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, ever since &#x2013; the competitive environment has gotten extremely challenging and tough since we bought Chloride and that is expected. When Schneider bought APC, everyone mobilized against them. The same thing when &#x2013; in this industry when you &#x2013; when someone does a movement like this that's the window to open up the attack and that's what's going on. So, it'll take a couple years for this thing to stabilize again. We're going through restructuring right now in Europe and so I think the European market is unfolding for us and Network Power <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:50) made a big change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of things, a lot of questions about guidance. I guess the way to ask it is what kind of dog is Zorro?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two things and the prior question caught it a little bit. I mean, there's so much movement around obviously with macro and these internal issues. There is an element though that it feels like there's share loss going on and it is hard to pinpoint in a quarter or anything but your comments on fluid automation sound tougher than Eaton and Parker, the electrical drives comment sound tougher than Rockwell and ABB. I mean, Telco, TI sounds a little bit better. It just feels like there's a bunch of stuff moving around and maybe there's too much noise and all the macro to really ascertain exactly what's going on but just stepping back and kind of thinking about the portfolio and what's going on competitively, do you feel like you're holding your own, are you seeing some fresh competition from people that are stepping it up relative to what you might have seen historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that changed that much. I don't think you can look at a quarter or six months. Those businesses &#x2013; all those businesses you mentioned had extremely, extremely strong 2011 numbers. Different customer base from the standpoint of what we serve and all those other guys you mentioned serve, I do not sense based on our business performance looking at the underlying macro or individual market spaces that we've had competitive issues different than we've had before. And I don't sense when it's all said and done that we'll have anything change that dramatically from what the market is doing. So, I don't sense that Jeff and as you know I'm pretty close to that stuff, but I don't sense that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just one last thing. Your comments on China were pretty clear. I think you also said though in your opening comments that you expected China to continue to weaken in 2013. So, just some thoughts on that; so you're expecting a little bit of a stimulus bump and then you think it might fade in the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that if you look at the global marketplace, if you look at, they are export markets and there's not a whole lot of recovery and it's basically stagnant type of growth, I think that China will continue to have weaker &#x2013; this fundamental economic pace as you go into 2013. If the U.S. stays at a very moderate growth in the 2% to 2.5%, Europe stays basically at no growth or negative growth; those are very, very important markets for China. And yes I know there's a lot of talk about turning this into a consumer-led economy there, but from the standpoint the capital spending, the export business is still very, very important for the China marketplace. So as I look at the one-time money they put back in there, they still have some structural issues they have to deal with. So I think &#x2013; I firmly believe they're going to allow the growth to modulate down a little bit more again next year to allow working off some of these issues that have built up over several years, Jeff. That's my call. That's my feeling. I have a pretty good feel for China.</p>
