          <p>Thanks Brock. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In the room with us today we have Bill Doyle, our President and CEO; Wayne Brownlee, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Joe Podwika, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; Garth Moore, President of PCS Potash; Tom Regan, President of PCS Nitrogen and Phosphate; and David Delaney, President of PCS Sales.</p>
          <p>I'd like to welcome the media who are listening in and remind people that we are live on our website. I would also like to remind everyone that statements made in this call that express the beliefs, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are given as of the date of this call and involve risks and uncertainties. A number of factors and assumptions were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a projection as reflected in forward-looking information, and actual results could differ materially from what we think appears the most likely at this time.</p>
          <p>For additional information with respect to forward-looking statements, factors and assumptions, we direct you to our news release and our most recent Form 10-K. Also, today's news release, which is posted on our website, includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Bill Doyle for some comments and then we'll go to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denita, and good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining our discussion of PotashCorp's third quarter performance. As you well know, these are uncertain times in the financial and capital markets as fear appears to have overtaken fundamentals in the decision making process for many people. We appreciate this opportunity to bring the discussion back to a focus on measurable performance and to the potential of PotashCorp as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Despite the turbulence around us, our company delivered the best quarter in our history. Our earnings of $3.93 per share were 39% higher than the record we set in the second quarter this year, and greater than the $3.40 per share earned in all of 2007 which was a record year for our company. We generated $1.7 billion in gross margin, more than triple last year's third quarter. This included record gross margin in all three nutrients as we captured the benefits of a strong pricing environment. Our cash flow from operating activities prior to working capital changes reached $1.3 billion and raised our total for the first nine months of 2008 to 2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>While many companies have been held hostage by over-leveraged positions and restricted access to capital during this global financial crisis, we continue to advance the execution of our long-term growth strategies because of our strong cash flows and the health of our balance sheet. This provides tremendous opportunity and flexibility for this company as we move forward.</p>
          <p>While the financial crisis did not impact our quarterly performance, we are not isolated from what is happening in the world around us. No country, company, or sector has escaped this widespread crisis of confidence. The broad sell-off of commodities has hit agricultural-related industries very hard. With many investors forced into de-leveraging and redemptions, even strong performers have been caught up in the wave of reactionary selling. This market correction painted most businesses and commodities with the same brush, as though fundamentals don't matter any more. Any rational examination of the fertilizer industry makes it clear that the essential nature of our products and the long-term need to protect the world's food supply present ongoing opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>Still, the market is now priced as though it expects a long and very deep global recession. While no one can say for certain this will occur, we do prepare for any impact it could have on our business. The good news is that the very nature of what we do provides a unique shelter. Consumers might choose to park their car or spend less on discretionary goods, but food will remain a priority. As I've said before, it is not a luxury item.</p>
          <p>Whether you are in North America or China or India, there is no denying that nutritious food is essential to health and happiness. This is not an area where people are willing to cut back. If absolutely squeezed, those at the margin may opt for cheaper cuts of meat, but they will not return to starch-based diets; that is a long-term reality for our business.</p>
          <p>Our optimism at a time when others are highly uncertain is supported by the fundamentals of our business. Although crop commodity prices have been caught in the wave of reactionary selling, the need for food has not declined. Global grain inventories remain at critically low levels, even though the world's farmers have produced what is expected to be another record harvest. The world's grains' stocks-to-use ratio is estimated at 16.6%, which compares to a 30-year average of 25.3%. This is not a surprise to those who follow our business. As production has fallen short of consumption for most of the past decade, countries have drawn down grain inventories to dangerously low levels to satisfy growing food demand. Now, we'll take a record crop every year just to keep pace. And it will take even greater efforts by governments, farmers, and fertilizer producers to begin the slow process of replenishing global grain inventories.</p>
          <p>This can't be resolved in a single crop year. In fact, using some historically conservative assumptions about future demand for grain, coupled with continued production in yield improvements, it is expected that the global stocks-to-use ratio will remain at historically low levels for at least the next five years.</p>
          <p>Food production is a long-term challenge, one with far greater power and impact than the current financial crisis. If crop prices continue to be disconnected from fundamentals and decline material from current levels, farmers will have little incentive to increase plantings or maximize production. That loss of production would put further pressure on the world's food supply. Obviously, that is an untenable situation and one that would warrant a return to higher crop prices. Ultimately, we believe prices for crop commodities will rebound when fear subsides and rational thought returns to the marketplace. Basic fundamentals will inevitably regain their footing.</p>
          <p>This same thought process applies to Potash, as the very underlying fundamentals of our business are quite strong. Simply put, it will remain a challenge to meet the world's growing demand for potash. For nearly two years, the industry has been operating at or near its production limits. Markets around the world have been on allocation, receiving only as much as the industry is capable of delivering. Our quarter-end potash inventories were reduced to just over 200,000 tons, the lowest level in the history of our company. Because of the essential need for our products, we anticipate continued strong demand over the coming years, even if global economic growth slows.</p>
          <p>As we look across our key markets for 2009, we anticipate a strong year ahead. China's lengthy delay in signing a 2008 contact reduced its potash imports by more than 3 million tons. That put constraints on consumption during its spring season, reducing applications in some areas by as much as 20% and forcing China to mine its soils. To maintain yields in 2009, China will need to increase its potash applications considerably to make up for the potassium deficiency created after this year's harvest.</p>
          <p>Late last week, China's State Council passed a ten-point plan to stimulate economic growth after its GDP slowed to 9% following the Olympics. In addition to increasing agricultural subsidies, China will now be raising prices for key grains to provide higher farm incomes. This is a major stride forward for that country in helping incentivize farmers to maximize future food production. Feeding its ever-growing population is clearly one of the highest priorities for the Chinese government. That will take a lot more grain, and along with it a lot more potash.</p>
          <p>Similarly, demand in India is expected to grow in 2009. After less than ideal weather and lackluster 2008 Kharif crop, that country is expected to continue its efforts to improve productivity.</p>
          <p>In the US, a late harvest has led to a short fall season, so we are anticipating a strong spring season ahead. This could put considerable strain on the distribution system in early 2009.</p>
          <p>The market with the greatest sensitivity to the current financial crisis is Brazil. As farmers are preparing for the spring planting season in Latin America, they have been forced to factor in a more complicated global environment, which has created concerns regarding credit and profitability. While the Brazilian government has just made available for its farmers more than 10 billion reais, roughly $5 billion US, it may not be enough, and along with suppressed crop prices, could make them cautious this planting season. If crop prices rebound by harvest time, which we anticipate will be the case, Brazil's farmers will do well. In any event, Brazilian soils are naturally potassium deficient, which means there's little opportunity to reduce potash consumption without significantly impacting yields. The world is counting on Brazil as a major supplier of crop exports. So any shortfall in production would further strain global grain and oilseed inventories.</p>
          <p>One of the unknowns as we look ahead is the impact of the rapid agricultural renaissance in the former Soviet Union as Russia is actively taking steps to revitalize its domestic food supply for the future. To accomplish this, its farmers need to use more fertilizer. The Russian government has indicated that it will require its domestic fertilizer producers to fill this demand, which could remove several hundred thousand tons of Potash from the international marketplace next year.</p>
          <p>From a production standpoint, we are using our strong cash flow to continue with our debottlenecking and expansion projects in Saskatchewan. This will give us the ability to increase our operating capacity from approximately 10 million tons to 18 million tons over the next five years.</p>
          <p>We have been in the potash business for many years, and we know that demand growth never follows a straight upward line. If for any reason demand doesn't materialize, we will follow our long-held strategy of matching our production to meet market demand. Right now, with the near-term uncertainty holding some buyers on the sidelines, we have no need to actively alter our operating plans, as labor issues have curtailed production at three of our potash facilities for the past two months. From the beginning of negotiations, we've been clear with our unions that we will continue to manage the company in a way that keeps our business sustainable under any market conditions. The rapid change in global financial markets might help our people to better understand our hard line on this issue. We want them back at work, but we won't endanger the long-term health of the company in the process.</p>
          <p>In recent months the market has used a broad-brush approach in valuing companies, sectors and commodities. There has been little differentiation between those with poor performance or weak fundamentals, and those with quality assets and real growth potential. As the market regains confidence and moves forward, we anticipate that investors will be more discriminating in where they choose to invest their money. Not all assets are created equally, and potash is unlike any other commodity. Good deposits are rare, there are a limited number of producers, government involvement is minimal, and very importantly, there are considerable cost and time challenges for any newcomers to the business.</p>
          <p>With a five to seven year period for greenfield development, we have a pretty clear picture of the supply situation in potash for the next several years. Added to that, demand growth is expected to outpace nitrogen and phosphate over the coming years, as it is the nutrient that has been most under-applied in developing nations.</p>
          <p>With our unmatched potash assets, proven performance, and capacity expansion plans, PotashCorp's potential for earnings growth is unparalleled in our industry. We have a long history of delivering on what we say we will do. We have never strayed from our long-term approach to operating our business, and this will not change. We demonstrated this again during our record third quarter, and we look forward to meeting the expectations of our stakeholders in the future.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your interest in PotashCorp. I'm joined today by members of our executive management team and we will be pleased to answer any questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Jacob Bout of CIBC World Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Looking for a comment on the Chinese potash negotiation; specifically looking at when is the next scheduled meeting between the two sides? What is the bid ask here? What do you think the current Chinese inventory levels are like? And then finally, if you maybe just talk a little bit about the resolve, or your confidence and resolve of Uralkali and Belarus, especially if China plays hardball here and this doesn't get settled until the spring of '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right Jacob. First of all, we're in the very preliminary stages of negotiations with the Chinese. The next meeting from our side, the Canpotex meeting with them will be at the end of November. In terms of inventories, our best guess at the current time is they have between 1.8 and 2 million tons at the port facilities, and our guess is that somewhere around 1 million tons within their domestic distribution system. So a total of about 3 million tons of inventory. As you know China was constrained this year due to availability of material, and consumption is down about 20%. They are going to have to replenish potassium levels; they had a wonderful harvest this year and pulling off a big crop, so they know the nutrient harvest was huge and they need to replenish that. The long-term compound annual growth rate for potash consumption in China has not been disrupted; that's 7% a year. So we think you'll see greater potash importations into China in 2009 than you saw in 2008, and we think they will be much quicker to conclude than they were in 2008. Our best guess is that certainly it would be done by the end of the first quarter and may well be done by the end of this calendar year. In terms of Uralkali and Belarussia (sic) [Belarussian Potash Company], I have no idea what they're going to do.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on, I guess &#x2013; with your stock where it is and you did execute more of the buy-back in this quarter, what should we be thinking about if your share price remains like this and that buy-back is completed on schedule or before schedule?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Vincent, what I would say to you, I mean if you think about where our share price is today; I mean we are priced for global depression, not just recession. It's though corn prices have collapsed and farm credit has dried up. And US farmers are going to mine phosphate and potash from the soils and China is going to drag negotiations on to the end of 2009 and we're going to see demand destruction and ethanol's going to go by the wayside and &#x2013; in general, people around the world are going to eat bark off of trees. We don't think that's the case.</p>
          <p>We think we have a short-term delay caused by this general fear that has been gripping the world. Farmers are no different than consumers of cars or clothes or &#x2013; consumers in general, if they're afraid, they will hold off on the buy. So we think we have a four month to six month problem here, which is a slowdown, but the thing about food production is you've got to plant a crop.</p>
          <p>And so the 2009 crop year is not that far away, and we know, for example, in North America with the late harvest coming off this year, which we knew we had because of late planting; it compresses what would normally be an eight week fall season into about three weeks. And with the current state of the market and the fear, as I said, which exists in the general community and certainly also within the farm community, we think we're going to have a very slow fall, but that is going to put a lot of pressure on the spring because everybody's going to be doing the same thing at the same time. People are going to be lining up their fertilizer needs for that 2009 crop, whether it's in Europe or in China or in the United States, Canada. You'll even see Brazil back in the market to get themselves in position here as that 2009 crop becomes a reality. So what I tell you is that we think, at the current share price, obviously we have a very attractive buyback opportunity, and we will pursue that. We've been in black-out period since the end of September, but we will pursue it starting shortly here through the end of January.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Fai Lee of RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Bill, I was just wondering if you could comment on the current operating rate at the Allan mine, and could you potentially restart Lanigan in the event of a labor disruption early next year? Also, do your customers, i.e. China and India, appreciate that almost 20% of global potash production could be affected by potential labor disruptions in the first half of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have Garth answer the first part of that, Fai, and then I'll talk about the second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fai, as far as the Allan production goes, we're running it at a reduced rate with staff right now, and we plan on ramping up that production as we go forward in the fourth quarter here. And Lanigan, we expect to get a labor agreement there in due course, and I don't want to comment on what may happen in the future next year in that particular operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fai, what I would say is if the union leaders hadn't let our folks out on strike, we probably would have taken some shutdowns anyway just to anticipate the slowness of the market. So in a certain sense, they've done that for us. In terms of potential disruption to the customer base out there, I think certainly the strike has helped solidify pricing during the third quarter. We operated in the third quarter; those results that we show with those mines on strike for over half the quarter. So despite the fact that they were on strike, we delivered record results. And as I said, it helped strengthen the market. So the timing in terms of appreciation of it by customers around the world, they certainly recognize what happened during the third quarter, and it remains to be seen what will happen in the New Year.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Brian Yu of Citi [Citigroup].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Good afternoon, Bill. I'm going to switch topics a little bit and talk, and hopefully you can answer questions about, phosphate. We've seen phosphate kind of catch religion with Mosaic taking shut-ins, and also news, I guess yesterday, that Morocco might be doing the same thing. Can you provide just some thoughts on what you think &#x2013; where phosphate margins could go, or are they sustainable at current levels through 2009? And then also on the sulphur cost side, I think there was news and that you guys would sell at a higher cost and then Mosaic would sell at a much lower cost. How does all the contracts work with sulphur? Does everybody hone in on a particular price when everything's said and done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Brian. In terms of phosphate, we have seen reductions announced by competitors around the world. Some people see that as bad news; I just can't figure that out for the life of me. I think that that is good news from our point of view. We also have reduced our DAP production. We're moving that P205 into other areas. We have, as you know, the most flexible phosphate operations in the world, and we can move the P205 into liquids, which have been very strong for us, both polyphosphates and merchant-grade acid, and certainly into purified acid. And if we saw a need to reduce P205 production, we would certainly do that as well. We are big believers in producing what the market requires and not building inventory unnecessarily. We just think it's a good way to run business in general. Some people have the opposite approach; we don't think that's particularly smart.</p>
          <p>In terms of sulphur, we've seen a rapid deterioration in sulphur price; it actually came much quicker than we thought. We thought it would be second half 2009, looking back a couple years ago, it's come quicker. We did book one piece of business at $300 a ton reduction; that was for 7% of our total business. The rest of our sulphur business we will book at lower costs more in tune with what you're seeing out there with other purchases from sulphur suppliers. I think the sulphur market is not unlike other markets, it tends to follow to a conclusion that is common, because you set the price out there for that particular nutrient. So it's not surprising that we're going to all end up purchasers of sulphur, or certainly within North America, are within a shoebox with one another.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mark Connelly of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bill, I mean we certainly agree that people are going to eat, but when you go back to the Asia currency crisis '97, '98, Russia protein consumption fell double digits, South Korea was down, Singapore, Malaysia. China wasn't as affected, I guess. So the impact there was clearly temporary. But I guess my question is, how different do you think the situation is this time if we are seeing a similar financially driven problem around the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Mark, I clearly remember those days, and of course we're in different days now with hundreds of millions of more consumers of protein; what I'd say about '97, '98 was the recovery of protein consumption. It happened very quickly. So I mean it was a &#x2013; you're talking 1%, 1.5% in some countries down in terms of major impact on us, on potash, which is in short supply around the world when you look at the ability of the industry over the last few years while we're on allocation to supply the needs of the world.</p>
          <p>And then looking forward over the next five years of where we think potash is going, and clearly we don't think that the &#x2013; I know some of the television personalities are talking about selling everything you own for the next five years, but we clearly don't think that the world is going to stop eating protein to any substantial degree at all.</p>
          <p>We think it's a very minor impact, and we think that with the tremendous growth in numbers of people who are consuming protein &#x2013; and by the way still moving into the era of protein consumption for the first time in their lives. A lot of people &#x2013; you know, you look at GDP growth, you say, "Oh my god, China is &#x2013; the end of the world. They've gone down to 9% in the third quarter."</p>
          <p>That's still 9% growth, you know. And this whole concept that the whole world spins around the United States, and you know, the rest of the world is just going to go into the same sheer panic that some of the financial community has gone to in this country, when quite frankly, they don't care.</p>
          <p>They don't know anyone on Wall Street or Bay Street, and they're just trying to eat better. It's a real fundamental thing. So, I just don't see an impact on &#x2013; a very substantial impact from this financial crisis on protein consumption.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Bill, I was hoping to just pick up on the very last sentence of the text portion of your earnings release, where you say, "We also view this as an opportunity to look for additional ways to increase the strength of our Potash business, which will provide long-term rewards."</p>
          <p>So, Bill, when I think of your company over a longer period of time, it's a company that, I believe you could say, has been built on a string of opportunistic acquisitions. A lot of the things you've said about the financial markets kind of would indicate to me that you think private market values are greater than the public market values right now. So, could you maybe expand on that final comment and tell us what you're seeing out there in terms of the potential to build on your Potash business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Well, David, you know, with any change in the market place, you have opportunities. And I would say one of the things about our company and our management team is that we don't get too excited when times are good, and we don't get too excited when times are bad.</p>
          <p>We don't manage the company for the share price. I know some people would like us to do that, but we don't. What we do is, we try to build the company at opportune times. And what I would say to you is that we think that there are opportune times right now. And certain competitors of ours may find themselves to be in a leveraged position unexpectedly.</p>
          <p>And there may be opportunity for us to take advantage of that. And so, to expand that any further, I'd have to give you names, which I won't do. But I do think that there are significant opportunities for us. You know, we're doing some things right now. Wayne, you might want to comment what we did overnight, if you want to tell him just a little bit?</p>

          <p>We did take a small increased position in <mark type="inaudible" /> chemicals overnight, and we're about a $115 million. I haven't seen the final results, but &#x2013; so we had increased ownership in that company, where we had an opportunity that there was a seller looking to exit the stock.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's just one example, but there are others. And we try to always have &#x2013; when people have criticized us over the years for not unlocking the leverage of our balance sheet. I can't tell you how many bankers have come to talk to us about, that over the last three years or so, some multiple times.</p>
          <p>And every time they'd leave, I'd just shake my head, and it's just not our business. And we've always managed the company to have the ability to have firepower, to be able to pull the trigger when we need to, to take advantage of opportunities. We like to buy cheap. Everybody knows that we like to buy cheap. We're cheapskates, we admit it. But we think it's the way to build a company. And so, when you have these type of times, and people get themselves in trouble, you know it's Darwin's theory proved.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon guys. Bill, question for you. I mean we understand how Potash is different from the other nutrients, but is it reasonable to expect Potash prices to remain at those current levels when everything else is dropping? And also, why shouldn't it drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I didn't get the last part of the question, Edlain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean essentially why shouldn't Potash prices come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Edlain, you know, what I'd say to you is if you think about Potash, it has a completely different structure than the other two nutrients. For all the reasons that you know &#x2013; and I went over a few of those in my remarks. There are 12 countries which produce it, a 160 countries which consume it.</p>
          <p>If you look at nitrogen, over 60 countries produce nitrogen. So, when you have that many players in the nitrogen game, and then the barriers to entry, certainly time being the greatest in Potash, and time being the least in nitrogen, you can get in and out of that business, or certainly in it, a lot quicker than you can Potash.</p>
          <p>And the amount of government control in the business creates less economic-driven decisions. And so, our focus in potash has always been to match supply to demand. We want to produce exactly what the world requires, but we don't produce more than the market requires. So, we don't tie up working capital. And we don't let the tail wag the dog.</p>
          <p>We respond to the market, when the market needs our potash. And by the way, our expansions are going to be what we think perfectly timed. And we're not backing off one bit on our expansions. We're just going to push ahead, because first of all, the majority of them are Brownfield expansions, and we can do it cheaper than anybody else and we do it quicker than anybody else.</p>
          <p>And the world is going to need that potash. And that's why our growth opportunities are far greater than any other producer in the world in the fertilizer industry. And so, your question kind of leads me to think about that broad-brush I talked about, in terms of the way the market has treated the various players in the industry.</p>
          <p>And we think that there really has been very little diligent analysis, I would say, of the playing field for fertilizers. And someone that has the asset base that we do to be compared and trained at exactly the same multiple, as someone that doesn't have any potash, you begin to wonder about how clever some of the analysis that we've seen is. So Potash, the pricing, has been more stable, because the structure of the industry is different than those other industries.</p>
          <p>And in our case, for whatever influence we have on the marketplace, we match supply to demand. It's just the 21-year track record of how we do things. So, anybody who is planning on potash prices coming down, I just don't think they're right. And we think we're going to see increases in China here, we think we're going to see increases in India, and a very stable potash pricing environment going forward. That's our view of the future.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Don Carson of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So, you talked about how consumption of potash was down in China this year. As we look forward to next year and then the need to rebuild nutrients, what do you see as consumption globally, focusing on both major markets like China as well as the US? And what's your sense &#x2013; you mentioned corn prices don't reflect current fundamentals of supply-demand. What's your view as to where corn prices should trend up to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well I'm going to let David handle the potash question. But let me respond to corn first. When I see corn come back to a $4.00 floor, which is really where I think the floor is &#x2013; you get some variations of the floor &#x2013; but we were, for 30 years, at a $2.00 floor in corn.</p>
          <p>And so, I think you've definitely seen the demand cycle for grains around the world take hold &#x2013; which by the way, isn't going away. It's a long-term change in grain demand. We are definitely in a demand driven cycle for the first time ever, and we're going to stay in it despite this financial contagion that's going on.</p>
          <p>But corn prices have definitely increased the floor from two to four. And I think at four, I think, you're at the bottom of the floor, and it's just going to be very tight supply-demand for corn. We're producing a heck of a crop in the world this year, but stock-to-use ratio to corn is still 13.5%, which as you know, is a very low global inventory for corn.</p>
          <p>And so, farmers around the world are going to need to plant corn acres in 2009. We think more corn acres, and the price is going to have to be sufficient to entice them to do that. So, we think between now and spring planting in 2009, you're going to see a rebound in corn prices. Corn prices got hung up just like Potash stock price got hung up.</p>
          <p>It got &#x2013; everything thrown under the bus at the same time, and it was an overreaction, de-leveraging taking place at an unprecedented scale. And so, you've seen some things that are really an aberration, but when you look at what the requirement for corn is, as people consume more meat around the world, we're very bullish on corn.</p>
          <p>We think you're going to see a response to corn that it will be higher priced by the time those spring planting decisions are made. Otherwise, you've got real problems, because you're going to have less corn planted, which means even higher prices. And then you get into a crisis situation. So, I don't see that happening. I think farmers are going to have the incentive to plant. So, Dave, you want to talk about the potash question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the potash side in the US, right now we're calling US consumption down probably 5 to 10%, and that's a worse case scenario. That's from 5.2 million tons estimated this past year to 4.8 this year. Part of the reason for that is, we're down 400,000 tons potash for business in second half, primarily due to our strikes and low inventory. So, we're going to go into the year as a system relatively low. We do think with increased corn acres, and an improvement in the corn price, that this potash number could trend up.</p>
          <p>In Brazil this year, we're calling potash imports of 6.8. We think right now with the soybean price, where it is, and the credit situation, that number could trend down to maybe 6.3 in '08, '09 as a forecast, or I should say in '09, calendar year '09.</p>
          <p>China will be up. We think they'll be up quite a bit based on their need to replenish the nutrients, as Bill indicated. India will be close to five million tons this year. As you know, that's a subsidized system, and we think the need for fertility and to raise yields, that they are on course to maintain that kind of number and likely higher into '09.</p>
          <p>Southeast Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, palm oil prices have come off. They have a little bit of inventory. They'll be right at 3.5 million tons this year. We think that number could be off slightly going into '09. So, year over year, some minuses in a few places, but I do think offset by growth in China and continued growth in India.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just kind of following on that last point. The question is on potash inventories. I'm kind of wondering &#x2013; or the ability of the market to respond. The question is, it's my understanding that between January and May of '09, that maybe 12% of labor negotiations are taking place that could impact 12% of the industry's production. So, I'm just kind of wondering whether that's an accurate assessment.</p>
          <p>12% could be impacted, and then is there kind of a unification, that the ranks are kind of similar in their feeling, in the negotiations as you've expressed? And I'm kind of wondering whether there are any inventory levels hiding around that could offset that short fall in production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Neal, I'm going to have Garth speak to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Neal. Yes, there are several negotiations that are going to come up in Saskatchewan next spring. But we think that calmer minds are going to prevail and the workforce is going to consider the offer that's out there. There's going to be some tight times, as David mentioned, over the next four to six months.</p>
          <p>And I think that that may bring some reality back to the negotiating tables. And I guess time will tell what will develop next year in negotiations. But there's definitely no extra inventory sitting around anywhere to cover that off, but we think that things will work themselves out in the next three to six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neal, one of the things that you learn in a strike is that giving a union leadership a strike mandate is a dangerous thing. Because as soon as they get that from the rank and file, basically union leadership has proved that it can do whatever it wants. So, all transparency and accountability goes out of the window, and the union members are left in the dark.</p>
          <p>In our case, with the three mines that we have on strike at the moment, the local union leader actually did a heck of a job negotiating for the members during the &#x2013; we had almost 40 negotiating sessions with the union prior to the strike. And she was tough and smart and fair and came away, I think, with a heck of a contract.</p>
          <p>I commented on it on the last call. But before she could deliver it to her members, she lost control of the process to the national leadership. And at this point, this idea of a commodity bonus was introduced, and since that point, the negotiating process has been paralyzed.</p>
          <p>And this commodity bonus really is a net income bonus. And the proposal that they gave us would equate to $157,000 per worker this year, based on current earnings projections. Essentially, the union leadership wants to take credit for all the Potash earnings, as well as our record earnings in phosphate and our record earnings in nitrogen.</p>
          <p>And they want to take credit for the earnings for our offshore investments and for the overall strategic direction of the company over the last 21 years. And you know, in any negotiation, you want to stick to the realm of what's possible. And if you look at their ask, common labor under their proposal this year, their ask would make $244,447 dollars. Now, in the real world, I mean if you look at our company, what we pay a senior vice president with a Masters in Engineering and 25 years, 30 years of work experience, that $244,000 might fit that person.</p>
          <p>But it sure doesn't fit an 18-year-old coming out of high school with no training in mining or safety skills. You know, it's just not the real world. And I can tell you, we don't have one significant shareholder who thinks that that's a good idea. So, when you get into the realm of the impossible in negotiations, which I think is where the leadership of the union is with this net income bonus or commodity bonus idea, you mislead the people that you represent.</p>
          <p>So, the leadership of the union professes to be experts in a number of areas. They've given tax advice to the Provincial Government, and also seem to be an expert in executive compensation. But unfortunately they haven't seemed to have much expertise in concluding a labor agreement. And there's been a lot of conversation coming out of the union leadership. They've done a lot of talking during this strike.</p>
          <p>We have been very reserved. We let them do the talking, and they've really tried to poison the relations between the company and our union workers, many who have been with us for 20 to 30 years. But there's two things that they've said, which really stand out to me.</p>
          <p>One union leader said that he has the best interest of the company at heart. Well, I tell you, this is simply not true, because his proposal for a commodity or net income bonus would destroy the company. We would eventually be forced to shut the mines, because we'd be uncompetitive. And all of our miners would lose their jobs.</p>
          <p>And the other thing he said was that the union leadership was going to win. Well, anybody that knows anything about strikes, knows that no one wins in a strike. And to say such a thing shows that he has his own agenda, and it's not what's in the best interest for our workforce. And our workers, in their hearts, they know that. So, as Garth said, we think calmer, more rational minds are going to prevail here.</p>
          <p>Right at the moment, this strike is absolutely having no impact on us. As I said, we would be taking shut-downs if they weren't on strike. So, with the financial contagion around the world, hopefully, people will come to some recognition that the offer that's on the table is a heck of an offer. And simply out of respect for our workforce, we haven't pulled this offer off the table, because we'd like them to know what it is, and hopefully they'll recognize that soon.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I had a couple of questions regarding a kind of a longer-term outlook for potash, and in particular &#x2013; I know you guys have thrown out sort of a 2.8 billion number for the cost of a new mine. And I'm just wondering if steel costs come down material next year, what would that mean in terms of the cost of building a new plant? And then secondly, have you heard anything in terms of some of your competitors with respect to that? And over the near-term, could you comment on the latest sinkhole that's developed near the Silvinit mine? That would be helpful as well?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Michael, as far as the capital cost of the new operation goes; we're not seeing the steel pricing come down. I think what's going to happen is the steel fabricators; steel manufacturers are going to reduce their short-term production output to meet the demand and maintain the price at a fairly decent rate.</p>
          <p>And I also feel that the $2.8 million price tag maybe a little stale by now. And I know as I've seen some numbers from some of the other people that are looking at Greenfield operations, and the numbers are getting a little bit higher than that now. But there's no &#x2013; there's still at this point in time, no one out there that's announced a Greenfield operation. And nothing going forward at this time that would make one come into effect within the next five to seven years.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the sinkhole in Russia, this is an ongoing saga. The public news is that they do have a new crack that's heading to the second bypass line supposed to be &#x2013; the last report was 64 meters away.</p>
          <p>And they're arguing about who's going to build the next bypass, who's going to pay for it I think is the big question. If it were me, I'd be putting spikes in the ground right now. But we tend to do things ahead of time as opposed to be reactive. So, we're just going to keep tuned into that one, as I'm sure many of you are.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bill, just under the wire, Canpotex, just two parts real quick. Similar to last year, but for different reasons, is it possible or is there a potential advantage to actually negotiating with India ahead of China in order to pressure China to not delay again?</p>
          <p>That'd be my first part. Second is just a mathematical one. In the past Canpotex typically has about a third of the freight forward agreements in place for about six months or more. Is that still the case that we should assume that maybe the net backs &#x2013; even though, things are dropping as fast as they are, the net backs probably are about two quarters away from seeing the full effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right Paul, I'm going to have David answer the second question first, and then I'll talk about India and China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Paul, about 80% of our sales on third quarter were on a CFR basis. Average freight on that was about $75. Going forward, we do have about half of that on a long-term COA basis, and we expect, with rates coming down at the quarter, to see the benefit. Rates have come off a lot, and I don't know the exact answer if our COA cost is at the low end of where the market is today, but it is pretty close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Paul, on which one of the two big buyers comes in first, I can tell you that the Chinese don't want to be last. They clearly have recognized, in conversations that I've had with them, they don't want to be last in line in 2009. And that's why I say there could be a real chance this could conclude by the end of December.</p>
          <p>We think certainly by the end of the first quarter, but could be by the end of December. They need to, as we said, increase their Potash consumption in 2009, and that means increase their imports. The Indians did jump the queue last year. Can they be smart two years in a row? I don't know. But clearly, people who are in the know, who know this business, they're worried about long-term supply for Potash over the next five-year period.</p>
          <p>And they've got to be careful to make sure they get that supply. You throw in this crack coming at Silvinit, which would interrupt rail to China &#x2013; you know there are a lot of things that can go wrong in the equation that you can't necessarily depend on. I know the Chinese are watching that sinkhole from Google Earth and tracking it daily to make sure that they're on top of it. But you're going to see the Chinese move a lot quicker than last year. So, I see a more traditional China coming first and India second.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you comment on the recently announced land reforms in China, where the land &#x2013; it can't be bought, but the rights to use it can be transferred? Is that a positive, Bill, on your mind? If so, when would that kick in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, just talking about that now Charlie, it is a positive. I think this new ten-point program that they've just introduced; clearly what it says is that they are going to incentivise farmers to plant more grain. And they're recognizing the pressure on what meat consumption is doing to the pressure on grain and the need to improve yields from the red line of what they call &#x2013; not going below 300 million acres of crop land.</p>
          <p>They've got to improve the yields coming out of that crop land, so that they can grow the grain required to keep pace with protein demand. So, we start to see them make these land reforms where you can actually potentially get to bigger farms, and then also deliver farm subsidies. So, the big problem in China has been low grain prices.</p>
          <p>And farmers in China &#x2013; Chinese being naturally the greatest entrepreneurs in the world, in my opinion, they respond to that incentive. And so, to see these incentives now coming from the Chinese government to recognize that they have to improve income levels, rural income levels, which is what they stated in their plan, I think is a very healthy signal for our business down the road.</p>
          <p>We think China is really going to be explosive in Potash demand here over the next five years and the good news for us is that we're going to be in the position to supply the lion's share of that growth with our expansions.</p>
