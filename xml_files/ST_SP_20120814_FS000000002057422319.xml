          <p>Good morning and a warm welcome to all Investors and Analysts. You are listening in to SingTel's Earnings Conference Call for the First quarter Ended 30 June 2012.</p>
          <p>My name is Sin Yang Fong and let me introduce management on the call Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO, Mr. Allen Lew, CEO, Group Digital L!fe, Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO of Group Consumer, Mr. Hui Weng Cheong, CEO, International, Mr. Yuen Kuan Moon, CEO, Singapore Consumer, Mr. Kevin Russell, CEO, Consumer Australia, Mr. Murray King, CFO, Australia and Ms. Jeann Low, Group CFO. They are also assisted by other members of the management team from Australia and Singapore.</p>
          <p>Before we start taking questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Yang Fong, good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today for SingTel's results for the first quarter ended 30th June 2012.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, net profit grew 3%. We've improved performance from the regional mobile associates. We also booked an exceptional gain from the divestment of the non-strategic investment. I think we have separately announced that this is around Far EasTone. Underlying net profit declined 3% .That due to weakening of the regional currency and the Australian Dollar as well against the Singapore Dollar. In Singapore, revenues rose a very strong 8% and that's on the back of strong contribution from NCS. EBITDA was stable, reflecting higher customer acquisition and retention cost and payments to NetLink Trust.</p>
          <p>In Australia, Optus revenues fell 3%, due to mobile termination rate cuts, lower equipment sales and service credits associated with device repayment plans. EBITDA fell 3%, in line with lower sales. The regional mobile associates continue to deliver very robust customer growth, key regional associates Telkomsel in Indonesia, AIS in Thailand and Globe in Philippines all turned in very strong performance offsetting weaker results from Airtel and also depreciation of the regional currencies. In constant currency terms the regional mobile associate pre-tax contribution would have been up 9%.</p>
          <p>Beginning this quarter, we are disclosing operating revenue for the new business unit and let me just share some key highlights of the business unit during the quarter. For good consumer, we continue to roll our 4G or LTE services in Singapore and Australia giving our customers unprecedented speaks and network quality. In Singapore we announced tier price plans for mobile data for those who implemented in July we also implemented revised data allowances in Australia. These changes were allowed us to keep our prices competitive and allowed us to sustain network investments in turn driving better experience for all our customers.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we have received ACCCs approval &#x2013; agreement with NBN Co to migrate our cable customers on to NBN. In the Infocomm space, we continue to gain tractions on our cloud services. Number of business customers using our cloud-based solutions in Singapore increased to 200,000 from 180,000 that we recorded in the preceding quarter. We also won and renew contracts of S$1 billion in value in the quarter. And that includes a five-year contract to provide and maintain a private cloud infrastructure, G-Cloud for the Singapore government.</p>
          <p>In digital space, we acquired HungryGoWhere. We also signed an agreement for the acquisition of Eatability of our leading restaurant review portals in Singapore and Australia respectively. These acquisitions are central to our strategy of providing more localized digital content relevant to our market. Amobee, which we acquired in April of this year, was awarded contracts by eBay, Expedia and Sprint.</p>
          <p>So with that, I hand over to Yang Fong. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.<mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question Mr. Roshan Raj, Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. Just three questions from me. First, on the three to five year kind of view, what kind of revenue contribution do you expect from Group Digital L!fe?</p>
          <p>Second question is, on the Q-o-Q increase in subscriber acquisition cost in Singapore. Our understanding was possibly a fair share of handsets being thrown in the market are Android phones. So despite that why should the subscriber acquisition cost have increased during the quarter? And third is, any thoughts on possible equity raising exercise by Bharti and SingTel's participation in such an exercise? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think you know we provide guidance on a yearly basis. So you know, certainly I am not in a position to talk about revenue contribution on Group Digital L!fe. But you &#x2013; we would expect Group Digital L!fe to become an increasingly important part of overall business. We see that Group Digital L!fe activity as helping to strengthen our core, increase our stickiness in non-core customers, in our core mobile broadband businesses, and we also see it as a new resource of revenue and growth for the Group.</p>
          <p>So, I can't talk about what the revenue contribution will be in three to five years' time. I can say quite, very confidently that we expect that to be a larger part of our overall business in that time period.</p>
          <p>Maybe I'd just quickly talk about the Bharti question before passing onto Moon to talk about acquisition cost in Singapore. Our investments in our associates, Bharti included &#x2013; we have strategic investments in these companies. We see ourselves playing a very active role in the growth of the business. Clearly, if Bharti or any other associates look at raising capital, we would assess if it make sense and if its value accretive, clearly we would support those initiatives. I think it would be premature and speculative to talk about specific associates.</p>
          <p>So maybe I can hand over to Moon to talk about acquisition costs in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. Yeah, I think if you looked at our SAC on Q-on-Q, there is a slight increase over the preceding quarter. This has got nothing to do with the amount of subsidy we do, we provide for Android or iPhone. It's actually quite consistent.</p>
          <p>What actually has contributed the shift in the slight increase in SAC is really due to the mix of our customer base. As we now have got more than 70% of our customer base postpaid data on smartphones and more than 90% of new customers or re-contracting customer have taken on smartphone plans, you'll see that they are trading up to higher value plan with higher data allowance, higher voice minutes. So, that constitutes a higher subsidy when they trade up to the higher plan. So on a blended basis, you see a slight increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you so much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Kelvin Goh, CIMB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have one question and that's on mio TV. I just like to hear your thoughts on mio TV's proposition without BPL as part of the offering, and basically is related to your thoughts on the rights &#x2013; the cost of the rights in the U.K. that's gone up quite a bit and how you see that translating in Singapore? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen, would answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sock Koong. Good morning, everybody. Obviously TV is all focused around content, and we've now had the mio TV content for two years since August 2010, Also, the BPL content exclusive for two years since 2010.</p>
          <p>We've also been aware since then that the regulatory regime around content has also changed to a non-exclusive regime. So basically from our perspective we've also started to build up from the content perspective, the availability of other different contents of spots. You can see we've built up our own self aggregated Chinese channel, which is gaining significant traction just recently, and Sock Koong announced highlights of our results.</p>
          <p>So we've also secured non-exclusive price to Tamil content which reaches out to 12% population in Singapore. So certainly we're building up our content capabilities and beyond just spot.</p>
          <p>I think beyond content we're also looking at the customer experience of the platform. We will have a new eye that goes up towards the end of this year. We also have a second screen ad for tablet that goes out and beyond that there are few other key things that we've learnt in terms of TV behavior that we will be emphasizing on.</p>
          <p>So I think, at the end of the day, I think content is key. We know the positioning and the attractiveness of BPL and who we are just up to. I think at the end of the day, when the bid comes up in October this year, we will look at it very seriously and we will come up with a bid that is eventually flat. The current content regime in Singapore reflects engagement with our customers and reflect the shareholder value to shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Rajesh Raman, HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Rajesh from HSBC, thanks for the call. I have two questions. Firstly you answered on the timing of the BPL bid being in October. Just wanted to understand if there is a significant cost escalation that we need to expect from the BPL bid and second do you have any update on whether the new management at Telecom is exploring the Telecom cell tower sale or purchase of the Telecom's services. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the BPL question and expectations in both the comments of our significant cost escalations. I think you need to look at &#x2013; we will look at this in the context of Singapore. I think the cost escalation that happens in the U.K. with the domestic rights of BPL, I think is for that market well within the content of the market and both within the content of the cost of license fees over the last year for price that, that content has come up for bidding.</p>
          <p>So I think that is probably not a fair indication of what's going to happen in Singapore, because if you look at the history of BPL in Singapore and the cost of BPL, the acquisitions have happened already prior to the upcoming bid. So I think, and also there is a bit change in the regulatory environment so I wouldn't use Britain or some other historical -- some other country as a precedent or what to expect for the cost of BPL in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul here. And to pick up on the question on Indonesia and Telkomsel, and as many of you know we have had some significant management change and renewal in Telkomsel including our own commodities. I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on a decision being made by Telecom and clearly those are for them to discuss in that.</p>
          <p>But I probably want to pick up on the question of the priority of the new management team. And they've been quite clear in stating that their focus is on making sure that we are a leader in mobile broadband and that we are aggressive in developing the new services that right on that network in order to be a leader in digital services in Indonesia. There's quite a significant growth visible in the Indonesian market and we want to make sure that we capitalized on that probably leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Paul.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the opportunity. I have three questions. Firstly, on the outlook on Optus, it seems to be flat to positive on revenue and EBITDA even though the first quarter has been quite soft in both. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what will change in the subsequent quarters? What are you seeing in the market?</p>
          <p>Second question I has is with regards to the Singapore mobile, it seems to have slowed a lot as well from the previous quarter, just wanted to find out what is driving this? What's changing in the market? And will it prompt some reaction in the product SingTel.</p>
          <p>Last question I had with regard to shared pricing. I was wondering, now that have seen it implemented for a fair bit, I was wondering if you see any movements with regard to subscribers on this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Paul, you want to talk about office outlook for the rest of the year. I think we have problems in our outlook for the rest of the year for the entire group, so maybe Paul you want to talk about Optus specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Moon may want to talk about Singapore mobile group and impact of the new data prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I am obviously not going to get into forecast even making any complications, but I might point for the number of the underlying trends inside the Australian business which are probably helpful then in giving us senses of the dynamics, and I'll also invite Murray if you wish to add any commentary to that.</p>
          <p>I think probably the two things that I'd point to most in terms of the Optus performance particularly around our biggest in this mobile, is that we are seeing a significant pressure in the market, which has been caused by the trends over the last two years.</p>
          <p>However, if you look at our outgoing service revenue in the marketplace and you allow for the impact of the device repayment plans we launched last year in late 2011. Actually, underlying outgoing service revenue has turned around and it's showing growth, it will be up 1.7% exceeding MRO in the period. We think that's quite positive in terms of the underlying performance in the business.</p>
          <p>Likewise if we look at our EBITDA performance for mobile, the reported EBITDA does show a decline, however, that reflects the fact that last year at this quarter we had provision in place, sorry, we did not put a provision in place for the incentive, for our staff, this year we have. If we back out the impact of that adjustment, just because it's the underlying performance of the business. Underlying EBITDA expanded by about 1.2 percentage points in terms of mobile in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So I think there are some underlying strength in the business. What's making it difficult for everyone to read right now is the that fact we have mobile termination rates. The impact of the new service credit or watching through the numbers. But ultimately we think that there are signs of positive in the underlying performance of the business. Murray, did you want to add anything to what I've said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Paul, I think you've covered it all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of Singapore mobile and I'll pass to Moon to talk about some of the trends that are driving mobile here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think when you talk about the slowdown in mobile growth in Singapore, you are probably referring to the revenue growth because from a subscriber growth standpoint, I think we have added 58,000 customers in the last quarter and we continue to gain share both in the postpaid and prepaid market. I think if you look deeper into the revenue growth we should &#x2013; the service revenue growth of mobile is up 2%.This actually is important.</p>
          <p>If you look deeper into it actually the slowdown as what you referred to primarily comes from roaming because if you look at the roaming traffic, shifted quite a fair bit year-on-year. And this has constituted the steep slowdown in overall mobile revenue. Slipping away at roaming revenue, the mobile revenue were grown by about 4% year-on-year. So that's still a pretty significant growth if you look at the market like Singapore.</p>
          <p>And on the third section on chip pricing. I just like to say that the &#x2013; while we announce the chip pricing introduction in early June, when we announced the launch of LTE. The actual effective date actually came in only on 1st July. So the impact is not in this quarter, you'll probably see more explanation coming in the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call. I have three questions, all on Singapore. The first is with regards to the mobile business, just wondering in terms of the increase in cost of sales and selling and admin expenses year-on-year by double-digit, aside from as you mentioned the mix of subscriber acquisition cost towards smartphone, is there also any impact there of people recontracting ahead of the implementation of tiered pricing and therefore subsequent quarters we could see this ease off?</p>
          <p>Second question is also on mobile side, postpaid ARPU is down q-on-q, just wondering any particular promotion or practice that's happening? And last question was on the pay TV side, we understand from the recent results that startup that some pay TV content went off contract during the recent quarter, just wondering if you are interested in that contract that is now available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Allen will take the pay TV content question first and then Weng can talk about mobile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sock Koong. Luis, I think in terms of the content gone off contract, I think since the non-exclusive regime of the note, I think there has been different types of content that has gone off contract and SingTel has looked at all of these content and we've looked at those that make sense for us to acquire, because either they drive further engagement with existing base or more importantly they drive customers across world, because it brings &#x2013; fulfill bouquet of content option to these customers.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an example, some of the content that has gone non-exclusive that we have taken across is an example of Sun. Sun is very strong panel channel that we've just taken across the companies into the Indian base, it gives them more option, beyond what we have is spots and some of the other content that we have there.</p>
          <p>There is another very significances of content, I can't disclosed right now that had also gone off contract and we are in the last stages of finalizing that and we'll announce something in September when we get to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Allen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Luis. Weng here. Let me explain, your question is on the expenses in acquisition cost in the quarter, whether that's been increased in catalyst upgrading in advance because of our tiered plan. I think we have not seen significant changes despite increase in the number of customers recontracting in June post our announcement of the chip plan that was effective from 1st July but you have to understand that most of our customers can only upgrade or re-contract at the end of their contract.</p>
          <p>So it's not the entire base can rush to re-contract because most of them are still on contract. So you will see only slight change, movement there and don't think it's that significant. The next quarter you will see probably re-contracting and new sales is driven more by new introduction of new smartphones.</p>
          <p>We have seen that happening with Galaxy S III when it was introduced in June and you are likely to see the impact next quarter when iPhone 5 is actually to be introduced. So this is &#x2013; this actually drives behavior more than any changes in our tiered plan.</p>
          <p>In the area of admin expenses having increased, you see that we have incurred little bit more on debt with regards to contract services. For example, for installation of our fiber services, you see that we have gained a lot of market share in terms of fiber in Singapore 2,9000 fiber connections kind of this quarter.</p>
          <p>A lot of these are actually come from our existing base of customers where we are upgrading them from ADSL to fiber and that would require some installation cost that we have to payout to third parties and sale of our own staff to vendors installation.</p>
          <p>In terms of postpaid ARPU, the third questions, I think that decline of that probably come from two factors. First, it's really a mixed question because we are, although, grown our data SIM customer base over the last quarter, over the last year, with the introduction of more tablets in the market.</p>
          <p>So many of our customers are picking up data-only plans which are used in tablet and those plans have got a lower average ARPU than your smartphone plans. And you have a dilution effect mixing into the decline in overall ARPU.</p>
          <p>The second one, which is a big impact as service to you, the impact of roaming, we're also seeing with the global economic downturn, especially in Europe. We are seeing lower traffic in inbound roaming as well as outbound roaming from our customers.</p>
          <p>So that has got a more significant impact on SingTel's ARPU because we have got a larger share of the business customers and so as higher value customers. So together with that, we had brought down the ARPU on a year-on-year basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks very much. Just two questions, firstly, sorry, I wasn't to go back to the pay TV question. But &#x2013; obviously, I understand the BPL is quite a critical content, but if you look at in the past 18 months, your revenue share hasn't really changed much. And I understand there's one-off in this quarter anyway, but even if you adjust for it, it's still in 20s. I'm just wondering, is that more a function of the lack of other appealing content or is it also a function of the technology restrictions which ADSL may have in carrying more content? So that's my first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on &#x2013; just the management thoughts on what's happening in India with Bharti at the moment. Obviously they are going after market share which is costing money, that sounds like in a contrast to what SingTel management normally likes to see more of a focus on profitability. Is there any thoughts on agreement or disagreement you have over this strategy? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me talk about new Mio TV content and shift to our ARPU. I think &#x2013; I look at content you know, Mio TV is something like mobile coverage on the mobile service. Actually when &#x2013; when the content in Singapore had an exclusive regime, which is an unique access system content, your coverage of the population was limited. I think as content becomes non-exclusive and we get channel content, we get Chinese content, we get traditional content on some of the other big content producers moving up exclusivity. Then our ability to cover the home factor increase to more and more.</p>
          <p>So I think, without talking about too much detail, right now, we believe that with the content suite that we have recovered slightly more than 50% of the population in terms of the need for entertainment and information. And this content starts to roll-off and just now I talked about Tamil and talked about a significant group of content, there is going to come non-exclusive towards the last quarter of this year then we can talk about next month that would increase our coverage way beyond 50% mark and allowing to appeal to more and more homes.</p>
          <p>So that's the first considering &#x2013; consideration in result to our ARPU. Our ARPU has been climbing up from low 20s, now to close to $30. So I think it is climbing up, but it will continue to grow based on content that we can offer our customers. So, hopefully, Sachin that answers Pay TV question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, Sachin, its Paul here. I'll comment briefly on India. In terms of the strategy, it's been quite clearly signaled as we are looking to protect our scale position in India and after a period in which results have been somewhat soft, we've gone back on the front foot in order to protect our revenue share position and the economics of the business.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the latest results, revenues are up 9% year-on-year and yes it is true that EBITDA has gone backwards and that does reflect some of the changes we have had to make in order to be more competitive. However, it's also important to take account of some of the changes in the environment where they were rules put in place around processing fees that we're able to charge in the quarter et cetera.</p>
          <p>Overall from a directional point of view, minutes of use are up 18% and subscriber share is up, 0.2% year-on-year and 0.4% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>So, we believe that often either strategy is correct, the challenge will be as we move forward to find ways and wish to translate the increase in subscriber share and the increase in traffic into improved profitability. And there's three areas that we would see as important to focus on there.</p>
          <p>The first one is clearly to take advantage of any rationalization of the Indian market, which is still little unclear, but as we greater clarity around spectrum rules and spectrum licenses, we do expect that there will be some rationalization of competitive forces in that market.</p>
          <p>Second is about segmentation. And as we &#x2013; how these customers, how can we find ways in which to segment more effectively, get longer life out of prepaid customers, and for those who have the ability to also sell some services.</p>
          <p>And the third area, which is one in which on which part we have been very good traditionally is around cost out and finding ways we wish to be a lot more efficient and clever about the way in which we support that operation.</p>
          <p>So do we support the strategy? Absolutely. We think that protecting the scale position in India is important. And we also believe the results in terms of minutes and subscribers showed that the strategy is certainly beginning to show signs of succeeding, but clearly the challenge now is to make sure we translate that into profitability moving forward.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Weng just to add to that. When you look at the last few quarters of customer market share you see that Bharti has in fact, rest the decline was last few quarters. So the last quarter, they have more access stabilizing 19.2, which is same as the quarter before.</p>
          <p>Now in this quarter for the aggression in some of the markets, or in some circles for which they are not the challenger. I think the result have shown that they manage to gain the larger number of the share of the net ads. For this quarter; they have gained about 6 million share of the net ads. Turning to results, I know what Bharti wanted to move into...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for the call. I have three questions. First one, could you elaborate a bit more about the ICT revenue increased that we've seen this quarter. How much of this would you say is one-off in nature, and how much of it is recurring? Also with regards to this, the MOE contract, how significant was that within the quarter's revenues and earnings?</p>
          <p>And outside of that I was wondering, could you talk about the handset subsidies in the market going forward, do you think that there is room for this to come down given that there's probably more competition from the Android devices, do we have the hope of subsidies for the future iPhone coming down or do we think that it's status-quo? And finally with regards to the fiber business, what percentage of the customers that you are taking on upgrade us from ADSO, as you mentioned, and what percentage would be new to SingTel as such?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The ICT revenue growth last part, there are two &#x2013; there are two key parts of it. One is from our IT business they know the timing of project completions keeping a milestone on MOE contract. So that revenue recognition there. And of course, the other bid is on our role as a key subcontractor for OpenNet in the rollout of the fiber networks. So we are at the tier end now. So these are &#x2013; again there are some completion revenues that we have picked up.</p>
          <p>So we have earlier guided that about of the rollout revenue for OpenNet would be accounted for by this year. There will still be some rollout but the numbers will be significantly lower. The ICT &#x2013; the IT business obviously we will continue to hope to see good growth there. We've got a very healthy order book in excess of S$2 billion as of now. So, maybe I can now pass to Moon to take the handset question and the fiber question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes, I think when you look at handset subsidy, we do not see significant shift in the level of subsidy for smartphones in Singapore. And obviously that's got to do with competitive environment whether how much subsidy is given in a particular market. The reason why you see many people talking about Android having lower subsidy to iPhone is really because of the wide range of Android phones. You know you have got low-end Android phones to high-end Android phones versus iPhone which is only one phone.</p>
          <p>So, on average obviously Android has a much lower subsidy if you take in of the low end and high end phone. But generally, I think the handset subsidy is stable and it will be dependent on whether consumers are actually buying higher value plans because if they take on higher value plan, naturally the subsidy will be higher and if they take on lower value plan the subsidy is lower. So, if you look at our quarter-on-quarter increase in subsidies they're  primarily because of the mix of customer is trading up to a higher value plan.</p>
          <p>In the case of fiber, I think your question is whether how many percent of our 39,000 are actually new and how many percent are actually upgraded. So, maybe I'll address the question a bit differently. If you look at entire Singapore market, there are about 1.1 million household and if you look at the fixed broadband penetration it's almost at 95%. So primarily everyone who needs a fixed broadband at home already has got a fixed broadband service whether it is with SingTel or with another service provider. So in the race to convert to fibre basically the whole Singapore is really trying to see how many of the existing fixed service provider whether it's on DSL on cable are migrating into fibre.</p>
          <p>One way to look at the split is if you look at our ADSL or non-fibre market share versus our fibre market share, we know that from the latest report that comes from Idea website in May our fibre market share sits around 58% to about 60%. And I think that is quite consistent even if you look at June numbers. Whereas, If you look at the overall market share for fixed broadband in Singapore we are still in the high 40s percentage in terms of market share. So generally we believe we are gaining a lot more fibre customers and in the long run if we continue to go at 59% &#x2013; 58% to 60%, we will be gaining share in the home broadband space.</p>

          <p>Hi everyone. I just had three questions. Firstly, can you maybe talk about the early trends in the 4G take up in Singapore. I know its early days? And in Australia, can you maybe give some color on your 4G rollout plans in terms of timing, cost coverage just basically in light of Telshe's plan to stay on 1.2 billion next year and in the mobile network?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in terms of the 800 million of this deal with the government, can you just discuss how this deal actually works and whether there are any protection if there is a change in government policy? And thirdly, assuming if there is a pickup in fixed broadband, just wondering whether this is driven by the S$89 on this bundle with the 50 gig broadband? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sock you want to? Maybe you want to talk about 4G pick up in our Singapore first then I think we can pick up two other questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the 4G question. I think we launched 4G smartphones in Singapore in June. Obviously that has got to the pickup of truly two things. First the overall coverage of 4G network in Singapore and second the availability of smartphones there are 4G. So in terms of 4G smartphones, there are actually only three phones that we currently have in the market; HTC 1XL, Samsung Galaxy S2, LG model. So there are only three models and with these three models, we are seeing slight pickup in terms of numbers. We expect more 4G handsets to be ready by end of this year. And we've seen more hand phones being available, we expect to pick up to be much faster towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And that will be in conjunction with our network rollout itself, because we have announced that by end of this year our 4G network coverage will be more like 80% of the island and by first quarter, next year it will be more like 95% of the whole island being covered. So, we think we are rolling out the network access timely in time to take advantage of the availability of handset that 4G ending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to turn to Kevin and Murray in Australia to talk a little bit about the 4G rollout, also about our broadband strength. And finally, I might ask Murray to talk a little bit about the NBN deal and how it will work in terms about migration of customers? Kevin, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. So, 4G plans where right in markets today and business in Sydney and Perth those networks in 4G launched just a couple of weeks ago. We will introduce our end-to-consumer in a period of weeks rather than months I don't know the specific date, but I would say measure in weeks rather than months. And we'll also be looking at Melbourne in that rollout.</p>
          <p>This is part of our comprehensive focus in our networks. So I think we have to view in the context of the reforming exercises underway for the last six months across Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, which are all pretty much completed, as well as all other key networks in Australia, which are rolling out towards the end of this year, as well as efforts to upgrade transmission, as well as activity to expand our joint venture with Vodafone.</p>
          <p>I think the key metric that we see around 4G as we are really focused in Australia just now and the customer experience side of which network is key and a system to get churn levels to stronger levels. And so obviously investment in 3G and HSPA of course are also pretty critical just now. Telesat's plans, we are aware of, we're looking them carefully but unquestionably we are largely focused in metro and focused around our core profitability of our existing base. Murray, on broadband.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, you have seen a lift in our overall broadband customers, fixed broadband customers in the quarter, so from 9.65 end of last quarter to 9.93 at the end of this quarter that is in part due to the product construct we've had in the market one of those product construct is the mobile bundled products at S$29 as you say S$0 broadband 50-gig was also a consequence of improving sales productivity in the like. So number of factors have contributed to the increase in the customer numbers in our fixed broadband portfolio. In relation to the question on the HSPA given how it works. The payments to us on the basis of migration of HSPA customers on to the NBN network we do have certain protection in the contract if there's a structural change with regard to the NBN arrangements around the HSPA footprint rollout including if the government of the die was to change substantially than NBN roll out arrangements, so we do have that protection in the agreement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a few more questions on Optus. Firstly you've done a Vivid wireless acquisition in the quarter. I was just wondering how much revenue that bought in and how many sales that bought in? And secondly, just looking again at the future for Optus you've just declined revenue I think 3.2% in the quota you're still looking for slight single digit growth for the year I was just wondering if you can talk about some of the drivers that are going to get you there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask Paul and I'm going to ask Murray and Kevin to handle that. But as we talk about Vivid I think the other thing we might talk about is just the fact that it gives us an unparallel opportunity to deploy that 2300 for 4G. And I'll let Murray talk a little bit about some of the drivers that we look at as we look at the shape of revenue over the next few quarter. But clearly we don't want to give a forecast or to in any way we seem to talking about qualifying guidance but over to you Kevin maybe to start on Vivid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes its Murray here. In relation to vivid contract as you saw we announced to at the back end of the quarter. So in relation to the revenue contribution and capital number of contribution is very small. The contribution we don't disclose in specific numbers around it, but it is a very immaterial contribution given highlight in the quarter the transaction was promoted. In relation to the guides as Paul said we don't provide any specific guidance or forecast we have provided if we got. I would point to some of the underlying trends however. So in relation to now overall revenue decline it's really as a consequence of the mobile termination rate declined, equipment revenue decline and the device repayment plan in credit. As we look forward you can see &#x2013; at our outgoing service revenue we have disclosed mobile economic service revenue is positive if you exclude the device repayment plan credit. And so it was underlying credit there with regard to positive service revenue growth for outgoing and the equipment revenue is obviously a consequent of shipments in any one period and mobile termination rates, again, will be with this for the remainder of the year.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. I have two quick questions. One, I was wondering, if you could give more color regarding the future for wireless data revenue growth in the Singapore domestic market. And we've seen it stick at 42% as a percentage of revenue after past couple of quarters now. I'm just wondering given 70% smartphone penetration rate, if there is any upside to that level. Or if we've seen that re-rating and we're now basically rebased at a new level?</p>
          <p>And then second question is regarding staffing costs here in Singapore. Obviously, high inflation in Singapore as a market, we saw on our analysis about 6.5% increase in monthly wages for staff on a year-on-year basis. Should we expect to see continued pressure on that line item? Or is there anything that can be done on a salary basis to keep that line item in check moving forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On wireless data, I think if you look at when we announced our LTE and chip trend, repricing of our marketing chip plan. This is really to position ourselves to ensure that the data growth is good to be in parallel with the way we grow our network. And the way consumers start to change their usage behavior, switching from voice, SMSing to data. So during the time when I announced it in June, I explained that 90% of our customers are all using within their 2-gig data plan or 3-gig or 4-gig data plan, the new chip plan.</p>
          <p>We expect this to change overtime especially when LTE phones are being introduced. As we have seen over the years, most platform users, more usage of data overtime. So I think this will be progressively growing the data contribution in overall revenue. I think that we have seen in the past few quarters that data contribution will inch up 1, 2 percentage points over a period of next few quarters. So we don't expect that trend to change. In fact, it may accelerate a little bit faster with LTE becoming mainstream from next year onwards.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. In response to the question on staffing, staffing cost levels, we are focused on staff productivity. And so we're continue to look at productivity measures whether through automation, through streamlining of the organization or through use of outsource vendors. So we'll continue to look at those productivity measures. Half or 50% of our cost, staffing cost, staff head count in Singapore is again related to NCS and the ICT Group and that is very tied into project revenues and project delivery. So we do look at project margin quite closely.</p>
          <p>I think the other point to note about staffing cost for the Group, you see that the Group has been quite proactive in how staff costs have been structured within the Group. There is a healthy mix of fixed cost as well as variable cost. So it allows us to adjust, should there be a slowdown or and obviously to compensate for strong performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could maybe, just one follow-up on that. You've guided over of course past couple of calls that the NBN fiber rollout project will be concluding largely this year. Will there be a reduction in staff and a reduction in overall staff expense that will be associated with the termination of part the completion of that contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In spite of the NBN fiber rollout, the project has been basically leased off either in-house dedicated to the project or through the use of subsequent-contractors that we manage very closely. So obviously that's very much tied to the project. So as and when as the project sailed off, we would be exiting some of those subsequent-contract arrangement as well as redeploying the staff.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for the call. Just a couple of questions from me. Just in the context of Optus in the mobile growth, I know you've inspecting on yield management and but when I look at &#x2013; when we look at a lot of the growth seems to be coming from the wholesale brands, so if you can just give us some context of i.e. growing your retail brands versus the wholesale brands. I know we are using whole proportion to yes there might be part in rounding but it looks like it's just purely coming from the wholesale side of the business?</p>
          <p>Secondly, the wholesale satellite is pretty strong, can you just give us a sense how is that was coming from the NBN Interim Satellite deal? And just lastly on the NBN deal itself the 100 million deal, or how much you were assuming at present value basis can you give us, is that correct, can you give us idea on just how what the 800 million looks like on a nominal cash flow basis? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah &#x2013; just come back to frame it that you just spot on, we have focused on profitable growth during the last three to six months. I think it's fair to say, we have focused more on getting or strengthened in retail, not the strength we have in terms of strengthening wholesale.</p>
          <p>So I think we have seen &#x2013; I guess a balance in here over the next six to 12 months. We have initially made changes in retail. We're changing wholesale to come. Murray?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Satellite, on the wholesale revenue performance, Satellite was a major contributor as a consequence of as the provision of Satellite services to NBN Co. So it is the primary contributor to Satellite growth.</p>
          <p>However; would know, we have announced in the quarter some significant Satellite deals to increase in the New South Wales Education Department. We've got enhanced Satellite services to distant education and renewal of the rising provision of broadcast services. So we continue to support or Satellite business continues to win significant business.</p>
          <p>In relation to your question on HSC deal, I would confirm that the 800 million required is on net present value basis. We don't disclose the growth of value of that. So obviously, we're telling one subject &#x2013; telling one payments.</p>
          <p>We do expect the payment to all the migration to commence around 2014 onward and then it's obviously the NPV is subject to the timing, not any of the comments, but of the overall rollout of NBN in HSC footprint.</p>

          <p>Hi, look there have been a couple of questions on the quality of the Optus result, which there are couple of good underlying signs with the percentage of postpaid growing in 3G and the fall in text and so on, but I just wonder how, what we should read into the decline in mobile broadband subscribers and also the fairly rapid decline in average revenue is there two kind of flies in the ointment in that quality story. And I guess, this is the third quarter now we've seen a big increase in the capital spending, it's not all going on mobile, there is some in satellite and elsewhere, but you do seem well set as you're rolling out that LTE network with capacity to compete on in terms of quality of service rather than necessarily through as you've seen in previous times for price discounting and subsidy and so on, and I wonder whether how that's going to &#x2013; how that might tie up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Again, I am going to advise the Australian team to talk about these &#x2013; but I &#x2013; I think absolutely when we look at mobile broadband, I think what the team will talk about our focus on profitable customers and the decisions we've made to pull back from chasing volume for volume sake. Likewise, when you pointed out there is some important trends to understand in terms of ARPU inside the base and Murray can disaggregate that for us. Likewise as we talk about the capital spending, I'll invite Kevin and Murray to give you some profile of that, so over to you Kevin and Murray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies, Ian if I don't cover them all. There's quite a few questions in that. I think on the mobile broadband subscriber side, unquestionably we'll pull back on subsidies and focus on profitable growth. We're not inclined just now to subsidize significantly on iPads, and I think there is another key nuance here which is &#x2013; we are excited as a group the potential in 4G and obviously with the network growing out or launching in consumer over the next one or two months we see that as they will see more of the &#x2013; the growth opportunity of mobile broadband seen in 3G. And I think one of the key benefits on 4G is the network capacity, the network economics, not just the speed. So I think just strategically we do feel as if the growth should come over the next two or three years more on &#x2013; on the 4G platform than in the 3G platform.</p>
          <p>So you've kind of nailed it in terms of the position and quality. We are absolutely focused on strengthening the network. As I get our foundation to &#x2013; to fundamentally overhaul and strengthen or improve customer experience and a differentiation at ground level has to come then forward in customer experience, relevant too in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:38) also.</p>
          <p>But that's directionally where we are, where we are going and dare I say what's what. I guess you can see it in the trends just now. SAC coming down is part of the &#x2013; I think they also watch for churn level coming down over the next 12 to 24 months that will be the other key one we'll be focused on.</p>
          <p>In terms of ARPU downdrafts, Murray, I think we have contamination rates are in there, we've got device repayment plans in there, other headwinds, one more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think Ian as you see in the MD&amp;A, you're seeing quarter-on-quarter our prepaid ARPU stabilize, our postpaid ARPU as you've rightly pointed out is down, around 9%. But if you exclude the mobile termination rate and the service credits associated with device repayment plan is down 3%.</p>
          <p>That's a consequence of the increased data allowance that's been in the market for some time. However, I would point out you've seen us reprice our postpaid services at recent times. Telstra has followed in relation to that. So you're seeing some repricing in the marketplace in relation to data pricing in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so finally, I just pick up and closing Ian just to reinforce to everybody the focus that we have on mobile quality. If you look what we've been doing over the last six months to nine months in mobile; first of all, our shift and our migration of customers to low frequency 3G bands is well underway and we're already seeing significant changes in customer profile. We've got about a 20% uplift in data traffic in areas where we've already migrated customers to a low band frequency.</p>
          <p>Second thing we'll be doing is running out HSPA plus, which we call 3G plus more extensively. Third thing we have, as Kevin mentioned is we've launched 4G and that roleout is now moving into the additional cities.</p>
          <p>Fifth is the announcement of our extension of our joint venture with VHA. That's all about helping us manage the cost line as we invest, as well as giving us early access to a large number of metropolitan sites over the next couple of years and therefore, accelerate our rollout of more depth and capacity into Metro, particularly for data.</p>
          <p>And finally, there's a Vivid acquisition which gives us access to 2,300 megahertz frequency, which as we've previously said, we see as an opportunity for us to launch a high-speed, high-quality network as we've got a reasonable amount of spectrum that's been available to us there. So significant work underway to lift mobile network quality and ultimately perception in the Australian market.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have got three questions here. The first, well, when you look at Bharti's earnings which are suffering from losses, mainly &#x2013; much of them coming from Africa. And now Telecom is serious about expansion in Myanmar. So what is your view on overseas expansion of telecom, especially when they are substantial contributor of the dividends? And what can you do to address the weakness of your minority state model in <mark type="ph" /> theater (55:47) That's my question number one.</p>
          <p>Second question is, your local competitor StarHub recently talked about increasing CapEx to grow enterprise broadband. So what are your views and which area do you think is area where they can target and which is area where you think it is difficult for them to match up with you?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on your mobile market share strategy. Yes, we have seen your acquisition cost are not coming down, we can see you are clearly &#x2013; your market share gains continue, so what is the ultimate end game here. Because definitely you are not chasing profitability in the Singapore market you are chasing probably your multimedia, but then how long can it continue? And what should be the end result here? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin. Can you repeat your first question, before the Telecom question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically I'm just giving you an example of Bharti that, that Bharti's African expansion is not paying off &#x2013; actually it's going to red in a big way as of now we can see. So I'm just taking example and saying now Telecom is serious about expansion in Myanmar. So what can you do about this whole issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I would say that, it may not be fair to Bharti to say that African investments have not paid off yet, they have not paid off. I think if you look at the first two posts &#x2013; the first two years of the investment, you have seen significant improvement in the African parameters of &#x2013; all the African assets that they have. They have gained revenue market share in all the markets and I know the first year there was a lot of heavy lifting to be done, fixing the network, fixing the IT system, getting pricing in place.</p>
          <p>So first year you've probably didn't see as much. I think after the first two years you've already seen significant improvement in African operation. So I think the jury is still out on Bharti investment into Africa. I think Telecom plans in Myanmar, frankly it's really not for us to comment. Actually we have no idea what they are doing in Myanmar, but I should say that SingTel as we look at overseas investments, we're always been disciplined, obviously you would have to make an assessment of &#x2013; where the market potential is. You never have perfect information when you make this investment decision. I think on balance, I think we have been very disciplined and how &#x2013; in various market entry strategies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly that's my point. You are very disciplined, but your associates are not, so what can you do...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like as I said, I think &#x2013; jury is still out on Bharti's African investments. We all agree that Africa is probably one of the last remaining emerging markets where penetration is still relatively low, competitive intensity not like what we are seeing in most of the other markets as well. I think this investments that we make, tend to have longer gestation and payback period. And I think we need to give management an opportunity to execute on a strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps investment in enterprise broadband, you want to talk about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think you know <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:17) in terms of our own investment of Singapore; we have guided 950 million for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And question is, is there a risk to the enterprise business of SingTel given that you probably enjoy more than 80% market share in this particular segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we &#x2013; even prior to NBN in Singapore, we have completed fiber to most of the business buildings. We always see our competition with the -- you know what MMC contracts more with the GSPs, the Global Service Providers than the Local Service Providers, because you need extensive infrastructure internationally not just in Singapore. Serving the SMEs I think you know you've seen our big move into the cloud services, I think that has allowed us, to move competition away purely from just providing assets and carriage.</p>
          <p>So we'll see how competition in enterprise space plays out with NBN, but you can see that we have been preparing ourselves. You've seen us adjust pricing of some of our data products. We have brought in a wider range of data products of different speeds. But I think more and more it's around serving and overall solutions to our cost services, than purely competing on the basis of prices or connectivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the mobile market share in Singapore, I think first of all, let me &#x2013; I think we do not just purely pursue higher market share for the signals, higher market share. That's not only, we do look at gaining customers who are profitable. And if you look at the subsidy while we have been pretty consistent for the running quarter we do not believe we have got higher subsidy than what our competitors are offering. I mean, the easy way to look at this is to look at retail offers. I think the pricing of the phones are actually quite comparable. So we believe the market is very rational and the subsidy for the market is quite comparable.</p>
          <p>And beyond just acquiring the profitable customer in terms of gaining share, SingTel has got definitely bigger play behind which is swappable having a quad play customer. We are selling more bundled services, fixed and mobile together, and beyond just quad play service, I think it also plays very well into our future digitalized services. I think Allen can talk a bit more about what are the new services that we can overlay onto our larger mobile market based in Singapore. Allen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. I think it's important for everyone to understand maybe at the end of this day how do we get more growth for SingTel into our existing quad businesses. And to go, I think in the context of what's happening to our industry and what's happening to adjacent industries around us, especially now with the internet being so prevalent and faster and faster network.</p>
          <p>So I think for us and SingTel at the end of the day, it's no more growth in Singapore and particularly in Singapore in terms of getting more carriage customers, but yes we want to acquire a greater market share, because we believe that with the new services that we are going to bring into the market targeted particularly in mobile customers, we will be able to get two new sources of revenue. One is the obvious one in terms of advertising revenue, but targeted advertising revenue that's why the acquisition of Amobee gives us a leg-up in Singapore and eventually into our associate markets as well.</p>
          <p>The second and it's starting to come into play is transaction revenue with NFC and the mobile payments that triggered off the smartphone and the devices that are in the smartphone. It gives us a greater capability to get transaction revenue and as we are starting to see, with cinemas, with taxies, and so experience we are getting from our defined product enhancing, we are able to get greater revenues into that space.</p>
          <p>And then finally, obviously, it's in the entertainment space, people carry around a smart device, they're able to play better and better games, they're able to watch certain TV programs. The ability to repackage entertainment for the mobile users, we have another revenue stream.</p>
          <p>So I think it's the mindset shift in terms of where we're getting our revenue that's important. And hence the bigger the base, the greater the calls get advertising, transaction and entertainment revenue.</p>
