          <p>Good day and welcome to the Munich Re Preliminary Key Figures 2009 and Renewals Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Christian Becker-Hussong. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to you all. Just a quick introduction from my side as usual, Joerg will kick-off with a few statements on the 2009 preliminary financial results and present the key figures to you. We will provide a detailed analysis of last year's financial performance on March 10. Torsten today will then take you through the most relevant findings of the outcome of the January 2010 renewals, and afterwards there will be plenty of time for Q&amp;A. However, in order to keep &#x2013; to give everybody a fair chance to participate in the discussion, would you please limit your questions to a maximum of two per person please.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Joerg, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to present rather good result for 2009. The numbers I will &#x2013; we have shown you here are reliable already. We also have lots of more information available, but we still need a couple of days for the quality assurance. Therefore, I beg for your understanding that I would not like to dig too deep into the one or the other topic. And so, I'd start with the overview on slide three.</p>
          <p>Our gross written premium was up by 9.5%, so we had a very strong top line development. This was driven by large solvency relief deals in life and health reinsurance and by the first time consolidation of the acquisitions of the preceding years.</p>
          <p>We achieved a consolidated result of 2.56 billion and with that we meet our over the cycle return on risk adjusted capital target of 15%. Our shareholders' equity went up by 1.2 billion to 22.3 billion. The small decrease in the fourth quarter is due to the share buy-back, due to technical effects of the acquisition of 5% of the ERGO shares from UniCredit Group and due to a decrease of unrealized gains and losses on our fixed interest security portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our return on investment was 4.3%. Reinsurance showed a strong underwriting performance which was partly based on a low level of natural catastrophe losses. We had a substantial improvement in primary insurance. The result of &#x20AC;380 million is a simple sum of the primary insurance segment before consolidation. After consolidation ERGO's results: ERGO's net profit was &#x20AC;173 million for the full year and 100 million for the fourth quarter on a standalone basis.</p>
          <p>This is a good result with an increase in premium income of some &#x20AC;500 million. A good combined ratio, an increased investment result, an improved expense basis and particularly favorable change in taxes supported by release of tax provisions in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now to the key figures on slide four. The premium developments you can find later on slide five. Combined ratio in reinsurance 95.3 &#x2013; allow me a few additional words on it, 95.3% of net earned premiums, the overall combined ratio thereof 2.4% from natural catastrophes of the year 2009, minus the run-off gains of roughly 1% for natural catastrophes of the preceding years, which means overall a burden from natural catastrophes of just 1.4% of net earned premiums. This is a little bit over 5% below our expectation of 6.5%.</p>
          <p>With our manmade major claims we had the opposite effect. 6.8 percentage points was between 2 and 2.5% higher than our five-year average. On balance, the major losses contributed some 2.5 to 3% below the expected level. That means so our result was favorably impacted by a lower level of major losses.</p>
          <p>Among the man-made major losses, more than half was due to the effect of the current recession, roughly &#x20AC;500 million, which is 3.8% of our net earned premiums. Including here, trade credit, surety and the like, and some increase in our D&amp;O reserve.</p>
          <p>Talking reserves, we had movements in both directions, up for general liability business outside of the USA, down across many lines of business and geographies. Including also the already mentioned natural catastrophe property run-off, positive run-off. On balance, we had a small positive contribution to our earnings from the run-off of our reserves.</p>
          <p>On slide five, there is the investment result. Sorry &#x2013; I go back to slide four with combined ratio primary insurance, which I had forgotten which would have been a pity, because it was quite pleasing in the fourth quarter with 90%. This is an improvement of 3.8% and also for the full year the 93.1 is little bit worse than in the preceding year, but still clearly below our 95% target. Our dividend per share went &#x2013; should go up by $0.25 or 4.5% to &#x20AC;5, 75%, this is the proposal of the Board of Management to the Supervisory Board and to the AGM, in April.</p>
          <p>Now really to the premium development, slide five. As you can see here we had slightly negative impact from exchange rate developments. 1.2 billion of the overall increase was due to the acquisitions. Hartford Steam Boiler was 450 million; Midlands was roughly 200 million; Sterling was plus 184 and Bank Austria Versicherung in Austria, a subsidiary of ERGO was little bit more than 300 million.</p>
          <p>More than the acquisitions the organic change contributed to the strong growth and here especially from, driven by the large quota share deals which were written in reinsurance life and health. And as you can see in the lower part of this chart, reinsurance life went up by 33% and in health by even 72%, Munich Re was here the preferred partner for special multi-year contracts with which the respective clients could improve their capital position.</p>
          <p>Primary insurance on the right hand side of that slide, we were growing in primary property-casualty in Germany and abroad in original currency terms, but the latter; our business abroad was impacted by negative currency impacts, especially here in the strongly growing companies in Poland and Turkey.</p>
          <p>Our business in primary life insurance went up by 4%. Our new business was strong, especially abroad, mainly driven by the development in Austria from Bank Austria Versicherung. In Germany, we grew somewhat below market average; we had a decline in regular premiums which was only partly due to the recent step which was done in the preceding year, but beyond that most probably recession related. But we had a strong growth in single premium business also in Germany. You can find details on the new business in life insurance, life primary insurance in the appendix, on slide 18.</p>
          <p>Now coming to the investment results &#x2013; we had an improvement to an investment result of 7.9 billion euros, which translates into a return on investment of 4.3%; you can find some details on the bottom of slide six.</p>
          <p>And here you see the quite obvious reason. We had a sharp decline, a sharp improvement with regards to write-ups/write-downs and here especially a reduction of the write-downs on our equities portfolio. If I might remind you here in 2008, our equities portfolio was to a large extent hedged by derivatives, so we had the negative effect from the write-downs, which was to a large extent compensated by gains from the disposal of these derivatives and therefore the result from the gains and losses on the disposal of investments went down between 2008 and 2009 by &#x20AC;600 million. So this is nothing to worry, because &#x20AC;1.6 billion positive impact is still quite a good number for 2009.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for 2010, we expect some more declines in regular income due to a lower level of reinvestment yields; so slightly, very slightly below 4% or around 4% running yields. We do not expect any major impact from gains on the disposal of investments; at least we do not plan for such gains from disposal also in order to support the underwriting discipline in all our businesses.</p>
          <p>With more or less unchanged administration expenses, we expect a return on investment between 3.6 and 3.8%. I would again like to emphasize without major positive impact from gains or losses on the disposal of investments.</p>
          <p>So far with the investment result for 2009; now finally a quick look on our well balanced investment portfolio on page seven; and this picture here is more or less unchanged like in the preceding years we have a shift from fixed interest securities to loans, this has to do with more favorable accounting treatment of loans. They are somewhat immunized against a potential spike in interest rates, because they are not always valued mark-to-market on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Apart from it, this is not a major economic movement here. So this picture here looks more or less unchanged; the same applies for page eight for our fixed interest part of the portfolio, still well balanced, moderate risk, corporate somewhat up by 2% and I would like to emphasize that we had some very good tactical movements in the course of the year 2009.</p>
          <p>From the beginning of 2009, we started a gradual expansion of high-quality corporate bonds in our portfolio, and the spread on the corporate bonds started to decline after the first quarter through all the three remaining quarters until the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>So, we fully participated in the spread tightening during the whole year, and in January 2010 we have consequently realized a part of our gains by the disposal of approximately 2 billion of our corporate bonds. On the whole, corporate bond portfolio, we obtained a total return in the course of the year 2009 of 14%. So, quite good tactical moves done by our asset manager MEAG, and by the ALM responsible persons in the respective companies.</p>
          <p>So far with our investment portfolio, I would now like to hand over to Torsten for his report on the renewal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As like every year, I report on the January 1 renewal of our non-life treaty book of business. And let me start with some remarks about the market environment and the competition.</p>
          <p>January 1 renewal took place in a more competitive environment, even a bit more competitive than we expected in November last year. The fast recovery of the financial market took place faster than we anticipated; this strengthened the balance sheets of insurance and reinsurance, the capital base did increase.</p>
          <p>What was the effect on the supply and demand side? First supply side, there was plenty of capacity available in all lines of business. There was hardly any business which could not be placed in the renewal.</p>
          <p>The available insurance and reinsurance business did shrink as a consequence of the economic crisis. This of course led to increased level of competition. But if we compare the competition today with 10 years ago, the last big soft market environment, then we have to say that they offer price reductions today were still on a sort of rational level. One broker recently described that this is with an orderly soft link which is in our opinion, a fair description.</p>
          <p>In some segments, midsize reinsures, sometimes midsize reinsures with lower security. We're aiming for higher shares or even lead positions. And when companies decided to go for the cheapest price they sometimes could achieve that. On the demand side our clients were under cost pressure, more cost pressure than before which affected their reinsurance budget, their internal reinsurance budget as well.</p>
          <p>So there was increased pressure to reduce reinsurance expenditures in the renewal. Some of our clients' insurance companies decided to buy less reinsurance capacity vis-&#xE0;-vis last year, as they could not or were not willing to pay higher reinsurance rates out of their softer original rates.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance security was not adequately reflected when final price or placement decisions were made except under few solvency relief covers or very complex business where a continued flight to quality was still in place.</p>
          <p>I switch to slide 11 now, and would like to answer questions, how did Munich Re maneuver through this renewal, how were we affected? First, our positioning as service reinsurer providing best security, largest capacities and best technical know-how made us again to a preferred partner for all sort of high-access and complex business or know-how driven business like pharmaceutical business, offshore energy business, D&amp;O type business, etcetera.</p>
          <p>I would also like to remark here that we were again in the first quarter the first address in the market for solvency relief type transactions. In Q4, we could write again reinsurance covers in life and health, which serve our clients as an alternative refinancing instrument. So remember, we wrote some of these very large transactions in Q2 and Q3. This trend is not as big anymore, but still continues. As a consequence of this trend, particularly in life and health, we expect for 2010 an additional premium contribution to the reinsurance segment in the order of &#x20AC;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>In non-life business, we were sticking to our underwriting policy profit before volume and before &#x2013; in pursuit of strict cycle management policy as in the years before. We deliberately gave up volume to keep our profitability on an almost unchanged level.</p>
          <p>The bulk of our business shows now flat or slightly reducing rates in loss affected segments, like storm Spain &#x2013; remember storm clouds last year affected the country; in credit business; in aviation. We could achieve very reasonable price increases. In terms and conditions, the clauses remained very unchanged, were not negatively affected by the renewal.</p>
          <p>So I change to slide number 12 and come to the figures in detail. The renewable non-life treaty book had a size of 7.9 billion premium. This represents 56% of our total non-life book, which is a bit below our last year's level. Remember, last year, this was a share of about 66%. This share of the January 1 treaty book reduced now due to the increased contribution of Midland and Hartford Steam Boiler, which are not part of our treaty book.</p>
          <p>Due to insufficient rates, we decided to give up the premium volume of &#x20AC;1.15 billion, which is 14.6% of the renewable premium income. And this could only to some extent be compensated 660 million by new business, which is 8.3%.</p>
          <p>Because of softer prices, we also decided not to fully deploy our full cap capacity under the non-proportionate cap cover, in the peak scenarios European windstorm and U.S. hurricane; and in both scenarios, we observed rate reductions in the U.S. more than on the European windstorm. But U.S. coming from a better price level.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of this strict cycle management policy, we reduced on an overall basis our premium volume by 6.7%; and the pure price change after elimination of our exposure-based premium changes, is almost flat minus 0.3%. That means almost favorable profitability levels for the remaining smaller portfolio.</p>
          <p>We are absolutely convinced, only because we decided to give up the substantial premium volume 6.7%. We could achieve such a pleasing stable rate change result in our portfolio and could decouple ourself from the general and market movements. And one word to our underwriters here in business divisions, they did in our opinion a very good job and have taken the right decisions and measure in this difficult renewal.</p>
          <p>And next slide, slide number 13. And what does this mean now for our premium split by region and by line of business? At a first glance, you see hardly any changes on this slide; and of course that is explainable, because the price changes and the competition was almost similar or unchanged over all the regions in the world.</p>
          <p>But let's look deeper into the various lines of business. In casualty, rates declined in line with other lines of business; but coming from lower profitability levels. There were only a few segments in casualty with rate increases like D&amp;O in financial institutions, professional indemnity and motor U.K.</p>
          <p>Our premium volume declined, however here only by two percentage points, which seems to be low or small. This is explainable because of very special new business we could write. One business segment which is new or increased is the Admiral relationship that was already reported in the press recently, where we concluded new treaties on a multiyear and long term basis, which support their expansion into other regions, particular into the U.S.</p>
          <p>And then we could write very few private treaties in Asia, sovereignty relief type treaties; and without these specific two relationship type treaties, we would have lost about 10% of our volume. So as casualty special consideration, our special impact from new businesses.</p>
          <p>In property, the property business was driven by a softer Cat rate in most parts of the world in the order of minus five to minus 10%. I mentioned already U.S. was more affected, but coming from better levels. The rest of property was basically driven by the client-specific performance of the treaties. So loss affected treaties, got rate increases in general flat rate reductions.</p>
          <p>One comment about marine business. This line of business had the largest volume decline in our portfolio, about 18%. You see that in the backup, 18%. And this is mainly caused of course by the reduction of the original premiums, due to lower turnovers of the policyholders. So here you see really the impact of the economic crisis and the consequential reduction of less premium income in this line of business. Otherwise, the rates were flat or reduced by single-digit percentages in marine.</p>
          <p>Credit business, we have to report an opposite development between our premium volume, which declined by 8%; and the rate increase in this book of business by about 15%. The lack of the rate increase, it's a reflection of increases of the original rates in the proportionate treaties, which were implemented by the large credit insurers during the course of 2009.</p>
          <p>In addition, it should be noted that our combined ratio in credit in 2009 was adversely impacted by large surety losses. We reported already about these losses, so-called first demand policies in the Asian shipbuilding industry. This business, this specific business is cancelled and fully reserved and cannot cause further adverse loss development in 2010.</p>
          <p>So considering in credit, the rate increases, the tight capacity management, and the restructuring of our credit and surety book, we expect a return in 2010 into the profitability; so that means a combined ratio below 100%.</p>
          <p>Aviation is a positive exception from the general trend. In aviation, we expect the premium volume increase by 9%. After all the airline accidents in the last two years, the aviation market did harden. The threat in the business in general decreased, had rate increases by more 20%. These rate improvements in the fleet business are however not shown here in the chart, as this is single risk business which we renew in the Q4. Here you see only the 1% rate increase which is in general aviation business.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, slide 14. Here are a few examples of the largest portfolio movements. First, you see here that we reduced considerable volume in our proportional motor book, minus &#x20AC;190.4 million. This is motor business which, because of rate reductions, ran into the unprofitability range, particularly in Eastern Europe, Germany and to a smaller extent in China.</p>
          <p>I reported already credit where you see here that we gave a premium volume under the surety and structured-credit business. And we should also mention that we could write some attractive new businesses in U.K. we benefit in our proportional book of business from the rate increases in the original influence market, rate increases reached about 12% that has a positive premium contribution of 83 million. And we could expand our business in a moderate way by a few short-tail lines and because of a few private solvency relief transactions.</p>
          <p>All in all, I would like to summarize that what cycle management pure would be applied only because of significant reduction of our premium volume, we were able to keep profitability unchanged, more or less. And I think, in the coming months, and the coming renewal, you will see a very unchanged renewal policy of the Munich Re.</p>
          <p>Back to Joerg Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Torsten. So this is bottom line orientation at work. This is also the reason why we achieved the good 2009 result in a challenging environment, and it was also supported by our very resilient investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our solid capitalization and the good performance of 2009 allows us to increase a dividend to &#x20AC;5.75 per share. As you know, our bottleneck is, in principle, the revenue reserve, but the current level, which should be in the order of 3.3 billion at the end of 2009, allows us to increase the dividend and to continue with the share buyback. By the AGM in April, we want to have done 1 billion &#x2013; roughly 1 billion &#x2013; of which one-half has already been done. So overall, this is a cash payout for this 12-month period of &#x20AC;2.1 billion, which is very strong.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we are confident that we deliver good earnings on a sustainable basis.  The 2 billion, which we repeatedly quoted here should form kind of floor here. Our realism with regard to the expectations, especially on the investment side, will not restrict us from grasping attractive business opportunities wherever they might come. In all areas, in insurance and in investments, attractive means that risks must be adequately priced for, and you can rely on Munich RE's discipline.</p>
          <p>So far from our side, and we look forward to your questions now.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll now take our first question from William Morgan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I just have couple of questions. First one is, I didn't see anywhere, you talking about a split between non-proportional and proportional business. Can you comment on to what extent that has changed, and whether or not that's had any bearing on the level of volume that you've sacrificed?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about to what extent Solvency II has kind of influenced the behavior during renewals. I mean, you pointed to some capital relief deals that you've done, but you do also mention that you're not getting paid for your balance sheets at the moment. I just wondered if you can give us some qualitative thoughts about how the industry is really behaving in the run-up to Solvency II. Any color there would be useful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill, for your questions. Indeed, we did not choose proportional and non-proportional split for one very simple reason. It was so unspectacular this year. It's almost unchanged. That means the split, when you take the three excessive loss, proportional and non-proportional business is in the order of 60-20-20. In the treaty book, it's 80 proportional; 20, non-proportional.</p>
          <p>So that is almost unchanged. That means premium reductions in general took place through the whole book of business in a more or less proportionate way.</p>
          <p>Solvency II has had an impact already in the renewal? No, not yet. We say and we are confident that it will have an impact in the future for two very specific reasons. One is the diversification in the owned portfolio and in the reinsurance portfolio will have an impact on the capitalization, on the capital base of the companies. So that the session into a more diversified portfolio will be measured and will payoff in the future. And the second reason is the security and the creditor risk of reinsurer is measured. But, and here's the but, Solvency II will most likely go live in 2013, and it's far too early that the current and the recent renewal decisions take this consideration already into account.</p>
          <p>I mentioned already, or I made one remark, that particularly in the last &#x2013; in this January 1 renewal, rating and security did not play the same role as one year ago. Why? Price was everything and was of higher importance in this renewal, and short-term thinking dominated sometimes to find a placement decision. So I agree with you. It's more desirable, and we like a faster consideration of Solvency II in that respect. But in the last renewal, it did not take place.</p>
          <p>What takes place now during the course of the year, and that's my final comment, is preparational work, so that clients begin to simulate and to ask us or to ask advisors what would it mean in the future for my capital base, to some extent, for the reinsurance structure, but it's not part of the decision yet.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had two questions. First one is, if I look at the very good stuff which has happened in the combined ratio and reinsurance, and in primary, and also the very good realized gains impact in the investment income. Then I compare that to the expectations and your beat towards the expectations in the total net profit, the factors you've cited are worth more than the beat you've actually shown. Now, you might say, well, where the market falls is a little bit irrelevant, and it's kind of a little bit willy. But to the extent that we don't have full numbers, it helps &#x2013; I wonder if you could share a little bit or give a bit of insight.</p>
          <p>I'm coming out that the missing number, if you like, that missing negative to make it square up to the 200 million beat, is about 160 million, which would suggest &#x2013; and this is my assumption &#x2013; that Q4 in ERGO in primary life was really very bad. And I just wondered, if that's right, and could you discuss the reason and the going forward and restructuring cost, stuff like that?</p>
          <p>And then, the other question, it's &#x2013; now, I'm not Munich Re and I'd never be able to do Munich Re, and you are doing a fantastic job, but if I were Munich Re and I saw my core business, which is so nice, shrinking by 7%, I'd think, oh my gosh, and I would be very tempted to do more and more and more deals to kind of capture growth. Is that &#x2013; how is the balance &#x2013; what balance are you going to strike when comes the AGM in April between doing at least the same amount to buy back, I hope, the one billion, or saying no, no, no buyback. We have got to do lots of deals and remain the big Munich Re you know and love.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Mike. Joerg speaking here. With regard to the buyback, it's too early now, as you might have expected, to give you a better guidance than we have already done. We would very much like to continue with the buyback. Currently, we do not see major reasons which would prevent us to do so, unless there would be very strong business opportunities coming up or unless the environment would change dramatically into a major crisis again, also.</p>
          <p>But apart from this, we think that the buyback is a very important element, on one hand, to provide our shareholders with a very attractive cash return, and on the other hand, to support discipline in all areas of the business. I can't say more at the moment.</p>
          <p>This applies, by the way, also for your first question with regard to the reasons for the deviation from the expectations. It's &#x2013; really, Michael, please believe me, we have just got the numbers and there's still a lot of quality assurance being done.</p>
          <p>There are totally &#x2013; in Q4, these are totally unspectacular numbers, with all respect, I would say. And please give us another couple of days to prepare it in a way which allows you to make a good analysis of it, and unlike in the past, we will provide you with a full Annual Report before our analyst conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. One, you talk about the rate decline being about 0.3%. So I am wondering what you might be able to translate that into, and your RORAC target, given the decline in yields as well?</p>
          <p>Second question as well is on surety portfolio. You say you fully reserved it. I was wondering what scope there is for recoverability. I'm conscious that on the surety line you quite often can get some recoveries <mark type="inaudible" />. Is there anything you can give us on that? That would be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, Torsten here. First question, the rate reduction, slight rate reduction by 0.3% has a very, very, very marginal impact on RORAC only, so we can expect, for the reinsurance business, almost stable RORAC on that basis, and so hardly any impact. And as far as surety is concerned, and as far as the reserves are concerned, we are very comfortable.</p>
          <p>And your question is right: can we expect or do we block on a recovery under these mentioned losses. Of course we block on that, but because the length of the financial or the economic crisis is very uncertain, and because it's very uncertain, whether, under these circumstances, the non-finished ships can be finished and can be sold, and if so, when, we do not want to make any reduction in our reserves now, and have to wait and see here to take a prudent position as far as our reserve is concerned.</p>
          <p>Is it impossible or unlikely that we see a reduction? No, not at all. We work hard on that, but we cannot make and do not want to make statements or projections about the size of any possible reductions under this surety loss complex. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just coming back on the RORAC, the question I guess was more geared towards the movements in the risk free returns, given that they've moved year-on-year, and therefore, they will be on a sort of &#x2013; on a complete basis, taken into account investment yields as well as the RORAC moved material. Do you think it's roughly where it was on that business you're in?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I hope you permit me to ask three questions on the renewals. They are all pretty quick, though.</p>
          <p>The first one is the 0.3% price drop. I know really it's only to renewed business. When you bring in the quality of business coming into the books versus the quality of business leaving, can you just say what your view is in the &#x2013; how the overall quality of the entire book has changed? Maybe you can only be qualitative, but is 0.3% a good indication, or would it be perhaps a bit slightly larger drop in the overall profitability of the entire book? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is, I wondered if you could posit any sort of outlook for later renewals? One of the major brokers have suggested the prices will keep softening throughout 2010. Do you share that view, or perhaps there's maybe some seasonality going on so that business renewing later in the year should see a different price change from what you've seen in January?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is, when everyone else talks about price changes, it's always &#x2013; like the brokers &#x2013; it's always in nominal terms. You are negative 0.3%, I believe, is a real number. What sort of claim inflation do you have baked into that, so that we can turn that into a like-for-like nominal number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Brian, Torsten here. First question, the minus 0.3 which we show is not the price reduction on the renewed business of the middle pillar. It's the price change from the existing, from the old portfolio, if you want, to the new portfolio. So the difference of cancelled and new business is considered or is taken into account here. And so, quality wise, the minus 0.3 fully reflects our expected profitability change.</p>
          <p>And second point, the later renewals: there are two further major renewals, the April 1, and July 1 renewal. Our best guess, our expectation for these renewals, is very similar market environment, softer environment, but rate reductions and price pressure in a very similar way which we have seen now. Usually, that is a fair observation when we look into the past years, where, for instance, the April renewals mirrored a bit the pictures of the general renewals and so on.</p>
          <p>The third part, inflation. We do not neither measure nor report inflation assumptions under the various line segments separately. Why? When our underwriters start their pricing, they take industry and region-specific inflation assumptions, depending or related to the specific segment and line of business, and they charge that as an ingoing parameter into the pricing, and built the price on the basis of the underlying loss expectation. So the final price we charge and we want to get assumes already all inflation assumptions.</p>
          <p>For that reason, we do not internally measure portfolio-wide inflation rates, and by the way, it would not make sense to allocate such average inflation rates. But you can assume, of course, that for the normal segments, they are on a lower level these days, in line with the inflation rates we see in the various countries in the world, where we still apply higher inflation rates than normal. It's in bodily injury specific segments like bodily injury claims under motor, under doctors' liability, et cetera. Worker's comp, these types of segments. Here we apply, of course, in line with past observations, substantial loadings on the countrywide inflation rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I ask this question? Can I just follow up, just qualitatively on that last point. I accept that inflation today is low. There is a general expectation that claim inflation will pick up at some point.</p>
          <p>Do you build into your expectation what the average inflation rate is going to be over the next, I don't know, five years or the life of the liability, or are you just sort of taking what today's inflation rate is in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We tried to estimate future inflation rates based on the duration and the payout pattern of the individual treaties. There's, of course, the exception under the excess of loss policies where we build provisions to index clause into the treaties which protect us from further adverse inflation developments over the time.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I've only got one question, so that sort of even things up a bit. I just want to get a feel, a better feel, for how you're looking at your business going forward. As reinsurance property-casualty prices soften, are you tending to look more &#x2013; for more life reinsurance deals such as we've just witnessed? Or would you walk away from that and think about larger share buybacks? I just want a feel for the tactics going forward, please. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as our business preference is concerned, life and non-life allows different underwriting policy. And in life, you don't have the cyclical pricing conditioned movements in the market. You get the business because your offer is of data or other type of services, or large capacity and security, and finally, you get the treaty. So it's not that yet that you get a pre-structured treaty offered, and then you compete for price and life.</p>
          <p>So price, life as a consequence of that allows a much more stable business development, and you will see that most likely in the future, as well.</p>
          <p>I mentioned already in 2010, we expect further, larger deals, not of that size like last year. And then we build our variable annuity business, and try to develop our Asian business in life. So that we &#x2013; very constant business development.</p>
          <p>In non-life, non-life is of course driven by the cycle. What is our attitude, what is our behavior. We write as long as we can write it, as long as we can get our profitability margins. Are we prepared to give up more if necessary? Of course we are. Has it a direct impact on our buyback to the shareholders? Theoretically, yes, always, as long as the balance sheet and here the revenue reserve does allow that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. My first question is about the outlook for ERGO. You clearly posted a significant improvement in the profits of &#x20AC;173 million. What sort of normalized profit do you think that business can generate? I think you dropped the 900 million during last year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, the positive prior year developments on natural catastrophes. Can you give us any indication of whether there was anything specific driving that, or is it all sort of just spread across the board. I'm just trying to understand how we should interpret that in the future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joerg speaking. I can start with the latter, because this is the easier one. It was more or less across the board. I have the impression that, after Katrina, we became somewhat conservative with our loss estimations, and this proved to be the case for the losses of 2007 and '08, and this is the origin of it. So not a major movement in one or two losses, but more or less across the board. Some minor reserve releases.</p>
          <p>With regard to the expectation for ERGO, this is difficult. The ERGO business is still somewhat dependent on the development of the capital market. This is clear. We have a 12 to 15% return on equity target on whatever the capital should be. At the moment, the capital is in the order of &#x20AC;4 billion. That would mean that we would need up to 600 million to meet this target. But you get more information in &#x2013; very shortly from the process of the ERGO squeeze-out, where we will have to publish the internal plans here in order to support the takeover price here. There you will get better indications, and please, for legal reasons, I beg for your understanding that I can't say more at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. Two questions. First question, regarding the recurring investment income. Assuming that the low interest rate environment will continue, how will your recurring investment income develop in 2011 and 2012? I assume it will come down somewhat more. But can you please elaborate a little bit on that?</p>
          <p>Second question, a strategic question. Your volume reduction was minus 6.7%, while your prices were maintained. And this should allow you a RORAC of 15% in an environment where interest rates have come down significantly. Is it possible that you are too restrictive by imposing a RORAC of 15% on your underwriters in this environment? And would you have not created more value by assuming volume of minus 2% and prices minus 1% or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, on the running yield, so the movements we expect are minor going on from 2010 to 2011. Depends highly &#x2013; this is very trivial. It depends on the development of the risk-free rates and of the spread. It's too early to give a better indication now. But we do not expect a constant decline from that level where we will be in 2010.</p>
          <p>With regard to the RORAC questions, our underwriters will have a lot of pleasure when they listen to what you've asked here, Torsten.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So how I get this rid of the table now. And listen, you are of course right. One can argue that if the RORAC target adequate, can I write more business if I reduce my profitability, my ambition for profitability, my target. That is right. I think we have to keep in mind two things here.</p>
          <p>One is in the best times of the market where other companies offer to their shareholders even far higher RORACs. Munich Re was reasonable in my opinion in our RORAC requirement. So we should not be the company who asks first for RORAC reduction when it becomes more difficult to earn it in a softer market.</p>
          <p>Second point, we really do not want to have all the business on both in softer market environment. Of course it's easier all the negotiations with the seems to keep the business on board, but we as the lessons learned of the last soft market we have sworn ourselves, that the cancellation of business is part of our general underwriting strategy and we would undermine this cycle management approach when we reduce the RORAC targets now.</p>
          <p>And the third point is let's not forget that particularly the reinsurance portfolio like ours has a lot of large risks in the portfolio sometimes although un-moderate risk and unidentified risk that's to some extent nature of our business for which we have to earn certain margins. So we think you're theoretically right but it would be the wrong step to do that now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Two questions, please. We're seeing some differential terms and conditions. Last year you've mentioned that differential terms and conditions have been heavily discussed and that market leaders such as Munich Re should benefit from this discussion. Could you please give an update on this issue whether this is still the case? And the second question is very short on ERGO. You mentioned the 100 million net profit in Q4. Did you already book some extra marketing cost here related to the new brand strategy already in Q4, or will this fully book in 2010? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Differential terms and conditions is an agenda point in the renewals and the negotiations particularly from our side. The share of differential terms in our book is unchanged bit more than one-third of our book is concluded on the basis of differential terms and conditions to our advantage.</p>
          <p>So that means clients want to keep us on board as long as possible. Of course in a softer market environment and when clients are under more internal price and budget pressure sometimes they prefer then to decide for the cheaper market. But the share again is almost unchanged is a bit more than one-third of our portfolio in 2010. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just one question on slide 14. You've mentioned that you drew your short-tail niche business and I just wondered was this partially due to an enhanced market position &#x2013; market position given the acquisitions which you carried out over the past years or was this not tied to those acquisitions at all? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was not tied &#x2013; not really tied to these acquisition. We have not taken the major acquisitions into the consideration for this renewal because we consider that the Midland and the Hartford Steam Boiler as sort of primary business written out of the reinsurance group.</p>
          <p>So that is not part of the report we give here. What we mean here is that, there is a closer market in specific know-how driven segments like pharmaceutical business, like the high excess environmental business, et cetera. And in this specific markets, D&amp;O is another example, you need the Munich Re like a few other players almost every year. And here of course we are first addressed but it has nothing to do what we report here with our other Hartford Steam Boiler and Midland type business.</p>

I was wondering, if you could say anything about the, and they're a multi-year contract, so I was wondering, if you could say anything about the profit profile of these. What was their impact in 2009, will the profitability of these contracts, is it likely to be pop-up in the IFRS reporting evenly over that term or not? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi. Two questions, please. The first one is of the 1.2 billion euros of premium that was cancelled, I was just wondering if you could break that down between the business, I guess you walked away from and the business that was cancelled by your clients? I know it's a little simplistic, but if you give us some sense of how it would break down?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just looking back at the deals you've done in the recent years, I wonder if you could tell us, you know all of these deals were going to be accretive. I am just telling &#x2013; wonder if you could tell us which ones have been accretive? And I guess, I am thinking here about studying life and this is ignoring the goodwill write-off at Midland and of course Hartford Steam Boiler? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Torsten here. Let me start with the first one. The 1.2 billion non-renewed or cancelled business, we don't have and we cannot give a split between what part is cancelled by client, what part is not renewed by us. At the end of the day it doesn't matter and it's not really necessary to differentiate, because of what happened at the end. There were negotiations, our price deferred considerably from the achievable price the clients want to take and on the basis he wanted to place the treaty. And finally, we had agreed to disagree on the renewal.</p>
          <p>So, net of that final market prices for programs were not supported by us. Who cancelled I don't know.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry. Torsten, if I can come back to you on that, because what I am trying to know is to what extent is the reinsurance business actually structurally in decline versus what essentially the sort of the price discipline you were showing. So there must be some of that business where your customers came to you and said, actually, you know what, we are not going to buy that this year, and I guess is that the percentage of the 1.2 which relates to that as opposed to areas where they were keen to buy, but for whatever reason, you know the price &#x2013; you could not agree a price.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have figures available here, but vast majority of that business is &#x2013; what cancelled or non-renewed because of pure price descents.</p>

          <p>To your second question about our acquisitions of the recent past, most of them were done just before the financial market crisis, and as you know we were somewhat swift in writing down the goodwill and some intangibles to adapt the business plans or after having adapted the business plans to the new realities in a way. And when I look at the contribution to our earnings in 2009, it was positive for Hartford Steam Boiler and for the others it was not positive. We will provide you with more detail on that in the course of &#x2013; in our annual report and also in the conference there.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot improvise here. So, I would have to look at it but the first look &#x2013; the first when I look at these &#x2013; at the results of these companies are these write-downs and these have hit us hard in the recent past, but we have now a quite clean balance sheet with regards to these goodwill's and intangibles and so on. So this is, I think, part of the beauty going forward now.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Could I ask some questions on the claim side, on the reinsurance business. Firstly, on surety, your losses, thus far, have been mostly in Asia, what's happening in the U.S., that's quite a late cycle business for you, is there any sign of an underlying deterioration in the U.S. surety book at this stage?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you mentioned some claims issues on D&amp;O and I think perhaps PI or E&amp;O, could you just talk about which sectors you are seeing a claims impact, are we talking just about banking or is it spreading to sectors beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second D&amp;O. The additional adverse impact on our book in 2009 came from financial institution type business that includes sometimes advisors or so, but it was financially related at the end. We don't have seen a spread of D&amp;O claims into other industries on a larger scale. That is not the case at least not in our books. And as far as surety U.S. is concerned, we have no indications of any adverse development, by the way our book in the U.S. is very, very small and outside the Asian specific loss complexes, we have &#x2013; which I have described, our surety book in difference to our regular or normal trade credit book performed in 2009, pretty well. So under the surety sides there are no further indications for adverse developments in other parts of the world, neither in the U.S., nor in other parts. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Could I ask firstly on the reserving, the reserve increase on the general liabilities side, if you could give us a little bit more detail there? Where there particular things that shifted in the year and are you comfortable with where you are at this year?</p>
          <p>And the second thing was on the profitability of German motor, obviously you see that from both sides, the primary and the reinsurance. And I guess there was a negative comment on the reinsurance side. Could you give a bit more detail in terms of how you view that market, and just how much you've reduced your exposure to that market on the reinsurance side? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me, it's Torsten, let me start with motor reinsurance in Germany &#x2013; reinsurance in Germany. We reported over the last years, our reduction &#x2013; the intentional reduction of that business segment in our book of business that has to do with of course with ongoing softening of the original rates, which have not really come to an end yet.</p>
          <p>We've reduced this year about another 25 million proportional business in our books, so that we are not really exposed any more to that specific class of business. And we know that the market consensus for 2009 of the motor business in Germany is in the order of 104%, including already reserve releases from the insurance companies. We have seen a few indications for better rates, but on a broader basis, the market has not recovered yet. Joerg, do you want to continue with <mark type="inaudible" /> other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a little bit. For us a good news is &#x2013; or not news, but good fact is that our market &#x2013; our market share in German motor business is substantially below our market share in more profitable lines of business. We expect the price war in Germany to slowly come to an end in this year, but that has been done already for a while. But there are good indications from some competitors increasing their normal tariffs and we hope that this will not be given in by discounts. The market as a whole seems to need some 5% increase in premiums across the board to really make money and so we will continue being very careful in that line of business.</p>
          <p>To your first question, the reserve movements in general liability, part of that has to do with the recession related losses. Another part comes from very specific areas, which I would not like to quote publicly because we are in good talks also with clients with regard to potential commutations, I beg for your understanding for that. But it's not U.S. driven, that is important. So, not the typical stuff from workers' compensation or so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Stephan Kalb from Sal. Oppenheim. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. I wonder how your combined ratio could look like in 2010? If I take your 2009 number and adjust for the deviation from the long-term average, I would get some worsening from NatCat, I'd get an improvement from manmade losses and would end up with some 97.8, that this would require &#x2013; that there would still be room for further run-offs in the current year and since Joerg you mentioned that your NatCat business has been priced more conservative after Katrina and Wilma, is it likely that this kind of run off we had in 2009 will be repeated in 2010 and we'd get in this region of 97 to 98%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Almost yes to everything. So it's my impression that we reserve conservatively, especially for NatCat losses, but the same applies for the whole book. But I never want to create any fantasy with regard to potential for our reserve releases, because we say that we need the current buffers we have. So it might well be that there is an additional potential but at least my team has not identified that yet, yeah. So &#x2013; and therefore I would not like to build an empire on that in a way. 97 to 98 sounds reasonable, yeah. Exactly on the kind of calculation you make here. But we also have to have in mind that there might be still an additional potential for recession related losses that we cannot exclude.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everybody. So last year you described an investment on the corporate bond side, currently some sovereign debt is yielding more than corporate side. Are you ready to take this kind of bet going forward? And my second question was about the credit reinsurance business, I was a bit disappointed by the volume you had, so is it only due to improper pricing on your side or maybe do you have the feeling that you left some money on the table because of aggressive competition? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the sovereign &#x2013; Joerg speaking, yes, we are ready to take some bets, but in a very moderate way. So the bulk of our sovereign portfolio is still in German and U.S. bonds. We have some bonds from Spain, from France, from the other European countries and there is also some risk and very attractive spreads in it, but in general the portfolio is rather conservative. Torsten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Credit reinsurance; the volume you see is driven by two factors. One is I reported the 32 million &#x2013; if you see one special reduction in volume because we decided to give up the structured trade credit and specific surety business as mentioned. So this is a special impact if you want.</p>
          <p>The rest of the portfolio is a development of two factors. One is we have very positive contribution to the volume because of rate increases implemented by the credit insurance companies which we got into our portfolio through the proportionate treaties. And here you will see the price change. But then of course we have negative development from the very strict limit management imposed by us but also by the credit insurers as a reaction and consequence to the current economic crisis.</p>
          <p>So credit limits in the markets are low these days. And we think that as a prudent approach I always say we cannot insure the burning house, already burning house as before. But lower limits irrespective of all the rate increases means at the end lower premium volume for the credit insurance industry and for the reinsurer.</p>
          <p>So we did not leave any money on the table or margins on the table. We could renew all the big permanent treaties in the market on the basis of very attractive terms and conditions, could even slightly increase our shares and could conclude these treaties in most cases on a multi-year basis. So that's a very satisfactory outcome, but you will see in the reduction of premium volumes of recession.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Still thinking, I mean this year is characterized by some very good dividend and share buyback but as well by several deals that you did last year. Now my question is, did the pile of opportunities on your table in terms of portfolios and as well other amenities enhance on your table, or is it stable or it did decrease? The entire industry is in a deep distress and for you it's actually a big part. So the question is how big will the part be this year, as last year, there was some five deals? So, yes, that's actually the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Fabrizio, Jeworrek speaking here. There is almost nothing on our table. And not because we are sleeping, but I think there is a lot in the very long pipeline at the moment, the very famous cases which sooner or later will come to the market, sometimes driven by the EU Commission or other government pressure. And this is exactly what we had already waited for a long while, that those who are distressed have to get rid of their non-core investments, their non-core assets.</p>
          <p>My personal opinion is that it is not highly probable that we will do a major deal. We have very good growth opportunities out of our existing portfolio in reinsurance distribution, is anyway not a bottleneck. So, we can grow our business quite nicely with the know-how and the underwriters we've on board, and perhaps also with additional underwriters here and there.</p>
          <p>In primary insurance we are currently consolidating our ERGO operations, and have this new brand architecture to develop in the course of this year. And therefore I think we have anyway enough on the table. So we will keep our eyes open and our team is in good shape, which could do an M&amp;A transaction but it is not probable. And especially it will be &#x2013; and definitely it will be done in a very disciplined way and we will not overpay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Can you talk about Solvency II for a second, so overall your expectation is that it's going to lead to an increase in demand for reinsurance? We understand that Solvency II impact is going to be found more likely on the life insurance side. But as part of the non-life renewal discussions, to what extent do you feel that primary insurers have started tailoring their reinsurance programs to respond to any pressure that you see emerging out of Solvency II?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As mentioned before, in the current renewals, we have not seen any direct impact from Solvency II changes or implications, not the case yet. What do we expect when we approach 2013? We expect development that the medium and small &#x2013; medium size and smaller insurance companies will have an additional demand for good reinsurance for two reasons, they have a less diversified portfolio and diversification pays off in the calculation of the capital base in future. And the second point is they get more or less credit for the security of their re-insurer.</p>
          <p>So, the closer we come to 2013 and more the discussions go on, the more that we play a role to restructure the current reinsurance programs.</p>
          <p>For the larger clients, you could argue the other way around that they have already, the big global companies, that they have already well diversified big portfolios where Solvency II will not lead to this push for better or more reinsurance more on the opposite direction. This is true by the way. But larger companies &#x2013; larger global companies they already in their internal models apply Solvency II type models in their decision &#x2013; for their decision making process. So that means they calculate already on an economic basis, so that there is no further negative impact to be expected that they change their reinsurance buying behavior. So, positive or slightly positive development for small and medium-size companies, no impact from larger companies, that is my best expectation.</p>
