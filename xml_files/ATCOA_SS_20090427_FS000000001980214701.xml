        <plist>
          <p>Good day and welcome to the Atlas Copco Q1 Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Hans Ola Meyer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Hans Ola Meyer, CFO, Atlas Copco Group, speaking. I have here at my side also Gunnar Brock, our Chief Executive Officer, participating. We will follow the usual format. We apologize for a few minutes delay in starting the call. There were many people calling in from around the world. But, now we are ready to go. We will start with Gunnar's first comments and then after 15-20 minutes, we'll move into an open Q&amp;A session. And we will finish this in just one hour, because after this conference call we also have the Annual General Meeting here in Stockholm, Sweden today and then bit later tonight. So with that, please Gunnar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Ola, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. As customary is, I will follow the handouts. But I guess you have in front of you and I will then from time-to-time refer to the number of the slides, so we are at least talking about the same things.</p>
          <p>Let me then start immediately with slide three for the highlights. I guess what we are telling is not much different from what everybody else has been telling over the last weeks when it comes to the global financial and economic crisis and its impact on our business. It's pretty easy to say that most customer segments and most regions of the world have showed a rather dramatic fall if you compare to the same quarter last year. However, if you look at the sequential developments from Q4 '08 and Q1 '09, it is not that much of a difference, if you adjust for the cancellations. We are all looking for the lights and some lights is to be found in China where we actually over the last two quarters have had very good development in the construction and mining business. You could find also perhaps areas in other parts of the world, but generally it's a rather big picture.</p>
          <p>Still cancellations mainly, as you may have seen, from the report coming from the mining customers. Q4 had about 1.2 billion in cancellation, and it's now down to below 800. And I guess that we have, although I may regret saying it, but hopefully we have come to the end of the road since most of the orders now are reasonably fresh. The bright spot though is that aftermarket business is holding up pretty well. And I'll come back to that later on when I talk about the business areas. Most of you also know that we started pretty early in October to try to adapt our capacity and costs to what we thought was coming. And I may say that so far it's been great work done in the organization, and we have in those short six months already seen a quite an adaptation to the capacity and also when it comes to number of employees where we have reduced close to 4,000 over that period of time. That's nothing one is proud of; however, I think we have to be satisfied with the speed of the adaptation.</p>
          <p>The strong point we feel is the cash flow and that we have managed, although &#x2013; and I'll come back to that a bit later as well &#x2013; the scaling down or reduction of inventory has perhaps not been as quick as we had hoped, but still we have done a bit better on the receivable side. So very good cash flow, and if you look at our capital structure, that you'll find later in the presentation, you can see that there is a little of maturity dates in the years until 2014. And with a strong cash flow for the rest of the year, I think we can look forward to quite a solid cash position when we end the year. But I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>Now next slide, figures in summary. I will not bore you with every detail. I think you can see the organic order intake, you could see the 17% decline in revenues which is 19% in volumes which then indicates that prices are holding. And also if we look at the order intake, measuring prices in the order intake, I think we are able to keep our prices at desired levels. No doubt there is pressure, but I think we are managed, and also in the aftermarket, pretty well to do the same. I don't to intend to read anything more really from that first &#x2013; that slide, but turn to the next slide six which is the world map and here you could see the geographical spread of the declines. Unfortunately, there are no pluses but, as we come back to later, perhaps this is as bad as it gets, but we don't know. We have to be prepared for a difference in that as well.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide seven, the Americas. We have seen a bit of a cancellation wave in the mining sector, particularly surface drill rigs in North America. Most of that I guess is tied to coal applications. Unfortunately, we have not seen any headlights or lights at all from the car industry. We have adapted our structure and our organizations in North America, but so far both MVI and to some extent also the general industry are showing quite some low figures.</p>
          <p>Turning south, it gets a little bit warmer or better. Brazil is actually relatively less bad off, and I think we have now reached a size and a mass in Brazil that makes us able to capture whatever business you find in that large country. Peru, Chile, large mining countries also affected, of course.</p>
          <p>Turning then to Europe, Africa, Middle East, not much to say. It's the same theme, quite solid declines across Russia, a bit of a concern to the extent that it's not much of an activity as we speak, and financing seems to be one of the issues hurting Russia more than other parts. Then we have seen some good and we hope more may come in terms of infrastructure related to the Sochi Olympic infrastructure project, and we got a large order for that during the quarter. Middle East, some pockets of strengths to be reported particularly from the oil and gas related but also in the road development, equipment. Dynapac got some nice orders in the quarter from that part of the world.</p>
          <p>Asia, Australia, similar trend. Although as I said earlier, the CMT business in China has done remarkably well. Things are not deteriorating. If anything, perhaps showing a bit of a better trend. India and South East Asia not so positive. Japan actually, although it is not such a large part of our business, but still Japan has done actually quite good. And so has compressor business in Australia and New Zealand, whereas the mining business has been doing less good in that area.</p>
          <p>So now I'm on slide 10 the organic growth per quarter and obviously as you see a long period of unprecedented growth has now turned into a not long, fortunately, period but of unprecedented decline. You can also see that the cancellations as part of the total are a bit less. Now this graphic shows, of course, the comparison between quarters of the same, the same quarter in different years, but as I said if you take the sequential development it is not as bad as it looks on that graph.</p>
          <p>Turning then to the bridge, the sales bridge. Currency has, of course, held up to the numbers, and 13% on revenues, and 10 on the orders received, cancellations taking off 4%, price positive still. And this is something we intend to work very hard to try to maintain.</p>
          <p>Moving on to 13. It shows the 12 months period of return on capital employed and the margin and there you can see that although the quarter was less good, the effect of the year is relatively smaller of course.</p>
          <p>Turning to Compressor Technique. Generally, across the board decline organically 30%. The volume of business in revenue, volume was down about 14%. But, as we said also earlier, aftermarket is holding up pretty well. And we are, we are not saving on our efforts, neither in terms of personnel nor in terms of money, to try to build the aftermarket. There is always aftermarket business to be taken, and still we are far away from any kind of penetration that should make it difficult. We still have quite a lot of opportunities.</p>
          <p>If we look at the operating margin having seen the biggest fall in history in terms of business volume, I think still 18% if we add back the redundancy cost is an acceptable figure, and I think that the organization has done very well to adjust to the volume. If we look at the acquisitions, we finalized the Aggreko acquisition in early part of the year.</p>
          <p>Rental is holding up reasonably well, not as well as the aftermarket, but it's not declining as much as the equipment sales is doing. So we will put as much efforts as we ever can into developing that business. And just to remind you, we are talking about specialty rental, oil-free air rental mainly.</p>
          <p>Looking then at the diagram 15, I think it is, 15, you can basically see in graph what I talked about earlier, 14% volume decline, a drop in margin, but I think I don't need to comment on that more. Construction and mining technique, yes this has been the business area with a lot of cancellations, but as I said there should recently sort of level out as the orders we're getting in. And there are good prospects around. So I think that the level has been stable, and actually if you look at the Q4 and Q1, the incoming orders has been pretty stable at the same level. So what has sort of played a little bit of havoc here is the number of cancellations.</p>
          <p>The operating profit, 868 million with 58 million in redundancy costs, an adjusted margin of 13.6. Currency is supporting that. CMT is the business area that is most of our three supported by currency. The effect on the result from adjustments and under-absorption are pretty tough. We have and we are trying and we see that in the difference between the gross margin and adjusted gross margin. So we keep prices well, but adjustments in terms of under-absorption, write-offs, obsolete, parts et cetera is coming through. And then we finalize the acquisition of the two companies in India for rock tools. And the next slide is just showing graphically what I just said.</p>
          <p>So let's move quickly over to Industrial Technique, which has seen the heaviest hits by an organic order decline of over 40%, and of course they are more than any of our three business areas relating to the MVI industry. And I think there is no question that we are doing well inside that space, but there is not so much business taking place. It's actually doing reasonably okay in Asia &#x2013; in the Asian MVI industry, partly I guess because we are focusing more and more and maybe successful in that area. We have here, and this is the business area with the highest impact of leverage. We have a relatively higher integrated setup here. So the higher leverage is playing off. The restructuring costs are or have been a bit hither. And thirdly the aftermarket share of the total is lower than for the other two. So, therefore, the effect on the EBIT margin is somewhat higher.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows again graphically what I just mentioned. So, I turn immediately to the slide 21, which is the P&amp;L, and I will not dwell on that more than just saying the adjusted EBIT margin is 14.5% if you add back the restructuring costs. I am not going to talk at all really about the profit bridge as I think they are what they are. You can see that and there is not so much more to add. If we then come to the balance sheet, you can see that comparing the March with March, March 2008, March 2009. It is quite an increase and that's of course two major contributors to that. One is the cash accumulation where we have today about SEK10 billion in cash and the other one is, of course, currency translation effects, as we have seen some very dramatic moves over the last six months even on that. So that explains the larger balance sheet in nominal terms.</p>
          <p>I'll come back to receivables and inventories when I talk about cash flow. Net debt to EBITDA is developing in the right way. Of course, currency plays one role on the debt side, and of course the lower earnings &#x2013; the lower EBITDA is of course also working in that respect. If we look at net debt to equity, I think we're at or around 74%. I look at Hans Ola here, and he nods, so I must be in the right area, at least. So I think that net debt to equity, of course, we have seen some of that currency as well.</p>
          <p>Loan maturity profile, not much to say. I think we are extremely happy that it looks like it looks. So no more to say about that. Taken then the cash flow statement on slide 27, I think it has been a &#x2013; it's a very good quarter. However, I would have liked it to be even better because I think that inventory is still on the high side. But I guess we have made the same misjudgment as most of our colleagues to the extent that a lot of the sales that went out to customers over the last couple of years didn't go to end-users all the way. It ended up in inventories. And the inventory reduction, it has been a huge inventory level to scale down among our clients and in industry in general.</p>
          <p>And of course if you at the same time had 30, 40% drops in demand, then inventory that normally lasts three months will perhaps last six, seven months. So we may have to be a bit more patient. It's going in the right direction. If I look at the inventory in the same dollar &#x2013; so in the same currencies, we talk a little bit over 6% volume going down, and if we look at the receivables, we talk about something like 14% I think in the &#x2013; sorry 12% in the volume of receivables going down. The next question you will ask is, of course, how is the aging looking and it's not looking too bad actually. The 60 and above has increased a percentage point I think or so. So it's really nothing dramatic. If more is to come, who knows. We prepare ourselves by making slightly higher provisions for that just in case.</p>
          <p>I said earlier that I think cash flow will be good for the rest of the area, and I think the reason for that is we have a working capital to wind down, if volume doesn't resume. So that working capital would hopefully turn into cash. We have relatively or rather low CapEx, which I guess goes for everyone these days. So CapEx is not going to eat cash. Neither is investment in rental fleet, although it's not huge, but normally it was net about five, six perhaps SEK700 million. There will be substantially less of that.</p>
          <p>And lastly, our loan structure is such that we cannot really pay off any of our debt. So the only way to adjust the cash then would be to acquire companies, and of course that is something we are looking at all the time, and more now than ever so. However, the supply of companies to acquire companies that are of interest to us is as we speak not very good and hopefully there maybe more opportunities available as we go on. Our divisions have a clear mandate and are encouraged to really look through and plan and try to be quick whenever there is an opportunity, but so far it hasn't presented itself.</p>
          <p>By that, I think my time is over. Then last slide is the near-term outlook, and I think it is pretty clear what we are saying that the economic situation still makes it very difficult to forecast and to the best of our ability we feel that there will be a weak period ahead of us, but that volumes will stay around the current levels. Should, however, this not be true and things turn dramatically worse, we are prepared but and as we can see today it looks like it has stabilized.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Gunnar. We are then ready for the Q&amp;A session, and I just ask the operator to repeat the process for that please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Nico Dil from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three quick questions please. The first one is on the restructuring you have announced. You've taken out 3,800 people or so out of the 5,000 you have planned. What have you seen in terms of restructuring savings in terms of two billion or so you've highlighted?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the decremental margin. I saw in the bridge that's it's around 45% now, and I was wondering what would make it worse going forward?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I would like have a look at the aftermarket sales. Could you perhaps highlight what it is as a percentage of the total for the different divisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting then with the restructuring, costs and savings, if we start from the end, what we said earlier I think still is very much holding; that is from the second half of this year the run rate would be that two billion plus that we talked about. If you ask how much is already now in and how much will be for the year, we guess that a 1.5 billion maybe the answer for the year. The next question was decremental margin.</p>
          <p>Well I think we can keep prices I think that is the key. The under absorption we are, I guess we should be not sitting at more or bigger disadvantage as we go on, provided the volume drop is not continuing. But if we level out where we are, we are sort of adapting, and of course we cannot do that momentarily. So Q2, Q3 we will be in a more measured sort of capacity situation, all things being equal.</p>
          <p>Aftermarket sales, if I take the Q1 figure of equipment of total and compare that to the Q1 '08, it was 64 '08 and this quarter it was 60. So consequently the aftermarket was 36 for the group this quarter last year and now 40. However, that's the order intake. If I look at the order received, it is a bit higher. Now most of the aftermarket business is in for out in the same quarter. There is no real building of order books, but the relation changes because equipment is falling rather than anything else, right.</p>
          <p>Then you asked about every businesses. Compressor Technique went Q1 '08 to Q1 '09 from about 26 to about 30 and then CMT from about 42 to about 47; that aftermarket is traditional aftermarket. It is consumables; drill steel, drill bits, et cetera, and some rental. In the compressor figure also was rental included. IT went from 24% to about 27%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one thing to clarify. The run rate of the restructuring savings is currently running at some 375 million a quarter already in Q1, is that a correct understanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that is reasonably correct. This is not an exact science because these things don't happen at the given day. It's &#x2013; and of course, it's most likely to believe that it's been sort of back-loaded that things happen rather in the end of the quarter when people leave, et cetera</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. That's very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Johan Eliason from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello, I have a question regarding the consumable sales. You say that as a whole your aftermarket has continued to be good in those segments and regions in the Construction Mining Technique, but then you also say that the consumables have been lower. Can you kind of quantify what sort of drop you've seen in the consumable side and the trend there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take CMT, I think consumables Q1 '08 was 20% of the sales and it's about the same in this quarter. So it's called, it's held steady then in relation to the sales. Of course, this inventory issue I mentioned just a little while ago is, of course, playing a bit of havoc. We hear customers saying that you know we have inventories for six months or 12 months of certain drill steel and drill rods, et cetera. I don't think we have a good picture of the whole universe when it comes to that. So I think there is an issue, of course, closure of some mines, but also of a larger inventory than we had expected, which means that the run rate is what we are selling now is probably little lower than the run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then maybe just a detail to Hans Ola, on the currency, net impact was around 500 million which was slightly higher than last quarter. At the current situation, what do you expect for the coming quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; as always we are reluctant to give a specific bridge, because it's not that as automatic as a mathematical formula to calculate, but we do believe that the situation in the second quarter will be fairly similar to the first quarter. That's as close as an estimate that we can guess right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you haven't changed volumes of your currency hedging to any significant degree...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we still have some corporate hedges that &#x2013; that is reflected in the corporate cost line in the first quarter as it has been also previously. And that was a negative of a little bit more than a 100 million, which offset a larger positive in the business area &#x2013; sorry 200 million, I'm wrong there. So we have certain hedges and that will be similar level of magnitude as in the Q1 in the Q2. So all in all about the same we estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Peter Testa from One Investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple questions please. I was wondering if on the first one if you could help us understand the cost flexibility beyond the savings program you have? Next, and how you are managing a supply chain and how you are using the cost opportunities you have to carry on with demand decline, especially thinking about the fact that your order intake is still in a difficult situation?</p>
          <p>Then the second is just on service and spares to understand, as &#x2013; from your perspective, how you think the service and spares would show resilience going forward given customer utilization?</p>
          <p>And then the last one was just on price. You're talking about holding prices strongly. You're also going to have material cost benefits I would imagine coming through this year, and whether you can give some sort of sense as to whether you would be sharing those in anyway or expect to hold on to that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Cost flexibility and cost reductions, et cetera. I think that the &#x2013; what we talked about a lot before, I think it shows to be holding up well. We have a very large share of our total cost of goods being so called variable and, of course, that cost is disappearing when the volume disappears. Ironically, of course, is that we invested quite a lot in capacity period 2005 to 2008 and, of course, even last year we were getting installation of equipment order 2006, et cetera. So, of course, that is standing idle, but I think there is a reasonably good proof of our flexibility and resilience on the volume side already now.</p>
          <p>Surely the old suppliers are not reducing prices. As I said, we try not to. And we see, of course, that many of our suppliers are not reducing prices. As a matter of fact, in some cases there has even been price increase. But without going into detail all over, I think you could say that expected and already realized prices for material and components would all things equal lead to a drop in our product costs of two to 3% during 2009. And that's, of course, the variable cost. The rest is then taken care of by our programs of adapting number of programs.</p>
          <p>The other question you asked was about spares and, well, aftermarket in general, the resilience. And surely, one thing is resilience in price, the other one is, of course, if customers don't produce or if they produce much less, after sometime you will, of course, see some effect on the aftermarket services. I guess it's like you're servicing your car, the interval gets longer if you drive less. On the other hand, there is still a lot of aftermarket business that's ours. So, therefore it's pretty hard to mitigate whatever is the component of people shutting down or people prolonging the interval between maintenance operations.</p>
          <p>On the price side I think that in some cases there are not so many alternatives. So, therefore, our position should be reasonable. But we have to see as we go on and we are prepared that this maybe more difficult, but so far I think we are doing okay. That was the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yes, just to clarify on price generally. I mean, you talked about you expect your price of material component to fall two to 3% of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you expect to hold prices in that, so you would expect to try and recover some of, let's say, overhead issues with better gross margin or product margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean the &#x2013; firstly the &#x2013; if we keep the gross margin at the prices level, then of course as we go on our adjustment should be smaller, because what we have seen now is, of course, cleaning out lot of inventory and obsolescence, et cetera. But if this becomes a prolonged period of time, then we will have done that. And then, of course, there is a little bit room for price reductions and still keeping the margins if our product costs are going down. That's true.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. It's Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Three questions please. Firstly, you mentioned in the statement that inventory write-downs hit the margin. Maybe you could just quantify how much that was?</p>
          <p>Secondly, your orders are still running well below your sales. You've had a positive book-to-bill until recently for a number of years. If demand stays at the current level, how long do you think it will take for your sales to full &#x2013; to kind of catch up with the current order rates? Just following on from that, would it make sense that margins declined sequentially as the sales were eight fold? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, Ben, I'm talking about hundreds of different items, stock being returned from sales companies, distribution centers, etcetera. So, I have no good figure, percentage point or whatever on the gross margin. I guess could be a reasonably good guess. But, so I am not talking about large write-downs. So if the &#x2013; when you have had, whatever 27 or 26 consecutive quarters of growth, there are inefficiencies and bad habits accumulated and we are sorting out those as quickly as we can. Yeah, the order book is of course getting a bit thinner, perhaps not as thin as quickly as we thought. But you know generally we do not have a large order book we talk from weeks to a couple of months except for the &#x2013; some of the drill rigs over the last years on this boom but also the, gas and process business in compressor. Besides those two, our order book is normally not very thick. Now the effect, and of course, if nothing happens, gradually, there will be more parity between revenues and order intake. But when that happens, it is our belief that our restructuring program is showing that we still can keep decent margins.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n from Handelsbanken Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My first question relates to the mix and how much is possible to quantify the implication on the profitability in each division? The second question relates to the under absorption and I was wondering if you, is it possible to quantify in absolute terms, what has happened in the first quarter and I'm also a bit confused with the answer. On the question before that under absorption wouldn't hit you harder ahead, volumes should come down more year-on-year, I guess. Just thirdly, and I thought there how much did you actually cut production organically in the quarter and given that when do you feel that you are imbalanced with the current demand? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, perhaps, Peder if I thought just on the second one, what we mean is really that the &#x2013; but I know that you would like to hear that we've cut production levels with 27 or 34.5% or something, I can't give you that type of a number. But, the reason why we &#x2013; and Gunnar answered in that way is, of course that the level of production and the utilization of capacity in the first quarter is already reflecting the lower order intake. And even though the invoicing has continued to be at the slightly higher level. That's what we mean that if you then measure in terms of percentage effects so to speak with we've ventured to say that we have seen, probably as bad as it gets on that percentage wise so to speak. That, that's the background to that answer basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, I also think that the next step in this rotation is of course more factory closures, which we haven't done that many but there will be, and when you close a factory you have to take out a quite a lot of structure. So that's what I am meaning by then being adapted to a lower volume. But the advantage I guess we have, as we have said many times is we have small incremental steps when we go up in terms of investments and of course we can also close incrementally smaller, when we go down. And this is I think a difference to our advantage compared to many other companies in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did we understand your first question right that you wanted some quantification on the mix effects on the margin or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have discussed this before and then given the quarters. Book in volumes in after markets it would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not something that we can disclose and have the perfect analysis on unfortunately. But it's obliviously so that the mix of having a relatively stable aftermarket portion of the business and a drastic fall on equipment that definitely has helped the margin without going into the specific effect. However in a quarter, like we have passed, which is much of a transition quarter, there are numerous effect Gunnar alluded to. Some, not only under absorption, there are inventory adjustments etcetera, etcetera that it's not very, very meaningful to do a full, try even to do a very detailed analysis of that mix. But underlying of course it helps us that that's quietly but to quantify it is extremely difficult, yes. Is that fine, Peder?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, okay. So the next question will be from Simon Smith [CSFB].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, I had two questions really, one was going back to the FX effects that you talked about. So, in the divisions you have the gross benefit of, the sort of 745 and then I presume in central cost area, you've got negative hedging effects, sort of 245. But obviously central cost was only about a 150, 160, which implies that excluding your hedging it was actually a positive 100 and I couldn't sort of calculate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I understand that because I wasn't perhaps 100% clear. But what we refer to in the bridge, is a bridge. So it takes the effect of what would have been the result had we had the same currency rates as previous year in the same period. And doing that, we come to a net effect of 500 million, right. And about 700 something of that is directly in the business areas and about 200 is on the account of corporate hedges. And you're right, but you have to see the 200 is the difference between a positive number last year Q1 and a negative number this year. You see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, you're saying</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 500 million is a bridge between something last year with a certain currency rate, it's not an absolute number or a charge that you will find neither in Q1 last year nor in Q1 this year, if you see what I mean. So within the corporate on the first quarter results of this year, in the corporate line, is a little bit more than 100 million negative, if you look from corporate hedges effect. If you look at this single handedly at this quarter. But as a bridge compared to last year, it's about 200 negative because we had positive in Q1 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's the way we have calculated the 500, let's say always in the same way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, great. So basically the way I should think about it is the corporate overhead should be a run rate of sort of 60, and then there will be whatever there will be from the positive and negative of hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. Well 60 might be a touch on the low side, if I recall that, but you're referring to the gross number that we have we have shown, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And taking a little bit more than a 100 off that. So, 157, yeah that, that's correct. We have a couple of other items that worked positively this time. And, but it's whole range of different things. So, I think that we have guided at about a 100 million negative is perhaps a more adequate run rate on corporate, without the hedging effects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, and my second question was really on the cash flow. You've obviously done very well on the receivables. And you know as I guess as volumes decline you would generally have expected to see maybe similar trends on payables. Do you think from here on those lines will move more inline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen of course a change and effect also from payables, as you say. However, in magnitude the amount of customer receivables is much, much bigger than the amount we owe to our suppliers. But, yes, we see similar effects, which is of course offsetting each other from a cash flow point of view, as you well understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and I guess just finally, the statistics you gave out of how the mix has changed in terms of aftermarket. I mean just sort of looking at the ratio of change and then the percentage increase. I mean, I'd be right in thinking that the aftermarket and IT was down sort of 23%, mining was down eight, and then compressor was about flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not in, if you take a volume in the quarter compared to the quarter before, then compressor is about steady, an increase in CMT and a decrease in IT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, fine I was going Q1 on Q1, then the stats you gave was Q4-to-Q1?</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, here Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley. Three questions maybe on the evolution, first of the aftermarket. Can you tell us more or less what happened in the first quarter, second quarter &#x2013; sorry, January, February, and then in March. In terms of the shape of aftermarket revenue, where do you see actually stronger performance and then on pricing you mentioned a couple of times pressure. Could you just give a little bit more sort of detail on which areas are just being more difficult or competitive? And then the third question is regarding your operating leverage, which is 45%. I think we calculated from one of your slides, but if you take that pricing, actually that increases a bit. I'm just wondering whether the comparables are actually looking more difficult so what's the later part of the year and you may see actually operating leverage increasing. Which basically goes in lieu with your previous comment that if you don't have volumes recover maybe from here you, you probably had lower margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the two first ones. I don't think, I mean, it's very hard to compare January, February, and March because, January was, I should say the, the effect of a close down over, Christmas, New Year that was surely more extended and wider than ever before. So, that makes that months not really, particularly representative. I think that if you allow for, working days etcetera I think there is no real change in the trend has been the same as far as we &#x2013; I can, see and remember in the aftermarket, it's been steady. Which it normally is and of course it's often tied much more to days of the month, working days than equipment sales. Prices, pricing, being the market leader and the price leader of course even in a market like this, one has to be extremely careful before one drops the price. And I think this is more true than ever and I think if I look at our suppliers, as I said just a little while ago, so you know you see them &#x2013; many of those, particularly those supplies who have branded products with global market positions. They don't lower their prices either. So, I think you have a &#x2013; perhaps the meeting on mines area in a way. I cannot say, that a particular segment is more hurt than others. I'm sure you could find pockets I think that the only general thing I would say is that price pressure is perhaps quite a lot in China today, but in the other parts of the world geographically I think it's not as much. I don't think I can say much more, more and more than that, but we are careful. And given our high share of variable cost in the cost of the goods, we are suffering less if we don't sell compared to the effect on our long-term price level if we lower our prices too much. So, I think we will try to stick in and dig in as hard as we can. I think it's important. And if we don't keep the price level up with our leadership decisions, who else is going to do that. Have you managed to calculate Hans Ola?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not much calculation, you've talked about the operational leverage. And let me just say, first of all that we have this type of bridge analysis on the profit that we have shown a couple of quarters now already. And I really must say that it's not &#x2013; should not ever be seen as the 'the model' each quarter. So to say, saying that we have operational leverage of 4 to 5%, just because it happens to come out in Q1, 2009. It's probably as wrong as to say that we had an incremental margin of above 40% in the CMT in 2007, which was the number at that time. One thing you pointed out yourself is that the price is included in that column and that of course helps a little bit the numbers. But in a quarter like this one that we have passed we are in a transition period, we have a lot of adjustment costs not only the under absorption that we talk about that we have commented already. And that's why we are alluding to a situation in the next couple of quarters that the decremental margin if we call it like that, would not necessarily have to be worse then what we have seen. When we get into resin let's say, which might be two or three quarters from now that no one really knows. Then we do expect the decremental margin if we call it like that of further revenues falls to be more inline with the business model that we have, meaning that we have a lot of outsourced components and products that we buy instead of manufacturing in-house. So, we see that the 50%, almost 50% fall through in this first real quarter of adjustment. We are not surprised about that effect. And we, as I said, we believe that we might not have to fear dramatically worse situation going forward for the reasons that Gunnar also commented earlier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would actually venture to say that I'm surprised we have done so much so fast in terms of adapting. Because just looking at the development as the world fell over a cliff, and I think that what we used to say is, look and relate to other similar industries and you will get perhaps a benchmark.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you. We need to speed up if we have one final question perhaps that's what we have time for now. And everybody that feels they haven't got any chance, Ingrid Andersson, our Investors Relations Manager, myself and others will try to help you after this call of course with questions. But we can take one final question from the conference please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question comes from Arnaud Brossard from Exane BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, thank you for taking my question. I have one on cancellations first. In Q4 they had a negative impact of 8% and again in Q1 negative impact of 4%. Can you just explain me &#x2013; help me understand where these cancellations stem from, I have a feeling that they are above what I've seen at competitors and I'd just be grateful if you could help me understand where they stem from? My second question and that would be my final one is just on your construction and mining business. Could you please differentiate the current trends between both businesses respectively? And maybe tell me about what should be the drivers in your view of our construction and mine side. And mining on the other side in the next few months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that what happened during the last two, three, four years with enormous growth in the construction and mining and particularly, in the mining side, is of course that customers couldn't get deliveries. And they ordered and they wanted to be, well in the queue. And given also the mix, where we grew quite a lot in the, large surface drill rig equipment as well as the underground with long delivery times. We of course booked orders and then when the demand fell off as abruptly as it did, we have seen cancellations. Now in what area, I think geographically I think you have seen cancellations basically from everywhere. And it's basically also most in base metal. Actually gold mining is keeping up relatively well. And in there, you've also seen much less, much fewer cancellations. There may have been some, but not that much I guess cancellations in the construction side. Coal has been one area as I mentioned where we lately saw more cancellations, we didn't see if I remember correctly so much coal application cancellations in Q4 as we saw in Q1. So, I think that this is different from customer mix and application and metals. So, I'm not sure you can sort of compare cancellations for two different companies.</p>
          <p>The drivers, I haven't said perhaps but it's clearly so that a positive aspect is of course all the global stimulus packages that governments are talking about and also putting money aside for. And there is no doubt that infrastructure will be a bigger part of our turnover going forward than mining because of all these projects that are being planned. And we see actually already Asia doing quite much better than Europe and the Americas. It's clearly, as I said, initially seen in China. Now the difficulty here is to just, or tell when this is happening, I mean projects like in Sweden where road building has been approved and everything is organized. It was just the money that were earmarked for 2011 you could easily put the money to '09 and off you go. But most projects are taking planning and permission and approval. So I don't think we will see so much of this before, end of the year. Mining, it looks like people believe gold mining will continue to do well. For the rest of the mining business, base metals, I think that is tied to, one, inventories around and secondly, of course the resumption of industrial production, which of course will drive the demand then. Is that a reasonable answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Yes, very much. Just one word on the current trends between construction on one side, and mining on one side, on the other side. How do they compare at the moment?</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I cannot give you exactly. But I would guess that that we are perhaps at the inflection point, where mining was the biggest until 2008. And today, I think construction applications will be the bigger one.</p>

          <p>As percent of sales, not as a trend of decline though.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, as a percent of sales. Which means order coming in and less, very few cancellation in the construction side ones, and then more fresh orders coming in.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you Gunnar, and thank you everybody perhaps before I let you go, let me just face the opportunity and I hope you join me in thanking our CEO Gunnar Brock for his, now 29th appearance consecutively in these conference calls. As you know, he is leaving the Group as CEO on June 1. And again I sincerely hope, you join me in thanking him and wishing him well in his next carrier.
