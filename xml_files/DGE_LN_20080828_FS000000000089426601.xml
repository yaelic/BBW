      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. In room with us today we have our Chairman Franz Humer. Franz has been on the Diageo Board for three years. He has a wealth of experience of managing global companies which we will benefit from as Franz takes up his new role. So welcome Franz.</p>
          <p>Now moving to our results. The results that we have announced today demonstrate the consistency of our performance. And this consistency is the result of our brand and geographic diversity. This is a strength, particularly in today's world. This year we've delivered 7% organic net sales growth, stronger price mix improvement is primarily the result of OUR swap strategy to focus on value over volume. But also reflects the price increases that we have implemented throughout the business. As a result, we've continued to expand our margins despite the tougher cost pressures that we face this year.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend, excluding Korea and ready to drink was up 8% and operating margins were up a total of 70 basis points. As a result, operating profit grew 9%. We have again generated strong free cash flow in a year in which we have invested heavily to support the future growth of the business, increasing our maturing scotch inventories and creating new distilling and bottling capacity for scotch.</p>
          <p>I am now going to hand over to Nick who will take you through the results in detail. Then I am going to describe the way in which our brands and markets are positioned for the year ahead. Nick?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul and good morning everyone. And a very early good morning to those of you watching this in North America. As I always do I am going to assume that you saw this morning's announcement and move straight to a review of the regions. As Paul outlined a moment ago this is another good set of results. Over 50% of our top and bottom line growth came from international, while operating margin expansion in North America drove over 40% of our operating profit growth.</p>
          <p>In North America, we continue to grow the top and bottom line through focus on our priority brands. These brands continue to gain share and their growth more than offset the 10% net sales decline in ready to drink. So that excluding RTD [Ready To Drink] net sales grew 8%.</p>
          <p>Value brands declined as we focused on our priority brands and our overall share was broadly maintained while share of the priority brands grew 30 basis points. Our premium wine brands gained share with double-digit sales growth. Our beer business also gain share on the back of solid growth of Guinness, up 7% and Smithwick's up 20%.</p>
          <p>We delivered a strong performance in Canada, contributing 15% of total growth for the region. Growth of the priority brands, new customer sales programs and price increases in the second half drove an overall share gain of 1 percentage point.</p>
          <p>Price increases across many of our brands drove favorable price and mix. Captain Morgan, Smirnoff and Crown Royal were the main contributors. We increased spend behind our Reserve Brand Group with a focus on luxury marketing and as a result our super premium brands grew 29% driven by C&#xEE;roc, Don Julio and Johnnie Walker Blue Label.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest behind innovation this year, with particular success in Crown Royal, Cask 16 Tanqueray Rangpur and Smirnoff Cocktails. And as you know we made three exciting additions in the year that will complement our brands and add to our premium, super premium and ultra premium offering. These include our investment behind Ketel One vodka, the acquisition of Rosenblum wines and the agreement to distribute Zacapa ultra premium rum.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Europe, as you know three years ago, we refocused our efforts behind global priority brands and emerging markets. In the year global priority brands drove over 80% of net sales growth, fueled by Johnnie Walker which benefited from the focus on increased marketing investment in Russia and Eastern Europe; by Smirnoff where growth was supported by new marketing campaigns for Smirnoff Red in GB and the increased focus on Smirnoff Black in Poland; and Baileys which returned to growth with new TV advertising in GB and growth in Russia.</p>
          <p>Guinness grew net sales as it continued to gain share in both GB and Ireland. Marketing spend increased with new campaigns and upweighted quality programs and combined with the Rugby World Cup this contributed to the brand's growth.</p>
          <p>In Spain J&amp;B grew net sales 7% on the back of price increase and the volume decline slowed to just 1%. The Start a Party campaign added momentum to sales growth especially in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>As we've discussed previously we continue to improve the nature of our customer relationships. For example, in GB joint business planning, together with better execution of promotions and category initiatives which improved the way in which spirits are sold in store contributed to 3% growth in net sales of spirits.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend growth ahead of net sales has driven the momentum of the priority brands and growth in the region's emerging markets but this has moderated operating profit growth.</p>
          <p>International posted another year of mid-teens net sales growth across all of its hubs. In Africa, demand for premium brands continues to grow. Investment in our infrastructure and brands has driven share gains and our beer and spirits brands grew net sales 19% and 21% respectively.</p>
          <p>Guinness grew net sales 13% supported by an increase in marketing spend of 25%. Pack innovation and increased marketing spend in Nigeria and Ghana accelerated the performance of Guinness Malta with net sales up 30% in Africa.</p>
          <p>In Latin America we accelerated net sales growth and gained share in our key markets. Focus on the priority scotch brands Johnnie Walker, Buchanan's and J&amp;B drove price and mix improvement in scotch of 13 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Our global travel and Middle East business benefited from more stability in the Lebanon, a focus on deluxe scotch and scotch gifting initiatives. This drove price mix improvement of 14% from just 2% volume growth. We've continued to broaden our brand footprint in international across Africa, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff drove growth in what are traditionally beer markets while Smirnoff, Baileys and Guinness contributed over 10% of the net sales growth in LatAm [Latin America].</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific, we have a diverse mix of markets, each at a different level of development and opportunity. In the growth markets of India, China and South East Asia, we continue to build our business, increasing the number of sales people in our new in market companies and as a consequence overheads in the region are up significantly in the year.</p>
          <p>In more established markets such as Australia and Korea, we focused on improved execution of our sales and marketing campaigns. For example in Korea, marketing investment in Windsor was maintained throughout the year and as a result the brand gained 1.1 percentage points of volume share.</p>
          <p>Smirnoff as the leading market Vodka in Asia-Pacific was the key driver of growth. During the year, net sales grew nearly 30% gaining share in India, Australia and Thailand.</p>
          <p>Volume of Johnnie Walker was marginally down, but net sales grew 4%. The impact of the disruption of the Indian duty-free market was only partially offset by the growth of Johnnie Walker in the domestic channel. And net sales declined in Taiwan and Japan given the declining scotch markets there. We increased price in a region which improved shipments in China in the second half, driving 10% overall net sales growth in the full year. Johnnie Walker gained share and has now gained an estimated nine percentage points of share in China over the last three years, closing the gap on its nearest competitor.</p>
          <p>In India, net sales grew 14% as the decline in Johnnie Walker offset by the success of our Bottled in India scotch brands such as Haig and Black and White combined with growth in our Sharktooth and Masterstroke innovation brands. This increased our brand range but has led to some mix dilution.</p>
          <p>Moving now to marketing. Throughout the year we've continued to invest behind our priority brands and key markets. We have reallocated investment from lower value brands to premium and super premium brands especially in scotch. Overall, marketing spend grew less than net sales. However, excluding ready to drink and the route to market change in Korea, the growth in marketing spend matched net sales growth at 8%. The 70 basis point organic improvement we delivered in operating margin was driven by North America, where margin improved 140 basis points and by international with a 90 basis point improvement.</p>
          <p>In North America price and mix improvements covered increases in cost of goods. And there was a slight improvement in overheads. In international price and mix improvements more than offset increases in marketing spend and overheads.</p>
          <p>In Europe increases in price and overhead savings in Spain offset margin reduction in Ireland where margins declined as a result of higher marketing spend. In Asia Pacific our margin was impacted by the increase in overheads as we built infrastructure in the region.</p>
          <p>At the gross margin level, there's been a like-for-like increase in COGS of about &#xA3;95 million, an increase of about 3%. In fiscal '09, I would expect costs to rise by about 5% on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>Before I move to the P&amp;L, a brief word on H2 performance. As we previously outlined, our strategy to premiumize scotch with reduced focus on value brands and more focus on implementing price increases did drive sales growth from less volume growth.</p>
          <p>In addition, volume of Windsor in Korea was down in H2, as the sell-in to our third party distributor in the first half reversed. And therefore, in H2 scotch net sales grew 8% and volume declined 4%. And this was the main driver of the change in net sales growth since the first half.</p>
          <p>In the second half marketing spend increased by 8% excluding ready-to-drink and our priority brands were again the major beneficiaries with Johnnie Walker spend up across all regions. Smirnoff was up in Europe and international and Baileys was up in Europe and Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the income statement. As we anticipated at the half-year the impact of exchange rate movements on operating profit was minimal, with the weakness of the dollar offset by the strength of the euro. Looking forward and based on current rates, we expect exchange rate movement to increase the operating profit by about &#xA3;60 million.</p>
          <p>The timing of our acquisitions in the year meant that their impact was also relatively small. Start-up costs mainly in respect of our acquisition of Rosenblum Cellars reduced reported operating profit slightly.</p>
          <p>Profit from associates increased by &#xA3;28 million driven mainly by Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy. Net finance charges increased by &#xA3;107 million, which I'll break down for you on the next slide. The net interest charge increased by &#xA3;90 million to 341 million. Net debt increased as we continued our buyback program and spent nearly &#xA3;600 million on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Our effective interest rate increased from 5.5% to 5.9% as a result of the rise in euro and sterling floating interest rates and as we refinanced maturing dollar debt at the higher current rates.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased that given our financial strength, we've been able to access the debt markets throughout the year at favorable spreads. In the current interest rate environment, I would expect to broadly hold this effective interest rate in fiscal '09, although exchange rate movements will increase the interest charge by approximately &#xA3;15 million.</p>
          <p>Moving to net other finance income. Finance income on post employment plans was broadly the same in 2008 as in 2007 as higher equity returns offset an increase in the discounted value of liabilities. Given the increase in discount rates based on corporate bond yields, next year this element of finance income is expected to be negligible.</p>
          <p>Exchange movements on short-term intercompany loans and loans where hedge accounting is not applicable were unfavorable giving rise to an 8 million movement year-on-year. And the movement in other finance charges relates to a write-down in the value of cash balances as we repatriated cash from markets with exchange controls.</p>
          <p>The charge to exceptionals relates mainly to the recently announced change we are making to our brewing operations in Ireland. Last year, there was an exceptional gain on the sale of land at Park Royal.</p>
          <p>In 2007, the tax rate before exceptionals was 33%, but excluding the impact of deferred tax movements and prior year settlements, the underlying effective rate was 25.1%. This year there were no material prior year deferred tax movements. And our effective tax rate is 24.5%, giving rise to a charge of &#xA3;530 million.</p>
          <p>This is lower than the 26% rate I outlined at the prelims as our effective US tax rate is lower than we envisaged and we have a lower level of earnings arising in higher taxation territories than we expected. It's difficult to forecast the exact tax rate each year, as governments review tax legislation and rates, however, I do now expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be around 25%.</p>
          <p>We've continued to generate strong cash flow this year, a further &#xA3;1.3 billion. Increases in operating profit and sterling dividend income from Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy were offset by increased working capital, which increased ahead of net sales as a result of our investment in maturing scotch and the higher value of raw materials and packaging held as stock.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure increases were driven by investment across Africa, systems upgrades and our investment in scotch production.</p>
          <p>Cash tax paid was broadly in line with last year. As I said before, I do expect the cash tax paid to move to our 21% ongoing cash tax rate. Although again, given the nature of tax settlements with revenue authorities around the world, it is difficult to forecast when this could happen.</p>
          <p>We finished the year with net borrowings of &#xA3;6.4 billion, free cash flow was nearly 1.3 billion and we've returned &#xA3;1.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks. Our investment behind Ketel One vodka and in our venture in South Africa and the acquisition of Rosenblum accounted for 575 million of acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Sterling was weaker at June, 2008 than at June, 2007, which increased reported net debt. In line with our commitment to a single-A credit rating, I currently anticipate that our 2009 buyback program will be around &#xA3;750 million.</p>
          <p>On an underlying basis, earnings per share grew 11% increasing to 60.6 pence per share from 54.8 pence per share last year. Organic growth drove a 5.3 pence increase, whilst the increase in debt associated with our acquisitions led to minor dilution of 0.2 pence per share. This was more than offset by the positive impact of 0.7 pence per share resulting from our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>In summary then, the world is uncertain. But our biggest asset in this environment is our global diversity and our range across categories and across price points. As you can see from this slide, our markets have different strengths and face different opportunities and challenges.</p>
          <p>In North America, we have a superior route to market and have consistently invested behind successful marketing campaigns. Therefore our priority brands have momentum, as their share gains demonstrate.</p>
          <p>In Europe we have grown the business, as we've successfully targeted our investment at growth categories, such as premium scotch, and growth markets, such as Eastern Europe and Russia.</p>
          <p>In international, we've built market and category leading positions in developing markets which underpins our position for the coming year. And in Asia Pacific, we've now created significant market presence in the high growth markets there. We face a specific challenge in Australia, with the duty change on ready to drink. However across the region, we believe that we can deliver and improve performance in 2009.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier input cost pressure will be more intense in 2009 than last year. But with our well supported brands, with good routes to market, we are in the best possible position to realize price increases.</p>
          <p>In contrast, the current exchange rate environment will benefit our reported results, as will our financial strength, which allows us to raise debt at an advantaged cost within the sector. Taken together, all this underpins our confidence in the guidance we have given today for the next financial year, namely organic operating profit growth in the range of 7 to 9% and for double digit reported EPS growth.</p>
          <p>And now I will hand back to Paul.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Nick. As Nick summarized these were a good set of financial results. But as Nick also outlined, the new year presents challenges, but also it presents opportunities. Our biggest challenge is the current global economic environment; against this our business has entered the new financial year stronger.</p>
          <p>The growth of our business is driven by our global diversity, our very strong brands across categories supported by good routes to market and our excellent marketing and deep consumer understanding.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are building stronger relationships with our customers. We have been consistently investing in this business model and it gives us the platform from which to continue to grow in the coming year.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to take you through how we will capitalize on strengths in the year ahead. Diageo is a truly global player across beverage alcohol. This global position means that we are able to seize growth opportunities, whilst managing challenges in individual markets.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we again delivered a strong performance in North America. We improved performance in Europe and we delivered very strong growth across international. In Asia Pacific the loss of our import license in Korea for part of the year impacted our overall performance. We also increased our overhead cost in Asia Pacific behind more salesmen and better distribution. And while this is the right long-term strategy for the region, in the short term it does hold back operating profit.</p>
          <p>In North America, while there have been signs of a slowdown in the on trade in some states such as Florida and California, we've not seen a significant impact on the overall spirits market. The latest data shows the US spirits market growing at the same rate as in fiscal '08 and Diageo is the only major player gaining share.</p>
          <p>Our relationships with our distributors are strong. The work we are now doing with them to build sales capabilities will give us even greater flexibility. We can anticipate changing consumer patterns over the next year and respond to these changes with the right brands, marketing and sales support, so that we continue to outperform.</p>
          <p>In our US beer business, we have gained share again this year. We've recently reorganized our sales teams to focus on our key customers and we are implementing a program to reduce our beer distributors' inventory levels in fiscal '09. This will benefit our distributors, further building our relationship with them and it will improve product quality to give the consumer a better experience of Guinness.</p>
          <p>Across our wine brands, we've reviewed our price positioning with respect to supply and the competitive landscape. This combined with the inclusion of our premium range Rosenblum Cellars and our tailored marketing programs means we are well placed to accelerate the performance of our premium wines in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>Innovation in fiscal '09 will focus on the value added premium line extensions, which have proved so successful in fiscal '08. Also premixed cocktails as consumers demand on trade quality in their home.</p>
          <p>Our results for '08 in Europe demonstrate the success of focus on three strategic pillars. In fiscal '09, we will continue to drive higher margins through actively managing the mix of our business by brand, category, customer, channel and consumer. We plan to take price across our European markets particularly in scotch.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to build on the super premium opportunity with increased resource for our Reserve brands, especially Johnnie Walker Blue and the Classic Malts. We will also continue to build marketing and sales support around brands such as Captain Morgan, Zacapa and Ketel One vodka. These brands are underrepresented in many of our European markets. And we will build their market positions to drive growth in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we will build at home consumption as we roll out our new category marketing approach across Europe particularly with the off trade retailers. In Eastern Europe and in Russia, we'll continue to benefit from the range of our scotch brands which gives us the ability to compete at the different price points across the scotch category.</p>
          <p>International has had a great year. The growth drivers are clear. We build market-leading brands, which consumers respect and aspire to. The performance we've delivered in Mexico is a great example of this. Growth was delivered across all categories. In a spirits market growing volume 2%, our leading brands in the fast growing scotch category gained share and together with growth of Smirnoff and Baileys drove overall double digit volume growth for our business.</p>
          <p>As purchasing power increases, more consumers were able to afford our brands. In the coming year, we'll continue to apply the same focus on great marketing campaigns and on broadening our brand range into new categories. In 2009, our innovation in international will be focused on off-trade beer in Africa to broaden the consumer base and on premium spirits in Latin America and also in global travel. In the last two years we've increased our investment across Asia Pacific to create a platform from which we can access the growth opportunity which the region presents.</p>
          <p>As we did in international five years ago, and using our learnings from that successful strategy, we're investing in our brands. We're building our routes to market and broadening our brand range. We've created new in-market companies in China, India and Vietnam increasing our sales teams significantly. We've broadened our brand range with innovations in India and with the introduction of global brands such as Smirnoff and Guinness in China.</p>
          <p>As these markets continue to develop we will be able to use the wide brand choice that we offer customers and consumers to capture growth. As Nick said earlier Asia Pacific is a diverse group of markets. As we look at the individual market outlook for fiscal '09, we'll have to manage changing circumstances, for example in India with the possible changes to the duty-free channel. Against this background, we have the brand range and organizational ability to deliver growth and continue to invest in the region.</p>
          <p>In total, across spirits, wine and beer, we are driving growth. Sprits grew 7%, wine 9% and beer 8%. We have strong brands in fast growing categories in vodka and rum. Our leading brands Smirnoff and Captain Morgan continued to grow share. We're delivering industry leading growth in scotch again driven by the performance of Johnnie Walker which further enhanced its leadership position this year.</p>
          <p>In beer, Guinness has outperformed the UK and Irish beer markets. But key to its overall growth is its great performance in Africa. Even stronger performance was delivered by our local brands Malta Guinness, Tusker, Pilsner and Senator.</p>
          <p>In fiscal '09, we will continue to drive growth across categories and there are significant opportunities for us to roll out our brands to new markets. For example Captain Morgan has an establish presence in North America, but grew double-digit in the other three regions as the rum category continues to expand globally.</p>
          <p>We have also delivered broad based growth across price points. And only the value category saw a decline as we reallocate resources away from value scotch brands.</p>
          <p>Within each category, we have leading brands across the key price points. Johnnie Walker, for example covers price points from $25 to $400 from Johnnie Walker Red Label to Johnnie Walker Blue Label King George V.</p>
          <p>In the current year, we've broadened our price range in vodka with the addition of Ketel One positioned between Smirnoff and C&#xEE;roc. Our ability to allocate resources between categories and price points to access growth opportunities will be a key driver of growth in fiscal 09.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, we build the most appropriate way of reaching our customers and consumers in each market. We've made a number of investments again this year which will improve our routes to market and drive sales.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, our focus is on driving growth in premium international spirits which is benefiting from a clear shift by consumers out of local spirits and into international spirits. We are now aligned with the best distributors in each of these markets. We bring the leading brands in international spirits and they bring strong and well developed distribution capabilities, local market knowledge and a relationship with customers.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, we now operate through a venture between Diego, Heineken and Namibia Breweries. This new route to market harnesses the opportunity of the premium range across beer, wine, spirits and RTDs, building on the 20% net sales growth we achieved in '08.</p>
          <p>We've also found innovative ways to bring new brands to Diego. This year, we've added Rosenblum Cellars brining a leading Zinfandel to our wine range in the US. We now own the brand and we've retained the expertise of the man who built the brand.</p>
          <p>We've entered into a new distribution agreement for Zacapa, which premiumizes our offerings in rum and with the Ketel One transaction we've enhanced Diageo's platform in the super-premium Vodka segment.</p>
          <p>A key contributor to our performance is the way in which we approach marketing. We want to be a hive of great marketing ideas, some big, some less so, but all resonating with our consumers. With our clear understanding of the brand attributes that we want to portray to consumers, we can vary our marketing campaigns using big things such Grand Prix sponsorship, using specialist implementations such as Bushmills' on a bank note and using regional things such as our partnership between Manchester United and Smirnoff Red in Asia.</p>
          <p>We can use global campaigns. For example, Smirnoff's position as the worlds leading premium sprit has been built through a consistent global message. J&amp;B's global 'Start a Party' campaign has been a key contributor to its strong growth both in the brand's traditional markets of Europe and in newer markets in Asia and International.</p>
          <p>We can also use local marketing campaigns and local executions of global campaigns. In this way, we are broadening the appeal of our brands to a wider group of consumers. For example, consumers identify with their local heroes. And we've used this insight in North America where the performance of C&#xEE;roc has been transformed by its link with Shawn Combs.</p>
          <p>Diageo is also a frontrunner in using digital media as part of brand marketing. We are looking to integrate digital across our brand plans to engage with our consumers where they expend an increasing amount of their time. Digital in all its formats is now reaching critical mass in many markets and it's not just the internet. It's across mobile phones, broadband and digital TV.</p>
          <p>A great example is Baileys in China. Baileys used the winner of the Chinese version of Pop Idol to headline two events to bring the Baileys brand to life in Shanghai and Beijing. While 2000 people attended the events, live webcasting, sponsorship of China's leading web portal and online ads increased the reach to over 1 million consumers.</p>
          <p>We look at consumer trends across categories and markets. Using these insights we can identify which trends have relevance and longevity. Trends which have longevity are rooted in the way that consumers live their lives and we've been investing behind these trends. Macroeconomic changes may temporarily moderate these trends but they do not fundamentally change their direction.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to take you through two examples which illustrate this. The first will show you how we continue to invest in premiumization while the second example highlights our increased focused on the off trade. Premiumization is a trend we been investing behind for a number of years. The way which we invest is increasing tailored to individual markets. This is important at a time when regions and income groups will be affected to different degrees by economic developments. However, there's still a growing number of consumers who can afford our brands.</p>
          <p>In China, we've seen the development from an expanding middle class and growing disposable income and the need to display their newfound status. Economic growth has made it easier for these consumers to act on their aspirations. And we've significantly expanded our super premium range.</p>
          <p>We've also expanded the brand range we offer in China. We can provide consumers with the status of an international brand but at a lower price point. This will allow us to broaden our consumer base in the years ahead. This will be a significant advantage as government policy on entertaining expenditure may moderate, as it appears to be doing.</p>
          <p>In contrast, in Russia, consumers are benefiting from the economic growth which is predicted to remain consistent and we've seen a strong demand for our super premium scotch. Sales have doubled of the past year and we see this trend continuing in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Globally, we now have 300 people focused on our Reserve Brands with local brand plans in place in all markets. This business model provides us with a platform for the rapid launch of innovations such as Nuvo and the Singleton. Net sales were up nearly 30% in the year. And we enter fiscal '09 with proven growth drivers behind each of the Reserve Brands in each of the 50 cities worldwide in which our Reserve Brand Group teams are based.</p>
          <p>In many of our developed markets one of the key trends is the move from on-trade to off-trade. And recent economic conditions are accelerating this trend. We've positioned our brands to play a key role in the off-trade. Key to this has been helping consumers to build their confidence to replicate at home spirits based on the drinks that they consume in the on-trade. In GB this thinking has driven our very successful Spirit of Summer campaign and we are about to build on that success with our Spirit of Autumn campaign. The slide shows the impact of our focus on increasing off-trade sales has had on two of our priority brands in the US.</p>
          <p>In the past year we have seen demand in the on-trade decline in the US. However, we've driven overall volume growth through successful off-trade marketing campaigns and in store initiatives.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our commitment to build better sales relationships with our customers. We've positioned ourselves to be the partner of choice, based on the strengths that I have already outlined this morning, our strong brands, our global position and our investment in marketing. We continue to form great relationships with local and international customers alike in markets all around the globe.</p>
          <p>Great sales relationships mean that our customers include us in the decisions they make about the beverage alcohol sector. Understanding consumer and shopper needs and behaviors allows us to roll out solutions which will help the retailer capture the opportunity for off-trade growth, potentially worth hundreds of millions of pounds in increased retail sales value.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, for example, Wal-Mart is our biggest customer and we are delivering consistent volume growth with them. Together we developed the category and share a common platform for growth. We also work together on social responsibility initiatives. In 2008, a Wal-Mart Diageo age verification campaign was run across all 300 Wal-Mart stores in Brazil.</p>
          <p>The campaign was designed to prevent minors from purchasing alcohol and it has received strong endorsement from consumers as well as stakeholders, who are dealing with youth issues.</p>
          <p>And now before we move to questions let me summarize. We are pleased with this set of financial results. And Nick and I have taken you through the key strengths which underpin the delivery of our consistent performance. Our approach to investment in the business continued in fiscal '08 and Diageo has entered the new financial year even stronger.</p>
          <p>We have enhanced our strong market positions in established markets by continuing to invest in our brands, to drive improvements in our routes to markets, focusing our investments on growth categories and markets and deepening the relationships with our customers. At the same time, we broadened our position in developing markets.</p>
          <p>In international our priority brands have continued to drive share. And we are expanding our brand range with innovation. In Asia-Pacific, we built stronger sales teams and infrastructure.</p>
          <p>We have further strengthened the business through acquisitions and alliances which have added three great brands, Rosenblum, Ketel One vodka and Zacapa.</p>
          <p>This is a business in the right shape to face the current environment. I believe that in 2009 we can again deliver our guidance while making the investments which will continue to strengthen Diageo. Thank you.</p>
          <p>I am now going to be joined by Nick, Ivan, Stuart, John and Andrew to take your questions. While you are getting ready to ask any questions that you have may have, I am going to show you some of the successful marketing executions that we have developed this year.</p>
          <p>Firstly, some great advertising which has been developed through our partnership with Shawn Combs and which is driving the very strong growth that we are seeing in C&#xEE;roc.</p>
          <p>The second shows a collaboration Smirnoff brought about between Mark Ronson and Duran Duran driving media coverage of the brand. Then you will see how the continued growth of our largest brands, Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness is underpinned by innovative marketing that builds consumer loyalty.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now take our first question from Michael Bleakley of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three brief questions. Paul can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. First question was on infrastructure, you've made an investment, obviously, in areas like Asia this year. These things that there are markets obviously, over the course of the next six to twelve months, where you're going to have to make major investments and maybe you could just talk us through what those market would be.</p>
          <p>Second point is on scale in developed markets and maybe the need to build the scale there, given the fact you've got a shift to off-trade consumption. Do you see any opportunities to further expand the kind of relations you've been building around the globe and to build scale in markets like Europe and give you a bit more leverage with the retailer?</p>
          <p>And then the third question was really on total beverage alcohol, obviously you've had a Namibian, South African position, which has been in place for some time. Could you talk briefly through the major incremental benefits you're seeing from drawing all sort of three or four sub-categories of alcohol together and maybe give us some indication as to where you see opportunities to expand that total beverage alcohol model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Michael. Why don't I try and take the first two questions. And I'll specifically then hand over to Stuart to talk about South Africa. Because I think the South African model is one that we can learn from and may prove applicable in other markets.</p>
          <p>First of all regarding infrastructure, we have the scale and the resources, so that if we see opportunity in any given market and it makes sense to invest further in infrastructure, we will do so. Here today, I'm not looking down the barrel of any major further investment, certainly a continuation the year-on-year impact &#x2013; the annualized impact of the investments that we've made but nothing fundamental. But equally, we are always alert to opportunities and we are fortunate that we have the resources to act to access those opportunities.</p>
          <p>Secondly, scale in developed markets. I think one has to look at that very much on a market-by-market basis. If you consider the US where the basic routes to market are quite different, we have very good scale in spirits; increasingly good scale in wine. But for us it's always about operating in the premium space. Scale for the sake of volume, really doesn't interest us. We want to make sure that we can market brands that we can continue to access the relevant consumer. So scale of the right quality will always be important to us. But scale just to be bigger I don't think serves us well.</p>
          <p>Let me to move to Stuart maybe to talk about South Africa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Michael. In South Africa, obviously the Diageo, Heineken and Namibia Breweries joint venture there, Brandhouse, is really starting to demonstrate success. I mean, we grew net sales 20% in the past and that was broad based across all categories of beer, ready to drink, newly introduced cider brand in that buoyant category as well as core spirits. And the way in which the total beverage alcohol solution is working for us there, really gives us increased scale.</p>
          <p>If you wind the clock back three ago, that business had about 300 people. Today we have more than 900 people and the biggest increase has been in the sales organization. So, feet on the street driving much broader and deeper distribution coverage, getting into areas where it's predominantly beer today but where our spirit brands are being increasingly featured as well as obviously the ready to drink brands. So distribution scale, breadth and coverage is one area.</p>
          <p>The second area really lying behind the ability to touch as many shoppers and consumers as possible, is the whole consumer understanding arena, by having real brands in all of the categories we're able to get in, understand the consumer drivers, shopper drivers and leverage those into propositions which work very well across the whole category with retailers. So the retailer category offer, consumer and shopper understanding, breadth of distribution, feet on the street, cost scale benefits, every which way you look at it, it's really working for us and as I said, results even in these early days have been incredibly strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stuart. I think just to add, having recently visited that market, quite recently with Stuart, you've got an interesting phenomenon that in every sector we are playing at the premium end. And if you look at the sales person, they have got everything in their toolkit that they need to access the kind of accounts that we want to access. So I think it's a great model. I think all the partners are very happy and we will learn from that and deploy in other markets where it makes sense. Next question please.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder if you can comment on two items. The first: in your presentation you reference your confidence in the ability to raise prices. Just -- what is your level of confidence that you can get adequate pricing given the slowdown in global GDP and will pricing contribute a level that we saw in fiscal '08 and fiscal '09?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if you could also just comment on your outlook for Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll ask Andrew to talk specifically to Spain but let me talk generally about the pricing environment.</p>
          <p>First of all, there are a variety of ways to go after price. You can go for across the line price increases and we have done that and we will to continue to do that. I am not saying that the price increase environment is easy but, because every consumer products company is facing rising input costs, that discussion is not unusual with buyers or whatever and therefore, there is a level of understanding even a level of receptivity. Now if we can couple that discussion with brand building activities, so we actually put support behind the brand to further endorse with the consumer why that price increase is worth it then we have a win-win. That's what we've done this year. We will do that again next year.</p>
          <p>The second kind of price increase is whereby you either migrate consumers up the price ladder or you introduce new products at higher margin to attract new consumers. I think we've got a proven track record in both of those areas if you look at what we've done with our Reserve Brand Group. In the numbers we've just reported, it grew 27%. These are ultra premium marks Johnnie Walker Blue Label, Tanqueray TEN, C&#xEE;roc, Don Julio performing very, very well. And I think what underpins all of that is our infrastructure, our marketing capability, but also a world whereby irrespective of the economic realties there are many people out there who view our products, our categories as affordable indulgence. They want the best and they can access our products at not huge price points versus other luxury goods. So we have great confidence in the pricing and the mix environment in the year ahead.</p>
          <p>In handing over to Andrew, let me just say I think our business in Spain, as he probably won't say this, our business in Spain I think performed very well in what has been a very tough market and the performance of J&amp;B, I view as outstanding. Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks Paul. And in fact I think the two questions are linked to quite some extent. Clearly the market conditions in Spain are soft, particularly in the on trade and that's largely driven by a combination of economic and lifestyle changes, but as Paul says our performance is been pretty strong and robust and I think this is really all about our strong brand equities in scotch because it really comes from two particular gains for us. We have been able to get a lot of price. So if you take our two big scotch brands in Spain J&amp;B and Johnnie Walker Red, J&amp;B is up 7% on volume of down 1%, so you are 8 points of gearing between volume and price and Johnnie Walker also up 4% on the volumes down 2% in that market. So we are getting sales growth as a result of getting both headline price and a reduction in the discounts that we are giving in that particular market.</p>
          <p>Really then when you couple that with some market share gains, price and market share gains driven by strong brand equities we haven't seen anything yet in our performance in Spain that would have us be unduly worried, clearly we're going to have to keep our eye on the market situation and the trend particularly in the on premise.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Erwan Rambourg of HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good morning. I am Erwan Rambourg from HSBC. Three questions, if I can.</p>
          <p>First on the guidance the 7 to 9% organic operating profit growth; is this on the basis of a similar sales growth, implying margin pressure or is this on the basis of lower sales growth than last year implying operating margin expansion?</p>
          <p>Secondly, maybe one for Ivan on the US I think you mentioned market share was broadly maintained in spirits, is this a slight disappointment and how much further do you think you can grow if at all the market share you have today in the states?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, on one of the brands, Jos&#xE9; Cuervo, it's the only priority brand in negative territory in both volume and sales growth. Can you give us an update on the progress you are making in terms of repositioning the brand and when do you believe we can see an inflexion point in terms of trends for that brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me maybe take the Jos&#xE9; Cuervo question first. Equally, in Ivan's answer to market share he may want to touch on it.</p>
          <p>Clearly, it is disappointing because as you've outlined all of our other brands, our global priority brands grew at attractive rates. That said, we don't own the brand and we don't have exclusive control over the marketing. However, we are working with the brand owners and I would expect a turnaround in the performance of that brand in pretty short order.</p>
          <p>The other thing not to loss sight off is we also operate in super premium tequila with the Don Julio brand. And Don Julio, although not obvious in these numbers actually improved its NSV by over 20%. So, yes, work to do on Cuervo, but we are seeing growth in tequila at the super premium level.</p>
          <p>Regarding guidance, there will be pushes and pulls in the year ahead and we will have to manage that. But the guidance we've offered outlines a similar profile in our P&amp;L to what we have achieved in '08 and of course seven to nine still underpins double-digit EPS growth.</p>
          <p>With that, Ivan do you want to comment on market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On market share, if you look at our performance in fiscal '08, on our priority brands we've grown 30 basis points in market share. So within the portfolio Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal, Baileys, Tanqueray, Johnnie Walker are all in healthy growth. Our Reserve Brands which are up nearly 30% in NSV are performing very strongly.</p>
          <p>Overall -- our overall share is flat for a couple of reasons. One is the low end of our portfolio. So brands like Gordon's Vodka, real katman and value brands which we have under invested and focused on is where we have lost most of the share. And frankly from an economic standpoint and a strategic standpoint we are fine with that.</p>
          <p>Paul addressed Cuervo, we are not happy with the share performance in Cuervo. I would say as we look at fiscal '09 with the marketing plans we are putting in place, including new campaigns and the innovation program behind Cuervo, I expect us to stabilize our position and from there build again the brand healthfully again.</p>
          <p>So overall net-net across the beer, wine and spirits in our priority value creating portfolio, our brands are very healthy and we have grown 30 basis points there. I would expect the trend to continue in the range of 30 basis points. Some years it may be a bit higher, some years a little lower. But our focus is really to drive value creation. So as we take up price, invest behind marketing and grow share, that could be the range of share improvement that I would expect to see. In certain years innovation will play a bigger role in driving share gains versus others. But we believe we've got a sustained platform for outperformance of the market for the next several years in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I would just build on that by saying to Ivan's point this is quality share, because the economics where we have gained share are very appealing. Also if you look at large full line suppliers in the US, we are clearly outperforming the rest of the pack. So we are quite pleased with our performance in the US.</p>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Melissa Earlam of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. It's Melissa Earlam from UBS, three questions please.</p>
          <p>Firstly, can you give us an update on Ketel One and the progress you are seeing there since the deal closed at the beginning of June and particularly what kind of level of margin we might expect from that brand into fiscal '09?</p>
          <p>The second question, perhaps one for Ivan; it was mentioned that there was an overhead reduction in North America in '08, which partly helped to drive the goods margin improvement. Can you just give a little more detail on that and whether we should expect continued overhead savings into '09?</p>
          <p>And finally a question for Andrew: can you just talk a little bit about three of your markets in Europe where the macro scenario is deteriorating GB, Spain and Ireland and if you're seeing any signs at all of consumers trading down in any spirits categories there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Melissa. So to overheads in the US, Ivan will get. Andrew you can talk about the European environment.</p>
          <p>Regarding Ketel, it's very early days, but we are very pleased with the performance of the brand, very pleased with what we bought into and are in the throes of, I think, forming an even stronger partnership with the Nolet family. One has to bear in mind that the brand is mainly at this stage rooted in the US. The opportunity for us is to migrate the brand into other markets. We have plans to do that and we have the infrastructure and capability to accelerate that. I don't believe, Nick, that we disclose margins by brand and therefore it's not really appropriate that I get into that. But early days on the brand we are delighted with what we see.</p>
          <p>Ivan, overheads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Melissa if you look at the operating leverage in the North American P&amp;L indeed a piece of it comes from the overhead improvement. I would say the bulk of that are one-off factor comparisons from prior years. So we would not expect that level to repeat. However, we are very tightly managing overheads in this current environment and I'd say in our North American business I would certainly expect with our focus on price mix improvement and gross margin to translate as well into overhead leverage as it works its way through the P&amp;L. But the bulk of what you're seeing in the current half are one-off comparisons versus the prior year which we would not expect to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Melissa, GB, Spain and Ireland are challenged markets as you put it. I guess largely the on-trade and particularly beer in GB and Ireland. I mean for our business, I mean touching on beer in the on-trade first, Guinness Paul has already alluded to, we managed to grow sales 2% on Guinness in both GB and Ireland in an on-trade market that is down depending on which period you take something around 5, 6, 7%. So, we are bucking the trend there, we are taking a lot of market share. That continues through -- right through to Q4. So to some extent, we've been immune by taking market share in the on-trade for beer.</p>
          <p>In GB we've had a lot of success now leveraging our spirits portfolio with the big off-trade retailers to grow the spirits category, particularly in at-home consumption. So we've been investing consistently this year behind the sort of big four category leaders we've got Smirnoff, Baileys, Bell's and Gordon's and investing in the category and growing the category in collaboration with the retailers is working very well for us. And a couple of numbers there Smirnoff in GB is up 8%, Baileys up 11% on prior year.</p>
          <p>I mean the other thing I'd observe, if you take the impact of those declines across Europe, we do have this great growing scotch business, 60% of our growth in Europe comes from scotch. And Johnnie Walker up 11% Europe wide from sale -- from volume up of 6% so combination of volume and price J&amp;B up 6% and we are effectively getting consumers to trade up in scotch. There's quite a revealing profile in the one of the markets, France, which is quite representative, our cheap secondary whisky sales are down 26%, our standard brands are up 3%, our premium brands are up 6% and our super premium brands are up 14%. So we are growing ever faster the higher the price point and we seem consistently to be able to get consumers to trade up through our Scotch whisky portfolio.</p>
          <p>And that brings me to premiumization. We are not seeing any slowdown in the premiumization trend even in Western Europe. We will keep close to this, but the top end of our Johnnie Walker portfolio is plus 18% year-on-year. That's Johnnie Walker Black and up into Blue and Gold. And our malts business is Continental Europe up 14%. So we've got 20% of our business now in premium and super premium and that does continue to grow. So yeah there are some soft conditions in those three markets, but I think our portfolio and some of the growth drivers that we've got and brand progress is allowing us to get some immunity to that.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from Ian Shackleton of Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen, Ian Shackleton at Lehman Brothers. Two questions: firstly, in the international division you kept the same net sales growth first half versus second half, but there has been a slowdown in volume and, obviously, an increase in price and mix. Is that a focus that we should expect to see continuing into '09? It seems to be there both for the beer business in Africa and the LatAm scotch business?</p>
          <p>And the second question was around Asia where we are clearly looking, I guess, for a normalization of Korea and a bounce back in '09. Is it right to see that bounce back affect to be offsetting the knock back on ready to drink in Australia, which you quantified at 25 million sterling?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Ian. Why don't I hand straight off to Stuart on first half, second half?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, I think, the short answer is broadly, yes, you can expect to see that kind of picture, growing volume at about 5%, net sales at 16% in the last year, that kind of relativity between volume and price. We would expect to continue driven by mix, driven by pricing actions including the full year impact of pricing actions we took in the F '08 particularly, in the second half and further pricing actions we will taking in the year ahead. The absolute numbers of 5 and 16, I definitely wouldn't be sitting here and saying those are numbers you should bake into your model, but we would expect solid volume growth and very good margin and mix improvement. So that's what &#x2013; that's the picture going forward as I see it.</p>

          <p>In Korea we &#x2013; the net affect through the year as Korea took about five points of growth off the top line and cost us about &#xA3;20 million in operating profit. I'm pleased to say once we got our license back we have been able to accelerate the business there and extend our share leadership in Korea so, I am looking to a very normalized and in fact an accelerated year on performance in Korea in F '09.</p>
          <p>In Australia and the impact of around 25 million does as you say provide some offset, we will be rebating our business in Australia, the RTD tax impact has been significant but counter to the RTD and netted off in that figure is a very attractive increase in our full strength Spirits business. So RTDs look like they'll be down about 35% Spirits look like they may be up around 15 to 20% but as you say there will be roughly an offset in F '09.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a question on the channel shift as you look at 2009, assuming that there's going to be a greater proportion of your sales running through the off trade, will that also affect the way that you spend your marketing dollars? So will you be shifting more of your spend into the off-trade? And if so, does it also imply that you will be spending more on price promotion and sort of in store merchandizing as opposed to more brand building activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer that at the macro level but equally I think the way that it gets executed is clearly market-by-market. Directionally it should not, equally the channel shift certainly in the US, does not bring with it any particular margin issues. The margin structure is very, very similar and we recognize that one of the reasons that we enjoy the penetration and resonance with customers is because of the image that these brands have. So we will continue to invest in brand building.</p>
          <p>As regards activity in store, that clearly will be dialed up but in a manner that is consistent with the brand image that we're trying to create.</p>
          <p>Andrew you've been quite at the forefront in some of this work in Europe. Do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it comes back &#x2013; an example I gave earlier on GB across Europe now where we are investing more in the off-premise is in growing the sprits category for at home consumption and we are doing that you know in collaboration with our big retail partners, identifying what are the key shopper opportunities for at home &#x2013; linked to at home consumption and then working with the retailer to produce a shelf layout and a combination of products so for instance in one example might be cocktails at home, sort of getting home after a long day's work, we've been merchandizing together the sprit product, the mixer, some lemons, some ice, to create some theater around an at home consumption occasion and that's driving quite a lot of growth in the sprits category in those retailer accounts. So that is a good example of where we are investing more in the off-premise.</p>
          <p>I must stress that we are also working very hard with our on-trade partners to try and help their businesses hold up which is equal important to us as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A good example would be say Formula One where clearly the positioning of the Johnnie Walker brand, the positioning of Formula One the way that we activate around races such as Monaco clearly builds the brand. But then you can take that package into the retailer and actually create a lot of excitement at the retail level as well. So I don't think it's either-or here. It is the combined package and I hope from the marketing work that we've displayed you get a sense that we are pleased. Always scope for improvement; we believe in continuous improvement, but we are pretty pleased with where we are in this regard.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Two questions please; the first one referring to international. There was a 2% benefit on the foreign exchange on net sales in international. Given the strength of the naira up what 10% year-on-year against sterling and the real about 20%, I wondered if that relatively low level of benefit reflected drag from other currencies or was it because of hedges and we'll see the benefit coming through in FY '09?</p>
          <p>And the second question related to South Africa. Paul, you talked about deploying the &#x2013; or potentially deploying the model elsewhere. I appreciate you won't be able to be specific about it, but can you talk a little bit more about what types of market you think would be suitable for this model and would you be open to other beer partners other than Heineken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the second question first and then maybe ask my colleagues between Nick and Stuart to comeback to you on the currency issue.</p>
          <p>First of all, would we be amenable to other beer partners? We would, as long as they have access to the right brands. In other words, they have to be premium brands. If it's just mainstream brands it works to a lesser extent.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we want similar philosophy. I think the mutual respect that's been built in our joint venture in South Africa is quite palpable when you visit that business unit and provides the right culture to spawn further growth. So you have to get it right as regards the brands and you have to get it right regarding the partnership.</p>
          <p>You also have to get it right regarding the market. In South Africa, the route to market allows the kind of structure that we put in place. There are many other similar markets to South Africa around the world but there is no question that in a market such as the US, it would be more challenging. So you've got to make sure the brands are right, the culture and shared goals are right and also that the method of distribution market-by-market is also right. So we will continue to explore these opportunities but I would say that our experience with Heineken to date is very positive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Nick, currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on FX Trevor, I think you almost answered your own question. It is really that the spread of our business, if you like, effect coming in here. You picked a couple of currencies that have strengthened. There are several others, many others in fact, across our business that have weakened. So in international the bolivar, the Mexican peso, the South African rand, if you like, have all gone the other way and so the net number that you are quoting truly is the net number of some ups and downs. If you recall the only piece of our business we hedge now really is the transaction side of it. Translation whether it would be sales or profits is going to come through to the business in that particular year. And therefore you shouldn't be thinking about this really something that is going to unwind in the next year. It will be a function of where exchange rates go to next year. This will not really be affected by edging</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Dresdner Kleinwort and Simon Hales. Please go head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. It's Simon Hales at Dresdner Kleinwort. I've got three hopefully very quick questions, please.</p>
          <p>Firstly, Nick, on your comment on input costs, I wonder if you could just flesh out a little bit more there the outlook for '09.  I mean how hedged are you now on your major input costs and is there any scope for that 150 million to see some reduction if oil prices continue to moderate?</p>
          <p>Secondly on A&amp;P [Advertising and Promotion] spend in the North-America, I'm surprise to see, it slow down further organically in the second half. Was that RTD related and how should we be thinking about A&amp;P spend in the US into '09?</p>
          <p>And finally just sticking with the US, I know the California is proposing a tax increase on flavored malt beverages to be coming in in early October. I think that your brands are largely going to be excluded from that, just wanted to confirm that was the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why don't I ask Ivan to comment on A&amp;P and also the specific RTD issue in California and Nick will come back to you on input cost. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On A&amp;P, if you look at this year, excluding RTDs, indeed our RTD business, we are disinvesting and so reducing our A&amp;P spend. On our core business A&amp;P was up 5% this year excluding RTD and we would expect that trend to continue. One of the things we're clearly looking at as we go into a more challenging economic environment is to sustain the brand equity building momentum we have in this very healthy portfolio. And we're going to be smart about it and we are going to keep building, because that's how we fundamentally expect to outperform the market.</p>
          <p>On your point on California, there is legislation in place or change in regs in California on the FMB [Flavored Malt Beverage] definitions and taxation. We have a plan in place in terms of the formulation of our products to be able to come through that pretty much unaffected. It's a little complicated, because we will have to reformulate slightly our FMB products, but we're ready to do that and if in fact the change goes in place, we'll be fine with our current line of Smirnoff Ice and FMBs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ivan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we shouldn't expect any significant cost associated with that, Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some -- not significant. I mean it's certainly manageable within our business. It's not a significant hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing to bear in mind on A&amp;P is we continue to get economies of scale particularly if we move into certain sponsorships, the brand grows, we do have some sort of fixed term levels of investments. So we are getting more bang for our buck in a media market that has softened somewhat as well.</p>
          <p>Nick, costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On input costs, you're right. We do hedge a number of key input costs some of which -- clearly there is a freely tradable market and so that does help us to mitigate future volatility, of course the bad news if you like is we know at what price we are hedged for those things in the coming year and that's why we're able to give you a fairly firm view that our year-over-year costs in fiscal '09 will be higher than the year-over-year costs were in fiscal '08 because we've locked some of them in through hedging.</p>
          <p>Having said that we cannot hedge everything and there are key parts of our business on the input cost side of the equation like glass where typically the contracts are indexed to other forms of inflation, again energy would be a typical one. So hedging, yes where it's applicable, generally not more than a year out, but there are still some parts of our business that we cannot hedge. And I think frankly of the guidance that we've given today as partly reflecting firstly some uncertainty as to where input costs will end up and then of course as we've discuss through several of the questions, our ability to offset that input cost side of the equation through price increases and we have to do more in the coming year on the price to hold gross margin flat than we did in '08. But you've heard from all the presidents I think the level of confidence that we can do that so that's kind of where we are on input costs.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning guys. Two questions if I may, the first on margins in Asia, it looks as if even adjusting for the impact of Korea, that margins in Asia are still only 15, 16%. I appreciate that obviously you're in investment phase in a number of these markets, also appreciate the hit perhaps from Australia in the new fiscal year but the question basically was about whether there's scope for that margin to materially close the gap vis-&#xE0;-vis the other divisions?</p>
          <p>And the second one regarding the 7 to 9% organic EBIT growth, obviously not a million miles away from what you have just done this year, so I wondered basically whether you are planning assumption is that economic condition are broadly unchanged in fiscal '09 or alternatively whether you are expecting a more material slowdown offset perhaps by accelerated share gains at Diageo? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all regarding the guidance and our outlook for the global economy; I don't think we are better able to call it than anybody else. One of the things that we can offer you though is a promise of agility. If we see adverse conditions in one market, we can usually scout out opportunities in another and therefore in the round, in the round of things, we have the diversity of geography, of brand, of price point, coupled with a very agile organization that will mitigate adversity by jumping on opportunities. I think as Nick outlined the guidance, a little bit of uncertainty around input costs but very much in line with what we've delivered in the last few years. And that yields double-digit EPS growth.</p>
          <p>Regarding margin in Asia, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am very optimistic about our ability to keep improving our margins in Asia. It will be affected as we start to expand beyond scotch into vodka. So there will some impacts. But if I look at the -- if you take away the effect, if you like, of some of the loss in volume around the Johnnie Walker Black Label in India this year with the closure of the duty-free channel, the underlying growth of our super deluxe business has been around 20% on Johnnie Walker Blue, on the malts business and on the Johnnie Walker Gold Reserve business.</p>
          <p>Taking India as an example, our duty paid scotch business in India grew NSV by 111% off 68% volume growth. So I think there is opportunity to continue. We are seeing the same trading up in Asia as we are seeing everywhere else and I would expect that to continue into F '09.</p>
