          <p>Well, good morning to all of you, to people in this room, to the people who are with us on the Web through the video conference. I'm here today to comment the annual results of Schneider Electric for the year 2012. I'm here obviously with Emmanuel Babeau, our CFO, with Carina, who has been our courageous IR for the past...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Four and a half years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>...four and a half years. And Carina will leave a seat to Anthony Song who is here discovering this new business. Anthony has been with Schneider for the past eight years and working in America and in the U.S. and in China. And Carina will take the lead of the strategy of Schneider Electric and be sure of one thing, she's well connected to the investors' community, okay?</p>
          <p>With that, I'm going to dive immediately into the results of this year and start with a short introduction by saying that 2012 is clearly a year of very robust solid results in a mixed environment for Schneider. It's been for us for year-on-year of consolidation and year after years of very strong growth, where we've made our point to control and improve our Solution business model with new mode of engagement with our customers, where we have integrated our acquisitions, and where we've worked hard on the cash translation of everything we do and particularly worked on the supply chain on the inventory.</p>
          <p>Once again, you will see that our growth engines, new economies, Solution business, innovation, new business, have played completely and have helped us to deliver the performance that you will now discover.</p>
          <p>So jump now very fast to slide, with you, to slide three to review the new identity card of Schneider. For the first time, &#x20AC;24 billion of sales in 2012, very global presence, very balanced actually, as you can see. 41% of sales in the new economies, actually 43% in the last quarter. Otherwise, we are going to reinforce the fact that Schneider is a tech business, more than &#x20AC;1 billion in R&amp;D in 2012. And we've benefited once again of our diversified position in terms of geography and in terms of end markets while remaining focused on the <mark type="ph" /> submission initiative (02:40), remaining focused on the <mark type="ph" /> sense (02:43) of technology.</p>
          <p>Moving on, I want to remind briefly a very critical signature of Schneider which is our engagement in social responsibility, in sustainable development by being totally focused on green business, having a responsible commitment to all the stakeholders of the society, on being innovative in measuring every quarter this engagement on reporting, this engagement in the initiatives of all the people in the company at every level.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to go straight into &#x2013; not that straight, I'm going to go straight into this year 2012 and I'm going to fly over what have we done in 2012, what were the priorities on. The first thing that we have to say that this has been a record year of earnings and cash generation as &#x2013; obviously, in very mixed market and in a complicated international environment. Sales, current sales up by 7%. Adjusted EBITA up 10%, EPS, earnings per share up 11%. For the first time, our adjusted EBITA is reaching &#x20AC;3.5 billion, 14.7% margin in the top part of the bracket we had prospected at the beginning of the year. For the first time, the adjusted net is above &#x20AC;2 billion. For the first time, our free cash flow is above &#x20AC;2 billion. So, very solid delivery in 2012 again, in a kind of complicated international environment.</p>
          <p>And if you look at all this, what you can say is we have benefited once again of our very global and balanced presence. So, clearly, we've suffered on the problem in West Europe, minus 5%. This is principally the south of Europe, and France which is suffering from the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>Asia Pac, unusually at minus 1%, while impacted by the adjustment of China after three years of extremely dynamic growth and adjustment in China which is nothing worrying, then impacted also by Japan and partly by Australia; North America, positive which is benefiting from new dynamics in a certain number of sectors, the IT sector, industry sector on the revival of the res construction.</p>
          <p>On the rest of the world, which this time has led the pack at plus 4% of growth with very strong dynamics in Russia, very strong dynamics in South America, East Asia on solid results in Africa and Middle East.</p>
          <p>We've benefited and this has been a positioning that we have researched aggressively in the past years. We've benefited off our diversification of end markets also. So, last year, a very solid performance in our partner business, our Power business or the transactional business we do with our partners where we compensate the weakness of South Europe by the dynamics particularly in new economies but also in North America where we have a good performance.</p>
          <p>Then Infrastructure which is slightly negative. I remind you that the priority of our Infrastructure is still integration of Areva, integration of Telvent, integration of Electroshield Samara from Russia, so priority given more to profitability than to growth on the big effort on this one.</p>
          <p>Industry which was down by 4%, suffering mostly of our strong presence in West Europe, but also in China last year. But you will discover afterwards that you have to put that in perspective with an improvement of profitability which is quite remarkable when you see that decrease of volume.</p>
          <p>Fantastic year in IT business and I'm saying that as Laurent Vernerey, he is Head of this business division is in the room, where not only we grow and we grow very well, but fantastic improvement of profitability, which shows the advance we have in this sector.</p>
          <p>And finally, a tough year or difficult year, negative year in Buildings due to the fact that we are principally present in mature countries and where we suffered also from the situation of the video market, particularly in the U.S. So this goes with the performance I described on record performance of results in the field of profitability and cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>So, what have we done? We've executed. This year has been a year of execution. We have told you that, after years of very strong and dynamic growth, we wanted to really execute and launch our Connect plan. And we've worked on Solutions. We've worked on our development in new economies, development in remote regions, development of adapted products.</p>
          <p>We've worked on the launch of many new products. We've worked on our supply chain with remarkable results in the field of customer satisfaction and the delivery performance which has increased a lot in the past year. We've worked a lot on our organization. I'll come back on that to make it more simple and enable new steps in efficiency in the future. And we've worked on excellence in execution, on pricing, on productivity, on containing our cost.</p>
          <p>So, if I go &#x2013; and I'll go quite fast on that one, in the detail of all these, firstly in Solution business, you know it's a point where you had challenged us in the previous year. We've executed what we were supposed to execute with Connect. So, Solution represent, at the end of 2012, 40% of our business, 39% to be precise. That makes &#x20AC;9.4 billion of sales. It has grown more than the average of the group. The gap is not as big as in the past years because, clearly, we've privileged the control of our profitability, the control of the way we deliver this business to our customers, and we've kind of slowed down our development.</p>
          <p>But we've gained one point of profitability in one year while the objective is two points in three years, so we are ahead of the plan in this year. And you know that the second part of efficiency where we want to work on this topic is the asset efficiency of our Solution and we've gained 10% in one year while the objective on three years is 20%, so half of the objective reached in one year. So, we are well in line to make of that Solution business a business which is really improved in terms of return on assets within the frame of Connect.</p>
          <p>Within those Solutions, a point of attention is the development of our services, plus 5% of growth respect to the rest of the business of the group. While I don't want to go into the detail but a lot of focus on energy management of connecting our customers to our control centers and then enabling new services on the base of this data collected, a lot of work on the huge installed base that we have out there that we are not servicing to them, our customers are needing this service, a lot of work on tracking the systems.</p>
          <p>We've got some examples here. We connect products. We aggregate the data and then we put together software which enable our customers to serve their installation and at the same time, we deliver day-to-day recurrent service on the installation of our customers, and we do that in every of the key segments that we do while we &#x2013; that's going to be, again, a big point of focus for the future and we need to keep accelerating in the development of services.</p>
          <p>Then, next one, next point of focalization is software. You know that our Solutions are controlled by more and more software. 2012 had been a year of big achievements in software, on the right side, we've launched new suite of software, integrated suite of management for buildings, StruxureWare for buildings. We've launched a very innovative suite &#x2013; integrated suite for manufacturing, which is mixing both discrete capabilities and process capabilities on putting into one package the control of process on manufacturing. On the control of energy, so that's StruxureWare for plant, it's plant structure. On &#x2013; again, the launch of an integrated suite for the management of data centers.</p>
          <p>A matter of pride for us. We've been recognized by many energy &#x2013; by many software consultants as the best suite in many sectors. People like Gartner, Verdantix or IDC which was not our traditional playground in the past. But we want to keep on building these software capabilities. We want to build new ways of delivering that software, sometimes by integration, sometimes on the cloud. This has been very successful and 2012 is a place where we've invested and started to deliver very significantly on this front.</p>
          <p>Next one has been &#x2013; is more traditional signature of Schneider, innovation. Again, 2012, we've invested more than &#x20AC;1 billion in R&amp;D. And the main topics here is connectivity where you see our Vijeo, our Acti9 new lineup of products which enable to be connected to your installation and control your installation, wireless or through a Internet connection.</p>
          <p>Then a lot of things in the field of energy efficiency, Wiser for homes, simple building control for building retrofit, mid-building retrofit, and a lot of new drives for industry because you know that 60% of energy consumption in industry is coming from motors.</p>
          <p>Big effort also in developing mid-level offers for the mid-class &#x2013; middle class of new economies and you see here a few lineups of products that we are launching in new economies. On the development of new business, you have shore connection for ports to avoid pollution in ports and also a lot of things happening on the electrical vehicle front where we have been selected by BMW as their preferential partner in the field of electrical vehicle, Renault and Ford in Europe. So we are keeping on developing our presence in this sector.</p>
          <p>Well, to tell you that during those years of crisis, we don't stop investing in new activities, and doing our job which is to be entrepreneurs in the field of &#x2013; in the vast field of energy management.</p>
          <p>Now &#x2013; so that's about the activities on business. Clearly, what remains a strong growth engine of Schneider is our presence in new economies. And 2012 was a bit of a peculiar year where the U.S. and China played counter cycle. China adjusted itself and U.S. was growing quite robustly.</p>
          <p>But if you exclude those two geographies, new economies are driving 10% more growth than major countries in our portfolio. So the investment that we keep pushing in new economies is bringing back a good differential of growth on profitability.</p>
          <p>So several points that we've spoken to you or described to you in the field of Connect, go into the secondary cities. You've got the example of the Go West in China, the Go East in Russia, it's go to secondary cities in India, in Brazil and other countries and strengthen our presence on the mid-market with adapted products and sometimes adapted brands and adapted commercial approach.</p>
          <p>Well, you've got the example here of Luminous, an acquisition we did last year which has been tremendous success in India doing inverters for the Indian homes and Indian small buildings; on Steck which is a second brand we are pushing actively in Brazil to serve the middle class needs in remote areas as a major focus.</p>
          <p>So, going to the next one, on growth, we have decided to work more on our supply chain. Supply chain is a large part of our added value and we described in Connect, what we want to do with a tailored supply chain which is tailoring our delivery model to the needs of each customer. This has already started to yield two very strong results last year, big improvement of the deliveries to our customers <mark type="audio gap" /> (16:20 &#x2013; 16:22) future and gain more on cost so that we can reinvest more money into the business.</p>
          <p>So, I don't want to enter into each and every detail, but we've created two business groups. One, which is a Partner business group which is focused on our partners, our integrators, our distributors and in charge of delivering the best basket of products, the best innovation for their needs.</p>
          <p>And another group of business led by Laurent, here again, we've focused on end users of 12 key segments, focused on delivering integrated solution <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:10) 1%; COGS productivity well in line to deliver our three years target of &#x20AC;1 billion; support function cost improved by 0.2 points; and inventory efficiency increased by 1 point or decrease, actually, or inventory level decreased by 1 point of sales.</p>
          <p>So a busy year, directed to making sure that Schneider is <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:46 &#x2013; 17:55).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>...we have reached for the first time a number above the &#x20AC;3.5 billion mark at &#x20AC;3.515 billion. It's a 10% growth. And here we have a 40 basis points improvement. The difference with the gross margin improvement is coming from our work on our SG&amp;A, what we called the support function cost during 2012.</p>
          <p>And during this year, we managed to decrease the SFC on net sales ratio by around 20 basis points. And, of course, behind that net number, you have a strong redeployment with a lot of savings happening in places where we see the business going down. So, it mean that we can adjust whether in the country or on one business line when the business is going down.</p>
          <p>We are permanently, as we already shared with you, simplifying, rationalizing, mutualizing our structure to gain in efficiency. And all the savings and they are material are being reinvested in growth initiative whether in term of new businesses and as Jean-Pascal described many of them or in term of investing, building teams, building skills in fast-growing geographies.</p>
          <p>If now I detail the various components of the evolution of our adjusted EBITA. First of all, of course, the volume impacted negatively this adjusted EBITA with an impact of minus &#x20AC;185 million. The mix has been negative, minus &#x20AC;241 million. Three drivers for that principally, the first one being the geographical mix which has played negatively with both Western Europe and China going down and they are region where we are enjoying a relatively good margin. Second element, the fact that Solution kept growing quicker than Product so even if we have higher margin this year on Solution than last year, the margin on Solution is still at a lower level than on Product.</p>
          <p>And third reason, we have had several important launches of new product in the course of 2012, one of them being Acti9. And at the beginning of a life cycle of a product, the cost does not reach the final target in term of cost of goods and therefore, it does a depreciating impact on the margin at the beginning, which is quickly corrected as we ramp up in term of volume.</p>
          <p>Regarding 2013, regarding the mix effect, we still expect a negative mix impact. Nevertheless, we don't think that the mix impact will have the same magnitude as the one that we have experienced in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to price, plus &#x20AC;226 million. It's a great achievement. If you cumulate what we have delivered in term of price increase between 2011 and 2012, we are &#x20AC;100 million above the raw material inflation cumulated over these two years. So, we are more than compensating the inflation, exactly in line with what we said and related in price increase, I would say, across the board, across the geographies and across our businesses.</p>
          <p>Looking now at 2013, I would expect price to continue to go up. We are still living in a world with inflation. Nevertheless, we are not entering 2013 with the same kind of carryover than the one we had at the beginning of 2012 and we believe that the price impact would be more limited. We think today that it could be around a positive number of &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>Productivity, plus &#x20AC;289 million. It's lower than last year but we have had some negative volume and last year we have some significant increase of volume. And we all know that volume is creating mechanically positive productivity, so still a good achievement to be almost up &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>We have continued to work on our procurement. We have continued to work on the efficiency of our manufacturing platform with very good results obtained, and certainly, the first harvesting of the fruit of the tailored supply chain initiative. Regarding 2013, we are targeting a productivity that could be between &#x20AC;300 million and &#x20AC;350 million positive.</p>
          <p>COGS inflation, a net of minus &#x20AC;11 million. You have the traditional inflation on wages and cost for production which is always between &#x20AC;80 million and &#x20AC;90 million. And in front of that in 2012, you have the positive impact of the raw material inflation, more than &#x20AC;70 million. So this is this net of &#x20AC;11 million. For 2013, we would expect, unfortunately, the raw material inflation to be back to negative numbers. And probably, based on the current price notably of copper which has been increasing a little bit, between minus &#x20AC;50 million to minus &#x20AC;100 million impact.</p>
          <p>Then the support function cost, plus &#x20AC;56 million. Again, a net amount that is hiding a lot of move downwards where we have to downsize, and upwards when we want to reinvest and we have been investing heavily. Then some other element for minus &#x20AC;54 million including, notably, some provision on inventory, some provision for warranty and many, many small things I would say. And then the impact of the acquisition, plus &#x20AC;74 million impact, and the currency impact which has been positive at plus &#x20AC;171 million playing on the currency that I mentioned to you already.</p>
          <p>Of course, one of the great achievement of Schneider for 2012 has been the margin improvement. And as you can see, we've been improving our margin in four out of our five businesses. The only business where we have been negative in term of margin evolution has been the Building business which has been impacted by both, I would say, negative trend at the level of the top line and pressure on margin, for instance, as the level of the Video business. And that really this is a combination of impact which explains the minus 2.9 points of evolution of the margin.</p>
          <p>But the four other are being positive. And, of course, the first one and which is the most impressive is the IT business where we have reached, for the first time, a record high of 19% EBITA margin plus 2.8 point. And that is really due to the excellent work which has been done on price, certainly good selectivity on the project, putting a certain limit in term of profitability that we can accept, and also some benefit coming from the price of lead which went down in the course of 2012.</p>
          <p>Industry is quite an achievement as well because with negative volume for Industry, quite significant. To increase the margin by 80 bps was very, very good work. And here again, it's productivity, it's pricing up, and it's certainly from Industry, selectivity on the project that has been taken and globally priority on margin.</p>
          <p>I'm repeating on the selectivity indicator, but certainly that was one of our objective for 2012, to really make sure that we were delivering on margin and notably margin on Solution. And we have to limit some arbitration at all level, all businesses in term of top line growth versus the margin.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure is another example of what I've just been describing, 30 basis point improvement in an environment which was not easy. And here we are harvesting the fruit of the integration of Areva distribution with legacy business of Schneider in the medium voltage.</p>
          <p>The first fruit of the Telvent integration, but much more is to come, in term of both top line synergies and cost synergies in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, Power, a modest growth, 10 bps but staying at the very high level, 20.7% of EBITA margin, very good work on price for Power and that has been able to compensate a negative mix when I talk about launch of new product that has been notably impacting Power.</p>
          <p>Now if we go down to the bottom of our P&amp;L, I would say many, many common features between the 2012 P&amp;L with 2011, when I look at other income and expenses and also during &#x2013; very much in line with last year, &#x20AC;174 million, restructuring cost of &#x20AC;164 million, so we are in this around &#x20AC;500 million spending that will be spread over three years.</p>
          <p>Then, of course, the big difference which is at the level of the intangibles, you have the normal amount of amortization of intangible which is around &#x20AC;220 million to &#x20AC;230 million, plus an exceptional impairment on the goodwill of the Building business. We had shared that with you when we discussed our Q3 numbers. We had said that the net impact will be between &#x20AC;100 million and &#x20AC;200 million, it's a &#x20AC;250 million gross impact and after tax, we have a net impact of &#x20AC;189 million. That gives an EBIT of &#x20AC;2.866 billion. Net financial expense very much in line again with last year, &#x20AC;405 million. The average level of debt for the year is above 2011 because we have the full impact of the acquisition of 2011 but we continue to slightly decrease the cost of our debt.</p>
          <p>One element here to mention for 2013, we're going to be impacted by the new IAS 19 on the return on asset for our pension fund. And that should have an impact negative on our net financial expenses between &#x20AC;30 million and &#x20AC;40 million.</p>
          <p>Income tax, here again, the income tax rate is very similar with last year. We are 23.1%. But we believe that what has been decided in France, notably, will have a negative impact on our tax rate for next year. Still difficult to exactly quantify but we believe that this negative impact could be between 2 points and 2.5 points of increase of our average tax rate for the group next year.</p>
          <p>Then equity investment which is largely the profit we are deriving from Electroshield Samara and our JV with Fuji in China. Minority interests are very much in line with last year. That give a net income &#x20AC;1.840 billion and an adjusted net income of &#x20AC;2.023 billion excluding the goodwill impairment. It's a 12% increase. And if we look at the adjusted earnings per share, we have reached &#x20AC;3.73 which is an increase of 11%.</p>
          <p>Another very good news for Schneider in 2012 has been the cash flow generation. We have reached this record high cash flow generation of &#x20AC;2.082 billion. This is of course coming from the operating cash flow, which is growing by 10% versus last year. We've been clearly keeping a control on the CapEx. We've been delivering an improvement of the trade working capital, which is really coming from the good work done on the level of inventory that Jean-Pascal mentioned.</p>
          <p>Then, looking at the dividend, we have increased the dividend paid to our shareholder. As you can see, acquisition net, very small compared to what we had at the end of June. We had &#x20AC;150 million. We have spent &#x20AC;90 million on three small acquisitions during the second half of the year, so very quiet year globally in term of acquisition.</p>
          <p>Then capital increase, that is what is subscribed by our employees plus a few stock option exercise and then on the other, you have several elements. You have the dividend that we paid to a third party when we pay a dividend when we have minority partner, the pension that we have made on our pension funds plus all the impact coming from forex, derivative on interest rates, which are on this other line. In total, we managed to decrease our debt by &#x20AC;870 million and we have a net debt at the end of 2012 of &#x20AC;4.4 billion.</p>
          <p>We are absolutely delivering on this long-term objective that we have &#x2013; to have a net transformation rate of our net profit into free cash flow generation of 100%. We have a number, retreated here, of 103% for 2012. And you can see in green that really in 2012, we have seen a big acceleration of the cash flow coming from operation, which show the quality of the profit generated and the cash associated to it.</p>
          <p>Of course, going along with that, we have seen our balance sheet strengthening. We have seen the net debt to adjusted EBITA &#x2013; EBITDA, sorry, going down from 1.4 times to 1.1 times, with a &#x20AC;4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for 2012.</p>
          <p>And we have seen the ROCE in the second part of the year, I would say as expected, starting to improve. And we are very much in the cycle of when we make acquisition, we have at the beginning, some negative impact coming from the acquisition on the ROCE. And as we integrate them, as we generate the synergies, we are back to growth on the ROCE. And in fact, if we even look toward the end of the year, we are certainly on a more positive trend at the 12.6%, which is an average for the 2012 year.</p>
          <p>All these good results translate into what we will propose to our shareholder meeting in term of dividend. We will propose an increase of 10% in our dividend, and proposing a dividend of &#x20AC;1.87, a dividend that would be fully paid in cash. And you have here the evolution of the dividend, just to realize that it is for the dividend an all-time high for the group, and also just for information, the yield that it has been representing over time, and you see that Schneider has been keeping a very good yield over the last six to seven years.</p>
          <p>And now, Jean-Pascal, I hand over to you for the outlook.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When looking at 2013, while we consider we're going to be keeping on facing challenges in Western Europe and especially Southern Western Europe, we see opportunities in the new economies with, as Emmanuel was saying, as I was saying, we've kept investing in new economies, and therefore, we keep seeing opportunities there. Particularly, when we speak about new economies, we estimate that probably China will have a slow start but we should see some revival of the activities around the second part of the year. And we see a continued recovery in North America, or let's assume anyway or let's recognize it's not exactly &#x2013; we don't have a huge visibility because this environment is what it is.</p>
          <p>But we target for 2013 a low single-digit organic growth in sales on a stable to slightly up adjusted EBITA margin. With that, and again, I would repeat that probably this progress should be more back loaded to the end of the year rather than at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>With that, I think we finished our presentation and we are ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>All right. As this will be my last time to be on stage with you, so you know me, so just let me kindly remind you to give everybody a chance to ask a question. So, limit your question as much as possible. Thank you. So, Ga&#xEB;l, first one.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Ga&#xEB;l De Bray from SocGen. The first question actually relates to what's going to be the focus in 2013? Because last year, I mean it was pretty clear that the focus was on profitability rather than growth. So, what do you expect it to be this year?</p>
          <p>The second question is on your software and services activities. They seem to be an important axis of your strategy. So, could you elaborate a bit more on these two segments, specifically how much of your business that is today? What's the margin profile of the two segments? What's the growth potential?</p>
          <p>And maybe if you could say more specifically how much of your installed base is being appropriately serviced in your view and what could be a potential target in a few years' time on this &#x2013; in this respect?</p>
          <p>And for software, the question would be more on your &#x2013; the way you see the business. Are you happy with your positioning now in this area with Summit, with Telvent or is it going to be an increasingly important part of your M&amp;A strategy going forward, maybe like ABB and Siemens are targeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, first, on the focus of 2013, we don't change focus. The focus can be summarized in the execution of Connect. We presented to you like one year ago the content of our three years plan, Connect, with very clear priorities. And we've just done one year of that journey. And we want to keep executing on those lines.</p>
          <p>So, we've made sure in 2012 that we had a very strong control of our operations, a very firm control of our operations. We've revisited the way we are organized so that we make our organization more scalable for the future. We have more capabilities through this organization to be more efficient and reinvest part of that efficiency into growth.</p>
          <p>What we are learning in the world of today that we have to be all the time more selective in our growth investment initiatives. So this is clearly where we balance our effort today, now that we have &#x2013; now, we always had but we, really in 2012, have consolidated a lot of our basics, and now we are in a very good position to drill faster or to go faster in some identified growth positions.</p>
          <p>Now, speaking about services and software, yes, we've been very vocal about that. These are huge opportunities for Schneider. I would start by services, the traditional culture of this company was not to follow up on systems and products when they were sold. Okay, one of our signatures is legendary reliability, and therefore, you buy Schneider, you have no problem, right? But the reality is that it's very reliable, but at the same time, our customers need to adjust, need to maintain, need to upgrade, and need to come back on their installations to benefit from the whole potential of those installations. Then all of our customers are facing, for most of them, a crisis, a need to be more efficient. So they ask us to take more their value chain because we gather more specialties than they do, and we can bring more added value on their energy management than they do.</p>
          <p>For us, it's just the beginning of the journey. How much of our installed base do we cover? Quite large in some very few sectors like the IT business, and very minimal in the rest of the business. So we've got a lot of potential here. And we're going to be working on that and keeping you informed of the development of that. Which proportion of the business are &#x2013; I don't know if we're public on that one, but it's roughly &#x2013; can share that with you, it's around 10% of our business would be below...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...on services. Software, we do software everywhere now. Even what we do on the Partner business is very largely supported by software. But again, while the core of what we do, we have one unit which is only software which is Telvent, which we call Smart Infrastructure. But when you go into the data center space, it's orchestrated by software, automated by software. When you go in the industry space, we always sell software that automates our products.</p>
          <p>Yes, it's a point of development. Yes, it's a point of focus. We've created well in advance of many of our peers an integrated architecture, which we know, which is called EcoStructure, powered by StruxureWare. And a large part of what we do in software will be developed organically. Because it's highly-linked &#x2013; it's not software for software, it's software which is intimately plugged into our hardware.</p>
          <p>And then, when needed, we are going to go for purchasing some pockets of software, supplementary software or pockets of know-how, like in supply management with Summit.</p>
          <p>But more and more, when we speak about managing the efficiency of our customers or helping them manage their efficiency, it's a blend of the efficiency of their process and even building as a process, the efficiency of their energy and the efficiency of their security. So, all of this is packed together into one integrated software-powered &#x2013; one integrated system powered by a software.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Olivier Esnou, Exane BNP. So, two questions, please. I'd like to talk a little bit first about the Building business, which has attracted my attention. Where do you think is the trough for the performance for that business? Can you qualify a little bit the issue? You think it's lack of scale, issue in the portfolio, management issues, what needs to be corrected? And why is it more difficult in this business to adjust the cost base, because we've seen in other division, despite decline in growth, the gross margin has gone up, so why makes it different here?</p>
          <p>And second topic would be on the project launch, if you can maybe give us some indication of market share development or contribution to growth? How successful it has been and how successful do you expect it to be in 2013 in terms of contribution? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the Building business, it's a paradox of Schneider, because when you look at the way we list our business, it seems a small business, but the reality is that Building is roughly 40% of our business because we sell what we classify as building, is a building control part of the business. But at the same time, this building control is plugged into everything we do in the Partner business, Power business into the Building, which is 40% of our business &#x2013; well, I don't have &#x2013; it's roughly &#x20AC;9 billion.</p>
          <p>So, it's the biggest business of Schneider with what we declare as Building being the smallest of the business of Schneider. So, you always have to bear that in mind and we have &#x2013; we candidly report this subset of Building business because we want you to have a visibility on the development. But always bear in mind that our Building business is plugged into our Partner business. That Partner business is a very strong business in the world and very profitable business in the world. You've seen it in the figures still increasing its profitability last year. Once we have said that, are we at the trough of the &#x2013; what are the issues of that business? The issue of that business is that unlike the other business, it has not been deployed globally.</p>
          <p>And we started this business from the major countries, and especially, for instance, the U.S., okay. And the U.S. has not been the best market for Buildings in the past years as well as some other countries where this business had its roots on historical strength.</p>
          <p>Are we at the trough of this business? Well, I would start by answering. Is it a problem of scale? Yes, it's a kind of problem of scale. But we have the technology. We have the presence. It's just that we have not deployed that technology everywhere. And to deploy it, we're investing. We're investing. For instance, in France, we are not in building control five years ago, now we start to have a sizeable share of the market. But it takes money, it takes experience, it takes convincing. So, these are commercial &#x2013; of course, we are doing our job of development.</p>
          <p>Portfolio, I think we are pretty much all right. Now, we did a huge job in the past years to converge our platforms. We narrated through acquisitions of several platforms. They've been unified around StruxureWare for Building. And this has been launched, as I was explaining, in 2012. But there again, we have to convince the architects or the designers and make sure that this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:21) on the market.</p>
          <p>So it's going to be a place of investment for the next &#x2013; for us, it makes no doubt that this business has a lot sense at Schneider because it plugs into our Partner business, it creates value in this Partner business. The intelligence we have in our electrical systems is reported into our building control systems and software, but it's going to be investment. It's going to be a lot of work to develop it and it's one of the worksites we have at Schneider.</p>
          <p>I should mention also that we've been hit on some video issues, especially in the U.S., where we had Pelco which was U.S.-centric. And this market has been complicated since we acquired the company. But it makes no doubt that it has a lot of sense and when I look at the performance we reach in this business after some years of development, it's very satisfactory.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, new products. Well, our new products, it's complicated to isolate it from the rest. I would say one of the good barometer of meters of the success of a new product is the rate of substitution, or the speed of substitution. I will take one example, Acti9, which is our new miniature circuit breaker which is really one of the foundational lines of <mark type="ph" /> for us (46:43), that many of you have in your apartments or in your buildings, as such &#x2013; but you don't know it because it's never, never has a failure. Well, this has been substituted to the &#x2013; 80% has substituted the previous series in less than one year. So it's been a fantastic substitution and we are launching more of those products, I would say, every month.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ludovic Debailleux, Natixis. First question is related to the use of the cash, looking at the low net debt over EBITDA ratio. How do you see the M&amp;A opportunities in this year and could you share buyback in 2013? What would be for you the target of net debt over EBITDA? That was question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two is related to your guidance. You expect an acceleration of growth in new economy excluding China that you already discussed. So where do you see the biggest opportunity and the biggest growth potential and what will be the negative mix effect of that? And maybe a last housekeeping question, what would be the negative number of the effect in Q1? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on cash utilization &#x2013; all right. Okay. So, there's always too much or not enough. First we have a dividend to pay, okay? And as you saw, we keep our words of distributing 50% of the net. We actually correct or adjust the dividend of the unusual event &#x2013; so non-recurrent event, so that's the first thing. Then we have some bonds coming to maturity in 2013 that we're going to have to refund. Then we are open to everything. At the same time, we said eight months ago, we would reopen the possibility of M&amp;A on acquisitions with the preference of bolt-ons.</p>
          <p>Same is still valid. You saw that we didn't move in the past eight months. We worked on it, but we didn't find the right opportunities at the right price &#x2013; right opportunities, yes; right price, no. Therefore, we are going to keep a selective watch, scrutiny screening on the market for acquisitions, but with a preference of bolt-ons.</p>
          <p>Okay, now on the guidance, well, again it's &#x2013; we can't comment on the market but we can say that today the market doesn't &#x2013; there is not much visibility. What we see &#x2013; if you take the big geographies, in the U.S., we see a revival of the residential. Our experience is that normally nine months, 12 months after comes the revival of the non-res, it's not as visible today. We've seen somewhere the IT business slowing down projects at the end of 2012, due also to our own selectiveness on projects, we acknowledge it. But we've seen, anyway, a slowdown in the major projects.</p>
          <p>So, we are a bit more cautious on that business for 2013. In Infrastructure, we believe there could be some good opportunities as well as in oil and gas in 2013, in the U.S. We've seen, by the way, our backlog increasing in this geography at the end of 2012. On Industry, we've seen a rebound of the market in 2012, but it could be more moderate in 2013, will it be only by the effect of the basis of comparison.</p>
          <p>If you go to the other large geography which is China, well, China has been single-digit negative for us in 2012, but very stabilized. There has been no deepening of the situation, on the contrary, a stabilization of our position from, I would say, Q2 actually. What &#x2013; you have to integrate is a perspective, it has been a year of fantastic growth in the previous three years. So I was really expecting this adjustment to take place.</p>
          <p>When we look at China, you still have to wait for the new government to really be in place, though first measures are taking place today. But I feel that the optimism is at a much higher level than it was one year ago in the business environment. We know that in our business we have to wait a few months before it ripples into a rebound.</p>
          <p>We expect to have investment in Infrastructure and we are cautious because some of it is open to players like us, some of it will not be open to foreign players. But we do, for instance, well in water, we do well in urban infrastructure. And we should benefit from that especially as we go into secondary cities, not immediately, more back loaded at the <mark type="audio gap" /> (52:11) in the field of Industry and particularly the machine manufacturers, of which we are a good partner.</p>
          <p>We see a good level in the market of data centers that we are serving. We estimate that the year will be stable or moderately up in everything which is residential and non-res construction. But again, take my words with caution because, I believe, that everybody is expecting March, mid-March, so that the new government is in place and the new policies are being confirmed.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the period, I said it, Europe is relatively better in terms of stability. But we expect the south of Europe to be still very weak, while the north of Europe has been stable and muddling through currently. And we expect some reacceleration, probably sustained by China in the rest of the new economies &#x2013; the other new economies especially the ones supported by resources, mining and oil and gas. I don't know if I answered your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question on the Q1 impact of the business days, not able to answer with detail. January was positive in term of business days. Feb is negative. I think, globally for the quarter, it's slightly negative but I can confirm that to you. Nevertheless, I'm coming back on the comment that Jean-Pascal has made on the profile of the year. We certainly expect the second part of the year in term of organic growth to be better than the first part of the year. So, to reach this low single-digit organic growth, we think that the second part will contribute more than the first part and we will not be surprised if the organic growth was around stability or even a bit negative on the first part of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, next question, I think, is from Alfred.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I'm Alfred Glaser from Cheuvreux. Two questions, one, on the working capital management. You had a very, very good performance in the second half of 2012 in improving working capital, what could we expect for the full-year 2013 on that basis?</p>
          <p>And the second question relating to the Infrastructure business and the demand outlook. Overall, you had a decent performance in 2012, but the business remains still difficult. Could you comment a bit on the outlook regarding demand here and in medium voltage in particular and pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll take the one on the working cap. Certainly as we are targeting to be back on growth <mark type="audio gap" /> (55:11 &#x2013; 55:13) the impact on the working capital because everything being equal, that should translate into an increase of the working capital. But the ambition that we have on the supply chain, the work that we are doing on inventory, give me some hope that we could be able to compensate part of the mechanical negative evolution of the working cap by further reduction in term of inventories. I cannot be more precise than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Infrastructure, it's been a place of big integration in the past two years, so we worked a lot on the combination of teams, rationalization of products, building the bridges between the teams and we've done big strides, but there is still some work to be done here.</p>
          <p>About the health of this market, well, of course we see quite a significant investment going on in the new economies. This is a traditional place of development for that business. And when we speak about Infrastructure, you have to realize that there are several components into it. There is everything about the cities. There is the utilities grid, and the distribution grid, I mean.</p>
          <p>And there is oil and gas, and not all of these have the same dynamics. But globally, what we see that probably the investment could be moderate in Europe because there is some other capacity at points in some of the utilities, I'm speaking about the utilities. At the same time, we have nice opportunities in Europe, shaping up around the Smart City, around making the cities more efficient. We see some investment coming up in the U.S. around the three themes; oil and gas, grid, and globally, infrastructure. And in the new economies, well, it's a need that we have to serve everywhere. So, again, we &#x2013; our priority was to make sure we would integrate correctly our companies inside infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Second priority was to make sure that we would get rid of the non-profit-making business, some of which we narrated that we would focus on the more profit-making business. We've been impacted in 2012 by some elements, for instance, Spain, which in our infrastructure, will it be from the Schneider point of view or the Telvent point of view, has been suffering a lot. We've been impacted also by some pricing issues on transformers and some primary medium voltage in Asia, but it seems to be easing a little bit from the transformer point of view at the end of the year. Now, what we want to do is to be more aggressive on the mix on the growth side of equations now that the teams have been put together and are operating correctly together.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>All right. I guess, we have no more questions from the room, unless I'm mistaken. And we will start taking questions from &#x2013; by telephone. Okay. So, the first question by telephone, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Andreas Willi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. The first question I have is on &#x2013; the first question is around some accounting matters. In terms of provisions in your account, you show an overall decline in provisions in some kind of &#x20AC;177 million reversal of surplus provisions, maybe you could give us some more guidance around that. What was it &#x2013; did it affect EBIT or does it relate to taxes or other issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On provision movement. No, on the other issue that you have read, well, it's true that we have discovered an accounting issue at the end of 2011 which was having a negative impact on our net profit of &#x20AC;27 million last year, which was more or less 1.4% of our net profit last year. And that is due to fraud in France, where an employee has been, in fact, manipulating document and creating some fake documents to &#x2013; which resulted into an overstatement of &#x2013; or an understatement of the provision at the end of the year for the rebates that we give to our customers.</p>
          <p>So, there is a lot of rebate given at the end of the year for our big customer which is based on the volume that they have sold. And that is based on numbers that we have on their level of inventory. And that has been, I would say, played by this person to underestimate the level of provisions. So you have the correction on 2011 made this year.</p>
          <p>What it shows is that despite all the processes of internal control which are extremely heavy, all what we have in place to make sure that this kind of thing does not happen. Well, sometime, when we have someone in the organization, which is in charge of something important and which is not trustworthy, we have an issue. And that has meant, of course, a lot of work at the group level to make sure that we are reinforcing everywhere the control, that we were doubling the level of security. And globally put in place all the necessary action for that not to happen again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has been a wakeup call, and we have put into place a series of measures to avoid that would repeat again. On the Solution, yes, we've done a lot of improvement in 2012. There is still more to come and it comes a lot by organizing ourselves better, developing the experience of the team in front of the customers. What you see here is just not being more picky on projects. It's really being more efficient in delivering better to our customers, in raising their satisfaction. We ambition to keep delivery on that side.</p>
          <p>Do we want to &#x2013; if I understood well your question, do we want to up our targets on that side? I don't see &#x2013; what we would do is to increase our growth ambition. Once we have reached a level of profitability, we would push on the volume side of the equation because it's a good business, it's a good return on assets, and it's a very good way to develop more intimacy with our customers. But we still have a way to go to reach our ambition on return on assets, both on margin and on the efficiency of the assets.</p>
          <p>And this is one of the reasons why I put together &#x2013; I appointed a leader, Laurent, in charge of animating, in charge of driving, in charge of leading those end user &#x2013; this end user group.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Daniela Costa from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Actually, just two things, relatively quick. The first on the margin improvement in IT to the 19%, do you see that as sort of a new floor or do you see it as just a consequence of operating leverage on the back of the better than average volumes in IT?</p>
          <p>And then the second one, just regarding your objectives on productivity and support function cost, if we see a significant sales pickup towards the, either the end of 2013 or in 2014, would you have to relook at them or they are basically independent of volume assumptions at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. On the IT, I am not sure I picked &#x2013; well, I guess your question is, are we still improving the margin in IT in the future? I would say, we've &#x2013; we are already overperforming the competition by a lot. And Emmanuel spoke about many things like what we've done. But I would say the first basic thing we did was the capacity to assemble a full solution especially for the space of the data center.</p>
          <p>And integrating this system with all what we do in power, everything in low voltage, medium voltage, security around that, completing a full system for the data center application, and also with the acquisition of Lee Tech, for instance, and what we had already at Schneider, the capacity to live the data center all around or all along the lifecycle from the design to the lifecycle maintenance of the data center. So, this complete value proposition is unmatched by our competition.</p>
          <p>Now, last year we've been also picky on what we'd take and what we wouldn't take. What I'm saying here is that probably what you see here is the top of what we should be producing in terms of margin. And we should be more balancing in the direction of growth, but very profitable growth in the future.</p>
          <p>Coming back to that is the objective of productivity on support function cost, if we have a pickup of sales on more growth, well, that normally generates more productivity in absolute value because the volumes are higher. In terms of support function cost, it helps on the leverage, so it would probably change the absolute values, but it wouldn't change the per split. We would adapt anyway, that would be just good news. I mean what we have &#x2013; what we want to achieve &#x2013; we want to achieve the objective that we have described in this context of mixed environment, and low visibility, but if the market picks up, it should help on both sides.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Martin Wilkie of Deutsche Bank. Two questions, firstly on the M&amp;A outlook. You mentioned that there are &#x2013; you haven't found the right opportunities at the right price. You mentioned also bolt-ons. I mean, do you have an amount in mind that you're looking to spend over the course of the next 12 months, just to give us an idea as to how much do you think acquisitions could add over the next one to two years?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was just coming back to your outlook on China. Are there any parts of the market already picking that give you confidence in that second half recovery or is it just very broad-based across the whole country? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer for the M&amp;A-allocated account for the next month is no. We don't have a defined amount. We don't work like this. We go by strategic choices and then financing the acquisition of those strategic choices, so there is no objective.</p>
          <p>On China, I already spoke to that subject. While we see green shoots today in the Industry side particularly with the machine manufacturers, we stay cautiously optimistic about data centers where we have had a good level of activity and it seems to be keeping on developing. We expect investment in Infrastructure especially in the west, in the north, in the south, means in the secondary cities where we have developed intensely our network in the past year.</p>
          <p>And we remain &#x2013; we've seen the market, we remain stable, stable plus in residential and construction provided you go into the new cities, into the new places of urbanization. This being said, well, we don't expect a lot at the beginning of the year because between the time optimism is coming back and the time it comes into real business at Schneider, it takes some months. It needs to be constructed, electrified and then they take our systems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Martin Prozesky from Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's Martin from Bernstein. Two questions, please. On the China development, can you give us a bit more color on how the various business development, especially industry versus low voltage, if you can give us a sense on that, please? And then secondly in terms of the bridge, I think there was some cautionary comments on what's going to happen on raw materials. Can you give us a bit more color on where you expect pricing strength to come from? Over the last two half years we've seen positive pricing but weakening relative to the previous half years. So, which areas do you expect positive pricing to support the business over the next half year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On China, it seems I just did it. So, I don't know what you expect more on it. Just low voltage &#x2013; integrated low voltage is going into all the end segments. So, what we do in low voltage is a mix of what we sell in Infrastructure, in Industry, in data centers, in non-res construction, non-residential. So it's a product, byproduct of the dynamics of all of those segments. And I went into what I consider as detailed as I can go through a description of what we see in 2013 for China.</p>
          <p>As we are saying, in Industry we start to see some green shoots and certainly a better level of activity than we had last year in China. For the bridge, well <mark type="audio gap" /> (01:09:44 &#x2013; 01:09:55) less favorable and we would have the traditional lag between our pricing and our <mark type="ph" /> RMA (1:10:20). So, you see that in all of this, you've got always factors of compensation. So, it's &#x2013; and you have to integrate things that you know pretty well because we've explained over the past years, which have been good years of volatility and changes and ruptures what is happening when growth is picking up or when slowdown is happening, you know what are the mechanism of compensation happening at Schneider.</p>
          <p>The good news is we are pretty stable in delivering cash and delivering profitability increases.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, well, we will take one last question, okay, and then we'll end today's session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The last question is from James Moore from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the questions. I wondered if you could help with what the video impact was on EBITDA in the Building division in 2012 and how you expect that to develop in 2013. I'm just trying to size its impact there.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I wondered if you could give us the split of the support function cost, the &#x20AC;56 million in the year, and give us the split of what was saving versus what was salary inflation. I think you said salary inflation was &#x20AC;80 million, &#x20AC;90 million in the first half, and an update for the full year on that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I wondered if you could say what your ambition is for the CST business, which I think you are looking to exit, but decided not to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the video impact, no, we're not going to detail what is the video impact. It is clear that it has been negative and we have been both seeing some pressure at the level of the top line and at the level of the margin. So that is one of the driver for the difficulty that we have experienced in the Building business, but we won't be specific on giving a number on the precise impact of video.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to dissipate any kind of ambiguity, when Emmanuel is saying negative, that means dilutive. It's a profit-making business, but it has been diluting the growth on the profit level of the division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. Now, on the SFC, probably the inflation is &#x2013; if we take a number for the whole world, it's probably a bit below 3%. So let's say that it has been around &#x20AC;150 million probably for the full year, so we have had to compensate that, of course. And again, behind the net number, there is a lot going on in term of savings, in term of adjustments, in term of rationalizing and significant investments in growing business and geographies.</p>
          <p>And on the CST business, as you know, we never comment on potential disposal. We have, of course, like you've seen a lot of rumors in the press, but we never comment this kind of rumors. The only thing we can do and say is that we are permanently reviewing our portfolio. We can get to the conclusion that something is less core, less central, less important to our strategy, and come to the conclusion that it's better to sell it, but we will only do it if we can get a price which is giving the right and full value for the asset, otherwise, we are not for sales and therefore we won't sell. And that's a comment that would apply generally for all the business that we could define at a certain point in time as less core, or less strategic.</p>

          <p>So, Jean-Pascal, Emmanuel, I think &#x2013; I've been told by the team there's one last question, so I don't want anyone to be frustrated. So, we take this last question but this will be really the last question. Okay. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi there. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the Solution and Products. It appears that the Solutions grew slower in Q4 than the Products did. Now, how much of that is down to external factors such as where we are in the cycle and how much of that is down to selectivity and where do you see that going in 2013 in terms of the difference in growth rates?</p>
          <p>And just on the margin guidance, I just want to understand the flat, stable to slightly up guidance in terms if you've got some tailwinds or if you've got some operating leverage in the growth? I mean, you've also got the selectivity on the Solutions, so that's headwind. So, which tailwinds should I be thinking about that might lead to flat margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the Solution it's, according to the market, a blend of the two, but I would say the prevalent factor has been our own selectivity on Solutions. Not only because of profitability but after years of strong development of Solutions, we wanted to make sure that we pay a lot of attention to the quality of what we deliver on the building of a very strong foundation. So you can't do everything at the same time. And we decided to slow down a bit so that we would deliver and &#x2013; we would create the right foundation to be ready for the next development. So that's the first thing.</p>
          <p>On the guidance, I think we've been though the whole elements. And what we describe here is a mix of geographies, of business, of delivery models, of introduction of new products, of development of existing products. And the best we can tell you is that guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, Jean-Pascal, this is the end.</p>

Well, I would like to thank you and I think there are many people in this room who could thank you and congratulate you for what you've done with us in the field of Investors Relationship and we wish you good luck again with Strategy which is very, very well connected to our investors. And welcome to Anthony and thank you to you all for your time, your attention, your support, and looking forward to more dialogue during our road shows. Thank you and speak to you soon.</p>
