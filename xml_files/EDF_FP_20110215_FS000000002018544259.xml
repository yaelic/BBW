        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being with us and of course, I'm very pleased to welcome you today to present the EDF Group's Results for 2010 a year that was particularly complex and we'll come back to that throughout this session.</p>
          <p>We faced many challenges both in industrial terms and financial term. And my recap of the year's key point will show that. First challenge goes without saying, I told you back when I arrived at EDF, we aimed to get back on track to optimum operational performance without which we could not hope to serve our customers or improve our figures.</p>
          <p>Operational performance is the true challenge for any industrial company and we have been able to reach it. I think challenge no less important was to deleverage ourselves, so that we could regain the necessary margins from a new without to jeopardizing each operational capabilities.</p>
          <p>Tackled every problem head on, we've readjusted our assets value and you will see that later on in our accounts. We've set aside provisions for contingencies and risks and we've made necessary changes in scope. All of these resulted in profound changes within the Group and its scope with around &#x20AC;3 billion in non-recurring items, extraordinary cost, as you have seen, but it was necessary to readjust the value of assets particularly in the U.S. and that was done already on the June 30 in the U.S. and we've made a similar revision in December 31 for Italy.</p>
          <p>To-date, our Group has improved its risk profile, de-risk as we say, and we will see details of that later on. These exceptional figures, of course, this was the price to pay for visibility, but it goes also hand in hand with growth potential and a much stronger industrial and specialty.</p>
          <p>Let's get down to the height of the matter. I have just set the stage for the 2010 results. The first highlight of the fiscal year was, as you see on this slide, the improved operational performance, particularly in France where electricity output has increased by 22 terawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Our level of hydropower output was noteworthy as well as the sharp increase in nuclear output, 18 terawatt hour more than in 2009. This trend was further confirmed in January 2011. As you are aware, the monthly nuclear output level has hit a new all-time high in EDF's history, i.e., 43.9 terawatt hours of output in January.</p>
          <p>In addition, all technical indicators on plant outage for nuclear and fossil fired are set or the hydropower response rate, all of these indicators show that all methods of generation are making remarkable progress.</p>
          <p>This improved performance was not limited to France. In the U.K., as we have stated last December at our conference on U.K. activities, we should read over the next coming weeks 90% output on one of the AGIs for the very first time since 2006.</p>
          <p>Back in France, it's important to know that this improved output was paired with a slight and limited increase in operating expenses around 1.5% in line with inflation. Increased output, cost control, good performance of our grids in France have also helped to contribute to arrive at 5.2% in EBITDA, all of which was made possible thanks to the seamless command of our teams. And also because we kept up our operational investments increasing them by 10% in France, primarily in generation and grid activities. These investments amount to nearly &#x20AC;8 billion.</p>
          <p>Conversely, as I mentioned earlier, we will face during fiscal year 2010, first of all, with the difficult climates in the main international energy markets as well as face within uncertain outlook for growth on the same markets. Major cause being as you know the collapse in gas prices due to non-conventional gases in the U.S., which had major impact on all energy markets internationally. And indirectly, we have also felt the impact even though, we're a small gas player, our energy prices have been impacted.</p>
          <p>These facts call us to be prudent and to face the reality of figures. It is a constraint for discipline in presenting our accounts and this is why we also made provisions and announcement, of course that is a difficult one, but that helps us protect us against risk.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items totaled &#x20AC;2.9 billion after tax with &#x20AC;1 billion in the U.S., an amount that was not readjusted, in fact of lower energy prices in the U.S. in the second half year; it is linked to negotiations that enabled us to switch ourselves from risks that are inherent to the put option that we had as well as to any economic changes, so no change in the provision in the U.S. for fiscal year.</p>
          <p>We also devoted &#x20AC;900 million in Italy in provisions and other non-recurring items approximately &#x20AC;300 million for the TaRTAM provision and &#x20AC;400 million, which are pure accounting mechanism. As you know, accounting rules mean that currency fluctuation deficits, which had been incorporated directly into the balance sheet in line with accounting regulations in previous fiscal year, linked to the British networks, all of that has to go back on the income statement. But it really has no impact on the real figures. It only impacts the income statement and that is &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>So out of the &#x20AC;2.9 billion for non-recurring provisions, only &#x20AC;400 million are simply an accounting mechanism to adjust for the accounting standards that force us to put that back into the income statement, meaning that the impact is absolutely neutral on the figures for the fiscal year since we already have that included previously in the EBITDA.</p>
          <p>And I repeat, all of these non-recurring items have no impact on the Group cash flow or its potential for growth. More so than ever, we now enjoy a strong potential for growth. As you know, we have sold assets with a significant positive impact reflected in the Group's consolidation scope.</p>
          <p>I'll remind you that back in October EDF sold its distribution networks in the U.K. for a total amount of &#x20AC;6.7 billion. And in December, we announced the sale of our stake in EnBW for an amount of &#x20AC;7.3 billion proportional approximately &#x20AC;4.7 billion for stocks, the rest being debt. The transaction was closed last December and it will become effective by the end of this month.</p>
          <p>In addition, following a change in covenants of RTE at the end of the fiscal year, RTE's results are now consolidated by the equity method in the Group's financial account. We will preserve our proportion of the equity in the results. These three changes have a total impact of &#x20AC;20 billion on the Group's debt. As you can see, 2010 was a year for reconfiguration of the Group, which now has stronger potential for growth and an improved risk profile, and with a significant improvement.</p>
          <p>On the slide three, you can see the same thing that I have &#x2013; the main figures that I've told you. Group sales totaled &#x20AC;65.2 billion with a growth of 10.2%. On the like-for-like basis, the organic growth was 4.6%. This reflects the improved operating performance. And the EBITDA stood at &#x20AC;16.6 billion with a slightly higher organic growth of 5.2%, excluding the TaRTAM extension.</p>
          <p>Net income, net attributable income amounted to &#x20AC;1,020 million. This figure includes the &#x20AC;2.9 billion in non-recurring tax items. Excluding these non-recurring items and the impact of IAS 39 on hedge accountings, net income from ordinary operations was 3.961 million (sic) [&#x20AC;3,961 million], up 11.3%, illustrating the Group's underlying performance in 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, at the end of fiscal year 2010, net debt was &#x20AC;34.4 billion versus &#x20AC;42.5 billion one year earlier. The debt-EBTIDA ratio was therefore reduced sharply to 2.2 versus 2.5 one year earlier. It should be noted that this ratio does not account for the sale of EnBW since it will be effective only at the end of this month. And following the cash in and the final closing, which will soon be effective, that debt-EBITDA ratio will go down to 1.9.</p>
          <p>These results are therefore in line with our financial objectives we had set for the 2010. In terms of EBITDA, we have exceeded our objectives, which showed a 5.2% increase in organic growth, excluding TaRTAM effect compared with a target of 3% to 5%. Our pro forma debt-EBITDA ratio post EnBW sale is 1.9 as compared with our target ranging between 2.5 and 3. Upon proposal of the Board of Directors meeting yesterday, a dividend of &#x20AC;1.15 will be submitted to the General Shareholders Meeting in May.</p>
          <p>I'll now give the floor to Thomas Piquemal, who will give you a more detailed picture of the financial statements for 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Thomas Piquemal. I'll now present and explain the 2010 results for EDF Group. I will start with accounting methods to confirm that as of &#x2013; we've used the same standards for December as we had in June 30, including the IFRIC 18 as well as IAS 39 that was readjusted in terms of net operating income to reflect the true operational performance. These are the volatility effects that are quite significant shown here on this slide we felt needed to be readjusted.</p>
          <p>While the accounting standards are the same, the scope has been different. We've completed three major transactions in the second half. First of all, the disposal of the British networks, which are now integrated in our accounts in all lines over 10 months since the final closing was in October with the contribution to debt reduction of &#x20AC;6.7 billion at year-end 2010.</p>
          <p>Disposal of our stake in EnBW, we have not cashed in yet the proceeds from the sale; should come in the last week. So the December balance sheet does not reflect that effect. But in line with standard IFRS 5, we presented the contribution of EnBW on all the lines of our cash flow statement and the statement which &#x2013; on a separate line, called assets available for sales.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we are now consolidating RTE in the equity methods as of December 31, so all EBITDA is now integrated in the Group's cash flow into our 2010 accounts. A bit complex because every one of this transaction had to be dealt with in a different account to it. At the end of my presentation, I'll give you the Group's key figures in the new scope.</p>
          <p>Sales were &#x20AC;65,165 million, over 10% growth including organic growth, spread in France over &#x20AC;2 billion and international market approximately &#x20AC;600 million, reflecting a contrasting figure with a low sales figure in the UK, but a rise at EDF Energy Nouvelles in Central Europe and in Benelux. Scope effects are significant, &#x20AC;2.6 billion on the sales in spite of the disposal of the British networks. We consolidated the 12 months of SPE and CENG in the U.S.</p>
          <p>EBITDA includes a &#x20AC;380 million linked to the TaRTAM extension. That affects the second half year of 2010 as well as the provision made in the first half year 2011. That mechanism, TaRTAM mechanism, will stop on June 30th.</p>
          <p>&#x20AC;17 billion is the EBITDA, with significant organic growth of &#x20AC;833 million, plus 5.2% versus 2009. In spite of a significant lower performance of our Trading activities minus &#x20AC;279 million EBITDA, organic growth that was obtained thanks to the high performance in France and stability of our other businesses.</p>
          <p>Group's EBITDA, as I said, is up 5.2%, like-for-like basis excluding TaRTAM. However, EBIT is down, &#x20AC;6.2 billion, versus &#x20AC;9.3 billion a years ago. Since most non-recurring expenses are accounted above that, readjusted for these non-recurring items on the like-for-like basis, we have the same growth of 5% in terms of EBIT.</p>
          <p>Net income is &#x20AC;1 billion including &#x20AC;.9 billion of non-recurring expenses of purely accounting charges. After readjustment, the net current income is &#x20AC;3 billion &#x2013; is plus 11.3%, &#x20AC;3,961 million adjusting to the Group's performance operational.</p>
          <p>These non-recurring items, &#x20AC;2.9 billion represent &#x20AC;1 billion in the U.S., &#x20AC;915 million in Italy and other asset impairments of <mark type="inaudible" /> coal-fired plants in the UK, which were subject to a sharp decrease in the spread as well as the extension TaRTAM expense amounting for approximately &#x20AC;250 million. These are after tax that won't come back to non-recurring items excluding translation differences, classification as income regarding the IAS 39.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items, let's take a closer look. First of all, in the U.S., prices fell again in half year two, affecting CENG and &#x2013; which is our stake in Constellation. In spite of this ongoing degradation, the provision remained unchanged against June 30, thanks to an agreement with Constellation that enabled to cancel the &#x20AC;2 billion put option for a cost of &#x20AC;123 million in stocks. The provision is unchanged, which was simply reallocated in the existing nuclear business, i.e., CENG.</p>
          <p>In Italy, market is characterized by a markedly lower margin, over capacity in the field of the electricity mix and so all of our assets whether Fenice, industrial outsourcing primarily for Fiat, TDE, which is the holding company through which we organize joint control of Edison with A2A partners. And then Edison, we believe &#x2013; we consider that we should provision for &#x20AC;915 million for risk that includes impairment for the Fenice assets.</p>
          <p>&#x20AC;16.6 billion, the Group's EBITDA, up 4.4%. Free cash flow is negative &#x20AC;300 million versus a positive cash flow of &#x20AC;242 million in the previous year. So this free cash flow is negative in spite of the cashing of the proceeds of Exeltium, i.e., &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the first half.</p>
          <p>Reason for this negative cash flow is to be found first of all in the CSPE, the increase of the CSPE that is the French utility tax, which is significant accounting for &#x20AC;2.8 billion of unpaid receivable, which reduces our working capital by &#x20AC;1.5 billion and has a major impact on our free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Another reason for this negative cash flow is to be found in fact that the &#x20AC;11.4 billion of our operating cash flow is below the operating CapEx, i.e., &#x20AC;12 billion. In fiscal year 2010, the Group has continued its capital expense efforts, plus 4% overall, including plus 10% in France. Here on the slide you see the breakdown, 40% in the regulated sector, the rest in non-regulated sector and the rest having to do with investment in new capacities, new nuclear as well as in other activities and maintenance of our grid including nuclear maintenance nearly &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Development expansion CapEx plus &#x2013; over &#x20AC;3.3 billion were devoted to expansion CapEx broken down into one-third in the new nuclear build, as well as Flamanville and UK projects. Another third, having to do with EDF Energies Nouvelles and the rest being split between West Burton in the U.S, (sic) [UK] or hydro and fossil fuel power in France.</p>
          <p>In view of this negative cash flow, minus &#x20AC;300, &#x20AC;1.3 billion in dedicated assets that was below what had been planned initially due to the contribution of 50% of RTEs stock into the dedicated assets. Nevertheless, we have a cash out of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, due as well to dividend payout and other impacts such as currency effects, approximately &#x20AC;800 million and before disposals, the Group's debt would have increased, an increase that reflects higher CapEx, insufficient operational cash flow, an imbalance obvious in France where the increase in the indebtedness of EDF on the French scope amounted to over &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Financial transactions have reduced our debt, the disposal of the UK networks, equity accounting of RTE, we are reaching now a figure of &#x20AC;34.4 billion with a pro forma figure of &#x20AC;27.3 billion in debt pro forma after the sale of EnBW.</p>
          <p>RTE is not just mere deconsolidation of debt, but we're talking here about optimizing the portfolio of dedicated assets by allocating 50% of RTE stock into our dedicated assets. We've actually formed a class of regulated assets that enables us to reduce the risk of our portfolio and to avoid &#x20AC;2.3 billion of additional debt.</p>
          <p>The yield figure of &#x20AC;1.3 million on the provision over the asset depreciation period, this will enable us to avoid &#x20AC;2.3 billion in debt while optimizing our management. I think it's worth specifying that we've invested into assets or we're funding assets that do not contribute to EBITDA as at December 31, 2010. &#x20AC;27 billion in debt pro forma, as I indicated, &#x20AC;10 billion correspond to assets that don't bring in any revenue to EDF because under construction, new nuclear, that's &#x20AC;4 billion, our other projects like EDF Energies Nouvelle, &#x20AC;1 billion, fossil-fired and other &#x20AC;1.7 billion. They've been joined by the CSPE &#x20AC;2.8 billion so that &#x2013; in the &#x20AC;27 billion of debt, we have &#x20AC;10 billion in assets that do not contribute to the Group's financial performance.</p>
          <p>A word now about the countries where we operate before we look at the pro forma figures for EDF, after the main disposals, a word about France first. The EBITDA for France is &#x20AC;10.1 billion that's an increase of 7.7% growth thanks to the positive impact of the cold weather and increase in production and generation for nuclear and hydropower generation. You can see the additional EBITDA due to that addition and the OpEx has been brought under control, minus &#x20AC;213 million. That's 5% of OpEx of the year.</p>
          <p>Another way to see how the EBITDA has changed is to look at the variation between the unregulated and the regulated; the RTF and RTE. The performance of the regulated is excellent, that's due to the cold weather and the containment of OpEx and TURPE. The unregulated includes the non-recurring expense of TaRTAM, which is why the percentage of growth looks low.</p>
          <p>To the French, upstream/downstream balance, you can see on the left, production, generation nuclear has increased 18 terawatt hours to 408. Hydropower is also up, 3.7, which have made the power possible to decrease purchase on the market, 5.6%, and also offset the end of a number of long-term and structural purchases like &#x2013; which is minus 4.7 terawatt hour.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, you can see sales and own consumption, plus 10.6 terawatt hour including 13 for the cold weather. Our customer portfolio explains that change.</p>
          <p>Output is up 4.6% in France. As you can see on this slide, we &#x2013; if you extend the graph from May, we've caught up the lag relative to '09 and we're now well within the range that we anticipated with the production of 408 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to maximize the availability of our fleet in the winter season, and this is a sustained effort that has continued into January. The best output nuclear generation in a single month 43.9 terawatt hour was the amount produced in January.</p>
          <p>The availability ratio is 78.5% in 2010, up 0.5% relative to '09. This is a turning point, which is the beginning of an improvement in our industrial performance after four years of steady decline. This figure was reached in spite of the increased weight of failures.</p>
          <p>You can see in the 2010 bar 5.2% of availability that disappeared due to unplanned outages. And 2011, you can see this reflected in the figures. Our goal though this year is to bring down the unavailability ratio to 3.9% and gain 1.3 points of availability, which should make it possible to offset the loss of availability in the mechanical service due to the number of inspections. There will be more of them this year than they were last year, nine this year as against five last year so that's 1.5 points of availability less, so that this year we're aiming to achieve the same availability ratio as last year.</p>
          <p>Our goal, as I indicated, is to maximize the availability ratio in winter time and achieve these improvements by pursuing our program to replace major components, and we will be deploying new outage scheduled shutdowns so that our fleets continue to operate to its maximum capability.</p>
          <p>Now, we look at more than just availability. That is improving. We also look at the availability of the hydropower fleet from 86.7% to 87.2% and the hydropower fleet was subject to significant demand, but the response rate good indeed, it was 87.2%, which is evidence that we now have good control over our fleet.</p>
          <p>The fossil-fired fleet's availability also improved last year with a decrease in the unscheduled outage rate and the unscheduled outage rate went from 8.6% to 7.3%, so that across our fleet base, we improved performance last year over '09.</p>
          <p>A word now about OpEx, up 10% in France, &#x20AC;700 million, which is spread across &#x2013; as you can see the growth applies to the regulated and unregulated; plus 10% for regulated, plus 9% for unregulated, with a significant share devoted to developing the new nuclear build, &#x20AC;839 million mainly for Flamanville.</p>
          <p>The performance of our UK activities is down 5.9% in EBITDA terms; that's &#x20AC;2.7 billion due to changes in scope. The Sizewell plant was shut down. That was 4 terawatt hours lost, which is a drop in EBITDA of &#x20AC;180 million you can see here in organic terms. That's the main cause of that decrease with a production mix that has changed. On the left hand side you can see that the fossil-fired plants were drawn on less than the previous year. We turn to the market for supply that's because of changes in spreads with the variation in the usage of our own output due to the end of a number of British Energy contracts, which explains the 12 terawatt hours we lost on the left hand side.</p>
          <p>In Italy, EBITDA is practically the same, practically unchanged, thanks to the collection of a non-recurring revenue stream Edison because a number of contracts were terminated early, &#x20AC;84 million in non-recurring EBITDA, &#x20AC;84 million, half of which is EDF.</p>
          <p>Fenice is back on track for its operating profit in '10 sorry, after and '09 drop because margins shrank and the EBITDA figure is nonetheless practically unchanged relative to '09.</p>
          <p>Other international, these are organic growth figures due to SPE and CENG scope changes. You can see that the EBITDA is up 8%, all of the countries contributed to that growth, Poland, plus 4.5% and the rest of Central Europe contributing as well. And we commissioned the combined cycle Dutch plant, we have 50% of our stake in that. And SPE did well and that was a successful integration achieved last year.</p>
          <p>Other business, a significant decrease in Trading, less &#x20AC;280 million EBITDA or thereabouts and that figure reflects a slowdown in business because we had very poor visibility on the market so that in order to decrease the risk on our business portfolio. The Trading teams decided to decrease the perimeter of operations particularly in the second half year, so that profitability dropped down relative to '09, which had been an exceptional year.</p>
          <p>EDF Energy Nouvelles pulled ahead significantly. Its EBITDA is up. We have discussed at length, plus one-third. And the rest of the business was slightly up by 2.9%. So, on the whole that segment is down 7%, because of a drop in the Trading business.</p>
          <p>As I said in my introduction, changes in scope and some significant disposals have significantly impacted our baseline and our ability to generate profit. You can see here changes in the performance and the contribution of these disposed assets to our 2010 business. So, you can analyze how these disposals will impact our accounts.</p>
          <p>On the whole, &#x20AC;20 billion in debt shedding distributed across these three transactions. The net operating profit for 2010 adjusted to the new scope of the Group is &#x20AC;3.1 billion, which is close to the EDF profit of &#x20AC;1 billion. If you add to that the disposed assets &#x20AC;860 million, which gives you the net current income &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>Two observations about this chart. Number one, the adjusted net income for 2010, &#x20AC;3.1 billion is calculated by calculating the disposed assets at 1% before tax, which is the rate at which we set our cash at low risk rate. We took a penalty for that in 2010. We haven't re-applied those funds, which is what you see in that &#x20AC;3.1 billion figure and we pulled ahead in our scope between '09 and 2010. In '09 with the same scope, the adjusted net income was &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The other key figures are sales &#x20AC;63.4 billion, EBITDA &#x20AC;14 million. These are 201o figures, which are readjusted to correspond to the 2011 scope and we have nearly &#x20AC;3 billion in CapEx. And these are the figures that we have relied on to determine our objectives for this year that our Chairman is going to talk you through.</p>

          <p>Thank you very kindly, Thomas. A word of conclusion before we come to our Q&amp;A session, I'd like to briefly look back on 2010 and look at the Group's goals for 2011. Before I do though, I'd like to share with you my profound belief in EDF. This corporation has considerable competitive assets in France and abroad, both now and for the future. And we're looking forward eagerly to the future. Our priority was therefore to consolidate our positions and bolster our Group. Above all, this calls for industrial expertise without which leadership would not be possible.</p>
          <p>As you've seen in our presentation, the process is well underway and we're starting to harvest the initial results. The fleet output, nuclear and hydropower did very well. To that, you can add the fossil-fired output, which did very well and was equal to demand; 22 terawatt hours additional generation compared to '09, this is a very promising first step, but again it is only that, a first step.</p>
          <p>The entire industry has shown that you cannot take a lasting hold on industrial matters without making operational investments and we have done just that, setting aside &#x20AC;2.3 billion for new investments in 2010, including &#x20AC;8 billion in France right from last year.</p>
          <p>Investing means preparing for the future all the while maintaining your existing assets and foundations and making it last like our generation fleet and improving grid performance. This hasn't been detailed yet, but for the first time in 10 years, we improved the service provided although not enough, but we did improve the service provided and the outage time was lower than in previous years and there again, a turnaround for the first time in 10 years.</p>
          <p>Now, we also need to stay one step ahead of change and invest in new means of production, which helps drive our results over the coming years. That's why we've devoted &#x20AC;3.3 billion to development investments, or did so last year. Preparing for the future also means not finding yourself short in the face of poorly identified or underestimated risks.</p>
          <p>Given the reality of deteriorating global energy markets, we had to take a number of steps including the sale of our UK distribution networks. That was a very handsome transaction. The networks were very highly valuated and our stake at EnBW was also sold at a very handsome price.</p>
          <p>Our position at EnBW and changes on the market did not mesh with our desire to play the role of industrial shareholder, which is why we agreed to the offer which we remade. These transactions have largely helped improve our growth profile, and if you add to them the inclusion of RTE under the equity method, they have helped get us out of debt. &#x20AC;20 billion in debt shedding gives us the elbow room that we needed to fuel our new ambitions, in particular abroad.</p>
          <p>You may have heard me say that there are no industrial ventures without human success. This is not something that I say off-hand, this is a genuine belief of mine. Our ambition in the area of labor and more broadly, our aim for HR is part of our profound conviction that skills must be a core part of our operations.</p>
          <p>Now, this is particularly true in an industrial group such as ours, which boasts a high level of technical ability and calls for unparalleled skill. We must constantly strive to keep them up, add to them and pass them on because in the next five years, 40% of our employees will have to be replaced due to retirement.</p>
          <p>To this effect, we've launched a large-scale recruiting and skill renewal program to prepare our successors for the generations that have built EDF as we know it today; a generation that will be asked to pass on the torch in the coming years. And this ambition will materialize in the form of a program that we call D&#xE9;fi, Challenge and we will be building campuses and rebuilding EDF labor philosophy.</p>
          <p>We have plans for our top three business lines production and generation networks. And marketing have been placed at the heart of our managerial organization. Everyone must know there are responsibilities at the crossroads of the business lines and geographic areas. Asia, for us to mesh <mark type="inaudible" /> and Central Europe are strong illustrations of this. Much changed last year and we will have an opportunity with the Executive Committee to explain to you our industrial strategy in details and our international development strategy in details in the spring.</p>
          <p>At this point, I would like to share with you a few of the challenges that we expect in 2010 (sic) [2011]. The first lies in France where the reform of the electricity is more decisive for EDF in industrial and financial terms. This reform, voted in December 2010, includes provisions that should help EDF preserve its interests. For example, using the TaRTAM rate as the base line for the ARENH or hedging all costs and fair payments of each investment to calculate the ARENH. However, there are still uncertainties as to the practical terms of the reform, which will be described in the decrees of the law.</p>
          <p>And actually our industrial performance also remains one of our core priorities. Year 2010, we saw a slight downturn. In 2011, we'll need to shore up our positions in particular by increasing our nuclear output despite a larger number of 10-year maintenance inspect occurring to our ability to get approval for the expansion of nuclear fleet lifespan. As you know, this is a decisive element for us to create value.</p>
          <p>Last, France's specific goal is renewing hydroelectric concession agreement. We must be clear on this matter. We're preparing actively for this and we intend not only to keep our existing contracts, but to win new ones starting with the first deregulated bids. Our second goal, we'll play out on the international scene of course where we already enjoy strong position both in Asia or even now also in North America.</p>
          <p>2011 will be also the year of energy reform in Britain. A new decisive step before final decisions are made turning investments in building new PRP in the UK. And I'd like to pay tribute to the British teams for their high quality and the efficiency in their operational performances achieved in 2011. Thank you to Vincent de Rivaz. Tribute as well for their decisive contribution, changing and contributing to the energy reform in Britain. You know how essential this topic can be in the current context of major investments to be made in the energy sector in Britain.</p>
          <p>Broadly, we also need to keep shoring up our positions, particularly in areas such as Central Europe, which has high potential for growth and we already have strong and profitable positions. The figures that you've seen earlier attest to that.</p>
          <p>Another goal internationally is taking a claim on major international tenders, which are within our reach if we can rely more than ever on our core business, combining our triple role of producer, grid operator, and supplier. We need to rise up to these goals on a short term. Our ambition and roadmap also includes a longer term outlook. Given the rate that which our world is changing, part of our success will lie in our ability to anticipate.</p>
          <p>Challenges linked to non-conventional gases, and their expansion in the U.S., which have had a high impact on energy market. And this illustrates how forward thinking is essential to driving and retaining our leadership in tomorrow's world. This obviously calls for building our skills. This is the impetus behind the 13 technical or trade academies that are gradually being introduced throughout the Group. The <mark type="inaudible" /> agreements signed with the labor organizations in September in fact meets the Group's needs for skills development and renewal in France.</p>
          <p>This also includes our ability to imagine the technology of tomorrow. And from this perspective, the decision taken in November 2010 to make Saclay the Group's primary R&amp;D center to serve as an innovation cluster with the other groups and universities located in Saclay is indeed an essential first step.</p>
          <p>As an illustration again, our purchase of a major calculator capable of performing 200,000 billion calculations per seconds makes us one of the world's leading industrial group in terms of computing power. This calculator will enable us to make significant breakthroughs in the field of smart grids, smart counters that call for processing huge volumes of data. It also help us to make major headway in extending our nuclear plants' operational lifetimes to tools that can perform mechanical analysis on equipments such plant valves and vessels and enclosures in the nuclear sector.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, we must focus on our customers, placing our customers at the height of our business is more than a simple catch phrase. Every day we must understand and anticipate our customers' needs, establish deeper roots in each region, go further in our approach to quality and improved customer service. We know that we still have progress to make in this respect, but the orientations have already moved on in the right direction.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we could say that the year 2011 is shaping up to be a year of many goals for EDF, very active. But whatever happens in the energy industry, it will happen with EDF. We have three key financial targets for 2011, organic growth of EBITDA between 4% and 6% and net debt over EBITDA ratio ranging between 2 and 2.2 times, dividend at least stable versus 2010, at least 1.15, of course all these based on a number of other requirements particularly the TaRTAM law and so on.</p>
          <p>And last detail, although it's smarter detail for shareholders, the Board of Directors will submit to the shareholders income to have a 10% premium on dividends for any stock held over two years, in line with regulations. This is a loyalty premium to individual shareholders and should it be approved by the shareholders' meeting, this premium will become applicable as of 2013.</p>
          <p>I'd like to thank you for your attention together with Thomas and the entire Executive Committee sitting here on the first row to take any questions you may have. We'll get priority to the analysts, first of all, and we'll tell our journalist friends that we will meet again later on for a Q&amp;A session specifically dedicated to journalists.</p>

          <p>Translator: Emmanuel Turpin, Morgan Stanley, first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I have questions. To clarify your guidance, I'd like to start about net debt. Can you give us guidance of a bracket 2 and 2.2 times net debt over EBITDA applied to an EBITDA bracket? Perhaps could you tighten up for this bracket, if you will by giving us, sorry, are we talking 29, 33 instead of 30, 32. And that give us guidance towards an increased debt versus the adjusted debt level and that's on slide 27. Are you taking the account a second one-off cash from Exeltium following the first one in 2010? Secondly, what CapEx level are you taking now and how much are you budgeting for CSPE deficit?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on net income, we have no specific guidance. We only have &#x2013; on EBIT we start from &#x20AC;3.1 billion in adjusted net income if you add &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;600 million in EBITDA, if I'm not mistaken. Now regarding your future CapEx and deconsolidation, how much should we count on for 2011? And could you give us an idea of the trend in the average cost of the debt interest expense?</p>
          <p>Translator: Answer from Thomas Piquemal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On debt issues, 29, 33 that is the bracket. Yes, but we're tightening up probably to 30 and 32, somewhere north of 30, let's say. Including the second payment from Exeltium, degradation of working capital linked to the CSPE utility tax, difficult to quantify very specifically because it all depends of course on the volume of projects particularly photovoltaic solar project for the coming years.</p>
          <p>In terms of the CSPE utility tax, our main goal is to be able to collect &#x20AC;2.8 million debt that is due. We were supposed to recollect that and we should collect that by 2015-2017 depending on the different assumptions of portfolio trend and assuming that there will be an increase of &#x20AC;3.1 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Regarding the debt, gross debt in 2010 was stable at 4.4%. Even though we increased the average maturity of our debt with a number of transactions, average maturity went from 7.4 up to 8.6 years on average. Our target for the debt is to limit the cost of carry, since we have extremely high liquidity nearly 17 &#x2013; over &#x20AC;17 billion as of year-end 2010 to increase due to the cash coming from EnBW's disposal, which will have a significant impact on our income. So, no necessity for the time &#x2013; for any issuance at the time. We just want to optimize your cost of cash investment.</p>
          <p>Net income, yes, we did not give any guidance on net income. You're right. What I can say at this point, we're perfectly comfortable with the consensus published on our website showing a net income from recurring operations of &#x20AC;3 billion for the fiscal year 2011. Once again, this net income includes a financial income that is highly penalizing for the Group. As I said earlier, we invest the proceeds from disposal at 1%. Our ambition of course is to invest these proceeds at a high interest rate thanks to our new investment policy, financial investment policy.</p>
          <p>That's specifically what I can tell you on your questions. Hopefully, I was able to give you precise answers to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the EBITDA guidance, there was some confusion this morning. This 4% to 6% to make life very, very simple for us, can you put some numbers on that? Second, on nuclear, you are this year 6 terawatts ahead of last year and you are guiding at a growth year-on-year of around 6 terawatt hours. So, you're effectively saying you are not going to do better for the rest of the year than you have done in 2010, isn't that conservative given your trajectory?</p>
          <p>Also in this guidance you have 9.3% unplanned outages, if I read, I think it was page 23, correctly. Isn't that an unbelievably high number in terms of outages? I thought many companies were like in 1%, 2% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the EBITDA, I don't want to believe that you couldn't calculate the figures once you had the percentage. Anyway, 4% to 6%, that's 14.7 to 15 range, if you will, if you want more specific numbers. Without any kind of readjustments, 4% to 6% without readjusting for TaRTAM, this is the growth rate that is applied on the EBITDA that includes the TaRTAM expense. And we believe in 2011, we'll have 12 months of the TaRTAM, six months due to the extension of the mechanism plus six months since the ARENH NOME mechanism will actually extend the cost of the TaRTAM mechanism.</p>
          <p>Regarding nuclear output, the figures that you mentioned, the growth will be better than what you mentioned. In France, for instance, if I can find the right chart, in France, we've grown 18.1 terawatt hour.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we increased the total output, 408 to 415, despite the fact that our assumption is minimum availability factor of 78.5%, which is stable compared to 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my argument was that you were four ahead in January and if I have not done my numbers wrong, you're two ahead in February, so you've already attained it, so for the remainder of the year, you're flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, may I remind you that we have nine de senior visits during the year that we try to optimize our availability factor during the winter. That's &#x2013; the point that you are highlighting is exactly the one I mentioned, which is the fact that we try to optimize the fleet during the winter. I confirm the target, which is 843 between 408 to 415 terawatt hours, which is again an increase compared to 2010 despite the fact that we would have stable availability factor..</p>
          <p>You also had a question on &#x2013; maybe Herv&#xE9; could...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Unplanned outages, you're talking 9% for the year 2010. 5.2% of what we call exceptional outages on damages on the three main components, steam generators, alternators, and transformers. The rest of that, the 5%, remaining 5% used to be 5.6% and we're considering taking it down to 5.4%. These are unplanned shutdowns linked either to extended shutdown times as compared with the optimum absolute standard of planned outages or shutdowns that are considered to be successful, and also unplanned outages that are linked to other factors not related to the main three components I've just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Basically, and we've already said it, in view of the highly specific features of the French nuclear fleet that follows the load and sometimes we have to shut down our plants in a number of cases and to monitor the load there is a difference versus other international. Six points of Kd factor is the difference as compared with other fleets. So, basically 10% in the shutdowns, i.e., unavailable and 5% to 6% linked to very specific features of the French fleet. Hence, our goal to reach the &#x2013; or 85% ultimately in terms of Kd factor.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Beyond the CSPE impact and other impact I mentioned earlier. And so we'll also be continuing our capital spending particularly in France. The CapEx budget plans for 2011 under the format that I explained is greater to &#x2013; than the &#x20AC;10.3 billion, greater by &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;1.5 billion, reflecting a significant effort in the distribution at ERDF as well as in the island systems and, of course, reflect as well continuing investment to replace the major components that are often responsible for the damages and shutdowns that Herv&#xE9; mentioned, as well as in new nuclear in the UK. So, overall, the CapEx for 2011 are planning to be higher than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Briefly, we have another Web question regarding the write-off. In the UK, write-off passed on coal-fired plants. As I've said earlier, we have impaired &#x2013; approximately &#x20AC;400 million on the coal-fired plants in the UK due to tax changes.</p>

          <p>John Honor&#xE9;, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have a question, if I may. Could you please come back to the subject of EBITDA? What is your Trading assumption? We saw the drop this year. In the U.S., there's a plan shaping up, you would be the only operator of the Calvert Cliffs site. You're in the process of setting up a very unusual scheme. Could you say a word about that, please and explain how that looks set to go forward?</p>
          <p>And then I have a question about the Areva mines, this is the second time around that we've seen a likely partner. Do you have long-term supply contracts with Areva? It seems to me you do, so what will be the purpose of that move? And then to Chairman, sir, what country are you targeting for your international development?</p>

          <p>I gave you some EBITDA guidance that includes that the Trading business would contribute same level as last year.

          <p>No, this is not an unusual scheme. Our intention is to pursue our efforts as undertaken with respect to the U.S. stakeholders. We've undertaken to determine under what circumstances we could build an EPR reactor at Calvert Cliffs 3. We've resumed conversations with the U.S. authorities, all of them in fact. That was two weeks after the Constellation transaction was concluded.</p>
          <p>As you know, this is quite a complicated project because the price environment is highly volatile, and because there is no regulatory framework or no likelihood of there being one of the type that exists in the UK, for instance, you're quite right to say that we're now back in control or now in a position to determine at which rate we want this project to go forward. However, we're not going to rush in shopping that reactor if the conditions are not right, primarily profitability conditions. And that is what we're looking at carefully. We will continue to talk with U.S. authorities and all the U.S. stakeholders to ensure in what circumstances we would be prepared to go forward with this project and in line with what we announced for the Constellation transaction. Chairman?</p>

          <p>The mines, well, EDF is the number one uranium purchaser worldwide. We are the number one nuclear operator, we're the biggest nuclear fleet worldwide. We have under direct control 84 nuclear reactors in operation to which you have to add the ones that are under construction. And among those 84, we have 58 French reactors and plus 16 in UK and then the reactors that are under construction both in France and in the UK to which you have to add stakes that we hold in plants in China; we have a 30% stake in Taishan and the two reactors that are under construction in China.</p>
          <p>So, if you take only the 74 reactors that we currently manage directly, we are the number one operator worldwide and we're also the number one purchaser of uranium worldwide. And we try to secure those fuel resources for obvious reasons and we have to negotiate long-term contracts with all of the suppliers and all the international players in the fossil market, including &#x2013; on the fuel market, pardon me, including Areva. And we intend to consolidate that position.</p>
          <p>And the idea of entering into mining operations is not out of the questions, we're not ruling it out, but it's not a high priority, it is not our aim to take over a mine, be it Areva's mine or any other, but we just want to secure our supply and we'll see under what circumstances we might take up stakes in a mine or mines. This is something that we're not ruling out and we've had discussions recently in that regard, which is why there was an article in the press. A partnership with Areva is a possible solution to securing our supply.</p>
          <p>Now, for foreign operations, we already have strong position in the UK where we are number one &#x2013; the number one energy or number one power provider. And we have a strong position in Italy, in Central Europe and in the U.S. and Asia, making us a major player internationally. And it is our intention to continue to develop both through organic growth and as we've said repeatedly matters greatly that we demonstrate that we're able to grow through organic growth. And given the expertise that we have, we will be addressing new international markets. This is under discussion regarding some international markets. I won't dwell on that topic, and we'll be addressing them in the form of different legal structures and doing so very selectively and we will be undertaking extra growth operations.</p>
          <p>We're looking at Poland very carefully. We're in the process of negotiating specifically for the taking up of a stake in that country. And we're looking at other locations as well. We also have a partnership in Italy. We're in the process of negotiating a partnership, the partnership contract that is very near. So, that's under discussion. As Mr. Piquemal specified earlier, we're in the process of negotiating with our Italian partners.</p>
          <p>So, that it can be said, we have a number of prospects. We are often approached with international development projects. Energy is in greater and greater demand. It is in shorter and shorter supply. And many countries are in the process of giving this better, careful consideration be they developed or developing and you know what so-called developing country has now reached the number two position worldwide as of yesterday officially. So developing, of course, I was referring to China; developing country doesn't really apply to them nor to other countries.</p>
          <p>We recently inaugurated the Nam Theun 2 dam in Laos, it's an extraordinary success. It's really a showcase for our skills in hydropower. Some of the members of the Executive Committee who are with us here this morning were instrumental in achieving that success and were there right from the start. It was a 15-year long project, it's a spectacular success and demonstrates once again that EDF is fully able to undertake projects very far from home and succeed and doesn't have to buy a slot on the market and can in the process reinforce its growth potential through international growth. And we will continue to leverage our skills both upstream and downstream. We will have much more to say about that in the spring when we talk you through the international prospects.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a few Internet questions to take. One regarding the debt over EBITDA guidance, is that 2 to 2.2 figure inclusive of major external growth transactions?</p>
          <p>The answer is no. And should we undertake such external growth transactions? We would communicate about the credit ratio and the measures we would be taking to satisfy our commitment to maintain our rating.</p>
          <p>There is another question from the Internet about the EBITDA guidance regarding the third-party access ARENH. Our EBITDA forecast factors in a price of the third-party access in line with TaRTAM, &#x20AC;42 according to our calculations. If we didn't get &#x20AC;42, will be the impact of one less &#x20AC;1 on our EBITDA figure?</p>
          <p>Given that today we have 80 terawatt hours for the TaRTAM, if we lose &#x20AC;1 of those 80 terawatt hours, we'll be losing &#x20AC;40 million in the second half of the year, twice that in the first. This is only an impact that we felt in half of the year, which don't have an impact on the Group's profitability nor on its cash flow balance in ensuing years.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Benjamin Leyre from Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions, if I may. Number one about nuclear provisions, could you tell us your level of confidence regarding the provisions for spent fuel storage and when will those costs be audited or revised, the costs incurred by storage of spent fuel?</p>
          <p>Number two, what is the rate of provisioning for dedicated assets to 2012? And is there a performance risk on the sale of your stake in EnBW? It is rumored that you may be sued.</p>
          <p>Translator: Mr. Piquemal answers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding nuclear provisions, you're referring to a number of comments about the possible revision of the deep burying costs. We have no information about revised budgets or new expectation. So we've maintained that figure. In the course of this year, we will be given more information. A number of workings groups have been set up to look into the matter and in fact they will be meeting throughout the year.</p>
          <p>As to your question about performance risk on the EnBW transaction, the answer is no, there is no condition that could suspend that transaction other than the antitrust. So we're expecting that transaction to go through to completion.</p>
          <p>As to the provisioning for dedicated assets, I think it's &#x20AC;40 million per month, is that right, as opposed to &#x20AC;80 million previously for &#x20AC;50 million in 2011. That's a significantly reduced amount given the contribution of 50% RTE shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question of a qualitative nature. You showed us a slide showing EDF's situation in 2010, which is quite favorable both for the current income and for the containment of risks across your operation. And then 2011 you anticipate the situation will continue to develop in a positive direction.</p>
          <p>So my question is, if that portrayal of the corporation as compared to the situation on the stock market, the contrast is quite striking. You're not the only corporation in the industry that's been taking a beating on the stock market. But question is whether behind that apparently positive appearance there aren't a number of fundamental difficulties that I'm sure you will be discussing at your strategic meeting scheduled for a few months from now. But that potential is of some concern to us, if you please answer that.</p>

          <p>No, we're not going to accuse anyone of incompetence. We're not saying that our business is risk-free. However, the visibility we have of the industry is good, promising compared to other players. Our profile, our risk profile is unusually well under control. I don't think it's accurate to say that we have been optimistic. We have been realistic.</p>
          <p>What were the major issues? When I assumed my position as the head of this corporation, the output and the fleet efficiency, I think we can say that the turnaround has been past and that we've improved our economic efficiency of fleet &#x2013; both fossil-fired, hydropower and nuclear has improved in efficiency, France and in the UK.</p>
          <p>And our teams are fully mobilized. I think the industrial climate is excellent. We have been able to enlist the support of our employees, generate enthusiasm about our project. And I really want to stress that the industrial relations climate is quite improved over '09, which has certainly contributed to the improvement of our performance, our output and the efficiency of our fleet. And we will no doubt continue to operate in this fashion and improve the situation further.</p>
          <p>As to the thorny issues such as the U.S. project, well that is now resolved. There were a number of risks arising from certain assets in our accounts that is why we booked provisions, which are in the balance sheet, but that ultimately apply to &#x2013; pertain to issues that arose in previous financial years.</p>
          <p>And the company had to be given a new voice and make us all heard, not only in France. Let's take the example of UK. I have paid tribute to the UK team under Vincent de Rivaz 's direction, given new UK regulations, which are going to impact the company significantly in the future. Well, that is quite favorable relative to the previous situations. This is as a result of some very hard work, discussion, and the regulation is now in the process of final approval.</p>
          <p>The price of carbon has now been set at a floor and that in principle was agreed to by the UK authorities. We haven't said enough about the vote that Commons voted where some 97% of the members were in favor and that's a watershed in our industry. And I think we really had something to do with that success.</p>
          <p>So talk about the gearing. Well, one of the subjects of concern was the debt burden, and this is really now behind us. We now have sufficient maneuverability. It is certainly never an easy matter to sell off assets that have been turned around and whose value has been improved thanks to the hard work of our teams. That was the case of the U.K. networks, among others. So we've recovered a certain amount of agility. The ratios have improved. We still have compliance issues when it comes to the natural rules that are imposed by the outside world or by the ratings agencies among others.</p>
          <p>But, again we have this new flexibility, which will make it possible to invest wisely be it into organic or external growth. And that again will contribute to our performance. We're not suddenly going to uncover risks. It's more a matter of our risk profile having been significantly improved and we can now really start from a sound foundation. And we continue to be very, very &#x2013; fulfill our legal obligations.</p>
          <p>Now, there are a number of uncertainties when it comes to the French operating conditions. And until those conditions have been specified, there's nothing we can do about the market speculating as it does when the prospects are uncertain, when your outlook is uncertain. And if we were to depart from the principle, the principle that we have to consider the full cost price when we sell off industrial capability, well, this speculation is bound to continue. It has an impact on the share price, beyond what you could reasonably expect, but let's wait until the jury is in because &#x2013; before we draw any conclusions about that.</p>
          <p>And the operating conditions of the Group have been to settled down to become more visible. As Mr. Piquemal said earlier, we are cautious in any statements where we calculate our targets very cautiously. We outperformed our objectives in significant amounts compared to what we announced last year and we have no intention to disappoint anyone in 2011. We're announcing cautious figures. These are not internal targets. These are cautious targets that we will be held accountable against.</p>
          <p>So we've got no hypothesis of any investment, of any amount other than release by the debt shedding. So we're not under threat of a takeover for the time being at least, can't say that about the stock market. There is a drawback to having stable capital structure. But the stock market will ultimately recognize the value of this company and I believe the market is not appreciating us at our actual value. But it's up to us to illustrate that that is the case.</p>

          <p>I have two questions. What date are we going to have an opening balance sheet for the new consolidation scope? In other words, as of which date can we start working on the balance sheet in the new scope, because we're still working on the older consolidations scope? Then you talk about the price of &#x20AC;40 per megawatt, does that just include TaRTAM mechanism or does that also include the possibility of selling 25%? In other words, instead of &#x20AC;42, you had &#x20AC;40. Could we estimate how much that would cost you in EBITDA for 25% of the nuclear output?</p>

          <p>Opening balance sheet. Well, with the exception of EnBW is one as of 31st of December 2010. The only thing that hasn't been included is EnBW. Otherwise, we include the consolidation of RTE equity consolidation. So &#x2013; and the next announcement for the first half year on the 30th of June, we will give you the consolidation scope including the EnBW transaction.</p>
          <p>Regarding your answer on the &#x20AC;42 &#x2013; answer regarding the ARENH price, if we can show the two slides that we had on the subject, the ARENH, third party access price, in application of the law and consistent with the TaRTAM initial price gives us a figure of &#x20AC;42 for the initial clientele portfolio. The calculation is actually very simple. A lot of data has to be processed. A lot of assumptions need to be defined.</p>
          <p>But the main three assumptions are that the calculation scope will determine of course the format of the consumption curve, hence the price of the average portion of energy in the TaRTAM. On the left part of this chart here, what you see &#x2013; there are several version of the TaRTAM price, connections, others &#x2013; they're called TaRTAM A, B and C, the TaRTAM family, if you will, meaning that when you calculate all of that on our portfolio, you have an average price of &#x20AC;45.5 per megawatt hour with transmission costs, commercial costs of &#x20AC;12.1 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Now, if we try to calculate that under the NOME Law, the unknown of course is the ARENH price. For a given fixed volume and fixed market price, two assumptions that remain to be determined, I remind you. We've done a number of calculations based on different scenarios. And that's how we reached this price of &#x20AC;42.</p>
          <p>To give you more details, doesn't this slide a little bit complex here with this chart. It is useful, slide 136. On the left side, this chart shows the range of possible values as seen today over the time based on market price for base load in 2012. The brackets we chose were between 51.5 and 53.5. That's the most reasonable assumption.</p>
          <p>Based on what we know on the enforcement decrees, which have not been published yet, it seems reasonable to have in ARENH volume anywhere between 82% and 80%. In the green part of this chart here, that is the portfolio of EDF customers, this is a result of the calculation shown in green, systematically above &#x20AC;42 per megawatt hour, where the gap between peak prices and base load prices on the market of &#x20AC;13 per megawatt hour basically the average gap over the past few months.</p>
          <p>There's one item that is not known because that has to do &#x2013; that will be determined by the CRE that is the shape of the load curve supplied at TaRTAM prices by our competitor only if the regulation authority knows who these clients are.</p>
          <p>The question is, what is the mix customers supplied by competitors between the various TaRTAM prices, i.e., TaRTAM, A, B and C. There may be a slightly different mix between our portfolio and our competitors' portfolio. And, of course, in both cases, we have to make calculations adjusted over in annual duration since some customers may have chosen &#x2013; made a choice between the TaRTAM price and the market prices.</p>
          <p>Now, according to our estimate the maximum spread on the final result should be anywhere between plus and minus &#x20AC;0.5 per megawatt hour, which gives us quite a lot of serenity when we estimated that the law should come up with a price of &#x20AC;42 per megawatt hour. Hopefully, I've answered your question.</p>

          <p>Regarding the impact on our accounts, now that clearly that was explained this calculation. &#x20AC;1 that is yes, an impact on our normative profitability regarding 80 terawatt hour and you're right that it can go up to 100 terawatt hour under the NOME Law, yes. But compared with a normative profitability in earlier, &#x20AC;1 means &#x20AC;80 million less in EBITDA over one year. That reverts back to our target of &#x20AC;40 million over six months, as I've said earlier. This is a six month impact, if you will, as compared with the forecast I gave you for 2011.</p>

          <p>I have three questions. First one, on the NOME Law, can you share with us your best estimates of the calendar for the announcement of publication of the starting date for the ARENH price, publication of the enforcement decrees, starting date, the trends, qualitative and quantitative estimates?</p>
          <p>Second question, on Dalkia, what is your position? Where you &#x2013; do you still think it's still the best organization structure, the best way of being present in the sector of energy services?</p>
          <p>Third question, on the issue of provisions for pensions, is everything done, settled, resolved for 2010 or do you still have a residual risks following the pension reform in France?</p>

          <p>Well, we're just like you waiting for the government's decision. What's been announced in terms of calendar is end of March with all information on the ARENH price and in other details, so the law should come into force with the decree being published in the end of the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding your question &#x2013; Dalkia, and your question on Dalkia, nothing new under the sun versus what you already know. EDF and Dalkia signed a cooperation agreement back in the year 2000, slightly over 10 years ago, and anticipated the fact the convergence between environmental and energy businesses would most likely a strong point in the new landscape of the future.</p>
          <p>Now 10 years later, all we can do is rejoice because that was true. So this cooperation between EDF and Dalkia is being bolstered, strengthened significantly and steadily in the field. I would have many examples to give you to illustrate that, but I don't think that is really on the agenda for this meeting. But maybe if you'd like to we can come back to that when we present our strategic plans.</p>
          <p>EDF is the key leader of centralized energy worldwide, with our core business being electricity and developments in the gas sector. Dalkia is the leading global operator in terms of energy optimization services on behalf of local authorities and major industrial players, and a major player in decentralized energy, particularly in countries where you have district heating. This is the case in many Central European and East European countries where, of course, our cooperation has led to major development and expansion. So, for the time being, there is nothing in the current geography, if you will, or history that would contradict this special ambition. We will see how things evolve in the future.</p>

          <p>Thomas Piquemal responding to the French retirement reform and its impact on EDF and whether everything was taken into account in the balance sheet as of December 2010, and I confirm that it does. And it has no impact, because the excess cost of the pension reforms and there will be one will be actually recognized as actuarial expenses, meaning that we increased our provision by approximately &#x20AC;50 million, but the overall cost is depreciated over the constitution of these provisions, which is why there is no impact on our account. In addition, there a number of positive impacts that will partially offset any impact from the French pension reform.</p>

          <p>Three questions. Number one, regarding provisions made in Italy. Could you give us the detail on what goes back to Fenice &#x2013; on what is applicable to Fenice and Edison? Does this provision take into account any failure of negotiations of gas contract?</p>
          <p>Second question, net debt over EBITDA and your target, could we, consider that let's say within 24 months in view of the deleveraging of your balance sheet achieved in '10-2011, could we expect perhaps 2.5, a 2.5 multiples, could that be a decent level in your view, in view of your investment capacities and internal capacity?</p>
          <p>When you published the third quarter results, Thomas Piquemal, you had talked about new capacities for the Group to find more savings. Could you come back on that topic? And perhaps, can you tell us whether these potential savings are incorporated into your 4% to 6% EBITDA target for 2011?</p>

          <p>As precise as I can be. We've depreciated Fenice's goodwill approximately &#x20AC;200 million is that goodwill, but I cannot give you any more details because we're talking about a number of global risks that have in provisions for all the assets. I told you that it includes TDE, Edison and Fenice, but I prefer not to give you details on the allocation of this provision.</p>
          <p>Regarding EBITDA target, difficult to project ourselves within two years because I have given you a full picture of the Group. But even though we will have external growth and acquisition transactions, we will remain below 2.5 times EBITDA and our target is, of course, as I say, is to preserve our rating.</p>
          <p>Lastly, regarding securing our supplies and purchases, all of that is included in our figures. We're talking about optimizing purchases within the Group, we're talking about synergies, the effects of which will be reflected primarily in year-end plus two and three. Of course, all our teams are working harder, but there is a potential for savings.</p>
          <p>We prefer not to give you any details on that pending the three-year vision that we would like to share with you in the spring. Once again, rather than give you little bits and pieces here and there, we'd rather give you a full snapshot all at the same time. We'll do that as early as possible in the spring once we have the main &#x2013; we know the main parameters of the ARENH price and the NOME Law.</p>
