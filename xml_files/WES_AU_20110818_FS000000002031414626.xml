          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding, and welcome to the Wesfarmers 2011 Full Year Results Briefing. Your lines will be muted during the briefing. However, you will have an opportunity to ask questions immediately afterwards, and instructions will be provided on how to do this at that time. Today's call is also being webcast live on the Wesfarmers website, and can be accessed from the homepage of wesfarmers.com.au.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to the Managing Director of Wesfarmers Limited, Mr. Richard Goyder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning if you're on the webcast, and good afternoon if you're on the East Coast. I'm joined in Perth by the heads of each of the business, so my initial comments will be followed by Ian McLeod, then John Gillam, Launa Inman, Guy Russo, Rob Scott, Stewart Butel, Tom O'Leary, Olivier Chretien and Terry Bowen, and then I'll finish on outlook. So, we're all together in Perth.</p>
          <p>I'm just going to give a bit of an overview of the results because I want the divisional heads and Terry to go into the detail and after I've talked about outlook we will move to questions, and hopefully have plenty of time for that.</p>
          <p>So, just a few general comments, and we'll try to keep you on the slides that we're on, so I'm on Slide 4 of the pack at the moment, the group performance highlights. A general comment. I think the full year results reflect the strong performance in a reasonably challenging period with some economic uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Obviously the impact of floods, particularly in Queensland and the New Zealand earthquakes. And they show, I think, the benefit of the diverse businesses the group has. I think we've got a very strong portfolio of businesses. We've got a performance-focused management team, and management teams within each of the businesses.</p>
          <p>And importantly, Wesfarmers over the years has invested in &#x2013; has had a long-term investment strategy, and I think we're seeing the benefits of that now, and I think we'll see the benefits of that into the future with the existing assets we've got and with the strong investment focus we've got in the group at the moment.</p>
          <p>So, on revenue of nearly $55 billion dollars, we had a net profit after tax of $1.9 billion, $2 billion up, just under 23% on last year, earnings per share up the same at $1.67 per share. Strong operating cash flow of nearly $3 billion, and a cash realization rate of over 100%.</p>
          <p>For the year, capital investment of over $2 billion, and a good chunk of that was growth capital expenditure, and we of course, have a very strong liquidity position. Terry will go through that. The balance sheet is strong, and the directors today announced a fully franked final dividend of $0.85 per share, which gives a full year dividend of $1.50 per share.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 5 where, as I said, the group managing directors will go through &#x2013; the divisional managing director will go through these in more details, but Coles we're pleased with where Coles is at. The turnaround continues in accordance with our expectations, and earnings up 21.2% on strong sales growth.</p>
          <p>At Bunnings, another really good year, a continuation of the last 17, and John will talk about what's underpinned that, but particularly the merchandising execution, a strong cost focus and a really pleasing continuation of opening new stores, and a very strong pipeline of new stores to come. For Kmart and Officeworks, which are both in turnaround mode, we've had improved earnings on a strong uplift in transactions and unit growth as they continue to reposition their offers.</p>
          <p>In Target, Launa will talk about Target. Obviously earnings there impacted through price deflation, clearance activity needed to &#x2013; where we needed to clear seasonal lines, but beneath that there's been solid transaction growth in that business. As we've previously flagged in Insurance we had a really challenging year, and significantly lower earnings due to the unprecedented number of catastrophe events and what flows from that through provisions for the liability adequacy and obviously reinsurance, higher reinsurance price as well. And Rob will go into that.</p>
          <p>We had a strong improvement in the Resources division earnings due to higher coal prices, albeit on less production than we would have liked because of the interruptions we had due to the flood. And the Chemicals, Energy &amp; Fertilizer business and the Industrial and Safety divisions both benefited from strong demand, particularly from the resource sector, but across many parts of their businesses, and very strong operational performance.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to go into anything on Slide 6, other than the bottom line, which is the return on shareholders' funds, which has improved, but it needs to and there's more to do on that front obviously, and that will be &#x2013; continue to be a strong focus for us. On Slide 7, a dividend payout ratio of 90%, and a return to growth in earnings per share which we are pleased about, and we obviously look forward to a continuation of that.</p>
          <p>On Slide 8, I said earlier I think we've got a very good portfolio of businesses, and I think those businesses are well positioned both in the current environment, but for the future and this slide just gives a breakdown of the businesses and their contribution for the year. Of the eight divisions, if you include Home Improvement and Office Supplies as one division. We had six of the eight improve their earnings over last year.</p>
          <p>And if you count nine and Officeworks as one, seven of nine and then if you go to Slide 9 on return on capital, Wesfarmers always has been, always will be an organization that focuses very strongly on return on capital, five measures or five parts of the equation, i.e. earnings growth and capital efficiency improvements. And six of nine improved, and Bunnings went back slightly, but that's on the back of a lot of investment in property which will underpin growth in that business in the future. So, pleasing results really in seven of the nine businesses or improvements in seven of the nine businesses over the last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of initiatives, again, the divisional managing directors will talk a lot about this on Slides 10 and 11. Just quickly, Coles' turnaround is on track. We've got a lot more to do in Coles. We think this turnaround extends way beyond the five years that we asked the market to give us, although we have a very strong expectation that the business will make the expectations we had for five years.</p>
          <p>In terms of Home improvement and Office Supplies, Bunnings is in very good shape, and well positioned for the future and we're seeing some good progress in the turnaround in Officeworks. Kmart is an exciting turnaround, and those of you who have been into our stores recently will see great value and values on everyday items. And we've got some more work to do, a lot more work to do in Kmart, but we're pleased with where it's going.</p>
          <p>Target, there's been an enormous amount of work done in recent times on the offering on how our stores are going to look and feel, on some productivity improvements, and Launa will touch on those. Rob will go to the things which we think will underpin an improvement in the performance of our Insurance business, particularly the underwriting disciplines, the growth in our broking business and some premium growth initiatives. And then on the Resources side of things, Jim will talk a bit about the expansion projects we've got on our Curragh and Bengalla and the outlook in that business.</p>
          <p>Tom in Chemicals, Energy &amp; Fertilizers will talk about expansion opportunities there, and what we feel are good markets for that business, and Olivier in the Industrial and Safety division will talk about the continuing investment in increasing our share of customers in that business.</p>
          <p>From a group point of view, profile I mentioned, it is always a key part of the group, and it's a focus of ours to ensure we over time get that right. And Terry and his team have done an enormous amount of work in recent times on the balance sheet recently in funding diversity, and our cost of funding, which is they are going the right way for us.</p>
          <p>So, with that I'll come back with outlook later, and hand over to Ian, who will run through Coles with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. We believe these results reflect the strong progress made during the third year of the turnaround, and demonstrate our underlying strategy of building a solid platform for future growth is working.</p>
          <p>We've continued to improve efficiency, improve standards, invest in stores, invest in Coles and rebuild the brand. Our investment and lower prices have been well received by customers totaling 1.6% underlying deflation during the year. We're encouraged by this progress, but fully recognize that there's much more to do to maintain our turnaround momentum.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Slide 13. Coles delivered revenue of over $32 billion, almost 7% higher than last year, and also grew earnings before interest and tax by over $200 million to almost $1.2 billion in total. Return on capital is now 7.8%, significantly up on the 5.1% return on capital of two years ago, and we expect further improvement going forward.</p>
          <p>Food and liquor revenue was up 6.3%, leading the sector, both in Australia and internationally, but EBIT growth of 23%, and a 50 basis points rise in EBIT margin to 4.2%. At a competitive convenience market, Coles Express grew shop sales by 2%, and fuel volumes by 2.3%. Profit grew by 23% through a combination of growth in fuel volumes, particularly V Power and diesel, improvements in shop sales mix and solid cost management.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Slide 14. In the last three years we've worked through a cohesive plan to address all of the issues we inherited, and set Coles on the road to recovering. We've added $2.8 billion in food sales in the last two years with a cumulative comparable growth rate of 12% in the same period.</p>
          <p>We've added 2 million more customers per week equivalent to a city the size of Brisbane, and our profits have increased to over three times the rate of sales, significantly improving our returns. I see the programs that have been instigated at Target with markdowns which are beginning to generate significant annualized savings. Other savings programs have also been added to further lower our cost of doing business.</p>
          <p>In the last three years our overall store space has been relatively flat, but this masks a significant change within the network. During this period we divested and closed 61 stores, and opened 53 new ones. By the end of FY '11, we had 144 stores in our renewed format. This has resulted in double digit growth in sales per square meter over the last three years across the state. Three years ago, external expectations on turnaround success were low, so hopefully our track record shows that good progress is now being made.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Slide 15. Our commitment to reinvesting cost savings and lower prices, particularly in Down Down campaign, have resulted in reductions of more than 10% on over 6,000 items. Coles has been criticized by some for its Down Down campaigns on staple products such as milk, but these price cuts have saved our customers over $800 million, and we have been rewarded by higher sales and more customer transactions.</p>
          <p>In the current economic climate, cost conscious shoppers are increasingly attracted to the value we are offering in our Coles private label range. Many consumers have tried Coles brand products for the first time, and they liked what they found. Over 1,000 new or improved product lines have been introduced in the last 12 months. We have now withdrawn the ill-considered You'll Love Coles brand from our shelves, and replaced it with a more contemporary and consistent Coles brand packaging design.</p>
          <p>Our premium Coles Finest range demonstrates the scale of change we've made in quality and innovation, and we're now progressively adjusting and rebranding Smart Buy. As a result, we are seeing greater penetration of Coles brand items in customers' baskets, with double digit growth in average sales per week. The quality of Coles brand products has also been recognized with 27 industry awards during the year.</p>
          <p>I now turn to Slide 16. The investment Coles has made in improved quality of our fresh food has driven over $600 million of incremental sales in the last 12 months alone. Our Australian First purchasing policy means that customers have growing confidence in the quality and providence of our fresh food offer.</p>
          <p>Over 96% of the fresh produce sold at Coles is Australian grown, and we're continuing to work with our Australian suppliers to extend growing seasons, and develop import replacement programs so that we can source more local produce for our customers for the simple reason that we know that's what they want.</p>
          <p>Accusations we are seeking to reduce our support for Australian product could not be further from the truth. We've also been working with our suppliers within our own network to reduce fresh food lead times through stores, and our supply chain strategy is focused on delivering further improvement going forward.</p>
          <p>Coles focus on animal welfare and ethical sourcing has also been rewarded by strong sales in fresh food, including HGP-free beef, sow stall-free pork plants, lower prices on free range eggs, RSPCA approved free range chicken, and World Wildlife Fund approved sustainable seafood. All these products have been very successful with customers, resulting in double digit sales and volume growth in the last 12 months. And also, Coles in-store push into regularly fresh baked everyday has also seen our ISB sales up 12% &#x2013; 15% in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 17. When we first arrived and removed barriers from our store entrances and withdrew the requirements for our cashiers to frisk people on the way out, critics thought we were na&#xEF;ve at best and wholly irresponsible at worst. I received letters of complaint demanding I put them back immediately as we'd be doomed without them. The reality is that we felt far more value to be gained in treating customers as customers rather than criminals, and improvements in stock loss could be better achieved in other ways.</p>
          <p>A three-pronged strategy was developed which has delivered over $100 million in savings in the last 12 months, and well over $200 million in benefits over the last two years. The three programs are, one, in-store process improvement, two, space and range changes, and three, replenishment automation and improved forecasting. These strategy have combined to deliver improved ordering to match sales, better rotation to reduce overstock and reduce markdowns, higher fresh produce sales by reducing prices and increasing stock turn, adjusting space to match sales in lower sale density stores, training and coaching through demonstrating in-store success and electronic stock taking of fresh meat and fresh produce. As a result, wasted markdowns as a proportion of sales are down by more than 150 basis points since we started the turnaround.</p>
          <p>This is very good progress, but we will not ease off on this project. There is more gains to be made. Further cost improvement programs have been introduced to reduce equipment cost and improve productivity and efficiency, and we see scale opportunity to supply chain end-to-end.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to Slide 18. There are several key elements to our store renewal program. The first is new formats. After the extremely positive customer response to our renewal store trials, we have moved to scale roll-out. In the last 12 months, we landed 94 renewal stores, nearly two renewals per week, including 83 refurbished stores, including those which we extended our footprint, and 11 new stores.</p>
          <p>The total number of new stores is now just under 150. The vast majority are delivering double digit growth, as well as a stronger fresh participation and basket growth. We intend to continue to roll out a pace of approximately 100 new stores in the next 12 months, adding up to 2% new net space through a combination of new stores and extensions, and we expect to add an additional 1,300 full time jobs as a result.</p>
          <p>The Berwick store in Melbourne is a very successful pilot of a large format store with significant uplift in non-food sales of both general merchandise and apparel. We expect to land a handful of these bigger stores each year, starting with Burwood in Melbourne in the two weeks' time, which personally will be my favorite of the supermarket so far.</p>
          <p>Team member training is key not only in renewal, but also old stores. Over 50,000 team members participated in training programs to improve customer service and fast and friendly training to improve check-out efficiency and scan rate, and 80,000 received refresher training in food safety.</p>
          <p>I now turn to slide 19. Similar to supermarkets, liquor has a five year turnaround plan which remains very much on track with growth in overall sales continuing. We've seen steady growth in market share over the last three years, and more importantly, not only arrested profit decline, but seen it improve considerably, a trend we expect to see continue.</p>
          <p>The predictable shift towards convenience on the one hand and destination stores on the other has accelerated in the last 12 months, which is why we've seen our strongest performance in our big box stores. However, there are a number of stores we inherited, particularly in Victoria, that are in sub-optimal locations, and over time we will adjust portfolio, just as we are doing in supermarket. We will continue to invest in big box formats with about a dozen due to open this year, and more to follow in FY'13.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 20. Our convenience business, Coles Express, was the quiet achiever this year. Coles and Shell are working well in partnership to grow the business in a very competitive market. The project revitalized a light refurbishment of 450 stores was complete on time, and stock outs were at record lows. We continue to launch our premium fuel V Power in more sites across the network, and new LED price boards are driving greater customer awareness. We've also added 150 new diesel pumps over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>These operational improvements and marketing initiatives, including the double fuel discount, have drove volumes and sales across the network. Despite the market trend away from convenience stores towards supermarkets, we continue to see positive growth in our shop sales, which is encouraging.</p>
          <p>I now turn to Slide 21. In conclusion, I'm very pleased with the results of the turnaround strategy in the last 12 months, and the momentum we are seeing going into FY '12. The strong FY '11 results represent the hard work of over 100,000 team members right across the business, and their commitment to our goal of making Coles a shop that customers increasingly trust to deliver quality service and value.</p>
          <p>Many of the programs we have put in place will continue to grow and expand as we rise to the challenge of expectations of further progress, but we do not expect life to get any easier in the current economic climate, and will therefore continue to implement our turnaround strategy at pace. We take encouragement from our progress made to date, but we are under no illusion as to the extent and scale of what is still to be done to ensure that we establish a solid platform for the growth in the years to come.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it over to John Gillam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. I'll comment firstly on Bunnings, and I'm starting at Slide 24. We were pleased with our performance this year.</p>
          <p>Our long term growth plans were well progressed. Day-to-day trading outcomes were good, and our strategic agenda is generating positive momentum. Looking at the headlines, we had healthy top line growth, sales up 5.7%. Earnings growth was strong with a 10.2% lift in EBIT. Return on capital at 28% is industry leading, and very good given historically high levels of CapEx during the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 25 you can see additional detail on our performance, and as is well known, the first half was impacted by adverse weather, and the second half through a tightening in consumer and building sector activity. In that light, the results are strong. Across the year, we've continued our multi-pronged growth focus. A lot of effort has gone into customer improvements in value, products, and service. Network expansion and existing store re-investment was a key work area, as also was further optimizing our stock flow and our range reset project is the most significant merchandising work we've undertaken for a decade.</p>
          <p>The range reset project is something we've been talking about now since the strategy day in May 2010. One of the positive outcomes you can now see is how it aligns with our long term approach to creating value for customers. I noted with a little surprise a few concerns that were raised following our Q4 sales update about slowing sales and deflation. I'm guessing the positive aspects of our range reset project, coupled with our deliberate approach of lowering prices isn't fully understood, so I'll try and explain it a little better now.</p>
          <p>In many circumstances, price deflation is a negative. That's not the case when it's self-determined and very consciously executed with good assortment planning. Our range reset project started 18 months ago.</p>
          <p>It aims to deliver clear benefits for customers, suppliers and our business. We're now seeing major benefits from that work. For customers, it's breath-taking, there are de-cluttered and easier to shop ranges. We're freeing up space for category expansion. Winning suppliers are enjoying a raft of volume uplift benefits, and we're getting the leading brands by channel at materially lower costs and better training, innovation and marketing support.</p>
          <p>As this work nears completion, our brand offering across all categories has strengthened, and you can get a flavor of that from Slides 11 and 12 in the supplementary pack. For over a decade we've applied the productivity loop thinking in our business and range reset outcomes literally feed that loop. In an environment where consumers are highly value conscious, delivering more value than ever before has obvious rewards.</p>
          <p>We'll continue on this path in the year ahead. There's a mountain of work already done to support more and more value being driven in a manner that's great for customers, and healthy for our business.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in new and existing stores, and as I've said before, we have a great runway of committed longer term development sites in place. In the '09/'10 year we opened 22 trading locations. In the 2010/'11 year, we opened 27 trading locations. So, far this financial year we've already opened three. That's a total of 52 locations opened in 26 months.</p>
          <p>As of today, we have another nine stores under construction, a further 12 store sites where we had DAs in hand, another 14 store sites where DAs have been lodged, and 29 other store sites owned or legally under our control. These numbers will increase.</p>
          <p>The quality and depth of our store pipeline is very exciting. The fact we continue to find, develop and open strong cites is a great capability of the business. We're very comfortable to forecast opening 16 to 26 locations annually for the foreseeable future, and our reinvestment program for existing stores allows us to reinvigorate our network with new merchandising standards and concepts. All of that work led to our capital investment levels reaching $595 million in the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook, and I'm on Slide 26, we expect to deliver continued sales growth in both consumer and commercial areas. There are five clear growth opportunities before us, and our strategic agenda and work plans target each of these.</p>
          <p>If you're unfamiliar with our strategic agenda, please refer to the June 2011 investor presentation. Please also note that we expect CapEx to increase in the year ahead as we complete a number of property developments and invest further in both existing stores and our property pipeline.</p>
          <p>In summary, Bunnings is healthier today than it was a year ago, and we're in a very good position to perform well in the market conditions that lie ahead.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Officeworks result, and I'm now on Slide 27, trading revenue for the year grew to $1.47 billion, an increase of 4.4%. Continued good progress on business effectiveness saw earnings lift 8% to $80.1 million at a slightly improved EBIT margin of 5.4%, which gave ROC a bit of a kick up.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 28, there were a number of highlights. Headlines sales growth across the Officeworks retail network of 5.2% was a positive result, particularly given the deterioration in trading experienced across the second half of the year. Strong transaction growth continued to underpin the headline sales number. Business channel sales benefited as a number of strategic initiatives and a new and expanded team gained traction. That's a pleasing sign for the year ahead.</p>
          <p>During the year, 10 new Officeworks stores were opened, and six stores underwent full store upgrades. A larger number of minor upgrades were also completed across the network. At year end, nearly 40% of the 135 strong Officeworks store network was trading with the new white store format.</p>
          <p>Improved service and an expanded suite of services and solutions is a key plank of future growth for Officeworks. On that front, we've been trialing tech services, office fit outs and have recently launched our online print hub to support the strong growth we're seeing in our in-store print and copy shop.</p>
          <p>Other key achievements in the year included substantial website enhancements, making it easier for customers to research and shop either online or in store. Officeworks has tried it online since 2004. Website reintegration work started in 2008, and online sales continue to grow nicely. Annualized web sales exceed $100 million. Pleasingly, whilst there is very good growth online, we've been now able to continue delivering solid sales growth in store.</p>
          <p>The outlook for Officeworks, Slide 29, is for moderate sales growth in 2011/'12 with competitive pressures on sales and margin expected to continue in challenging market conditions. The current conditions are especially difficult for smaller businesses. Good execution of the strategic agenda by Mark Ward and the Officeworks team should help maintain a positive trajectory on sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>Initiatives to enhance the customer offer remain at the forefront. Investment in expanding and enhancing the store network will also continue. The programs in place to drive B2B performance are exciting, and internally, the focus on lowering cost and increasing effectiveness remains very strong.</p>

          <p>Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone, and if you could please turn to Slide 31. I would now like to take you through Target's performance, which has been a difficult one.</p>
          <p>Our operating revenue decreased by 1.1% to $3.8 billion with the decline in comparable store sales for the full year of 1.2%. However, for the second half of the year, we saw a 1.7% comparable store sales growth, and increased our market share of department stores sales year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Target's earnings before interest and tax was $280 million with an EBIT to sales margin of 7.4%. While we did see customer numbers and unit sales up significantly on last year, margins came under pressure from price devaluation across all categories, in addition to the markdowns that were required to keep the inventory clean and fresh for our customers. This was particularly evident with the clearance of summer apparel as of a result of unseasonably cool weather.</p>
          <p>Sales in intimatewear and homewares delivered positive growth for the year as our customers responded to the quality and value of the in-house designed homewares offering, as well as the expanded range in intimateware apparel. Our key categories of childrenswear and baby related products also had positive growth, while ladiesware had a marginal decrease as Mom made the most of her existing wardrobe and focused on her family needs.</p>
          <p>Sales of electrical items declined compared to previous years with a significant decline in demand for CDs, DVDs and interactive toys. We have continued to invest in new opportunities, however, with the launch of our online store in February. The initial range of baby and nursery products has now been expanded to include kids clothing, schoolware and a range homewares.</p>
          <p>Customer response has been very encouraging with traffic continuing to increase, and we have received positive feedback regarding the site's ease of use. Already the online store is generating the equivalent sales of a medium to large Target Country store, and we will continue to add further ranges with a number due online before Christmas.</p>
          <p>Our bricks and mortar also received investment with three new stores opened in the past year, including a Target store at Belconnen and Target Country at Port Douglas. We also refurbished 65 stores, predominantly Target Country, to improve the shopping experience for our customers and team members.</p>
          <p>There is no question that trading has been volatile with customers cautious in their discretionary spend. Expense and capital management will be a key focus as we see this challenging and competitive trading environment continuing this year, which will place pressure on margins and comparable store growth.</p>
          <p>However, having said that, we will continue to explore alternative ways of reaching our customers and providing them with an enhanced shopping experience. This includes our online store, as well as social media and a new inner-city format, Urban by Target, which opens in Chapel Street later this month. Additional network expansion is planned with approximately 10 net new stores, and 20 to 30 refurbishments to be completed this financial year.</p>
          <p>Finally in a tough competitive landscape, we are focused on the customer. It is all about ensuring that we continue to deliver on-trend product at prices 20% to 30% less than specialty stores and department stores. It is also about presenting this merchandise so that the customer has a good shopping experience, and Target maintains a differentiated leadership position and product.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Launa, and I start on Page &#x2013; Slide 35. So, Kmart's revenue for 2011 increased by 0.4%, just over $4 billion with comparable store sales growth for the 52 weeks just around 0.3%.</p>
          <p>The profit was up $11 million to $201 million, with an increase of 5.8% on the previous year. Return on capital was 23.6%, up from 21.8% in 2010, and we had a very pleasing result with lost time injury dropping from 9.1% to 6.8%.</p>
          <p>On the full year sales result, the subdued growth was probably characterized by two main elements. One, while customer transactions and volumes continue to grow throughout the year with customers responding very well to our everyday low prices, this was offset, once again, by our reduced prices. And secondly in 2011, we were fully operating under an everyday low price model so where categories such as apparel, toys and home performed well during the year, other categories, such as entertainment, barbeque and outdoor that have traditionally performed well during either promotional events or heavy discount periods, declined on the previous year.</p>
          <p>On a positive note, earnings growth was solid, and this was achieved through a combination of product sourcing improvement and in reductions in cost of doing business. In addition, our customers continue to respond well to our everyday low prices, and this is particularly evidenced by our continued growth in unit volumes and strong customer transaction.</p>
          <p>Slide 36. As was mentioned, highlights for the year include earnings growth which was solid, and underpinned by product sourcing improvements and continued reductions in the cost of doing business. The underlying customer metrics remain strong with unit volumes and customer transactions growing consistently throughout the year. This was particularly pleasing in the second half as we circled last year's strong growth.</p>
          <p>We have now circled a full year of operating under the everyday low price model, and are therefore now well positioned to leverage off the learnings of this year, in particular with respect to volume quantification. Investment in the fleet continued with basics such as floors and fitting room replacements which this program is now largely complete.</p>
          <p>In addition, we completed a further five store refurbishment throughout the year. Finally, John Sink and his team at Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto continues to perform well for us with solid sales growth for the year, underpinned by its refined offer aimed at growing customer services.</p>
          <p>On outlook on Slide 37. On outlook, our immediate priority is to connect even more customers with the new Kmart. We believe customers have not yet taken full advantage of Kmart's everyday low prices offer across the entire store. We believe the opportunity exists for Kmart to better communicate its low price strategy.</p>
          <p>It is our goal to demonstrate just how irresistibly low our process had become, and we will continue to refine our offer to ensure that we have the right products for the right price across all of our stores for our families' everyday needs.</p>
          <p>Our goal is also to improve our operating model efficiency, and by that I mean maximizing the efficiency of product flow by being as efficient as we can across the entire supply chain network from factory to shelf, by having stock on show and available for sale at all times of the day and being efficient in store execution. Opportunities still remain in sourcing product for the newly established Kmart Australian sourcing. We will continue to invest in new networks, and in particular, the opening of new stores.</p>
          <p>We truly believe Australian families are very conscious of cost pressures that they face, and we at Kmart are committed to providing them with the value on everyday items that they really need. Today we are a new Kmart. Our prices are irresistibly low. Our products are on trend, and they are of high quality.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Guy. I'll start with a performance summary on Page 39. Last year we grew revenue by 2.4% to $1.74 billion. In line with previous guidance, divisional EBITA decreased by 77% to $30 million. This decrease was directly attributable to the unprecedented level of natural disaster claims in Australia and New Zealand, and cost associated with reinstating reinsurance following these events. Our insurance brokering operations achieved growth and earnings of 5.1%, $52 million, with a profit margin of 27.5%.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the highlights on Page 40. The impact of the catastrophe events and additional reinsurance costs of the year is highlighted in the supplementary material on Slide 26. This shows the impact of catastrophe claims over allowances of $71 million, the additional cost of reinsurance reinstatements of $39 million and our liability adequacy test charge of $32 million reflecting, increasing reinsurance cost and change in our program structure from the 1 of July 2011.</p>
          <p>Notable claims events for the last year included three major Christchurch earthquakes in September, February and June, the Brisbane flood, Cyclone Yasi and fierce storms in WA associated with Cyclone Bianca. Although these events resulted in underwriting losses for the year, we are very proud of the operational response of our teams to helping our clients in their time of need, and managing claims as efficiently as possible.</p>
          <p>Looking through these cat events, this year we achieved a number of key milestones. We continued to deliver underlying improvements in underwriting performance. We've had good traction with new growth initiatives, such as Lumley's EDI business and Coles Insurance, the acquisition of FMR Risk in New Zealand and strong growth in insurance premium funding.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the outlook on Slide 41. As we advised the market last month, the cost associated with reinsurance in 2012 have increased significantly. Given the way premiums are earned through our profit and loss, we expect that it will take more than one year to recoup these costs through premium rate increases and other initiatives.</p>
          <p>In recent months we've achieved positive rate increases in clauses such as New Zealand property and earthquake and Australian property and business insurance. However, classes such as liability, CI and commercial motor continue to remain quite competitive.</p>
          <p>In terms of earnings outlook, referring back to the normalization earnings chart for 2011, we think that it will be in the order of $30 million of additional reinsurance cost and allowances to weather events in 2012 that we will be unable to fully recover from premium rate increases this year. We will have a better sense of this in the coming months, and it is obviously subject to changes in the premium rate environment.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we will continue to capitalize on the strong customer response we've received from new growth initiatives. By a way of example. This week we launched with Coles a new campaign for Melbourne motorists providing significant savings on quality car insurance with added benefits, such as roadside assist.</p>
          <p>Our broking operations will benefit from recent acquisitions, such as FMR and higher revenues as premium rates harden. Since June, OAMPS has completed two small bolt-on acquisitions which will contribute another $2 million of EBIT this year. The recent fall in investment yield is something we are watching, as this may affect investment returns year ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I'll refer you to Slide 43. Earnings before interest and tax at $369 million is up 124% on last year's EBIT of $165 million. This increase in EBIT was due to higher export coal prices, lower Stanwell royalty expenses, and no hedge rate losses when compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The increase in EBIT was offset by lower metallurgical coal sales down approximately 20% on last year, plus higher costs, both as a result of major rainfall and flooding, particularly in the January &#x2013; December and January period at our Curragh mine.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our lost time injury frequency rate at 1.3 is significantly lower than last year due to our continued commitment to creating an injury-free workplace.</p>
          <p>Now I'll refer you to Slide 44. The Resources division highlights for the year include ongoing production recovery at Curragh from adverse weather-related events. And as previously reported, Curragh experienced a significant reduction in coal production for the year as a direct result of record rainfall, major flooding and ground water inflows into the mining areas with consequential increase in mine operating costs.</p>
          <p>Another highlight for the year is record export prices were achieved in the final quarter for FY '11 for both metallurgical coal and steaming coal. At the same time, the Australian dollar rose to new record levels.</p>
          <p>We continue to experience strong global demand for coal. The Curragh $286 million expansion to 8 million to 8.5 million tonnes of export metallurgical coal is underway with completed expected during Q1 calendar year 2012.</p>
          <p>I now refer you to Slide 45. Call outs for our Bengalla mine include a 14% increase in sales volume for 2010/'11 on strong export demand. As announced in November 2010, progress is continuing on stage 1 expansion to 7.5 million tonnes per annum. Completion of this expansion is expected in Q1 calendar year 2012.</p>
          <p>Premier's highlights include a 37% increase in sales volume, reflecting increased demand from Verve Energy, and the movement to a sale supply to Verve from July 2010. A strategic review of the Premier mine was initiated in March this year to consider a range of options, including a sale process.</p>
          <p>I now refer you to Slide 46. Looking at our outlook for the division, September quarterly price negotiations were completed with a 10% decrease in Curragh's metallurgical coal prices compared to the June quarter result. Curragh continues to have strong shipping performance from our traditional customers.</p>
          <p>We are experiencing a re-emergence of tight labor market and industry cost pressures, which will impact us moving forward. Curragh's metallurgical coal sales is forecasted to be in the range of 6.8 million to 7.2 million tonnes for this coming financial year, and the full year sales mix is expected to be approximately 46% hard coking coal, 22% semi-hard and 32% PCI. This is a significant improvement on last year's sales mix.</p>
          <p>The Stanwell royalty is expected to be in the range of $195 million to $210 for the full year. Looking forward to this year, mine expansions are underway at both Curragh and Bengalla, and are due for completion in Q1 calendar year 2012 and next stage expansion studies are continuing.</p>
          <p>I now hand over to Tom O'Leary from Chemicals, Energy &amp; Fertilizers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stewart. Earnings were higher than last year at $283 million, which included $42 million in insurance proceeds from the Varanus Island gas disruption back in June 2008. Excluding those, earnings grew 26% largely due to a return to profitability of the Fertilizers business.</p>
          <p>It's worth remembering, though, that in the previous year the Fertilizers business in incurred a write-down in inventory of $25 million, but it also suffered from depressed margins for most of the year as it sold through highly priced inventory.</p>
          <p>Return on capital also increased, and excluding insurance proceeds, return on capital was 18.5%. Disappointingly, we've seen an increase in our lost time injury frequency rate. However, the division's applied more resources in this area, and we've seen some improvements, including a reduction in our total recordable injury frequency rate. That measure tracks a much broader categorization of injuries, and so the improvement is encouraging, and I expect further improvements in all safety indicators over time.</p>
          <p>Turning to highlights. The Chemicals business continued to see solid demand for its products, particularly those associated with resources, and had good production results as well. Offsetting this, though, was some increased gas input cost into the sodium cyanide business, and at Australian Vinyls, continued lowest spreads between PVC and VCM pricing, and that depressed earnings from the business. The higher Australian dollar also negatively affected both these businesses.</p>
          <p>You'll have seen the major announcement we made back in June regarding our proposed $550 million ammonium nitrate expansion when we received approval toward a long-lead time item. In addition, last month the Environmental Protection Authority released its report and recommendation to the minister. We don't expect those approvals will delay the project timetable, and we're still targeting commissioning in the first quarter of calendar 2014.</p>
          <p>Turning to Kleenheat. Production from the Kwinana LPG plant was lower due to lower LPG content into Dampier Bunbury gas pipeline, and that resulted in lower export sales. The business was also affected by increased gas input cost for much of the year. Offsetting those negatives, though, is a higher Saudi CP price even when converted into Australian dollars, higher domestic LPG sales tonnes and some cost reductions.</p>
          <p>While LNG earnings were in line with last year, good progress is being made on the American Power Group LNG engine trials, and once these are complete, we expect sales will follow. Our covered fertilizers, though, going to our smaller businesses, in enGen and our 40% interest in Air Liquide, West Australia, earnings were ahead of last year. On the sale of enGen, we expect to book a pre-tax profit on the sale of approximately $40 million in our first half results.</p>
          <p>Turning to outlook. We expect strong demand for our chemicals products servicing the resources sector, however we'll have the impact of a 35 day 3 yearly shutdown of our ammonia plant in November, and that will reduce earnings by around $15 million.</p>
          <p>We expect to get back to the board on the ammonia nitrate expansion project later this year, and in Kleenheat we're going to face some headwinds this year and beyond. That business will feel the impact of a full year of increased gas input costs, and new higher gas transport cost in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>LPG content in the pipeline has in recent times trended lower, and if that continues, it will have a negative impact on LPG production and earnings. Consequently, we expect earnings from that business to be $25 million to $30 million lower this year.</p>
          <p>In Fertilizers, we're off to a good start with some good range in Western Australia in recent months, but in terms of outlook, full year earnings still depend on weather conditions for the rest of the calendar year to seeing a good harvest, the seasonal break in the second half and the terms of trade for farmers.</p>

      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. I will now cover the Industry and Safety division, starting on Slide 52. The division is reporting inclusive of Coregas in 2011, and last year has been restated accordingly.</p>
          <p>The division delivered a strong result in the year, benefiting from the resurgence in the resources sector, major project activity and continuing improvements in business operation. Our operating revenues for the year of $1.56 billion were up 10.3% on last year, and pleasingly, sales growth was achieved in all business segment.</p>
          <p>Our earnings before interest and tax increased by 20.3% to $166 million, reflecting earnings improvements in all business units. And return on capital increased from 10.5% to 13.1%, thanks to the higher EBIT result, but also coupled with strong capital management across the division.</p>
          <p>On Slide 53, some of the key highlights in the year included certain improved business portfolio performance. As I said, all businesses achieved sales growth this year with the best results being achieved by Blackwood, Protector Alsafe and Bullivants. Coregas also achieved good sales growth as a result of strengthening the sales teams, the business restructure and the benefit of collaboration with other businesses in the division and the New Zealand business's further improvement, despite the impact of a subdued New Zealand economy, and the Christchurch earthquake.</p>
          <p>Early in the year, we also divested Motion Industry, and merged Blackwoods Paykels &amp; Protector Safety in New Zealand and finally, a small gas detection business that was acquired in New Zealand. The solid sales momentum was supported by wise expansion, strong growth in service fees, as well as a significant increase in eBusiness transactions with customers.</p>
          <p>The division's international supply chain capability continued to improve with the opening of a multi-country consolidation distribution centre in Shenzhen, Southern China, early in the year. Supply chain improvements also resulted from technology investments, and ongoing upgrades to our branch network. We have also continued our operating and capital management focus, as well as our commitment to safety, sustainability and employee development.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the outlook for the division on Slide 54. The operational improvements that have been implemented have positioned the division well to support customer growth in key masthead sectors, although next year, the division is expected to continue to benefit from project activity of major mining and oil and gas projects, and the ongoing diversification of its customer base.</p>
          <p>We will also continues to target acquisition opportunities to complement organic growth. This being said, cost pressures I expect it will increase work cost retention challenges, especially in resource related areas and ongoing competitive margin pressure. Overall, while the outlook is uncertain for a number of non-resources sectors in New Zealand, it remains positive and we had an encouraging start to the year.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now hand over to Terry Bowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Olivier. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll now just cover off the group's other business activities, as well as key elements to their capital management activities during the year.</p>
          <p>So, I'm on Slide 56. You can see here the performance of our associate businesses was a loss of $33 million for the year, and this result was primarily due to noncash downward revaluations recorded by our Gresham Private Equity Fund investment, which totaled $60 million loss for the year compared to the previous period's $43 million gain.</p>
          <p>Just to remind everyone, the downward revaluations in Gresham reflect not only a combination of earnings in that year, but importantly, valuations which have confected in this year, and obviously impacted the carrying value. The importance of this is the investments under these accounting standards are required to be valued on this basis. This brings about a lot of volatility from period to period, and importantly, this is noncash in nature. But looking forward to the other areas of other business, we had $19 million gain recorded by Bunning &#x2013; BWP Trust, and earnings of $7 million for Wespine.</p>
          <p>Interest revenue of $38 million was down on last year. This reflected lower cash on deposits throughout the year as we used the cash that we previously had on deposit to reduce our debt levels once we put in the new re-drawable debt facilities in place from December.</p>
          <p>We had non non-trading items this year recorded in the group because we've included Coles' property surplus lease provisions this year in its divisional result. In other we recorded a loss of $41 million. That's primarily related to increasing claims cost from the group's self insurance program at a corporate level.</p>
          <p>Group overheads for the year were $102 million. This included $6 million in donations, which we made in respect to the Queensland floods, the New Zealand earthquakes to assist with relief efforts after these tragic events.</p>
          <p>Moving now to capital management on our working capital performance on Slide 57. As at year end, the group had $149 million increase in working capital compared to the last year net of insurance movements, and this increase was predominantly driven the retail divisions.</p>
          <p>Inventory levels at balance date were higher than the previous year due to sales and network growth in the mine and the retail businesses, as well as some increased stock investment as we implemented some new strategic initiatives. HI improvement's growing store network and sales growth accounted for the higher inventory levels in this business.</p>
          <p>In Coles, late in the second half we temporarily increased safety stock levels in key products in preparation with the supply changes in that businesses, specifically easy warehousing. This combined with an increase in net sales and also a continuing move to centralized delivery of a number of key lines, like milk and chips also led to higher stock balances in Coles. But pleasingly in Coles we've continued to see very strong improvement in the reduction of its net working capital days over the year.</p>
          <p>Kmart's inventory increased as it effectively doubled its direct sourcing program, and this resulted in higher level of goods in transit in this business. Cash from moving in payables increased due to additional inventory purchases in supply terms. However, it was moderated compared to last year's. We're not able to repeat the substantial reset that work we undertook last year, particularly in Kmart, and the effect of the increased direct sourcing in Kmart on supply chain.</p>
          <p>As outlined at the first half, receivables increased during the year. This has occurred as a result of the growth in the Insurance &#x2013; the Insurance division's premium funding business, and also consolidating settlement terms across to Coles Switch.</p>
          <p>The net cash movement of the Insurance asset standings claims and unearned premium liabilities for the year was an inflow of $114 million compared to $1 million last year. We have provided further information for people on the group's balance sheet in the supplementary pack, and I'll refer you to that.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Slide 58. Despite higher investment and working capital, the cash realization for the group, as Richard said, remained solid above 100% with operating cash flows for the year of $2.9 billion. The graph at the bottom of this slide shows that over the past three years the group's operating cash flows will have broadly financed all the dividends, plus our investing activities in a period where we've seen a strong phase of growth capital investment underway, and also in a period where we've continually neutralized the dividend reinvestment plan.</p>
          <p>Slide 59 shows that during the year the group invested $2.1 million in capital expenditure with $642 million of this in land and buildings related to retail network expansion. This year's investment being $406 million ahead of last year was really reflected accelerating store network growth, particularly in Bunnings and the expansion work underway in our Resources division. All retail businesses, though, continued to invest in store infrastructure, and this included, as Ian said, the renewal of 94 stores in Coles.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure during the year was partially offset by $216 million in proceeds from the disposal of property, in particular, primarily from the sale and leaseback of a number of Bunnings warehouses. Looking forward to next year, we anticipate a continuation of this strong capital investment phase that the group is currently in, and we forecast our gross capital expenditure at this stage to be between $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Importantly, this current phase of strong capital investment is expected to strengthen the group's future financial performance for years to come. The estimate includes store network expansion in all of our retail businesses, and again, particularly in Coles and Bunnings, as well as the production capacity increases in Curragh and Bengalla and CSBP's ammonium nitrate operations, assuming board approval.</p>
          <p>We will, as usual, update people on the estimate as the year progresses, and also provide details of any property sales that we may make during the year as we actively manage the group's cash flow and return on capital.</p>
          <p>Slide 60 shows the group's balance sheet, and it's strong with all key liquidity indicators continuing to improve. The group's strengthening credit metrics and outlook resulted in an improvement during the year with S&amp;P &#x2013; in our ratings with S&amp;P upgrading our rating from BBB plus to A minus with a stable outlook, and Moody's upgrading the group to a positive outlook in its rating.</p>
          <p>And as Richard mentioned, the directors have declared a final dividend of $0.85 fully franked, taking the full year dividend to $1.50, 20% ahead of last year's dividend, and providing a payout ratio for the year of 90%. Given that a number of the group's shareholders value the dividend reinvestment plan, we'll again offer this option.</p>
          <p>As has been our recent practice, the group will acquire the required level number of shares on market to neutralize any dilutionary effect of the shares issued under the &#x2013; no discount will apply to the allocation price, and the program will not be underwritten. Shares will be transferred to those shareholders that elect to participate on 30 of September.</p>
          <p>Turning now to debt, the group's debt financing on Slide 61. Gross debt at the end of the year was $4.9 billion with net debt of $4.3 billion, and the group also had $2 billion in committed, but undrawn facilities to support its liquidity position.</p>
          <p>During the year, the group continued to proactively diversify its funding sources and lengthen its debt maturity profile with the establishment of a new $2.5 billion revolving debt facility, and the issue of a $650 million U.S. five year bond. The all-in weighted average cost of debt of the group for the year was 8.8%, and the guidance for next year is in the range of 8% to 8.2%. The decrease reflects the benefits of the refinancing work that we've been undertaking in recent years, as well as the expiry of a number of interest rates swaps that were put in place prior to the GFC. 59% of our debt remains hedged through to June 2012.</p>
          <p>On Slide 62, the chart shows the group's debt maturity profile incorporating the positive impact of the new debt issuances during the year. The average tenure of our drawn debt was extended to three years, and importantly, the group has less than $1.4 billion of debt maturing in any one year, and no short term debt maturity concern. The chart to the right of this slide shows the current board diversification of debt sources, including the new debt facilities put in place during the year, which have further reduced our re-financings.</p>
          <p>On slide 63, I just want to touch on the group's partially protected shares, given that the lapse date of these shares will occur in coming month. The lapse date for the share is November the 23, 2011. However, the directors have the right to extend this lapse date for a further 12 month or up to 4 times in the event that the S&amp;P AXS 200 industrial index, which is the XNJ index is less than 6,500 at the close of trading for each day during a two-month period prior to the lapse date.</p>
          <p>As at the market close yesterday, the XNJ was trading 3,437, obviously well below 6,500 and I can advise that it would be the directors' intention to extend the lapse date for 12 months should these conditions be met at the 23 of November, 2011.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand back to Richard.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Terry. And finally on outlook, the last two slides, just some brief comments because most of the divisional MDs have talked about outlook.</p>
          <p>Our group view is reasonably positive on the outlook, subject obviously, to any further fallout from a fragile global economy, weather events or commodity prices downward movement. But we've got the turnaround businesses of Coles, Kmart and Officeworks where we've still got significant scope to improve performance in each of those businesses.</p>
          <p>We continued investment in Bunnings and Target, and we're optimistic about performance of those businesses, an opportunity in Insurance that Rob's talked about. In Resources, expansion, plus commodity prices and when the Industrial businesses and their exposure to the resources sector, as I said, we feel quite positive in terms of the outlook.</p>
          <p>And longer-term, as Terry mentioned, a significant phase of capital investment going on which will equip the business well for the long-term. And supporting that, we've got in each of the businesses, as I said earlier, strong management teams focused on delivering value for shareholders, and all our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>So, with that, hopefully that presentation which was reasonably lengthy, but provided some information that you wanted. We'll hand over to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on Resources. Can you just talk a bit about the inclusion of a hedge benefit I think of $134 million in second half '11; are there any hedge benefits that are likely to positively impact Resources in fiscal '12? And just comment on the confidence about underlying cost increases in resources of 10% to 15% please, which was made at the end of the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look, I think I'll refer you the hedge slide in the supporting pack under &#x2013; let me just find the number for you &#x2013; Slide 36 in the supplementary pack, which gives you a pretty good indication of what our hedge position is for the next 12 months. So, I think that should be taken into account in terms of our future earnings. What was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>The cost, okay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Cost you said on an underlying basis year round 10% to 15% through the year. <mark type="indiscernible" /> have another 10% to 15% cost increases in fiscal '12. Is that still the case or is that a little conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think where we sit with cost, as we reported today, costs for last year were up by about 46%, and I alluded to that back at the June investor update. And really the key contributing factor there was the record rainfall and the flooding that we had at Curragh, which resulted in our production, met coal production coming off around 20%, and we had significant additional costs associated with dealing with the rainfall and flooding, not the least of which was addition truck and shovel pumping, re-establishment of pit accesses, the ongoing level phase we had particularly in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>But looking at I suppose the underlying cost for last year, while they went up 46%, we see the underlying costs went up by somewhere in the range of 10% to 15%, and as I also indicated in one of the earlier slides, we'll continue to see cost pressures as we move forward with the resources industry the way it is at the moment in terms of the tightness of the labor market and the increased costs that are coming through. So, we expect similar sort of numbers to flow through into this financial year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just a second question in regards to Coles. Can you just, Terry, just the value of the meat contract? And then for Ian, has the company moved to a stage where there's been sufficient investment in store such that the strong comp growth really does drive quite material underlying EBIT margin expansion going forward now that you've invested enough in store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking the meat or just onerous contract first, Cole, 66 and then we've got an offset through discount unwinding of 23, so net growth 43.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the investment in stores, I don't think we're finished with that, Shaun. I think there's still more to be done, both in terms of investment infrastructure and investment in price, so we still see that continue. I also don't think we've got to the bottom of improving our overall efficiency and lowering costs of doing business. So, still expect EBIT margins to grow over time, but our focus is still about driving sales and generating higher levels of consumer confidence through our pricing strategy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My question on coal, if I can. Stewart, you've got a big increase in tonnes from 5.3 tonnes to 6.8 tonnes to 7.2 tonnes this year. What's the &#x2013; how are the mines going at the moment? I mean, I think in June, you still had some water leaking in from the pits. How are you going there? Are you over the worst of it? Or is it still likely to be suffering from the floods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, good question, David, and thanks for that. Look, when we spoke back in June, sort of we were experiencing some significant level of failures. We're starting to see the frequency of those failures reduce. We've had no significant rainfall since May, so we're not adding to the problem, and we are now starting to see production levels returning to normal.</p>
          <p>In saying that, we see that we're in a phase of rebuilding stocks. During the second half of last year, we ran down all our stocks across site. But at this stage, our guidance remains in that 6.8 million tonnes to 7.2 million tonnes for this current financial year. And if you compare that to what we achieved back in 2009 and 2010 where we had 6.6 million tonnes for that year, it's not a big uplift from that previous level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And nothing is happening at the moment that causes you concern at this point? You're getting back on track now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're getting back on track. I'll always have the qualification that wet weather can strike again, David, but we are starting to see some significant improvement in production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Stewart, on your pricing, I think in the third quarter you were at $US221 per tonne for your hard coking, and then it jumped to $US328 per tonne for the fourth quarter. I think in April you said that &#x2013; I think you were expecting to do about that 1.9 million tonnes for the fourth quarter, and I think you stated in April that you were expecting about 50% of that to be sold at the higher fourth quarter price, and around about 50% to basically flow through from the lower price.</p>
          <p>In other words, third quarter price to go into the fourth quarter price. I think the fourth quarter you only did about 1.2 million tonnes or thereabouts. Is it fair to say then that in this fourth quarter you didn't sell much at that higher price and going forward what can we expect in terms of the prices released? Does that mean that the tonnes that you didn't deliver in fourth quarter, you will deliver in first quarter at that high price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I gave the price in the press release I gave at the end of the June, David, that said that the coal prices were coming off 10%...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the met coal price, and indicated I think $US310 per tonne for the hard coking coal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And also I gave a guidance there in terms of approximately a third of this current quarter would be at Q4, 2011 pricing. So, it would be one-third at the old price and two-thirds at the new price.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't started negotiations for the next quarter pricing. Volume and pricing will be discussed at those negotiations, David.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Phil Kimber of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question maybe for Terry on the D&amp;A in the Coles business. It was flat, and yet CapEx is pretty well doubled that. I just wanted to get a sense of why the differentials and the outlook going forward. Should we assume that D&amp;A in the food and liquor business is going to push up towards the CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil. I think we covered this partly at the half as well. So, the CapEx, as you can appreciate, you've always got new assets going on the register and assets coming off, so you can get some lumpy timing periods, depending on what's being fully depreciated. As we mentioned as well, a lot of the CapEx in Coles there's been some buildings, which you wouldn't expect to drive depreciation, and there's a bit of WIP as well.</p>
          <p>We also mentioned that when we inherited Coles, like a lot of things, the asset register was a mess. So, that took us a couple of years with a big team to get on top of that. That resulted in some asset write offs, which stopped a bit, but also some reclassifications which had a small timing &#x2013; relative to look-back it had some small timing effects. If we look forward, your anticipation should be in Coles that depreciation increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But it should...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It will be subject to land and buildings, obviously, and the amount of WIP, but going forward, the expectation is that you'd expect to see depreciation in Coles increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my second question really related to the dividend. A strong payout there, and stronger than last year, but also particularly in the second half. Net debt went up a little bit this year, and I know that's sort of been your philosophy behind dividends in terms of being able basically keeping net debt levels flat. Next year, you have a big step-up in CapEx. How should we think about that payout ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Group dividend policy seeks to deliver stable and growing dividends over the time, and that's really subject to the current and projected cash flows, and projected being important profit generation and the availability of our franking credit. And we obviously recognize there's always a benefit of getting franking credit to shareholders <mark type="indiscernible" />. So, what we do is we look through the cycle, and we do that to really avoid volatility and ensure sustainability as best as possible with the dividend.</p>
          <p>So, if we look at the current dividend, I think when you look back in the last three years, there's a clear looking through the cycle where we've had a couple of years where we didn't pay out free cash flows, and then obviously, this year is a bigger payment where you have gone into some of those previous years' gains. If we look forward, we know we're in a high CapEx space at the moment. But we wouldn't expect that to continue at those kind of high-ish levels that we're in at the moment. This is a real phase. That should deliver returns going forward, so we'll look through the cycle again, and I think I've guided towards the stable and growing dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil, I mean if you think about it. If we did an acquisition of a business of say $2 billion, we'd take some part of that, and this is no different. Over the next 12 months we've got around $3 billion of CapEx. A lot of that is growth CapEx in the business, and we'll look at the factors Terry mentioned, but as you think it, think about steady and stable and growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Afternoon, all. Just a question on the CapEx number. It's a big step up. Is that mostly property in the increase there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're expecting higher property than as John has mentioned, he's accelerating. We'd expect Coles to accelerate on the work that they've done on their property pipeline, and we've got a bit more in that we're expecting in the other retail businesses as well.</p>
          <p>But then if you look at the bigger areas, obviously, with a lot of the rain that's affected the Curragh expansion, so we're going to complete the Curragh expansion this year. We've got Bengalla to finish off. It also does assume at this stage in that number that we get approval from the board for the ammonia nitrate expansion, so that would be an adjustment. And then we always give ourselves a bit of a buffer on land as well, so that's how you should think about the increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of selling off property, I mean you only did $200 million this year. How much clarity do you have on selling property down the line? Because I would have thought that returns are going to come under pressure as you invest in property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's part &#x2013; a lot of the land and buildings we are holding is with Bunnings, I'll also let John add to this, but I think what we would do as a group is make sure that we're not &#x2013; not being hasty in terms of exiting property. We exit at the right time when the development of that property has maximized the returns for the group, and we also make sure that the market conditions are appropriate to be putting the property into. So, I think that's the way we think about it, but I don't know if John wants to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Just to reinforce to what Terry said, acquiring the right site, getting it a great position and then financing it correctly is what our long term position has been. So, we use sale and lease back with very strong characteristics to give us what we need over time, and so this year as we sit now, we see conditions that would say to us, maybe a couple of hundred million would be what we'd do. If the conditions are better, we might do more and we'll just keep you updated throughout the year. Probably by the half we'll be able to give a pretty good picture of what we think will occur. But a couple of hundred million would be a decent stab at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And just a question on retail generally. A few businesses are saying that June, July and August were very weak. Have you seen that across your retail businesses?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got a number of retail businesses, obviously, so that momentum that we've had in Coles has continued through that period, and Bunnings has been pretty good as well. And we find daily fluctuations around weather and a whole bunch of things. It's been more mixed in Target and Kmart over that period, and June was certainly softer in the last quarter than the first two months in that quarter. July has been okay I'd say.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to clarify something in relation to the cost per tonne for Resources. Obviously, the costs have increased because you've had to deal with the weather events. Should we expect once the weather has normalized that those costs will come down, and then start growing by the 10% to 15%? Or is this the base that they'll grow from current?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your assumption is quite right. I think as we wash through the impact of the rainfall and floods, we'll get back to the underlying cost increases, and I gave you some guidance on that of 10% to 15%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on Coles and just trying to understand the progress of the cost out now versus your expectations and whether the view is that the cost out will be more, say, back end loaded, given the easy ordering and the warehousing that is coming up. And I know you don't &#x2013; this isn't sort of a hard that you to talk anymore, but I think historically, you talked about when you first acquired the business, talked about $450 million of cost out opportunities. Can you just give us a bit of a feel for timing of cost out, whether it is going to be back-end loaded and maybe relative to that $450 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're heading close to that overall. Now if you look at some of the changes that we've made particularly in stock loss waste and markdowns. But I mean, the programs have still got a potential to come through in relation to improvements in productivity in stores and improvements in cost management across the business, particularly end-to-end through the supply chain, there is still further benefits to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it more back loaded, given you're obviously &#x2013; the initial phases of the turnaround was around getting customers back into the store, and now it's all...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you've seen come through and the first couple of years were very much sales driven and it still is. But you've got to start to develop programs and then start to move the benefit. So, it has taken us a couple of years to get easy ordering completed. That's then leaving us opportunities now to kind of proactively move forward to get better line of sight on demand planning with our suppliers through our Easy Warehousing initiative and therefore we would expect further cost benefits to come out of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one for Launa as well, just on Target. The margin pressure obviously, Target has phenomenal margins, but are relative on the discount department store side of things. But do you think what we're seeing at the moment is more just a normalization back to where margins should trend over time, given the competitive environment, and is there the feeling that maybe the medium term margins for Target more in the 5% to 6% versus sort of the 8%, 9%, 10% you've been achieving over the last few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you just repeat that last sentence again? I didn't get that about 5% and 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, do you think that we're now sort of going to see margins normalizing sort of closer to this 5% to 6% type range versus where it's been historically, in sort of the high singles, low double-digit range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think let's kind of talk on pricing first. We &#x2013; all retailing when it comes to kind of general merchandise and apparel is experiencing deflation, whether it be the top-end department stores or the bottom end stores. And as such, we are as well and we are all endeavoring, in fact, to keep our prices down so that we can really service the customer well.</p>
          <p>So, do I think that those are going to normalize? I think what we are seeing now to an extent is an element of normality. Where we are with our EBIT margin of about 7.4%. That probably is realistic at the moment between that and 8% and as a general merchandise type store selling apparel, that is a good result still. But there is going to still continue to be a lot of focus on price.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, just a question with regards to food and the food and liquor business in particular. After four halves of now sequential margin expansion, I was wondering if it's time to start to raise the eyes a little bit and look at your major competitor? I was wondering if you could sort of make any comment around whether or not there was a structural impediment to the Coles business achieving margins that were more in line with where Woolworths is at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we said all along is that this is about Coles versus Coles. I mean, the EBIT margins when we first acquired the business were under 3% and we have expanded that to over 4% and we expect to see further expansion continue. That's part of the overall plan and it's about the delivery of incremental profit growth year-on-year and that's, again, the third part of the plan. We expect to see that continue. What you have to do is recognize it's not just about gross margin expansion. It's about reinvestment and price to deliver value, so our consumers are getting more foot traffic through the door. So, we've got an internal plan on how we expect to see that expand, but I am not going to comment on what competitors may or may not be achieving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I guess in terms of a structural difference then, obviously, there's a good scale, but outside of that, no comment, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Clearly, the things we were talking about previously in terms of changing the infrastructure in the stores, improving our overall efficiencies both in the stores and through the supply chain. There's still a resolute determination to see further progress come through there. But we are looking at reinvesting a number of those benefits back into price for the customers' benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a question on the CapEx. Obviously, it's been touched on a fair bit in the &#x2013; the stick out on this seems to be creating a little bit of a surprise. Is there any comments that you can make in terms &#x2013; or want to make in terms of return on capital for the incremental CapEx going in, that perhaps gives us an ability to feel more comfortable with the amount and the quantum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to say I feel very comfortable with the amount, because it shows we are investing in the business and because of the disciplines we have in place and have in place for a long time in the group to approve any capital expenditure. So, we have got &#x2013; we have our hurdle rates. We do discounted cash flow analysis on any capital investment and I'd have to say on most of the capital expenditures that I have signed off in recent times, we have been well in excess of our hurdle rates in terms of expected returns from the investment side. I think this is good for all of the businesses and it will underpin growth in the group going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Second question regarding Target, just following from an earlier one. I guess &#x2013; I'm just trying to understand the extent to which the additional markdown expense in the second half might have really impacted things, because the EBIT the second half on Target was $70 million, down from $100 million, the ECP, and higher than that obviously second half '09. So, any light you could shed on that would probably be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, as you know, we had a very disappointing November and December, but unfortunately, the stock had already been bought and there was very little we could do about it and some of it, as I said earlier on, could have probably been &#x2013; we didn't do the best of buys. But there was also aggravating circumstances, particularly with the weather, where a lot of seasonal product like swimwear and beach towels, et cetera, doesn't sell due to the unseasonably cold summer.</p>
          <p>Now that merchandise had to be marked down in January, February, and March, because it's very much our policy that we really do clean up our product. That's one of the things that we are absolutely strict about, is seasonal product needs to be marked down and cleared, so we can start the next season clean. And we have a very large proportion of our business is seasonal, because we are a fashion business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so should we interpret that delta, $100 million to $70 million as mainly markdown, or a small proportion is markdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a combination of both, because we didn't get the sales, you also didn't get profit in the first half, because you are not selling the better &#x2013; the product that we tend to make most of our margin on is on our seasonal product. But you have a twofold situation. If you don't sell, you don't make it and then you also end up taking markdowns as well in order to clear it. So, it's really a combination of both, but we were emphatic that we need to keep our inventory clean.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. If I can just start off on Coles and in particular, the investment that you talk about. You talked at length about investing in price, but does the company feel that they need to invest in other areas of <mark type="indiscernible" /> staffing and further above the line marketing investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've invested in both two of those areas as well, Craig, particularly in the fresh food areas. If you're going to sell fresh food, then you've got to invest further in making sure you look after the product in-store. We developed a number of training of programs, particularly in fresh fruit and veg, which is really now in order to make sure that we look after the product more effectively and we rotate it. And we've had a full re-rostering on the front end as well to drive efficiency improvement in terms of lowering queues at the checkouts.</p>
          <p>So, we certainly continue to invest there and we'll do again. And so, it's not just about price, it's about investing in the quality of the product as well, which we've done again through some of the programs that we identified. So, it's a program turnaround that relates to a number of different factors, not just about investing and price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, so just to be clear, I think when Wesfarmers inherited the Coles business, the wage percentage in store was quite low. Do you get the feel that service levels and all the aspects of staffing in store are now at appropriate levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and there is probably more efficiency that we can take out of it as well. I think that's one of the things we've really identified was to, wasn't necessarily that the overall costs were being pared back, which indeed, they were, but it was the way in which the costs were being allocated and there was sort of an approach which is very much focused on the cash dollar remuneration as opposed to investing in the business to drive sales and look at what your cost of doing business might be and your percent of sales on remuneration overall.</p>
          <p>So, we've actually developed a program, which enables us to track wage spend far more efficiently and effectively across each of the individual categories within a store in order to make sure that store can grow on income, but.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question, you'll never guess, is about CapEx. Can I just add in &#x2013; can you clarify for the $2 billion that was spent in FY '11, how much related to land and buildings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you turn to slide 59, Craig, we have got land and buildings 2011 and 2010 shown up, so $642 million of that was land and building and within our forecast of $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion, that's &#x2013; we obviously had an increase on $642 million baked into that forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the land and buildings is retail. The reason I'm following this issue is just the &#x2013; is any of the CapEx, in some ways, being forced because property development in retailing has ground to a halt? And so effectively, Wesfarmers has to internalize that to ensure store growth continues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; and I'll hand over to John, because I said a lot of this was in plannings. But I think rather that we see this as being a great opportunity for us the last couple of years and I think we have taken full advantage of it as a group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think it would be wrong to characterize it as a negative, Craig. There are less property developers able to purchase and then work through the development of a site. That's a fact. But actually, the market conditions are terrific for doing that. And if you go back into the '90s, the initial strength of the Bunnings warehouse network was built on taking the opportunity and taking charge and driving the acquisition and the development of a site ourself.</p>
          <p>And we've just gone back to what's part of our DNA. Our property and construction team are really first rate and they are having a lot of fun and doing a great job. And now, we have to get back to the other side of the equation and that's the financing side of it on the other side of opening the sites. And our CFO and our Head of the Property Finance Area, we're working hard on getting good outcomes for sale and leaseback going forward, which will net this out over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this, say, the Bunnings business in particular, if you had acquired a property site, is that &#x2013; the property side of that, is that a NPV positive transaction or is it negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at the underlying property condition and we want to do a property transaction that makes sense from a property developer's perspective, but we actually don't want the best property outcome. But we want the best business outcome and that is the best store for Bunnings.</p>
          <p>So, when we do the CapEx, the CapEx is approved or not approved based on the business outcome, with an underlying glance at what it looks like from a property perspective to make sure it washes its face. And over time, as a property developer and that's a core capability of that business, we've managed to produce on the long run, around 2% to 3% of our EBIT average from property development profits. And going forward, who knows what that will be, because conditions do dictate the sort of property we're able to get. But we see a reasonable outcome around the order that I've just mentioned over the 5 to 10 years look forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, when we do the CapEx, we use a pretty conservative assumption of what we will sell the property for down the track. So, we're not disjointed. It's based on the business justification, but we are very conservative on our assumptions of property realization, which we usually exceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, but it's the verticals that you'll retain across the property development and the retailing that's, I assume, giving you the justification <mark type="indiscernible" /></p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just in regards to Kmart, in regards to the poor performing categories there, barbecues, entertainment, and outdoor, I think you mentioned, Guy, is EDLP the right strategy for those products, given that they aren't staples? Will people just go and buy those product categories when they are on sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe they &#x2013; probably not. I mean, let me spill it into two different areas, because one is driven by market conditions, so that's the entertainment area. So, we are finding a significant drop in music CDs, because of the ability to download apps on the iPhone and whatnot. So, that category is really hurting us.</p>
          <p>And the other part in the entertainment area is that what we are selling consoles for 12 months ago are about half the price. So, we are still selling similar amounts of Wiis and Xboxes, but the market price of those across all of us from David Jones to myself and the ones in between, the retail prices of those are at half, so volumes the same, but dollars are down significantly, so the market conditions on the entertainment.</p>
          <p>On barbecue and outdoor, I think it was just one of those, whilst we were spending a lot of our time trying to get the whole EDLP model right, in particular, apparel and homeware. I think that our focus on barbecue and outdoor wasn't as strong and also garden, and we've now just about cleaned that up. So, it was a laggard in changing the model. So, we definitely &#x2013; I think we definitely probably got that area right now, but it's less big and bulky and a lot more everyday use around the things that you need for the barbecue, versus having the range of barbecue, if you like. Hopefully, that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that makes sense, thanks. And just the second question was on liquor and really around the small format issues that you discussed. Woolworths has continued to invest capital in new small format stores and refurbish those format stores as well, so is this small format issue a company-specific one?</p>
          <p>And I guess just second to that, I was just interested to know why it's taken so long to realize that 1st Choice needs to be overhauled and that the liquor store network needs to be reconfigured. I would have thought both of those things would have been fundamental changes that you would've looked at from year one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that that we have, the structural dynamic that's happening within liquor in Australia is not dissimilar to what's happened in other markets. And essentially, you've got polarization where the smaller store format, if it's adjacent to a supermarket, is where people would buy liquor for convenience. And what's evolving is a broader level of destination style awareness through the larger box format, and we play in both of those markets.</p>
          <p>We've had development over time of a refresher program in liquor lines since the start of the Coles turnaround and redeveloped a number of stores into a revised format there and have also enhanced it since then. The same is true on 1st Choice where a number of the stores have been developed, we've changed the format there. We've changed the interior of the store and the look and feel.</p>
          <p>Where you're seeing the biggest challenge in liquor more generally in the marketplace is standalone small store formats, which don't kind of fit inside of those two categories and that's an industry issue, not a company one. So, overall, we're pleased with the progress that we've made in liquor, we've growing the sales overall, the market share has grown consistently over the last three years, we repositioned it in terms of its price, we've improved its overall profitability ahead of its sales and we expect to see further growth coming in the marketplace. But some of the elements in terms of structural change in relation to the portfolio will take time to change, the same as they are with supermarkets. But we do expect to see further progress down the train.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much. Just one for me and following on from the previous question about liquor. There's a comment you made that the sales in the liquor business have grown. Is that in reference to FY'11 and if it is, did it grow consistently through the year, or did you see the growth level fall away in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've seen growth come through during the course of the year. And we've seen consistent growth coming through during the course of the three years that the turnaround has been in progress so far. Certainly when the stimulus package was on a couple of years ago, then there was a broader benefit there, but we're seeing good progress in the area of liquor within our business and I think it's been well documented as a pretty challenging market at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks. And then just a quick second question, on the Kmart business. Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto is obviously a very different business to the department store operations. Could you perhaps just comment on how the performance between the two businesses has differed and also, what expansion plans there are for Tyre &amp; Auto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. So, there are three parts to the Kmart model, right? So, there is the Kmart Australian stores, the New Zealand Kmart business and the Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto. Each time I've spoken about this business, Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto has always been a very strong business, has got good sales growth, has had good EBIT growth. The most significant change that's happening in the last 12 months under John Sink's leadership is the &#x2013; the just under 300 outlets that we've got are getting a considerable makeover from how they look from the outside as you drive along the streets. So, a considerable amount of reinvestment is being plugged into business similar that came out wasn't given the capital to or reinvestment to fix it up.</p>
          <p>And also, a lot of money being spent on the customer service area, where particularly it's, again, a female-driven business similar to retail, to create a better environment, not just in the reception area, but also the receptionist, if you like. So, it's doing well and I think the &#x2013; within a 24-month period, nearly every one of their stores would have been totally revamped and they look good, great model.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Michael, without putting down Guy's response, which is a very good response, and the terrific people in Kmart Tyre and Auto, it's in the group scheme of things, a pretty immaterial business, I must say. And even in Kmart, it's a handy contributor to the overall business, but that's the scale of it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just an observation on property, Terry, and a question. So, as you are going to spend more than $642 million on land and buildings next year, you probably spent $1.7 billion over three and you've got a starting point, so there's clearly a land grab going on here. The trades are talking about Coles having a budget of $1 billion for property. If you add in Bunnings. I imagine that covers most of it. So, is that what's driving this, you guys just trying to get distribution for your brands and the other guys out there doing the same thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I will classify it as a land grab. I think what we said is that the environment in Bunnings has always had a very strong property portfolio and network that has built up in the current environment, as John explained, has enabled us to accelerate and be very pleased with that position. We said Coles wasn't active enough in its own portfolio and we have been making moves to accelerate that.</p>
          <p>The reality is, I think you said $1 billion of property allocated to Coles. Well, that's not true. So, I think what we've said is we've said $642 million in land and buildings this year, mainly in retail obviously, mainly in Bunnings, and we'd expect an acceleration on that amount and that's within the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion forecast that we've given.</p>

          <p>Okay. The second question is for Ian, just talking to slide 17, I'm looking at the reduction in wastage index. And the question is, is the index the movement in the percentage of wastage or perhaps the dollars saved? And in terms of the index alpha, are you above what you consider to be an acceptable level of wastage for a supermarket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we are getting pretty close now to levels where we'd anticipated being from our previous experience. I mean, there is still more to go in relation to improvements that we can make. But certainly on the percent of sales basis, the better performing stores are delivering new levels that we'd anticipate to see consistent with what we've seen before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, a couple of questions, start off with Ian. Ian, $800 million worth of return to customers through lower pricing. If I then backsolve on what your deflation was for the year, it suggests that you took pricing up by about $730 million in other areas. Is that concentrated in a couple of categories where you were passing through cost pressures, or is that pretty much across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't been doing that. If the implication is we've been taking prices up another line to fund the reductions, that certainly isn't what we've been doing. Essentially, what we've been doing here is driving out efficiencies through the business to create a savings pool and that's been reinvested back in price.</p>
          <p>If you look at how the $800 million is calculated, you've got to look at where the average rate of inflation was running prior to the acquisition, which runs about 4.5% a year and then you look it earning from there to deflation of 1.6% during the course of last year, so a combination of the investment in price, which is real, and the suppression of price increases is actually where you get the number from. So, it's not a question of putting prices up in other directions.</p>
          <p>Certainly in some categories, there has been inflation, but that's been driven by the other extraneous factors. In produce, for example, the situation in relation to bananas has been well documented, as indeed in areas like tomatoes and cucumber as well. So, we've seen in some of these fresh areas, prices move up, but in other areas, we've invested heavily. So, there has been a countervailing effect, particularly in grocery, which has meant that our underlying position has delivered deflation or inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just so that I've got this one right. The $800 million is since the acquisition and it relates to the differential between if inflation had continued at pre-acquisition levels versus minus 1.6% in....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not a question of a cumulative effect over a three-year period, it's an in-year element. If you look where inflation was running prior and where we have taken it so far and you look at the differential in terms of level of investment we've taken and what we've actually suppressed in terms of increases that we have chosen not to pass on, that's where you get the $800 million from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I look at the expansion of your liquor licenses or liquor stores that you're talking about over the next couple of years, how are you going to get the liquor licenses? Are you going to have to buy sites that already have liquor licenses or do you think you can apply to get that many over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the liquor licenses are determined by different legislations in different states. There are opportunities to expand accordingly. Certainly, it's becoming more challenging to get liquor licenses as we move through, but there are opportunities to move liquor licenses where we might move a small store to a larger store in a similar catchment.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a quick one for Launa and Guy. If I look at your inventory levels respectively in Target and Kmart going into July, are you comfortable with them, or because June sales were as poor as they're reported to have been, does that mean you've got an inventory hangover and you're having to do markdowns to clear that inventory?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we're going around again, thanks. Richard and Terry, one of the great &#x2013; the businesses I'm concerned about is Gresham, particularly the private equity. Now, I do understand that it's noncash and it's priced to book, et cetera, et cetera, but over the last four years for the Gresham Private Equity Fund business, you've made a profit of $16 million in '08, you lost $57 million in '09, you made $43 million in '10 and you've dusted $60 million in '11.</p>
          <p>Over the four years, you've lost $60 million and you've probably invested about $300 million or $400 million into that business. I just don't get the Gresham Private Equity Fund business. I just don't understand what Wesfarmers is doing there. I understand that Wesfarmers has got an inter-company connection with Gresham. There is some corporate governance issues there that I don't particularly like, but that's a discussion for another day. I just think that that four-year history has now shown that this business really shouldn't be in the makeup of Wesfarmers and I just don't understand why it's there and I'd like you to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David. Just on the corporate governance side of things, we own 50% of Gresham and we've invested in Funds One, Two, and Three. And Fund One, the realized investments grew out of the significant profit for the group and in Fund Two, the only realized investment, I think, which is the nappies business, which has been a very good cash realization for us as well. So, there's a difference between what's been reported and what we've realized and we'll realize in the future. But clearly, the last year or two...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wouldn't that be in there, Richard? I mean, you've basically &#x2013; that's the outcome of that, if you realize it, that would be in those numbers, wouldn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is, although Fund One is probably prior to that. And then as Terry said, the movement this year is basically a carrying value movement and it's a compression of PE ratios on potential exists and the challenges in some of the businesses, so I'm not resigning from that. But the bottom line on this, David, will be, will we make adjacent return on the investment? I think the internal rate of return we made on Fund One was high 20% and time will tell on Fund Two. Fund Three hasn't made any significant investments at this stage. And in terms of our sort of what we've currently got invested, Terry, help me out, but it's not hundreds of millions of dollars. I would think it's in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a bit more than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've lost $60 million, it'd have to be a fair bit more than that, wouldn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you've lost $60 million this year, you'd have to have a fair bit invested for the book value to move that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We've got in funds, really, there is a not a lot invested. We made a commitment, but as Richard said, there hasn't been a lot of investments in Fund Two. It's broadly around $100 million and it effectively is similar to its carrying value at the moment or thereabouts, so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, David, it's to date based on our realizations, the investments in Fund two is more challenging, where we are involved, we don't sit back, Terry and I and Tim Bult are on the investment committee. And yeah there is still &#x2013; there are some good investments in Fund Two. The issue shall be whether they can be properly realized, things like Barminco and there is one or two other things that look reasonably prospective at the moment, but time will tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, Richard. I'm listening to Guy talking about taking more inventory on through direct sourcing and it's a trend that other retailers are doing. I'm just a bit concerned that taking on more inventory risk &#x2013; I mean, I do understand that you take on more inventory risk, it does lower the cost, you get lower cost et cetera. But if you get it to bounce around in economic conditions, you can be left with pretty heavy inventory risk and the inventory increase this year of $450 million or so, I'm just a bit concerned about the trend that this is going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the direct selling, there is couple of things there. Terry talked a bit about the key part of that, which was Coles. On the direct side of things, David, you are right to point it out. There is a potential risk. I think we manage it pretty well. You certainly get a margin expansion through doing it.</p>
          <p>And we don't sit on inventory now, and Target will come out, if we are all concerned about it, we deal with it pretty effectively and we keep a very close eye on this through the management teams in the business and then through the other side that we have here. So, and in fact, I think the supply chain, the length of the supply chain, if you like, is compacting, not extending as we do this. So, the risk diminishes through having more efficient and direct supply chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are probably competitors, Richard, which I suppose we take with a pinch of salt, but I would like you to comment on it for the record, that a couple of signs at Kmart in particular, it's low cost strategy is predicated pretty much on just buying loads and loads of inventory and it's sitting on container loads of inventory in docks all around Australia. Can you quash that for the record?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I actually had those ships sitting off ports full of Kmart gear. We know exactly what the inventory is, we know what they're holding. And we have got some significant benefits in Kmart through better buying, there is no question about that. And Guy has talked a bit about that at the results, sorry, the strategy day in July, but we don't have containers and containers sitting around the place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you got too much inventory in Kmart, Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we've got a little bit more than we'd probably like at the moment. But that's, Guy, maybe $10 million, nothing more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, on &#x2013; this is Terry here. In the segment notes, the second section, you can see the assets employed from 2010 to 2011 and you can look at &#x2013; do a bit of work to strip out capital expenditure and depreciation and it gives you a fair idea what inventory may have moved.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of what the movement's been in Kmart, yes, there has been an increase in inventory, but you'll be able to work out yourself, it's not material relative to the inventory increase in total for the group, which we have said is when you work that through, Bunnings is obviously opening up a lot of stores and growing sales. But you've got to look at the creditor side of that as well, because obviously, you get funding on that.</p>
          <p>And similarly, Coles is growing and in Coles we are taking more into, they say, fresh, like milk and chips, which is obviously gives us advantages and competitive advantages and we are going to go through a very significant change to our supply chain in Coles and you would be mad not to watch the customer and make sure you look after the customer, while increasing safety stock ahead of that. So, I think I wouldn't get overly concerned about Kmart's inventory position when you look at the group's inventory growth.</p>
