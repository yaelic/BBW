          <p>Thank you, Judy, and good morning and thank you for joining us.  Andy and I would like to start the call today with a short review of our fourth quarter results.  After we've completed our brief formal remarks, we'll open the line up to questions from the audience.</p>
          <p>Our company recorded net income of $330 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Reported earnings per diluted common share of $0.15 were $0.38 lower than the earnings per diluted common share in the same period of 2007 and $0.17 lower than the prior quarter.  Although the company's operating business continues to do well, the decline in reported earnings from a year ago and the prior quarter was primarily the result of higher credit costs, including the cost of building the reserve for credit losses and additional impairment charges on securities, a consequence of current market conditions.</p>
          <p>Significant items impacting the company's fourth quarter earnings included $253 million in securities impairments and $635 million incremental provision expense.  In total, significant items reduced earnings per diluted common share by approximately $0.34.</p>
          <p>Our performance metrics were negatively impacted by these significant items, as return on average assets in the current quarter fell to 0.51% from 1.63% in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Our return on average common equity dropped to 5.3% from 18.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.  Without the securities impairments and reserve build, return on average assets and return on average common equity would have been approximately 1.46 and 17.5% respectively.</p>
          <p>As I stated at the beginning, our operating businesses continue to do very well this quarter and the results were highlighted by the following:  growth in total average loans, excluding the acquisitions of Mellon 1st Business Bank, PFF Bank &amp; Trust and Downey Financial of $19.2 billion or 12.7% year-over-year, with solid growth in all major categories.  On a linked quarter basis, total average loans excluding acquisitions increased by $5.2 billion or 12.4% on an annualized basis.</p>
          <p>As many of you heard me say in the past U.S. Bank is open for business.  Our growth in average loans this quarter demonstrated that fact and our fourth quarter new business statistics further illustrates just how successful our business lines were in attracting new loan customers and servicing the lending needs of our current customers.  During the fourth quarter, U.S. Bank originated over $16 billion in new loans to businesses and consumers, including over $3 billion of consumer loans, over $8 billion of residential mortgages, over $1 billion of loans to small businesses and well over $3 billion of commercial and commercial real estate loans.  And be assured that we have not strayed from our high quality credit standards to attract and establish all of these new and expanded customer relationships.</p>
          <p>We also experienced exceptional growth in average total deposits this quarter.  Average total deposits excluding acquisitions increased by $12 billion, 9.6% over the same quarter of last year and $5.8 billion or 17.2% annualized on a linked-quarter basis.  Our company continues to benefit from the uncertainty in the financial markets and a flight-to-quality by customers seeking our stability.</p>
          <p>Net interest income in the fourth quarter increased by 22.6% year-over-year and 9.9% unannualized linked quarter.  This increase was a result of an improvement in the net interest margin, which was 3.81% in the fourth quarter, 16 basis points higher than the previous quarter and 30 basis points higher than the same quarter of last year, in addition to the quarter's strong growth in average earning assets.</p>
          <p>Moving on to fee income; seasonality, a slowing economy and unfavorable equity markets led to the decline in a number of fee-based categories this quarter, including payments, trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges.  Payments-related fees, which include credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment products, and merchant processing services, were lower on both a year-over-year and a linked quarter basis as a result of a decline in transaction volumes.</p>
          <p>Trust and investment management fees were also lower year-over-year and linked quarter as adverse equity market conditions reduced the value of assets under management and consequently related management fees.  Deposit services charges decreased from both of the comparable time periods due to a change in consumer spending patterns in this challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>Mortgage banking revenue also declined year-over-year and linked quarter, primarily reflecting a change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of the economic hedging activity.  Mortgage production of $8.1 billion was higher than both the same quarter of 2007 and the prior quarter, the majority of which was packaged and sold into the secondary market.  As many of you are aware, mortgage originations are up substantially in 2009 with the drop in interest rates, and we expect our mortgage originations to continue to accommodate the increased demand from both new and existing customers.</p>
          <p>Treasury management fees and commercial product revenue were higher than the fourth quarter of 2007 by 9.4% and 8.3% respectively, reflecting the wholesale group's ongoing revenue initiatives.  On a on a linked quarter basis, treasury management fees were seasonally flat while lower syndication fees offset increases in other lines within the commercial product revenue category.</p>
          <p>Finally, within non-interest income, other income was lower year-over-year primarily due to the higher end-of-term residual loses and impairment on consumer auto leases, offset somewhat by the impact of a Visa gain of $59 million as a litigation escrow account maintained by Visa, Inc. was funded in the quarter in connection with their recent settlement with Discover.   On a linked quarter basis the Visa gain made up the majority of the positive variance with end-of-term losses on retail auto leases slightly favorable as well.</p>
          <p>Total non-interest expense in the current quarter was essentially flat to the fourth quarter of last year but $137 million higher than the previous quarter. The variance, or lack of a significant variance year-over-year, was largely the result of a $215 million Visa litigation charge, which was taken in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Offsetting this favorable year-over-year variance was approximately $70 million of operating and integration expenses related to recent acquisitions, as well as higher expenses associated with the ongoing investment in our business lines, our national marketing campaign, loan workout expense and tax credit investments.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency ratio as reported for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 50.6%, lower than the 55.1% we posted in the fourth quarter of 2007 and slightly higher than the previous quarter. We continue to be one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry with a full-year efficiency ratio of 47.4%.  We have always operated with a disciplined approach to expense control and our ability to manage our cost is particularly important in this environment.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, in addition to our standard profit plan, each of our managers submits a contingency budget that includes a 5% reduction in expenses relative to their approved plan.  This year's planning process was no exception and we have recently begun to ask managers in certain business lines to implement their expense reduction scenario.  Be assured that this company will implement cost saving strategies in a very thoughtful and deliberate manner, so as not to hamper the momentum of the business lines and their future success.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to credit; as expected, credit costs trended higher again this quarter.  Net charge-offs of $632 million were 26.9% higher than the third quarter of 2008 an increase similar to what we experienced last quarter, and in the middle of the range that we projected in December.  The increase in net charge-offs reflected continued stress in the residential home and mortgage-related industries, declining home prices and the impact of the worsening economy on both our commercial and retail customers.  Total net charge-offs to average loans outstanding were 1.42% in the fourth quarter compared to 1.19% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Also as expected, non-performing assets increased this quarter.  The change reflects an increase in the bank's core loan portfolio and the effect on non-performing assets of the recent acquisitions of Downey Savings and PFF Bank &amp; Trust.  At December 31, total non-performing assets were $2.624 billion.  Included in non-performing assets was $643 million of loans and other real estate covered by a loss share agreement with the FDIC in connection with our acquisition of PFF Bank &amp; Trust and Downey Financial.  In other words, there is a minimal amount of potential loss given the terms of the agreement with the FDIC.  Excluding these covered assets, non-performing assets increased by $489 million or 32.8%.  This is also in line with our expectations as previously communicated to investors.</p>
          <p>The majority of the increase in the core bank portfolio was related to residential construction, residential mortgages and related industries.  However, the economic slowdown also had an impact on some of our commercial and retail customers.  The ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned excluding covered loans was 114 basis points at December 31, still well below the level of the ratios posted by our peer banks to date.</p>
          <p>Restructured loans that continue to accrue interest rose by 27.9% this quarter, as the company continues to work with customers who are current or become current on their payments, to renegotiate loan terms, enabling them to keep their homes or retain the value of that relationship for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As I said in the past, we intend to protect the quality and strength of the balance sheet. And given the upward trends in both net charge-offs and non-performing assets, in addition to the current economic slowdown, we increased the allowance for loan loss this quarter by recording an incremental provision for loan losses of $635 million or an amount equal to 100% of net charge-offs.  With this addition to the allowance for credit losses, the company's allowance for credit losses to period-end loans excluding covered assets was 2.09% compared with 1.71% at September 30th, and the ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding covered assets was 206%.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will also continue to access the adequacy of our reserve for loan losses and provide for credit losses to reflect changes in the credit risk of the loan portfolio and economic conditions.  Again, we enter this credit cycle with a strong balance sheet and we will continue to protect that position going forward.</p>
          <p>And finally, and importantly, our capital position remained strong.  On November 3, we announced our participation in the Treasury's Capital Purchase Plan and subsequently issued $6.6 billion of preferred stock and related warrants to the U.S. Treasury. Our tier one and total capital ratios were 10.6% and 14.3% respectively at December 31, both well above our target levels.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Andy who'll make a few more comments about the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Richard.  I'd like to begin with a quick summary of the significant items that have impacted the comparison of our fourth quarter results to prior periods.  At an investor conference in December we disclosed a few significant items that were expected to impact our company's fourth quarter results, and the actual impact was as predicted.</p>
          <p>Included in our December presentation were the following: first, we expected an impairment charge on our SIV exposure of 200 to $300 million; the actual impairment was $253 million.  Second, we predicted net charge-offs to be in the range of 610 to $650 million and that we were expected to build the company's loan loss reserve by amount equal to 90 to 110% of net charge-offs for the quarter at a rate higher than the previous quarters.  Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter equaled $632 million and the actual reserve build was $635 million.  Significant items totaling $888 million were very close to the expectations and reduced earnings per diluted common share by approximately $0.34.</p>
          <p>For comparison purposes, during the third quarter of 2008 the company recorded $411 million of security losses, the result of impairment charges on structured investment securities, other preferred securities and non-agency mortgage-backed securities.  Other income in the third quarter included $39 million of losses related to the bankruptcy of an investment banking firm.  In addition, third quarter results included incremental provision expense of $250 million.  Together, these significant items reduced third quarter earnings or diluted common share by approximately $0.28.</p>
          <p>Finally, as you may recall, the fourth quarter of 2007 included two significant items, including $107 million charge to other income related to the original purchase of the structured investment vehicles from an affiliate and a $215 million charge related to Visa, Inc.'s litigation settlement.</p>
          <p>Now just a few comments about operating earnings; net interest income in the fourth quarter was higher on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis due to both earning asset growth and strong net interest margin.  The improvement in margin on both the year-over-year and linked quarter basis was the result of growth in higher spread assets, the benefit of being liability-sensitive in the declining rate environment and net free funds.</p>
          <p>In addition, we were also able to maintain very favorable short-term funding rates as market volatility continued throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Going forward, assuming the current rate environment and yield curve, we expect net interest margin to moderate to a level comparable to the average for 2008 or in the low to mid 360's.  This expectation accounts for the impact to the recent acquisition to PFF and Downey Financial, the dollar reprising of certain consumer loan products and the normalization of funding and liquidity in the wholesale funding markets.</p>
          <p>As Richard mentioned, the growth in non-interest income was affected by the fourth quarter &#x2013; in the fourth quarter by losses on auto lease residuals.  Specifically, $71 million of the decrease in other income year-over-year was attributed to residual losses.  On a linked quarter basis we saw a $3 million improvement in the total amount of losses from retail auto leases.  We continue to carefully manage the residual risk on this portfolio.  Given the current market for used cars, we expect adverse market pressure on auto lease residuals values to continue into 2009, but overall losses will be manageable as the number of vehicles coming off lease declines.</p>
          <p>On November 21, U.S. Bancorp acquired substantially all of the assets, assumed all deposits and most of the liabilities of Downey Savings and Loan and PFF Bank &amp; Trust from the FDIC. We did not acquire the legal entities of either of these institutions and I'd like to clarify a few points regarding the impact that these acquisitions had on the results and financial reporting.  First, the company purchased net assets of approximately $1.6 billion between these two acquisitions for a nominal amount of consideration.  Second, as part of these transactions, U.S. Bancorp entered into a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC, which provided for a specific credit loss and asset yield protection for a significant portion of the loans and foreclosed real-estate.  These assets encompassed by the loss sharing agreement with the FDIC I referred to as covered assets in our financial reporting and are segregated from all other assets for transparency.</p>
          <p>Table 8 in our fourth quarter earnings released includes the summary of these covered assets.  As of December 31, we have estimated that these covered assets with the contract value of $13.8 billion, will incur cumulative credit losses of approximately $4.7 billion or 34%.  Of the $4.7 billion, $2.4 billion represents the company's estimate of the losses to be offset by the loss sharing agreement with the FDIC.  The remaining $2.3 billion represents U.S. Bancorp's first loss position of $1.6 billion, essentially equal to the net assets received at close plus an additional $700 million of losses, which represents the company's remaining share of expected losses.</p>
          <p>Finally, because the majority of the assets acquired in the Downey and PFF transactions we're experiencing credit deterioration, they were recorded in the financial statements at their estimated fair market value to reflect expected credit losses and the estimated impact of loss sharing agreements.  Accordingly, we will not record additional provision or charge-off's related to covered assets unless further credit deterioration occurs going forward.  You will note that we have provided credit statistics with and without these covered loans for comparison purposes.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call back to Richard.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy.  And in conclusion, overall I was disappointed with the relative size of our earnings this quarter and our inability to increase earnings on either a linked quarter or year-over-year basis.  However, I am very proud of the fact that our company continues to profitably navigate through this difficult economic environment while continuing to build momentum for our future.</p>
          <p>Our fundamental businesses remain strong.  We are, however, a bank and therefore not immune to the challenges facing our industry. But as the results of the fourth quarter and full year 2008 demonstrate, we are actively lending to creditworthy borrowers.  We are judiciously investing in and growing our banking franchise and businesses.  We are serving our communities through business partnerships and employee volunteerism, and we are creating value for our shareholders by maintaining our prudent approach to risk, preserving the quality of our balance sheet and the strength of our capital, and positioning U.S. Bank to meet both the challenges of today and the opportunities of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>That concludes our formal remarks.  Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, I was hoping you could give us little more color in terms of how you calculate the tangible common equity ratio, I think you're showing 4.5, and I get 3.8 when I ex goodwill, and then when I exclude other intangibles I get closer to 3.3.  I'm just trying to reconcile how you're calculating it to get to 4.5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Matt, and it's a calculation that we've actually used for over a decade and it's been consistently applied.  I believe the fundamental difference between the way you're calculating and we are, is some components of OCI and the inclusion of those. And we start with core capital and probably the biggest difference is the exclusion of the unrealized gain/loss in securities in our calculation. We believe that starting with the core capital number is more appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then are you excluding &#x2013; obviously you're excluding goodwill, but what about the intangibles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so all intangibles other than the MSR, I would assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.  All goodwill, all intangibles, and then adding back or not excluding the MSR; correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, that's helpful.  And then separately, Richard, you guys have been one of the more responsible banks out there, you're one of the stronger banks out there, but the outlook for the industry overall seems rather dire.  And I know this might be little bit of an unfair question, but I mean how do you think about what the government can do to fix the industry overall?  I mean you guys have been dragged down by it, and I think everybody is kind of looking around for some solutions, and I'm wondering if you have any thoughts and how you think this all plays out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Matt.  First of all, I'm actually quite optimistic that we &#x2013; with the new administration and the new team that we will have some new solutions, and I think perhaps a more collaborative view of asking a lot of us in the banking community how we think different solutions might be best suited.  So, I'm looking forward to being more a part of it.</p>
          <p>I'd also tell you that as difficulty as things look, I'm looking forward to the time when banks will start to trade again on their core earnings, and I know that's quite a ways into the future when the fear of the unknown finally is extracted from the formula.  But our company is pretty simple, as you know and we're doing exactly what we did a few years ago, in exactly the same way.  All the same businesses, and despite the economy bringing us slower with some revenue based on the payments and trust businesses, which is an interim solution that will eventually recover, and the fact that loan losses are a reality and we're taking our fair share of those, but still earning well above those.</p>
          <p>And I'm kind of encouraged that at least in the simple form of things that as this is a cycle, it's longer than we thought would be &#x2013; it might be a deeper and more protracted than we thought it would be in more places.  I'm actually looking forward to getting to the other side because our core fundamentals haven't been affected and we're still operating kind of the old fashioned way of a balance sheet bank growing the business with fees and spending money to ensure that there is a future.</p>
          <p>In terms of the actions of the government hopefully can take. I think we all agree that part of this is just confidence. In fact, it might be the biggest part and that's very intangible.  But to the extent that we can get things moving again, I think it's going to be instructive for people to believe that there is a market out there that's willing to help them either grow their companies or grow their personal assets.</p>
          <p>When you look at the headline that banks aren't lending, and obviously we don't participate in that headline because we lent over $16 billion in new loans last quarter.  I should typically celebrate the fact that we're having a flight-to-quality that many of our peers are not, but in this circumstance, we're no longer celebrating that distinction.  We're wishful that everybody will get back on to the game and that we'll have a more robust banking environment where people start coming back to banks for lending.</p>
          <p>So, I'm looking for a solution that will help of us equally, and I think getting the housing situation fixed will be the first remedy, getting the foreclosures behind us and getting the &#x2013; turning the market where the valuations start to improve instead of degradate (sic) is going to helpful.  And then I think the confidence is the other piece that kicks in because after real estate and real estate related issues, which are many, we're just going to have people needing to turn the corner and believing that an investment in themselves, in their homes and their companies is going be a well placed investment that will eventually yield a return.</p>
          <p>And what I'm happy to report, in my long answer to your question, is that banks are the place again where they're going to go.  Despite all of this turmoil and discord in the last couple of years, I don't know if anybody's noticed, but banking is back again.  It's a really good business and it's the place where consumers and businesses are going to go to grow their companies and grow their lives.</p>
          <p>So the risk premium is back, the yield curve is back, the confidence isn't, but it will be.  And eventually, when you look at the alternatives of the interlopers that came in with international funding, foreign investors, private equity &#x2013; most of that has been there, visited and left.  So, on the long view, if we can get past this difficult time, the structure of core banking is sound.  And I'm kind of looking forward to getting there first.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question regarding your dividend, I just want to get your updated thoughts on that, in the context of the deepening recession and with the tangible common equity reduction you guys took this quarter.  If you get to the point where you're internally looking at under-earning the dividend for more than just a couple of quarters, whether it's due to securities impairments or continued reserve building, are you thinking that in that kind of a scenario you'd take a closer look at that payout ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, thanks for asking it that way because that's exactly the right way to ask it and the answer is yes.  Let me just remind our investors: every 90 days our board evaluates the dividend.  And seriously, every 90 days; there's never been anything rubber stamped about it.</p>
          <p>As you know, we just declared our dividend at the late middle of last month, just paid it out a couple of weeks ago and we are scheduled to look at it again in the middle of March, at which time we will. To the extent that we have a dividend out there should reflect to you that we think we can more than cover our dividend with earnings and that's how we identify the level which we should payout. To the extent that the world becomes more impaired or there become scenarios that aren't currently contemplated, even by us at this point in time, then we'll use that information to evaluate in March and again in June and again in September.</p>
          <p>And we'll make the right call; we're not going to preserve the dividend to be ridiculous about being dead right if it's not going to be appropriately covered by earnings, but we're also not going to reduce the dividend until which time we feel that it's appropriate and necessary given number one, the constraint on being able to raise it again and number two, on the fact that we recognize that's a value to our investors and our shareholders as part of the strength of this company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that, and just one last one.  In terms of the restructured loans and the increase linked quarter, can you talk about what drove that increase, where you saw most of this and was any part due to the inclusion of Downey and PFF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bill Parker.  The restructured loan increase is just a continuation of something we began more than two years ago, primarily two areas: one, residential mortgages, where either we know people have rate resets coming up and we will be proactive and get a hold of them and if they're current, we'll say you do not need to &#x2013; you will not have to increase your payment, just keep making the same payment, that's about half of the residential mortgage restructuring loan increase.</p>
          <p>And then the other piece is where people have fallen behind, we have a variety of programs, we help them, we verify their income and hopefully can create a program where they continue making a reasonable payment.  If it's something where they can't make a payment that at least has some kind of market rate to it, then it will be a non-performing loan even if they do stay in the home.</p>
          <p>And then on the credit card side, where the other increase comes from, we have a variety of either hardship or workout programs that again, we'll offer what we consider fair rates or something less than what they've been paying to allow them to get back on their feet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Bill, you might also add for David that with the Downey acquisition, we agreed to participate in the FDIC's restructuring program and we're actually having good success with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yeah and the restructured loans that you see on our table do not include the Downey, PFF &#x2013; most of the single family homes came under Downey, 10 to $11 billion, with the &#x2013; we're offering a specific program that was put forth by the FDIC, all goes through verified income, you can extend the loan term up to 40 years, you can reduce the interest rate down to 3%.  All those are covered assets, and to the extent we reduce our rates below something which is market, that is part of what the FDIC has offered up as their loss sharing.  It's not just a credit loss sharing, it's also a value loss sharing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Okay great.  One last one I just thought of, the increase in terms of the net charge-offs in C&amp;I.  Can you talk about that, in what industries you saw increased stress that contributed to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did have a couple of larger C&amp;I charge-offs in the fourth quarter.  One of them was related to the oil and gas energy industry, it was a pipeline and storage company.  And another credit we had a larger loss on was in the gaming industry.  Both are industries that we have active roles in financing, but there were issues in both of those credits.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you just comment more on your outlook for credit in non-performing assets and what you're seeing in, as a follow-up to that last question, what other industry groups are you monitoring more closely?  And also, as related to the covered assets, is there any scenario where you can lose money on those covered assets &#x2013; and I'm just trying to figure out &#x2013; when I look at a reserve to NPA ratio, should I permanently exclude those covered assets or is there a chance we could have losses down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll have Andy answer the last question first. I'll answer the first one last.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so, Mike, on the covered asset question, first of all, I should highlight that our current expectation is very, very consistent with the expectation we had a month and half ago or two months ago when we did the deal. And for the most part we're at the point of the loss sharing agreement on those covered assets that it's a 95% FDIC loss, 5% U.S. Bank loss.  So, to the extent that we're wrong, for the most part we're at that level of sharing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as regards to kind of our view looking out on credit losses, both charge-offs and non-performs, and I have to report that as basic and as predictable as we've been in the last four quarters, you can just go forward so far on the same trajectory.  I mean, we're seeing the same kind of the linked quarter, 20-30% increase in non-performs and charge-offs, I don't see that changing in the near term.  I've always been a pundit to say, you can see 90 days out; after that it gets a bit blurry.  But in the 90 days out we're seeing nothing remarkable, but nothing improving.  We're just seeing a continuation of what we've seen heretofore, that's why we thought we would at the end of the year basically double down on our reserves to continue to be at the high end of the quarter's balance sheet and that may or may not need to continue because we may not see that as not necessary if we just continue the same kind of trajectory.</p>
          <p>We are looking forward, Mike, to that moment when all of a sudden loan losses appear to start flattening out and then eventually settling and going down. Somewhere around that time reserve build starts to slow and goes down to equal to earning asset growth, and when those days happen those are going to be great days for at least those of us that are just operating standard above the line in core growth, and then it will definitely shine through.</p>
          <p>But in the meantime, I think we're going to project the rest of this year as probably more of that traditional increase in losses first, reserve build along the way &#x2013; and that we haven't seen a place yet where that turning the corner is evident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so FDIC covers 95% of the covered assets.  So you are exposed 5% of what number? Would it be of the 5 billion that's currently covered or an original amount?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not the original amount.  So, we expected a certain amount of loss.  We wrote down our assets to that loss level.  There was a 20/80 loss sharing agreement, Mike, 20% of U.S. Bank, 80% to the FDIC.  Up to some level, we're just about to that level, there's a little bit left to go then after that it would be 95 FDIC, 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 5% of the 14 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>5% of whatever losses occur on that loan portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the original 14 billion.  So, very &#x2013; so it's not a &#x2013; it can hurt you too much at this point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one separate question.  The processing businesses &#x2013; now how much of the decline is seasonal and how much is more kind of permanent through this cycle, especially with consumer spending going down...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...the way it has.  Can you just elaborate on that?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Processing business is well defined.  My answer will include merchant processing and we'll say corporate card, corporate spend for the less traditional businesses that a lot of our peers don't have.  I would say that the decreases you've seen are &#x2013; majority of those are recession related; they are not seasonal.  Seasonality would typically bring us to a fairly flat quarter one over &#x2013; quarter four over quarter three, because the government is higher in quarter three and comes down in four, but the retail was up in quarter four from quarter three, instead they're both down and they're both down linked quarter and they're down year-over-year and that is almost entirely recessionary or slowing.</p>
          <p>We saw, as you all did, on the merchant side, you can see either our big portfolio of airlines, hotels, the resorts or retailing &#x2013; it's a third, a third, a third &#x2013; they all showed a certain level of significant drop year-over-year in the month of December and the government spending went to almost nothing in the last half of the last month of the quarter based on what appears to be a lot of cost cutting and budget controls.</p>
          <p>We're seeing, January we expected to be slower; it is slower.  It's not exceeding our expectations, so it's actually firmed up a bit over perhaps the delta year-over-year that December had.  But make no mistake about it &#x2013; consumers and businesses are spending less, they're traveling less and they're watching their nickels and dimes. We'll all be affected by that in the near-term.</p>
          <p>What I like best about this business though, is the pipeline if you will, is built and it's done, so just less is flowing through it. When the market recovers, we just start putting more, more through it and it's very scalable.  So, we don't have any structural losses here and we have no loss of customers, we're still building our base of new businesses.  We simply have less per customer incidents for the next I think next probably six months or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last follow-up, since it is so scalable and revenues are quite strong, why not do another acquisition in the processing area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely could &#x2013; that would be brilliant and to the extent that we are able to find one, you could expect that to be on the shortest list of the things we would do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, I wanted to follow-up on Matt's, I think the original question.  If I calculate the tangible common ratio like I do I guess for most banks, instead of getting a range I get 3.2%, and we've had other banks that are below three, of course, that have gotten hit hard because of that.  Can you just give thoughts on there your comfort level with it, with the TC ratio, again calculated like we do for other banks, in the low threes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris this is Andy again.  First of all, as you know that indiscernibleratio is calculated a bit differently among different entities, different banks calculate it differently, some of the rating agencies calculate it differently.  So, we've been using this consistent calculation and again we start with the core capital number.  As we've talked about, we think the way we calculate it, we like to stay above the 4% ratio as sort of an internal target we set for ourselves, perhaps the way you are calculating it's above 3%...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...so, it is something that we're cognizant of. However, we have a very strong earnings power, we have great businesses.  We are very comfortable with the ratio as it is and as Richard mentioned, we don't see any need to capital raise or anything around that to improve that ratio. We're comfortable with where it is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can follow-up on a different question.  You gave some margin guidance, I think some of this is already answered, but if you look in, I missed the first part of the call so forgive me, but the &#x2013; of the 16 or so basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, was any of that tied to the acquisitions made in the quarter or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Chris, none of it was tied to the acquisitions.  First, we benefited from rates coming down in the fourth quarter.  We're liability sensitive, so that helped us out. That will level in the first quarter and in the rest of 2009.  Second, as you know and particularly in the month of November, there was a very volatile market, particularly in LIBOR and we are &#x2013; we're in LIBOR on the assets side of the equation.  So that helped us out a little bit.  The acquisitions actually are a bit negative to our net interest margin and once we have the full impact of the quarter in there, that's why we said we'd be in the low 360s.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris, it's Richard.  I'm going to go back and just confirm what we just said based on the way we defined tangible common, and you can define it however you want so we're not going to debate that, but based on our measurements we have indicated and would indicate here that when we would do another deal or transaction, we'd set a minimum limit for ourselves of 4%, the way we define it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is no magic about that. But we thought it would be instructive for our investors to know that we do think that there is a minimum level that is appropriate to have, no matter what your preferred or Tier 1 capital is, and we would make sure that we would go out and raise the difference to protect those levels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, everything in restructured loans gets reported as either current loan, delinquent loan or if it does, we default those into non-accrual.  Two comments on that: one, we've been doing this for over a couple of years.  One of the ways we measure that is looking at on residential mortgages anybody that eventually does go back into or does go into, for the first time, into foreclosure.  By that measurement, it's at about 13%.  And I will say though that has a blend of much older loans which are going to have a higher rate and that can get up to 20 to 30%, along with the newer ones that we have just restructured, which are obviously, seat least in the short term doing fine, but on a blended rate basis, are up through our data on the fourth quarter was 13% rate going back, not back into it, but into foreclosure.</p>

          <p>Brian, it's Richard. I would say, although a layman view, we do have some comps against some of our OCC brethren and we're slightly more successful than our peers have been.  I don't &#x2013; I don't exactly know that if the approaches we're all taking at the time at which we grab the customer and do what we can to restructure, but that's favorable.</p>
          <p>And I would say: we would do this again and again and again.  This is good business at times like this.  We have long given up the need to be dead right and hold onto the terms and conditions of a loan and put a customer out of their car, out of their home, out of their credit card.  We have found it for years to be smart to restructure, but it's never to our benefit to let the numbers lie or confuse any of you.  So, for us, it's not 100% guarantee it's going to stave off an eventual loss, but it's well worth the effort and in many cases it's proven to be successful.</p>

          <p>And then if I could just follow up, and not to beat a dead horse on the tangible common, but is there any piece of the securities portfolio you would highlight, the 4.5% basically assumes that a lot of this stuff will revert to par.  Is there any piece of the &#x2013; some piece of the securities portfolio that you would highlight as potentially actually being at risk of defaulting at some point in the future that we should kind of think about into '09?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brian, this is Andy again.  If you think about our portfolio of about $40 billion, about 60% of it is agency backed, mortgage backed securities, high quality. About 20% is municipal or treasury related securities, also high quality; and then we have about $3 billion of jumbo, about $1 billion of Alt-A and then some other debt securities in trust preferred.</p>
          <p>I would say that we've appropriately priced all of those and the stresses that occurred in this quarter relate to spread widening on some of those securities that I talked about.  We've reflected the losses through the other than temporary impairment and I'm fairly comfortable with the accounting there, so overall it's a high quality portfolio.  There may be additional stress; also in there is obviously the indiscernibleSIV portfolio, which is down to 1.225 billion now so, it's a high quality portfolio.  We've reflected the prices and the OTTI and the permanent impairment correctly.indiscernible</p>

          <p>Right.  So, we're not here to tell you that it's over and that we won't have any other further impairments, but based on the starting point of a year ago and 3.1 billion and both the pay-downs and the write-downs and the current position, we don't feel any longer that that is a material surprise activity for any us to forecast and while there may be some additional losses in the, we'll say tens of millions of dollars over the next few quarters, it's just that. And so, now we're down to just being a simple bank with earnings above the line and loan losses and reserve <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Todd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.  Rich, I was just wondering just in terms of your outlook on the credit side and expectations for just the higher loss levels going forward and NPAs and so forth.  What kind of unemployment scenario are you factoring in and as you've talked in the past kind of about your recession outlook and plan and so forth.  Can you give us a little &#x2013; just a little bit more color in terms of economic backdrop you're kind of factoring in, whether it's the auto lease residuals or the card portfolio and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, first I'll answer your question. We're looking at seven to 8% scenario, moving through to 8%, maybe even a little higher by year's end. So, we're not at the Armageddon 9.5, 10.5% kind a levels, but we're also reflecting what we see as the current world.  One thing I'll say, Todd, is as you know, because our portfolios are wholly prime-based in the credit card side and majority of that on the consumer side and all of that in the mortgage side, we probably haven't felt all the effects yet of the unemployment trickling into the customers inability to pay. In other words, at 6.5 or 6.7% unemployment you would probably agree with me that even most of us on this telephone call don't know a lot people unemployed.  It's just &#x2013; and those aren't the people that we've doing, making loans to, or doing business with on the lending side, but if all of a sudden you get 7.5, 8, 8.5% we're all going to start knowing people that have viable positions, that now have lost their job and they have assets that they owe banks to and all of those things.</p>
          <p>So, we're expecting to see something less than linear, perhaps something more than linear and that losses will start to move up as unemployment goes higher.  So, my point is that we've accounted for it that way. I don't think that you'll see our loan losses to be very predictable and pretty steady based on the quality of our portfolio, but where you've seen losses in credit cards, retail lending or home-based products, we'll just continue to see those move up over the course of 90 days in very steady way.</p>
          <p>On the charge-offs, it could come from commercial real estate or from commercial lending, C&amp;I lending, that's a little, we'll call it lumpier, and while 2008 will have been our look back on taking care of some fairly big losses in our California housing and development portfolio, those are done and paid for.  Now, I think in 2009 we'll have a fairly steady equal amount in losses in commercial real estate attributed to just more traditional, commercial real estate across our national footprint.  And on the C&amp;I side, I don't expect that to change a great deal.  I just think we'll continue to have new names replace prior names with a slight increase over the course of time.</p>
          <p>So for us, I think when the cycle is done, we'll have continued to enjoy a meaningful spread below the losses at most of our peers.  But we're going to see a meaningful increase from where we ended last year by the end of 2009 just because the world is going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that.  And just more specifically with the card portfolio, again, essentially a prime based portfolio, but as you mentioned before, potentially with the unemployment level perhaps exceeding 8%...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...in the near term.  It's over &#x2013; your loss rate is over 5% now.  I mean conceptually and again a big part of your loss coming through in the card portfolio, could that conceptually go over 6%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I got you. I know the sound bite you want now; so in quarter four, you see we're at 5.18% on credit cards.  We are going to forecast that to be slightly over six &#x2013; six to 6.5 at the end of this year, or a year from today as we're talking back on quarter four.  Not talking seven and eight, but we're not talking that it stays in the 5s. We see a continued atrophy to something more like 100 to 125 basis points above where it is.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  And hi, how are you?  Two quick questions, I just want to make sure I understood how the incremental 700 million of losses from the acquired portfolio is going to be treated.  That does or does not flow through the provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of those losses do not flow through the provision.  Most of the loans that we acquired are accounted for the fair value level and those have been marked down.  So, to the extent there's further markdowns against that over and above our expectations that would flow through.  But to the extent that &#x2013; they're at the fair value, that's already been marked down and will not flow through charge-offs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So the 1.6 billion taken at closing, the losses that &#x2013; the incremental loss above that you're saying was actually captured at the &#x2013; in the basis adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so think of it this way.  Eric, we purchased an entity that was $1.6 billion long in assets.  And our total loss expectation for the portfolio is just over $4.5 billion, of which about half is covered by the FDIC, covered guarantee.  So the remainder, let's call it 2.3 billion, you're really net against the long asset position of the 1.6 and that represents the 700 million that we really think economically will be a loss to U.S. Bancorp as reflected in our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and that's the basis adjustment for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, Andy we've marked those down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those assets we've markdown to 34%, consistent with what we talked about in both the presentation and our call here.  So, those have been markdown.  Our expectation loss is 34%, and that's how going through the math I described we get to the 700 million net number for ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Eric, I'm bringing it up because we will undoubtedly have something flow through provision,  I'm sure, but it won't be very much to the extent that we've already marked them down to 66% of original value and because we've accounted for so much of the stress that's happened in those portfolios at this point in time.  I will say though how grateful we are that we have that loss sharing agreement and the backstop that protects us given what could be a more dire scenario for some of those California, primarily California, assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you for that explanation; and just one other quick one.  I didn't understand from the press release, what happened with your tax rate in the period, can your just explain that to me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, simply stated we have a number of items that are tax benefited income items and to the extent that our revenues and our net income was lower those number &#x2013; those tax benefited revenue items were a bigger component of the overall income number therefore our tax rate went down.  We would expect it to go back upward to more normal levels in 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" />. I just wanted to say one last thing in terms of our closing comments.  I am very, as I said, disappointed about our top-line earnings, but I could tell you I'm very proud of the momentum we're building in this company.  And at the end of the day we'll be traded eventually on our core earnings with reasonable loan losses and with reserve build.  And I think you'll see that we will be one of those banks to come through this even stronger than we started.</p>
          <p>I also draw your attention to the rating agencies that have recently made a number of changes since the 1st of December, and at least as we speak to you today, both with S&amp;P and Moody's we now are alone as the most highly rated bank of our large bank peer group with AA rating and a stable outlook with S&amp;P and Aa2 and stable outlook with Moody's.  And we are quite proud of that and to the extent that you would agree that that's some reflection of the quality of both our balance sheet and our earnings ability.</p>
          <p>We close with that as one of our points of pride and certainly the employees here are using that to our benefit to continue to grab this opportunity that's been created in this environment where we are taking market share we are growing deposits and loans and we're able to continue to invest in some of the business you expect us to be investing in so that we're distinctly different and diversified in earnings and prepared for, I think, a better day when things start to improve.  So, that's all we have, and we thank you for your attention and interest in our company.</p>
