          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding. Welcome to the ASML 2012 Second Quarter Results Conference Call on July 18, 2012. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig DeYoung. Please go ahead, sir</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations here at ASML. I'd like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast. Joining me from our headquarters here in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, is Mr. Eric Meurice, ASML's CEO; and Mr. Peter Wennink, ASML's CFO.</p>
          <p>As the operator mentioned, the subject of today's call is ASML's second quarter 2012 results. However, on July 9, ASML announced a Co-Investment Program in which customers will potentially contribute up to &#x20AC;1.4 billion over the next five years to accelerate development of 450-millimeter wafer platform and the next generation of EUV systems, both expected to enter volume production in the second half of this decade. So we would welcome any remaining questions you might have about this program in addition to those questions you might have about our Q2 results.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in today's press release and in our second quarter results presentation, both of which you can find on our website at www.asml.com. This Safe Harbor Statement will apply to this call and all associated presentation materials. The length of the call will be 60 minutes as normal. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Meurice for a brief introduction. Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig. Good afternoon, good morning, thank you for attending our conference call. As usual, before we begin the Q&amp;A session, Peter would like to provide an overview and commentary on the second quarter result and provide an outlook for the year. I will myself complete the introduction with some further comments on market view longer term and about our strategy. So Peter, please, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric and welcome to everyone. Summarizing our second quarter, sales came in just above &#x20AC;1.2 billion, which is essentially the same as in the previous quarter. This quarter sales remained largely skewed towards the Foundry, IDM, sectors, which was about 73%, including non-critical KrF systems which is supporting the capacity additions.</p>
          <p>As in the first quarter, only 9% of second quarter sales went to the DRAM sector with just under 20% going to NAND customers. The average selling price of all systems recognized in the second quarter was &#x20AC;22.4 million, reflecting a bit higher immersion shipments than the first quarter. Service and field option sales came in at a record of &#x20AC;243 million, which is again driven by a significant adoption of system performance-enhancing field options.</p>
          <p>Updating our previously announced share buyback program. As of July 10, 2012, last week, ASML had repurchased 33.2 million shares of which 7.5 million shares in 2012 for a total amount of &#x20AC;970 million, of which &#x20AC;270 million in 2012, giving an average buyback price of &#x20AC;29. For regulatory reasons in connection with the Customer Co-Investment Program, which we announced last week, ASML has suspended its share buyback program from July 10, 2012, until further notice. And we intend to resume share buybacks when permitted under applicable regulations.</p>
          <p>The second quarter net bookings came in at 43 systems, valued at &#x20AC;949 million excluding EUV. Our book average selling prices came in at &#x20AC;22 million with the quarter's booking profile seeing a significant moderation in foundry orders at 36% of total orders, half of that &#x2013; basically half of what they were in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The balance of orders was almost evenly split between IDMs, NAND, and DRAM. Our order backlog at the end of the second quarter was &#x20AC;1.5 billion, excluding EUV, by the way, totaling 55 systems with a strong average selling price of &#x20AC;27.3 million. The backlog profile at the end of the quarter changed as combined memory moved upwards to 36% of total versus 23% at the end of the prior quarter. Much of that change coming from DRAM as it moved from 2% to 14% of the backlog. Reminding you, by the way, that this change is only four high-end units divided over three customers.</p>
          <p>As to the outlook, we estimate second-half sales coming in between &#x20AC;2.2 billion and &#x20AC;2.4 billion, with the third quarter estimate at &#x20AC;1.2 billion at a gross margin of 43%. R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses will be about &#x20AC;145 million for R&amp;D and &#x20AC;60 million for SG&amp;A, which is slightly above the previous quarters as we decided to upgrade and invest in our IT infrastructure throughout the remainder of the year. The second half looks to be sustained by an increase of system shipments supporting NAND shrink <mark type="ph" /> plans (5:48) and by a low but relatively stable level of DRAM system shipments.</p>
          <p>We see a lower 28-nanometer and 32-nanometer logic shipments in the second half compared with the first half and we see IDMs coming in slightly higher when compared to the first half of this year. The exact level of sales achieved in the second half will largely depend on the strength of NAND pick up to be mostly fueled by new ultrabook PCs and new smartphone ramps.</p>
          <p>And with that short summary, I would like to turn it back to you over &#x2013; to you, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. So, as confirmed by Peter the balance of 2012 looks in fact steady. This would lead to nine consecutive quarters of about &#x20AC;1.2 billion or more of sales. This is pretty good in a non-fully supportive economy worldwide.</p>
          <p>Further, our developing views on 2013 suggest that it will be supported by NAND and DRAM at the beginning of the year assuming a good pickup of the PC ultrabook business and a continuation of the high-end mobile unit growth, along with a steady shipment to IDM, which is also driven by PCs and the start-up of 20-nanometer foundry/logic by mid-year 2013.</p>
          <p>The reason for the acceleration of the logic business in 2013 is a shortened node transition period between the current 28-nanometer node and the future 22-nanometer node, which will be about only one year, driven by the current race for best integration, best feature set, best power consumption in the mobile arena where Intel architecture &#x2013; the Intel architecture and the ARM architecture will both play. This transition is also very, very lithography intensive as we expect between 1.7 and 2.0 times more immersion systems used per wafer start in 22-nanometer compared to 28-nanometer.</p>
          <p>EUV for R&amp;D use will also contribute to 2013 sales as we will ship up to 11 systems of the 3300 as we planned now for a long time. These will not contribute to production by customers; they will be only used for recipe engineering but this will create nearly &#x20AC;800 million of revenue for ASML, which will add up to the base sales for 2013.</p>
          <p>Technically, to keep our immersion leadership, we continue to enhance the overlay through good performance of our TWINSCAN NXT:1950 system. One of these systems, by the way, has exceeded productivity milestone, an enormous one, of more than 5,100 wafers in a single day at a customer manufacturing site, which is 600 wafer more per day than the previous record achieved only three months ago. It illustrates the continuing productivity improvement of our platforms for high-volume chip manufacturing.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will introduce a new version of the NXT even capable of higher performance, higher throughput, and also better overlay along with the install base upgrade by mid-2013.</p>
          <p>We will continue in parallel to develop and introduce the extensive line of holistic lithography software/hardware product so as to enable required process control machine matching improvement, which are necessary in the complex nodes of the future.</p>
          <p>As part of this product portfolio, our computational lithography unit Brion has delivered significant enhancement to its leading Mask 3D models and applications, which are required at the 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer node and below. The full accuracy of the Brion Mask 3D model can now be realized with virtually zero incremental computational cost versus substantially less accurate thin mask models.</p>
          <p>Regarding our EUV program, customers have now exposed more than 15,000 wafers on the six machines, six NXE:3100 process development systems which are currently installed. And we are confirming steady progress qualifying the platform towards customer production ramp &#x2013; well, in fact, the new platform towards customer production ramp for 2014. This platform has shown exceptional performance with a demonstrated 6 nanometer on-product overlay and with dedicated chuck overlay of less than 2 nanometer which is an extraordinary performance.</p>
          <p>We have made constant progress on the EUV source, which, as you know, has been, for a while, the critical <mark type="ph" /> pass (11:07) technology that we have to master. With regards to the productivity itself, 50-watt power capability has now been repeatedly demonstrated at one supplier and the 105-watt concept potential has been confirmed in lab experiments supporting our roadmap to volume production system starting at 70 wafer per hour in 2014 and upgradable to 125 wafer per hour two years later.</p>
          <p>However, in situ &#x2013; not only lab, but in situ experiments on the new machine called the NXE:3300, will be still necessary for full confirmation of this roadmap; although as already planned, we still target to gather in effects by late summer to prove and confirm that roadmap.</p>
          <p>In lieu of the progress made, we have received a customer commitment to purchase four additional NXE:3300 systems that makes it a total of 15, preparing in fact for the first semiconductor device production on EUV in 2014.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we are encouraged, as Peter said, by the short-term view 2012 and by the mid- to long-term prospect of this lithography market, which is very, very much driven by a huge industry technology transition appetite.</p>
          <p>So with this, Peter and I would be pleased to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric and thanks Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session, but beforehand and as always I'd like to ask you to kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up, if necessary. This will allow us to get as many callers in as possible.</p>
          <p>Now, Operator, could we have your instructions and the first caller, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, sir. Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Sumant Wahi. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Sumant Wahi from Redburn Partners. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my call. My question is actually more to do with the announcement last week, I mean, and your R&amp;D expense. Given the last week's announcement, you obviously intend to increase your R&amp;D budget by 25% I suppose starting from next year.</p>
          <p>And I was just wondering how you will be recording this on your P&amp;L and how will you be recording the cash from your customers, which is being paid for this extra R&amp;D. I mean should we be anticipating a contraction in your operating margin next year, and hence EPS, as well as a real revenue benefit from this higher R&amp;D-- will only be coming a few years &#x2013; in a few years' time. So that's my first question and I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think you should simulate at this moment any reduction of profitability short term through that deal. The accounting is going to be a bit different per customer, in case of a significant party. The accounting of these funding will be done below or above the gross margin line so there will be a bit of difficulty to trace all these numbers.</p>
          <p>But as a generality, we intend to manage the P&amp;L as we have always been doing, which is providing to the market a steady increase of profitability. We expect the steady increase to come through this funding a bit, but also through the fact that this acceleration of new products is going to deliver higher top line. So we're going to have a higher top line. We probably are going to have a higher gross margin because of these accounting situations. We are going to have a higher R&amp;D gross expense because &#x2013; in fact, we will invest more in R&amp;D for these accelerations. And a part of that will be compensated by the R&amp;D funding. But in any case, we do expect a steady increase of our profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously on higher revenues for next year I suppose, which is quite <mark type="ph" /> happy (15:59).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not guide 2013 yet, etc., but we expect higher profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my follow-up question very quickly is on the demand from the NAND sector, which is coming towards the second half. Is this more capacity expansion, i.e., new factories or mostly just technology upgrade? And kind of within that, I mean the bit growth you're expecting for DRAM and NAND this year and next year will be really helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on NAND it was &#x2013; the pickup we are expecting is a pickup that the customers will in fact see in their own shipment of semiconductors with &#x2013; by the beginning of 2013. So we are going to have to ship lithography tool and then six months or so later, you will see the chips. So we're talking about chips out in 2013, lithography in starting Q4, Q1, Q2 of 2013. This pickup will be new factories, yes, absolutely, and requirement for more machines because of the technology transition. So you're going to have the two drivers, more factories, more wafers and more machines per wafer to adapt to the new technology.</p>
          <p>Your next &#x2013; your other question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was on bit growth in DRAM and NAND for next year, I suppose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bit growth, so we're not just forecasting those. We just follow what Gartner says and at this moment, I think, Gartner kind of says 40-ish, 45% growth of DRAM, I guess and about 60% growth on NAND. If these numbers are realized, we will grow as we said. We also believe from what we heard from the importance of the new form factor PC and the new solid state drive, then the Gartner numbers may be conservative. So in other terms, if the Gartner numbers are what they are, they will sustain growth for us. And it is possible that the Gartner numbers are a bit conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Janardan Menon. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Janardan from Liberum Capital. Just to follow up a little bit on the memory side, you said that in the first half of next year, your sales will be more to the DRAM and NAND segment, and then with the foundries picking up around the middle of the year. So what kind of visibility do you have on that memory spending for the first half of next year? Do you have sort of commitments which are not yet reflected in your purchase orders and therefore not shown in your backlog? Or is it that you're expecting those orders to come through to you &#x2013; order commitments should come through to you over the next couple of quarters?</p>
          <p>And a follow-up is on EUV. You said you'll hit 70 wafers an hour by 2014, and 120 wafers a couple of years later. So what kind of throughput do you expect to get to when you start shipping the units at the end of this year or early next year for the NXE:3300?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So regarding the commitment backlog, et cetera, the answer is yes and yes. We have a startup of orders, bookings which came driven by the &#x2013; this growth curve. So we have a bit &#x2013; we have received a numbers of orders for that. But most of the orders haven't come yet. They are more commitment/production expectations. So they will come into the backlog through new bookings in Q3 and Q4.</p>
          <p>Regarding the speed of EUV, so the reason why we still don't have factual data on the speed itself of the EUV machine is because the lab experiments are driven in the lab as well as in -- on the 3100 architecture, which is not similar architecture than the 3300 machine which is planned to be available to experiment by October-November timeframe. So only by then we will know exactly how all these technologies, how do you say, get installed onto the -- quote-unquote -- final machine.</p>
          <p>The minimum performance from what we can see at this moment would be &#x2013; I would say a 30-ish wafer per hour if we get unlucky on the first machine with more work to stabilize the controls mechanism &#x2013; control mechanism, potentially taking three months, six months, or so, to get to a point where the 30 wafer per hour will transform itself in 70.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you get to 30 by the end of this year, would that be enough to convince your customers to move EUV into volume production in 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We already got the orders for four, we are negotiating a number, additional number. The data today is good enough to suggest that you should start investing into production 2014. I would even say to you with the data that we have today, if we were to stop immediate development, we would get to this 30-40 wafer per hour so without any more development based on the new machine, the 3300, which is much more effective &#x2013; energy effective. And that already would not be a bad number for production. So the level of customer risk for 2014 at this moment has reduced significantly.</p>
          <p>Now, don't get me to say that 40 wafer per hour is a good number and it's my new commitment. It's not what I mean. But it says that the worst case situation in case a terrible situation happens, which we can't do even any progress is already not a catastrophe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. St&#xE9;phane Houri. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. St&#xE9;phane Houri, Natixis. Two questions if I may. The first one is that you're talking already of the 22-nanometer or 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer transition and you're saying there is some weakness in the 28-nanometer to 32-nanometer. Can you tell us where we are exactly in the current transition? And you also said that 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer was twice as much litho intensive that the previous generation. Can you remind us how much more intensive is the 32-nanometer for the 28-nanometer?</p>
          <p>And also, second question on the bunch of orders for EUV, can you specify if it's for memory, if it's only for one customer, and I heard you say that you are negotiating currently. Are you currently negotiating a new bunch of order?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So a good set of questions. So I didn't say that 28-nanometer was weak. I said that we are getting to the end of the build-up of 28-nanometer capacity. So, if we ship all the plans up to the end of Q4, we would have reached about 200,000 wafer per months, 200,000, 220,000, okay.</p>
          <p>There is a set of customers who would tell us that 28-nanometer will continue well into 2013 and there are plans at this moment to get from this 200,000, 220,000 to about 350,000 wafer per months capacity. So, if I were to listen to customers at this moment I would in fact tell you that 28-nanometer is only 70% done and you need another 30% or whatever capacity to be built on by the &#x2013; even with upside possibility by Q4 and clearly a significant shipment in Q1 and Q2 2013. So, call it a potential upside for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So 2028 in our press release is like we would have expected this to stabilize at 220,000, 230,000 wafers. But people are talking about more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer is usually would have started in 2014. But in view of the huge drive by the mobile environment in which you have the big fight between the ARM architecture and the Intel architecture, both architecture driving to excellence, and excellence being very far away. Let me try to explain.</p>
          <p>When you get to an application where you still have multiple chips, you have a chipset into a smartphone, you know that you're forced to try to get the chipset to be integrated onto one chip. Until that continues, there will be a huge incentive to customers to try to make that leap and get to the next technology, which allows you to have the famous one-chip solution.</p>
          <p>So we expect the one-chip solution to happen beyond 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer, and we expect this to be a hard-fought battle between the Intel architecture and the ARM architecture. So that creates a momentum in the market on the side of Intel and on the side of the others to build up these new technologies faster than ever before.</p>
          <p>So that will benefit lithography because in addition those technologies are very complicated to build. As I said, 1.7 times to 2.0 times more lithography intensive by wafer on 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer versus 28-nanometer, 32-nanometer, because the 28-nanometer, 32-nanometer is the same node. So if you wanted to compare 28-nanometer, 32-nanometer, to 45-nanometer, I cannot answer your question easily, but we can get you that data in due time, if you call, Franki or Craig.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding EUV, so yes, at that moment, the units that we have accepted on order are for DRAM. As we always said, DRAM, at least two critical layers are so complicated that I guess, if we do not execute EUV by 2014, there will be a delay in the shrink. So customers have realized that and therefore have usually incentivized to do that.</p>
          <p>The second set of &#x2013; batch of orders that we are currently negotiating are for also 2014 and they are for DRAM. The third set is for logic. And in logic arena, we expect to have to be in production for 2015 or so in a node, which will be called anywhere near 14-nanometer or 11-nanometer or 12-nanometer, whatever, but they will mean the same thing.</p>
          <p>You're going to have in the logic arena a node which will look like a 20-nanometer design rule using architectures of transistors like thin-fat. That would be a node that will come just beyond 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer. And then, on the back of it, there will be in 2015 or so, a node of &#x2013; using the same type of architecture thin-fat but with a shrink factor. And that node will be called 14-nanometer or 12-nanometer or whatever for, I would say, marketing reasons. And that node is &#x2013; absolutely requires EUV. Without EUV you cannot shrink.</p>
          <p>So, in other terms, if I make myself clear, you're going to have 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer, you're going to have 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer with a type of thin-fat architecture which allows an improved performance but not yet a shrink, and you're going to have that technology shrunk and that will happen from now on until 2015, 2016, and that's, again, hugely lithography-intensive.</p>
          <p>Even &#x2013; whether you use immersion, double double patterning, or you use EUV, you're talking about a huge numbers of critical layers and a huge number of lithography-enabling tools like the holistic lithography set of products that we have. So, we see logic dwarfing basically DRAM anyway by 2015 or so back <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:10).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just on your question what the difference was between the 28-nanometer and the 20-nanometer node in terms of lithography usage, on the 28-nanometer node the average that we've looked at is about one or two double patterning layers for the 28-nanometer node going to about 10 at 20-nanometer. So that is quite a significant increase in double patterning. Of course, some of that we will compensate by giving customers access to new technology that gives them higher throughput and better yields. So some of it will be compensated through the new technology that we're shipping</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. It's Goldman Sachs. Actually, I had a similar question about the layer intensity. But I'm wondering whether maybe you could help us understand how we should translate that sort of layer intensity into a percentage of sales computation. I think the one thing that is obvious that &#x2013; is that lithography has clearly been the one area in semi CapEx overall, or we just have equipment at least where capital intensity is not falling. But the historical average I think is sort of in the 15% range. Any sense as to whether that 15% is now structurally 20% or 18% or any sort of measure to the top of increase that you may expect will be very helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We think we reaching &#x2013; we will be reaching more and more towards 20%, 22% mainly also because we &#x2013; I think, we are more intensive in lithography in the logic arena. So in this &#x2013; and logic may represent a bigger share than it used to. So that's also a factor that tells us that we can get into a higher percentage of the total CapEx, semiconductor CapEx.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, that's very clear. Thank you.</p>
          <p>And my second question actually is on the capital structure, obviously, great to see the announcement from last week and a big underpinning of your positioning. But the one thing, of course, it doesn't really change is the fact that when all is said and done, your capital structure arguably is still relatively cash rich if you're in a good environment cyclically. So any update as to what you may look to do then once the transaction is complete? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's going to be a repeat of what we said last quarter. Basically, we have the policy to return cash that we don't need, and we do that through share buybacks and through dividends whereby the latter, we intend to let it grow. But once we have decided to let it grow, it &#x2013; at least it has to be stable at that level.</p>
          <p>Clearly, what we have decided internally that we will use the fall period to reassess every one or two years. We are going to reassess the policy &#x2013; the capital policy of the company and we're going to review whether the ratio between share buybacks and dividends as we have seen in the past &#x2013; whether that should remain or whether we should adapt that to different use. So that is more or less, say, further detailing of our overall policy, which is the money that we don't need we will give back.</p>
          <p>As I said in my introductory comments, we have temporarily suspended the share buyback program because of regulatory reasons. Once those have been resolved as &#x2013; and they result from the transaction that you mentioned last week, then we will just resume our share buybacks as we did before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mahesh Sanganeria, RBC Capital Markets. Eric, I have a question on the four new EUV tools. Are there commercial agreements and margins and throughput commitment in all those &#x2013; are they similar to the first 11 tools or this four have a different arrangement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good news, they are a different arrangement. Bad news, they are different arrangement. As some of you know, the 11 original tools are as is because the customers accepted to participate to this project as a R&amp;D project. As we know, this is beyond commercial relationship. This is a development of a new technology. So they accepted to take the <mark type="ph" /> 2D (33:56) 11 tools as is so we can ship at the best specification we can get and that's it, which is why we believe that we are going to recognize revenue next year no matter what the exact performance of the tool is.</p>
          <p>However, we mentioned clearly to the customers that we now are ready to take firm commitment on the specification. We did not get pushed back from the customers. Indeed, they understand that we have to take those responsibility, which solidifies in fact the fact that we are serious for production in 2014. So the specification indeed says that you've got to pay this price for a machine capable of 70 wafer per hour, upgradable within two years to 125 wafers per hour.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on &#x2013; question on the near term. As you look in the second half, in terms of your order profile, will it be similar to Q2 that memory and logic split almost 50/50? Or are you seeing more memory in the second half in terms of orders?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Difficult to call the bookings. As usual, as we said to you ten times, it's a bit difficult to time the bookings. It depends on the customers. Sometimes they book with three months lead time, sometimes they book with six months, sometimes they book with nine months. If it's logic, it's sometimes longer cycle times <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:21). So, your question is nearly impossible to answer. I could say that I should &#x2013; we should get in Q3 more memory bookings than we should logic, but I would not even be sure of that. So sorry, I retire my comment. It can be anything. But really...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, JPMorgan. Thanks for letting me on. Eric, I have &#x2013; just a question. I mean, overall in the comments you've made in the release this morning, ASML seems to be much more sanguine or bullish than the peers in semi cap. So I mean, can you make a comment on why you think you are different versus your peer group? I mean, is it because of your long lead times? Is it your market share? So, what do you think internally is the reason for that? And I have one follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's difficult for me to judge how our peers are seeing what they are seeing and the specifics of their technologies, but I can guess that the lead time is a key point that we are starting to see what they haven't yet seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just moving on in terms of your existing product mix, seeing that lithography has been increasing as a percentage of sales for your customers, but also your customers are seeing a lot of concentration. We've seen DRAM has concentrated quite significantly over the last couple of years. Do you see that as a risk for your ASP, say, two years from now despite your own very strong market position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact I see the opposite. The consolidation has two values. One, it creates an opportunity for customers to have R&amp;D capability. And the fear factor for us remains only whether customers can shrink. If customer can shrink and they're not designed to take the shrink, lithography will be a huge growth business for the future. So the fundamental is we need customers capable of shrinking. We need customers capable of R&amp;D. So, and therefore we are very, very happy with consolidation. This is huge compared to any commercial short-term situation.</p>
          <p>The second bit about consolidation is what happened last week is in fact due to the fact that the consolidation of large customers allows us to make a point that this already becomes a nature or it's a weapon required by the whole industry for the whole industry's benefit. And if you had 15, 20 customers, this message would have been extremely difficult to pass where the 15, 20 customers would fight themselves to try to have a smart way of solving the lithography system. But with fundamental, say 10, 8 large customers, they understand that lithography has become the weapons that they have to help to subsidize to get going for their own business model, which at the end of the day is designing chips for shrink.</p>
          <p>So consolidation is a very good thing for that and it has helped us tremendously in the discussions of the deal, first with Intel, and at this moment with the others.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, it's Merrill Lynch. Thanks for taking my question. My first question if I may is about gross margins. Can you maybe talk about the underlying gross margin assumption we should have for 2013 on the EUV machines and whether you also have maybe slightly higher or improved gross margin for the non-EUV part of the business? And I've got a quick follow-up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've &#x2013; as a danger of repeating myself, last quarter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:54) said that the gross margin target for 2013 is the high 20s. That is what we are focusing at &#x2013; on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EUV.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EUV, yes, yes, thank you, Eric. Just to make that sure. And we need about a two years period to get to the corporate average. That's what we've said before. This is still our target.</p>
          <p>Now, on the gross margin of the non-EUV tools you can always &#x2013; if you really look a bit deeper into our current results and you look at our gross margins that we are currently showing, that gross margin currently includes running EUV cost that we have in the EUV factory that we currently have. So, the gross margins stay where they are from a corporate point of view.</p>
          <p>So, from &#x2013; we'll call it &#x2013; average point of view they stay flat while our costs have gone up. So, you can deduce from that that the underlying gross margins of our non-EUV tools have actually gone up, which is true. And that has been driven by the increase of the system enhancements which we sell on top of the bare tool. That has, let's say, given a positive side or a &#x2013; what I've said, positive boost to the gross margin profile of the non-EUV tools and has helped us cover the current EUV running costs that are not part of cost of goods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, brilliant, that's very clear. And then a quick follow-up to one of your statements, Eric, a bit earlier. You said that at 28-nanometer for logic, the build-up is more or less finished in your view, but one &#x2013; or at least some of your customers want to increase that to 350,000 wafer per month. So I'm just trying to understand what exactly you're trying to say there? Is one of your customers trying to substantially increase capacity and you don't believe them or how should we understand that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think what I tried to say is that in the current press release, we are not taking care of the possibility of an upside.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question asked &#x2013; and it's not our opinion, sorry, then I missed it, I did not communicate our opinion. We did not want in the press release to say the &#x20AC;2.2 billion to &#x20AC;2.4 billion guidance reflect an upside. It doesn't. Now, there's always a possibility of an upside. Why would they go for an upside? What's the rationale? The rationale is that they have underinvested in 45-nanometer &#x2013; 40-nanometer, 45-nanometer. The 65-nanometer was a big node, 28-nanometer could be a very big node to compensate for the fact that they didn't transfer too many things on 45-nanometer.</p>
          <p>So there is a business model out there that says in fact 28-nanometer should be bigger. And we don't have an opinion on that, we have to see whether they are right, and whether in fact there is going to be so many mobile systems, et cetera. If you talk to the fabless guys and they talk about the potential numbers for smartphones at 2 billion, we are going from 1.2 billion or so, 1.2 billion, 1.3 billion to 2 billion, if that's the case, yeah. You can imagine that they will need much more wafers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just so I understand, your guidance for Q4, whether what you're talking about at the moment does not include this potential upside and what's your concern about this, what the macro side and the fact that yields of 28-nanometer are going to get better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no because we usually don't guide just on rumors, so that's all it is. Don't read anything that &#x2013; we don't believe in anything.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's UBS. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on 20-nanometer lithography requirements. I think you're now saying effectively that the requirements of the 28-nanometer would be 70% to 100% higher. I think previously, you've said somewhere around 60% higher. I just wondered what the increment that you've learned in the last few months has been &#x2013; has warranted that increase in intensity as you look forward?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, I guess, one for Peter, maybe, in terms of hiring the additional R&amp;D staff that you need, the 25% to 30% additional R&amp;D engineers. What, I guess, problem that poses and whether you feel that you can get the available labor for 450 <mark type="ph" /> millimeter (44:55) and this second phase of EUV? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I can answer the 20-nanometer. You talked about our ratio 1.7 to 2.0 times more. I think we always said that. I do not remember having said less than that. In fact, we were waiting a bit to know if that ratio is based on the same yield and the same utilization rate than 28-nanometer because you don't want to be biased by a difficult start and the 2.0 times &#x2013; 1.7 to 2.0 times is based on a good start. So if 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer is a big issue, where they have trouble to do yield and to do utilization, then we will have to ship even more than what we planned. So this number that we have is a &#x2013; acceptable economic target.</p>
          <p>Regarding the R&amp;D build up, maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; like we said, we need between 1,000 and 1,500 engineers. We don't intend to put all those people on the payroll. As you know, we have a flex model. We have dozens of companies that actually help us find those people. Those are specialized engineering companies, which are basically temp labor companies. So they are already gearing up.</p>
          <p>I think I mentioned it on the previous call that over the least 12 to 18 months, about 50% of the people that we hired were non-Dutch, so we basically get them out of the European zone. So we're not confined to the Netherlands only. So it is us and our supply chain &#x2013; which I mean the flex labor supply chain that have to deal with this particular challenge. But also some of that work and I think a significant part of that work will go into the supply chain with our knowledge and research institute partners, which of course have also people available now and especially in this macroeconomic circumstances. And they're glad to take up the challenge to provide us with additional engineers.</p>
          <p>So, yes, it is going to be &#x2013; and also it's going to take a bit of time until we ramp to the peak of the program, where two, three, years down the road &#x2013; probably two years &#x2013; which also gives us a bit of time to actually hire those engineers. And hiring 750 or 800 engineers per year, we've done that before. So yeah, it will be a challenge for our HR organization, but in these times, that's a nice challenge.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Francois Meunier. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello. It's Francois at Morgan Stanley. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a very simple question actually because the announcement last week was also about 450-millimeter. Is 450-millimeter a good thing for ASML?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a bad thing. It's a &#x2013; I think it's a good thing for the industry, so it's going to be a good thing for us. As you know, you may be asking the question because some of our peers are concerned about 450-millimeter. If you are a chamber type business, 450-millimeter is a big problem. Because the same chamber in the same time would process twice as many dies. So theoretically, if your price is about the same because the chamber at the same price, you would cut your business by a factor of two. So 450-millimeter would be a very negative point for a chamber type business.</p>
          <p>We're not a chamber type business. We are a painting business. The painter is a big lens and it paints centimeter by centimeter or nanometer by nanometer. And therefore, if you had on the same wafer more nanometer, well, the painter will spend more time. So the machine itself, you will need as many machine per square centimeter on a 300-millimeter base or 450-millimeter. It doesn't change at all our economics.</p>
          <p>We were a bit concerned that we would have to do this work without the industry completely aligned on the specification and the timing and we would have to overinvest in R&amp;D in a wait-and-see attitude and then as usual wait and then have the machine ready, nobody takes it and then two or three years later, somebody takes it. That would have been a cost inefficient way.</p>
          <p>Now, with this consortium that we built, we are now pretty happy that the execution is an execution between consolidated customers, consolidated whatever suppliers, and we can align the dates, align the money, and therefore, do this in the most efficient way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, a bit of a follow up on this one. Would you say &#x2013; I mean you're probably have to redesign the chassis because the &#x2013; obviously the wafer will be &#x2013; it would be quite bigger as it happened before when you switched from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter. Is the price going to change much basically for a given machine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The price will go up by a factor about 10%-ish if we execute correctly, between the 300-millimeter machine and the 450-millimeter machine of the equivalent spec. But in 2018, when those machines will be in production, a 300-millimeter machine will cost 'X' times more than what we are doing today.</p>
          <p>So the NXT machine off 200 &#x2013; 300-millimeter machine of 2018 will cost &#x2013; I don't want to give you a number, but in the &#x20AC;70 million anyway. So, and the 450-millimeter equivalent would cost &#x20AC;77 million or something of this nature. So the ASP growth comes through the resolution and the performance of the machine relay...</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And not so much of the die size &#x2013; I mean, sorry, the wafer size. The wafer size will get us an additional inflation of 10%, roughly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we agree to push from the biggest maker of chips today. Do you think the results will follow or they are still discussing and feeling a bit scared about actually moving to 450-millimeter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So sorry, are you asking the question, are they joining the consortium or are they joining 450-millimeter or both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>450-millimeter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, 450-millimeter. On 450-millimeter it is not abnormal when a leader leads and you need one to be on top momentum in the industry and I think Intel has been clear that they wanted to do so. And they believe that it's good for the industry for them to sponsor that technology. And that will be useful for the others to get in when in fact this infrastructure will exist again helped by Intel. At this moment we suppose that the best date for really production, and I don't mean recipe, R&amp;D, and all that stuff would be 2018 or so.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna International. Two question. First on EUV, how should we think about the booking and revenue recognition? When would you start to actually include it? And to get the revenue recognition, what are the key milestone and would it take more than one quarter. And I do have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the revenue recognition, Eric, said it's &#x2013; I think at the beginning of this call and somebody asked a similar question &#x2013; we have &#x2013; for the first 11-12 units we have an agreement with our customers that they accept the tools as is because it's more an R&amp;D project. And we basically share the risk of the introduction of that tool. So that will be when we ship the tool, we book the revenue, but also we will book the order. I mean, you know how many orders we have. So if you want to see when it flows into the backlog and when it goes out, it will be a turns business when we ship. So, we give you separate number of units that we have on the order.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, we said, the tools that we are booking today, they will &#x2013; they are currently being booked with a certain performance and a criterion that we need to meet at shipment, which will be for 2014, which will basically mean that we will have revenue, no recognition as we have it today. And then also we will have bookings as we have it today. But for the first 12, so that's for next 12 months, you will see turns when we book the revenue for the first 11-12 units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just one very quick follow-up on the foundry-related booking and how the capital intensity could go up by two times. And in terms of the dollar value of booking, should we expect similar trends like last year where foundries took a pause, it did have an adverse impact on the overall booking. But in the end, it came back very strong in Q4 of last year with shipment for 2012. Should we assume the same kind of trend, especially given the higher dollar of booking because of the increased capital intensity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know. We're getting bookings. Timing is an impossible question. We just don't know. Everything is possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Jagadish Iyer. Please state you company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Piper Jaffray. Two questions. First, Eric, you had called out the color in terms of DRAM and NAND for the first half of 2013 and also Foundry for the second half. I was just wondering how should we think about overall immersion tool shipments in 2013 directionally given that you're concurrently going to be shipping several EUV systems? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want me to guide on 2013, but I will resist. So, I'm not going to help you. No, no, no. It's too early. It's too early. What we said at the beginning of the call is we have numbers of positive drivers. The biggest one is the 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer ramp, which could be a big one.</p>
          <p>As I said, it's a multiplier by 1.7 to 2.0 times the run rate of 28-nanometer. So if it starts early enough in 2013 and you will have a run rate which is 1.7 &#x2013; double time what will happen in 2012, then of course it only be six months. But then, in the first six months, if you have NAND and DRAM as we said, we are going to have, and if the upside on 28-nanometer comes in, 2013 is a fairly good year. And therefore there is growth of immersion tools. Then you add to this the famous &#x20AC;800 million of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:50) and then 2013 is a pretty good year.</p>
          <p>But it is too early. It is six months. 22-nanometer may be delayed because of a technology issue. QUALCOMM may say the price is too high, so I'm not going to convert my 28-nanometer to 22-nanometer so quickly. You may have some impact. So, it's too &#x2013; early to be on top your -- a firm scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; fair enough. So, just a follow-up on the EUV. I was just wondering how are you going to be de-risking yourself in terms of the laser source vendors. It looks like one of them is head of the pack. I was just wondering that given that that could be so many challenges ahead. So, how are you de-risking yourself and how are you pushing the other vendors to come up to certain level in terms of the source power, so that you can kind of pick and choose between those vendors? Any color on that will be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. So, indeed at this moment one of the vendor is ahead of the pack as you know and as you also know we are investing significantly into this relationship for them to succeed. On the other hand, it is our responsibility to de-risk the situation. So, there are numbers of ways of de-risking. One is we are still working with Ushio and with Gigaphoton on their own business model. Clearly one of them has a business model of insertion of EUV in due time. So, this is not a race of only one horse.</p>
          <p>The timing is not immediate, however, it does help in the R&amp;D &#x2013; sorry, it does help in the production &#x2013; that environment, because production as we said is only a start in 2014, 2015, but then in 2016, 2017, 2018, is when the unit comes in. So, if you have a second player coming for production it's a de-risking situation.</p>
          <p>On the other hand also, we are building as you know a knowledge of the sources, and so for us, it would be easier also to know what to do in case we need to be even more involved into source development.</p>
