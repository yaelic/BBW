          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Second Quarter 2009 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keisha and I will be your operator for today. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Keisha. Well good morning to everybody and welcome to ConocoPhillips' second quarter conference call. Joining me this morning is our Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO, Sig Cornelius.</p>
          <p>Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings press release and updated supplemental information package and posted the slides we'll be using on this teleconference. You can find this information on our website.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed that we made some changes from what we've shared over the past several years regarding the content of our earnings release and the conference call slides. These changes were made with the intent to be more consistent with our SEC filings without reducing the information you've received in the past. The most significant change is the use of year-over-year rather than sequential variations as the basis for discussing our most recent quarterly results.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I need to direct you to our Safe Harbor statement on page two. This is our standard reminder that we're going to use forward-looking statements that may be made during our presentation in response to questions you may have and our actual results may be materially different than the answers we provide today. The sources of those material differences can be found in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>So, now I'll turn the call over to our Senior VP of Finance and CFO, Sig Cornelius.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clayton. I'll start my comments on page three, which shows a summary of our key operating and financial performance for the quarter. Earnings for the quarter were $1.3 billion or $0.87 per share with cash from operations of $2.6 billion. We ended the quarter with debt of $30.4 billion resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 34% which is flat versus last quarter. Operationally we delivered strong results.</p>
          <p>Compared to last year, E&amp;P production was up by 7%. In addition, operating costs across the company were down by more than 15% due to market improvements and other cost reduction initiatives. Although these factors were positive, the combined impact of continued low Northern American natural gas prices and weak realized refining margins created significant headwind for us.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page four, total earnings were down by 76% compared to last year. The slide shows changes in the various reporting segments. The biggest decrease was in our E&amp;P segment driven by lower oil and gas prices. Prices and margins were also the largest driver in our downstream segment and resulted in a loss of $52 million compared to earnings of $664 million last year.</p>
          <p>For all segments, prices, margins and other market impacts decreased our earnings by nearly $5.4 billion in aggregate. This was partially offset by higher volumes, primarily in our E&amp;P segment and after-tax cost reduction benefits of more than $450 million across the company.</p>
          <p>Page five speaks to our cash flow performance. We generated $3 billion of cash from operations excluding working capital changes. Working capital increased by $400 million this quarter primarily related to timing of tax payments. These items, coupled with a capital spend of $2.9 billion and dividends of $700 million resulted in an overall debt increase of $1 billion this quarter.</p>
          <p>I'm moving now to a review of our segment performance, starting with total company production on page six. Overall E&amp;P production was up 7% or 122,000 BOE per day versus last year. Market factors accounted for approximately 25% of this increase. This included positive PSC adjustments and benefits from sliding scale royalty rates in Canada which were partially offset by OPEC curtailments. Excluding these market impacts, production was up 92,000 BOE per day or a little over 5%.</p>
          <p>In our operations category, production from new projects more than offset decline in other operational factors. We had a total increase of over 175,000 BOE per day from new developments and projects startups. This includes YK in Russia, BritSats and other new wells in the UK, Alvheim in Norway, and Su Tu Vang in Vietnam. We're also seeing production increases from our heavy oil projects in Canada. Finally, in the second quarter of this year, the new Bohai Bay FPSO came online.</p>
          <p>When you add our share of LUKOIL production which is an estimated 442,000 BOE per day, the total company production was a little over 2.3 million BOE per day for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to page seven. Total E&amp;P earnings for the second quarter were $725 million, down from $4 billion last year. The tables on the bottom of the page show the earnings variances by geographic area and changes in price realizations. On the left hand side, you can see that the earnings variances are fairly evenly split between US and international.</p>
          <p>Moving to the right side of the table, you can see the significant decline in realized prices year-over-year. Compared to last year, natural gas and NGL prices were down around 60% and crude oil prices were approximately 50% lower. In total, lower prices negatively impacted earnings by around $4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>After including the price impacts on production taxes, the overall decrease was $3.9 billion which is shown on the second bar from the left on the chart. Although production volumes were up 7%, our overall sales volumes were up only 5% reflecting an overlooked position in the second quarter of last year. This higher sales volume resulted in an increase to earnings of approximately $650 million.</p>
          <p>Overall operating costs are lower, consistent with our performance in the first quarter. On a pre-tax basis, costs were down around $275 million compared to last year. Market factors such as foreign currency and utility rates represented about 75% of this savings. The balance is due to savings and operations from lower activity levels, lower service costs and portfolio changes which is partially offset by higher costs for new production.</p>
          <p>The other bar includes two special items. First, we had an impairment of $51 million for the expropriation of our Ecuador assets after we suspended operations there on July 16. In addition, we also booked a $37 million after-tax asset retirement charge related to an incident on June 8 at our Ekofisk 24/W water injection platform. The other bar also reflects an after-tax increase of $75 million in DD&amp;A, predominantly due to the increased production and major project startups that I referenced earlier.</p>
          <p>The R&amp;M earnings variance is shown on page eight. It was a tough quarter for refining as margins decreased significantly and demand remained weak particularly for distillates. Compared to last year, the overall global market refining crack spread decreased by over 40% resulting in a $1 billion earnings decrease for refining. As shown on the graph and the margins and other market impacts bar, overall margins were down by $770 million, reflecting some clawback from higher relative values for secondary co-products such as coke and fuel oil.</p>
          <p>US refining market capture was less than 50% this quarter, which is down compared to recent quarters and the second quarter of 2008. The main driver of this lower capture was low distillate margins and compressed light heavy crude differentials. Compared to the second quarter last year, distillate cracks were down over $20 per barrel and heavy crude sour differentials tightened by more than 70%.</p>
          <p>On the volume side, we had a 5% decrease in global refining utilization compared to last year due to continued weak hydroskimming economics and optimization of margins based on market conditions. In addition, we also had higher turnaround activity in our international operations this past quarter.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax operating costs were down around $400 million. This was fairly equally split between market factors and operational savings which included lower turnaround cost, staff cost, and other maintenance and operating items. Included in the bar labeled other is a non-cash after-tax impairment of $72 million, primarily due to the allocation of goodwill to the pending sale of our interest in the Keystone Pipeline project.</p>
          <p>I'll now move to page nine, which shows the variances for our LUKOIL segment. LUKOIL earnings were $682 million for the quarter which is down 11% from last year. The biggest driver of the change is lower estimated prices and market impacts which account for more than $500 million of the decline and is consistent with the results we are seeing in E&amp;P. Offsetting this market decline is a benefit from the true-up of our estimated results to LUKOIL's reported earnings which occurs on a one quarter lag.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter last year, we had a negative true-up of $120 million compared to a positive true-up of $192 million for this quarter. This gives us an overall true-up delta of $312 million. The reported earnings also reflect a variance of $73 million related to basis amortization differences.</p>
          <p>Page 10 shows the variances for all our other segments. In Midstream we experienced lower results due to significantly lower NGL prices and lower volumes. Our share of CPChem results were $50 million higher due to cost reductions and lower turnaround activities which were partially offset by lower olefins and polyolefins margins. Corporate expenses were $157 million after-tax for the quarter. Compared to last year, larger foreign currency gains and lower costs were partially offset by higher net interest expense.</p>
          <p>That completes the review of our second quarter results. I'll wrap up with some comments on our operational and strategic items that are shown on page 11.</p>
          <p>I'll start with our outlook for the balance of 2009. As we signaled last quarter, we expect E&amp;P production to be up slightly for the full year compared to 2008. We expect to get back some of our year-to-date gains over the next two quarters as we execute our normal seasonal maintenance programs and begin to see the impacts of reduced gas drilling activity in North America. Additionally we are experiencing some unplanned decreases due to the Ekofisk platform incident and expropriation of our Ecuador interest.</p>
          <p>Our global refining utilization for the balance of the year is dependent on economic conditions. In an environment like we are experiencing today, we would expect it to be in the mid 80% range average across the portfolio with higher rates in the US and lower rates internationally. We are still assuming a capital program of $12.5 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>With respect to cost reductions, we have realized savings of around $900 million pre-tax so far this year excluding exploration. This compares to our full year objective of $1.4 billion. We set our full year objective based on an expectation that we would see benefits from the price environment as well as operating savings from activity levels, service cost deflation, and personnel reductions. So far this year, we've seen a benefit of around $800 million from market factors such as energy costs, utility rates, and currency impacts.</p>
          <p>Operationally, our net reduction is around $100 million which includes savings in our base operations partially offset by higher costs on our new E&amp;P projects. Continuation of the market savings will depend on future commodity prices and currency rates. Given our current outlook, we expect to meet our full-year target.</p>
          <p>Moving to an update on some of our projects, I mentioned earlier that new production from our major projects and developments are more than offsetting decline. The projects are performing in line with expectations, and are in various stages of ramp-up. We will continue to see volume increases in Canadian heavy oil projects and in Bohai Bay as we move into next year and through 2011.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we expect to bring on the North Balut field, which is part of our Block B PSC in the Natuna Sea. On the downstream side, we plan to commission the new hydrocracker at our San Francisco refinery during the third quarter. After the unit comes online, we will see clean product yield increase by around 15% or more, and we'll also get a small increase in the amount of heavy sour crude that the refinery can process.</p>
          <p>On the exploration front, we are encouraged by the promising results from our Poseidon well in the Browse Basin of Australia. Additional appraisal drilling and testing will be needed to determine the size and commerciality of this discovery. We are currently drilling in the Kontiki prospect in the same area, and we'll be going back for additional appraisal drilling on the Poseidon structure once this well is finished.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we executed the agreements for Block N in Kazakhstan. Our next step is to obtain seismic data with the goal of drilling in the later half of 2010 or early 2011 on this world-class prospect.</p>
          <p>That completes my prepared remarks and I will now open the call for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Keisha, I don't know if we've got some people interested in asking questions, but now would be the time.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Neil McMahon. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein. Just a few questions, just looking at the chemicals results, a little small in the overall scheme of things. Has the cost reduction there been a structural change, or has it been driven more by your energy cost reduction over the first half of the year? I just wonder if it's structural versus something that could actually change based on input cost drivers, and I've got a few other questions too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's primarily on the input costs. There have been some structural changes, flow through with the JV with Dow and Styrenics, but that's largely the environmental things that are flowing through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just turning to the Browse Basin, is there anything like &#x2013; I just, you started, I think you are a week or two into the Kontiki well. Is there anything that you've come up with in the last few months on Poseidon that's given you any additional information versus when you had finished drilling the well? Just wanting any more clarification on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no new information on the Poseidon well. As you might know, we had some operational difficulties that affected our ability to test that well, and we had to abandon the well. So, we don't have any further information to process at this point. We will be going back to the Poseidon structure after the Kontiki well is finished, which we anticipate will be in the next 60 or 90 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that when you do finish the Kontiki well, you will give any further information about the potential from both the &#x2013; well, hopefully it's a discovery for you as well. But from the first two wells, because we haven't had a news release from you yet on the drilling so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they are separate structures, so it will depend on how the drilling goes at that point. So, that's all I'd say about it right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a last quick one on Yanbu, it looks like yourselves and Aramco are going to contractors to sign up for the project. Is everything still in place in terms of the terms there and the timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the press releases that Saudi Aramco and Total put out around their JV at Jubail confirmed that the EPC markets have improved and validated the joint decision that we made to resume the bidding process. We don't have a specific price hurdle in mind for that project at this point. An FID will be taken sometime next year after we re-look at the cost, the bids, all the project premises at that time. So everything is basically still in place and on schedule the way we had previously communicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Evan Culio. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for taking my call. I have two questions. I guess one is a little follow-up on Neil's call on Yanbu. Just to understand that you and Saudi would jointly agree to proceed with the project when you see more numbers, and meaning that you have the ability to proceed or to not proceed, if at that time you thought the project wasn't going to be in your best interests?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, very definitely. We would &#x2013; that would be a joint decision, and again, we would look at all the factors that go into that including one factor that I didn't mention would be the financing. Because financing is a part of that whole package including the ability to IPO that into the Saudi markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh I see, so financing at the asset level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my second question is a broader kind of finance question. If I look at operating cash flow relative to CapEx, plus your dividend for the quarter, you're about $1 billion short, and you're cash flat with $1 billion of incremental debt. So going forward, and I know you mentioned you're holding your CapEx here at this point, in 3Q, if it is more like 2Q, how are you to work to balance the kind of the levers here with the CapEx dividend or increased borrowing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look to the end of the year, we basically think that we can manage debt flat to lower at this point, and then obviously we are seeing some improvement in higher oil prices that didn't fully flow through into the second quarter, but are certainly with us into the third quarter and hopefully into the fourth quarter. We are going to see some positive impacts from some disposition proceeds coming through, and then as we approach year-end, we will be back to kind of inventory target levels. So, again, we are very confident I think that debt will be flat to down from this point forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mark Flannery. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions. One is a bit of a follow-up to that last one which is assuming no change in oil prices or gas prices from here, let's say if we look forward to next year, do you think you can reduce your debt level just from cash from operations? Is that the underlying plan, or we are going to have to see a slight strengthening in the environment before the debt level starts to fall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mark, we are still putting our plans together. Early stages for 2010, and of course that will involve a combination of capital and operating plans and all those input things that you refer to. So, our plan certainly is to continue to bring our debt down back to our target range that we saw earlier, and we fully intend to manage it to that level. And we feel like there is a lot of levers that we have to work with to move in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess the follow-up is on costs. You mentioned you saved $900 million in costs so far this year, 800 million of which are from market factors, and you cite the two main ones there as energy and FX. Could you first of all try and split those? How much is from energy and how much from FX? And the second question &#x2013; second part of the question would be if you are &#x2013; now, if you think you are going to meet that target of $1.4 billion for the full year, do you expect the balance of the cost savings to be from the operating line? Is that the implication from what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, well, first of all, I think as far as the split between those two, we may have to get back to you offline on that. And as far as the run rates, we would expect to kind of see the same run rates to get us to that $1.4 billion savings. Now simultaneously, kind of going on with our focus on cost reductions, we have captured another $500 million in cost reductions from working with the vendors and service providers through June. Some of that is flowing through to controllable cost and &#x2013; but a lot of that is going to flow through to capital which you 're not seeing as well. So there is more to the cost story than just what's shown in controllable cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Murti. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions. First was just on natural gas production in the US, which looks like it's being doing a little bit better. I know you've cut back your activity like many have. I wonder if you could provide any comments on your net gas production outlook over the remainder of the year and into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You talking about the US or North America Arjun?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, really, I guess both US and North America would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that basically the same general trend there, Arjun, is you are going to see that at these activity levels, we would see base decline rate starting to impact at about around the 10% per year rate. So, by the end of the year we will be down about 10% from what we thought we would, showed at the first quarter. So again, from that point forward, it will be a little bit dependent on our activity levels. As you said, we've pulled back our activity levels and redirected a lot of our drilling on our rigs that we had under contract where we could to oil targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you. The second question was just on refining. I think in your remarks, I think you referred to a mid-80s range across the portfolio. I think a little higher in the US, a little lower outside of the US. Some of your larger peers are talking increasingly about shutting down, or at least temporarily shutting in entire plants. Where is Conoco in that sort of thought process on refining? Are you looking at more, bigger changes to either how aggressively you run your plants. Mid 80s still sounds like a decently high number. I'm wondering if you had any thoughts on that.</p>

          <p>Yes, Arjun, we look at all this, as probably all our peers do as well, on a market-by-market, refinery-by-refinery basis basically, and making optimization decisions daily, weekly. So that's an ongoing process. And we don't see any plants, or refineries in our portfolio that are on the verge of kind of a total shutdown mode that we would get to that level. And we're just continually optimizing the portfolio and certainly making sure that they always cover the cash costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you think about this decision, Sig, is it a refinery or unit decision, or is it sort of an integrated decision? You obviously have &#x2013; you have a lot of crude oil production though in the US. I personally don't think of it is as integrated of a decision. But perhaps you do, and I'm, obviously I'm taking besides the EnCana joint venture refineries?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of things. First of all, on gas production, I know it's not normal for a major to think along these lines. But given how significant your US gas production is, and given where the forward strip is relative to cash costs, where is management's head in terms of potentially considering some kind of hedging on at least some of those gas volumes? Obviously, a lot of your independent peers do that, but I'm just wondering where your thinking is right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've thought about it, and again are not currently active in that area, and are not inclined to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's not on the table. The follow-up I have is, I guess a few weeks ago, you mentioned the &#x2013; or you put a press release out confirming the go ahead for the Shah development. Obviously, this had been, I guess ongoing now for quite some time. Can you just provide any update you can in terms of what's changed by way of the capital commitment? How the <mark type="inaudible" /> does perhaps improve the economics, and if you could roll that into maybe some discussion as to how things are looking in Australia. Because my discussions with Clayton a few weeks back suggested that the capital costs there might be coming down quite significantly as well. So, any update you can suggest that maybe makes your economics look a bit better on both those projects, would be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let's just talk about Shah first, and to clarify, we had been operating under an interim agreement at Shah. And what you saw recently with our announcement on, that we had signed the Shah gas field joint venture and field entry agreements with ADNOC basically was just replacing interim agreements that we've been operating under informally, and these agreements just formally established the joint venture. Regarding the economics, we are out for bids, or going out for bids on Shah, and we will take FID sometime in 2010 once those EPC bids are in and evaluated.</p>
          <p>So the bottom line is that there is -- economics and everything else are subject to what, and the go forward decision are subject to the bids we receive and the evaluation that's done at that time. So it should not be construed as a decision that was made to go forward with the project based on the announcement that was made regarding those particular agreements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As it relates to Origin, we are very pleased with the progress we are making on Origin. The site, we are very close to identifying a site for the LNG plan and in final stages with discussions with the Queensland government at Curtis Island on that. Hopefully, we would make a announcement on the site in the very near future. On the marketing side, we are seeing a great deal of interest from potential buyers from Australia.</p>
          <p>They have a very favorable view of our project, given our leading position in the resource base there in Queensland. As it relates to the cost update, we remain comfortable with our plans to reach FID late in 2010, early 2011. And that will be depending again as kind of how the bids are coming in and I would say it's probably a little premature to comment as far as what the costs are looking like. But again I think when we entered into that project, the costs were at a fairly high point in the cost curve and so we would expect things to be, come in lower than that. But again it would be premature to speculate at this point, so.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to come back to the refining business and with the collapse in the light-heavy differentials, I wanted to first of all ask if it has made any changes to your potential decision to move forward with the upgrade at the Wilhelmshaven refinery? And second of all just following up on what Arjun was saying, are you actually considering then shutting in coking units for instance as a result of the very narrow light-heavy differential currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Wilhelmshaven, that project still remains important to us as we reposition that refinery to be a top quartile supplier of distillates in Europe. We're going to continue to evaluate the options on how to best move forward from a strategic standpoint on that. No decisions have been taken on it yet. We would expect to make a decision around that later this year. Regarding the coke question, we have cut back our coker runs modestly based on current economics, but we haven't shut down any of them totally at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then maybe if I just could, Jim Mulva has obviously been one of the industry spokesmen on carbon legislation. Do you have any comments as an organization on what the existing carbon legislation looks like and what effects it might have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the climate change goes, we are currently very disappointed in the bill that passed the House. We remain committed to the national legislation to address the growth in greenhouse gases. But nevertheless that we think the legislation that passed the House does not represent a fair and balanced and integrated approach and is a bill that we cannot support and can't predict the outcome that's going to take in place in the Senate. But we are certainly, hopefully that the bill that passed in the House will not be with the final version ultimately looks like to the extent there is any climate change. With regard to kind of legislative activity in general, it seems like climate change has taken a little bit of a back seat to healthcare going on right now and we don't anticipate action being taken on climate change, perhaps until 2011 at this point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sig, a question. When I am looking at your international E&amp;P tax rate, 69.4% versus the first quarter 64.1, I would have thought the tax rate to be lower in the second quarter because of the higher oil price. Is it primarily due to the impairment charge or there is a other reason behind and if you can give us an idea that how should we look at it for the remaining of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have to get back to you on that as far as the variance. I hadn't focused on the variance being that dramatic, but Clayton or Diane will get back to you on that. And what was your second question? Maybe that's for outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the &#x2013; also on the international E&amp;P. Versus the first quarter if we add back the impairment charge to the second quarter, you are down about 50 million. But the oil and gas realization is up about 2.50 to $3 on a BOE basis. And so that seems like there is a swing, that means that it should contribute about 150 million or so to you. And so that, respond to a swing about 200 million, is that because of the higher implied unit cost or that is because of other reasons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, maybe we can get back to you on that one because I am not sure that &#x2013; there is probably multiple things kind of going on with that on both the costs and the revenue side, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's just get back to you on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two final questions. One, with the change in the governorship in Alaska, any change in the plan for the gas pipeline for you guys and where we are on that? And also that with Iraq finished there, the first bidding round, and that based on the terms that being offered by the government there, is that still a, really an interesting area for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with respect to the Alaska situation, I mean it's very early days with the new governor at this point. We would hope to have a very constructive dialog with them on moving the project forward and having them consider what we are doing that would be helpful to move that project along. But, again it's early days and really haven't engaged in any conversation yet with the governor on that project.</p>
          <p>With respect to Iraq, we look at opportunities as they come along. They recently announced their schedule for basically a second round of bidding at this point. We'll look at the opportunity, but every opportunity not just in Iraq but around the world has to compete with our existing portfolio and we'll seek opportunities as long as we realize the appropriate returns for the risk that we would undertake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you guys see the security situation in Iraq currently is sufficiently improved for you to actually put your own men on the ground?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we participated in the first bid round as you probably know and we got comfortable that we could do that in those instances, so I guess the answer to that is yes.</p>
