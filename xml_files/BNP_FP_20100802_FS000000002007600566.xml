        <plist>
          <p>Well good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're going, with Jean-Laurent Bonnaf&#xE9; and Philippe Bordenave, to present you the second quarter results of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>I think the key messages for the quarter are really, first of all, the sustained activity with, while increasing revenue to &#x20AC;11.2 billion, the continuing decline in the cost of risk. It is the fourth consecutive quarter where we see a decline in the cost of risk. Cost of risk stood at &#x20AC;1.1 billion for the second quarter this is down 54% to second quarter of last year and 19% to the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Results are in line with the group's new size after the successful Fortis acquisition, with a net income of &#x20AC;2.1 billion. The Tier 1 is 10.6% and the Equity Tier 1 is 8.4% as of the end of June. ROE for the first half of the year is 13.7%.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues, I said, &#x20AC;11.2 billion, up 12% at historical perimeter and really flat at constant scope. Operating expense is down 1.2% at constant scope. That, combined with the steep reduction in the cost of risk, produced a pre-tax income of &#x20AC;3.7 billion, up 69%. And then the net income is 2.1, up 31%.</p>
          <p>Two non-recurring items in the second quarter on the revenue side, own debt valuation, revaluation, &#x20AC;235 million of revenues. And on taxes, a one-off impact of the Fortis integration at the cost of 160 million. So altogether, these two exceptional items somehow compensate themselves.</p>
          <p>I think this 2.1 billion net income is a measure of the effectiveness of the business model of BNP Paribas applied to the group's new size.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues by operating divisions, Retail Banking did really well, up 17.1% at, well, historical perimeter. So did Investment Solutions, up 16%. And CIB, the revenues were off 30% compared to a very strong second quarter of last year. So sharp rise in revenues from Retail Banking and Investment Solutions. They totally offset the decline in revenues from CIB, resulting in a flat revenue at constant scope.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk. Cost of risk, well, it's at 66 basis point for the second quarter, fourth consecutive quarter of decline. And had a drop of, once again, 54% against second quarter of last year, 19% against first quarter of this year. This continued reduction in the cost of risk for the group can be analyzed for the different operational divisions of BNP Paribas, starting with the three core domestic markets, France, BeLux and Italy.</p>
          <p>In France, the cost of risk at 35 basis point is stabilized at a relatively low level, in line with the first quarter. So &#x2013; and I think it should continue to be at that kind of, well, rather low level for this part of the cycle. BeLux, the quality of the loan book is unchanged, 32 basis point, very much in line with the French retail cost of risk.</p>
          <p>BNL bc, 108 basis point, against 107 and 109 for the last two quarters, so sort of a stabilization at a high level. We still see some increase compared to the second quarter of last year due to SMEs in Italy.</p>
          <p>And BancWest, very strong decline in the cost of risk, 132 basis point against 163 in the first quarter of last year and over 200 basis point for the last two quarters of last year. The quality of the loan portfolio has really started to improve, and I think we'll see the decline possibly to continue throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Europe-Mediterranean, stabilization &#x2013; well, of the cost of risk &#x2013; well, stabilization of the quality of the portfolio in Ukraine with the latest improvement confirmed, &#x20AC;45 million. No significant changes in the other countries. So altogether, we've seen as far as for BancWest and Europe-Mediterranean, significant profits back to BancWest and breakeven for Europe-Mediterranean.</p>
          <p>For Personal Finance, I think an important positive change. The cost of risk has started to abate, which is very important for Personal Finance. I believe this should gradually continue over the next few quarters, and you will see the reflection on that in the higher profits of Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>For CIB-Financing Businesses, portfolio quality has improved. No new significant doubtful loans are filed for this second quarter and, therefore, provision write-backs this quarter resulted in a positive cost of risk of &#x20AC;118 million.</p>
          <p>We then come to the pre-tax income by operating division. Retail is, well, over &#x20AC;1,200 million, more than double last year. And Investment Solutions &#x20AC;470 million up, well, one third, 32% against last year. CIB down only 7% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion compared to second quarter of last year. So overall, strong operating performances combined with a sharp decline in the cost of risk in all of our operating divisions.</p>
          <p>BNP Paribas Fortis integration is progressing swiftly and very efficiently. I'm very satisfied with the momentum and the results. We're ahead of the announced synergies; &#x20AC;402 million of implemented synergies at the end of June against the target of 900 for 2012. It's still too early to revise the figures, but I think we're up to a strong start.</p>
          <p>In terms of mergers, the mergers that needed to take place in Asia and America, where BNP Paribas had to acquire the portfolios and activities of Fortis, it's all completed. In Belgium, the target organization for CIB is effective and operational. In Investment Solutions, in Asset Management, the legal mergers are completed in most countries. The Wealth Management, the merger is done in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Retail Banking, France, buyout and absorption of Fortis is completed and in function and IT, we've made the quick wins. And for payments, we've chosen the BNP Paribas Fortis system as the European platform for SEPA payments for the entire group. So a very successful integration and where all key operational divisions are involved.</p>
          <p>Consolidated first half, nothing different from the first &#x2013; from the second quarter. Revenues are, well, up 0.2%. So it's not different &#x2013; very different from flat. Operating expenses constant scope down 1.4%, and cost of risk down 53.2%. Therefore, you get to a 4.4 billion net income for the first half, up 39%. Strong cash flow generated, illustrating the strengths of the group.</p>
          <p>In terms of our breakdown of revenues by business mix, it's 56% Retail, 30% CIB, 14% Investment Solutions. So a bit more biased to Retail revenues and we're used to nothing really very different.</p>
          <p>And in terms of geographic mix, two third of our revenues are derived from our four &#x2013; exactly 65% are derived from four domestic market. France is now 37, Belgium and Luxembourg, BeLux together, is 17%, and then Italy is 11%. Other Europe &#x2013; other Western Europe is 10% and then rest of the world is 20%, basically shared between America, rest of Eastern Europe, Mediterranean and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>You see that for the first half, well, we now have to put here HSBC with 5.5, &#x20AC;5.6 billion. So, we would come just neck-on-neck with Santander as the #5 for this first half net income. I think a leading position, confirming the new positioning of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>I now give the floor to Jean-Laurent for the Retail Divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. So for French Retail, we benefited from quite sustained business flows. Loans are up 3.3%, especially mortgages at plus 7.8%. Deposits also are strong, with sight deposit growing at 7%. All in all, based on these nice business flows, revenues reached 1,732 million, plus 4% as compared to the second quarter of 2009, with net interest income growing at plus 3.4% and fees at plus 4.8%.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are up 3% due to increase in employee incentive and profit-sharing scheme. And all in all, with the cost of fees that is flowing down smoothly, the pre-tax income is up at &#x20AC;479 million. That is more than 16% as compared to last year. So all in all for French Retail, we had quite a strong and balanced growth, both in revenues and results.</p>
          <p>For BNL, this is BNL, revenues are at &#x20AC;755 million, up 1.6%, which is somewhat not so high, in liaison with very, very adverse tax rate scenarios, especially short-term rates that are very low, and also a very poor demand in terms of financing of the economy. But away from these two elements, we benefited from good sales and marketing drive.</p>
          <p>New accounts openings are still at a high level compared to 2009 &#x2013; in line with 2009. The cross selling is still is improving. Deposits are up 5.8% as compared to last year. Loans, as I state, are stable and we still enjoy positive net inflows, both in life insurance and mutual funds.</p>
          <p>So operating expenses are down, minus 1.4% as compared 2009. We are still benefiting from the effects of the initial industrial plan and, on top of this, from the first additional synergies from the integration of Banca UCB and Fortis Italia. And of course, we are continuing our opening program with new branches, around 60 this year.</p>
          <p>All in all, pre-tax income is &#x20AC;103 million, minus 18% as compared to last year, due to the cost of risk that is still high as compared to last year, even if it has stabilized somewhat compared to the two last quarters. All in all, we can say that BNL enjoyed good sales and marketing drive and good control, of course.</p>
          <p>For BeLux, we enjoyed quite good sales and marketing drive. Deposits are up close to 13% and sight deposit close to plus 7%. Loans are up 1.4, especially strong mortgage growth, plus 8.9%, and loan for small corporates, around 3.7%. So revenues are up 7.2% at &#x20AC;836 million euros. Operating expenses are up 2% with costs that are still being optimized in line with the industrial plan.</p>
          <p>Cost-income ratio for the first half of this year dropped by four &#x2013; more than four points, as compared to last year. And pre-tax income is at &#x20AC;156 million, more than three times the results of last year. So all in all, we can say for BeLux that we're benefiting from a renewed confidence from the customer base and this activity has already reached quite a good level of profitability.</p>
          <p>Europe-Mediterranean. You know that we're strongly working on the potential of both Poland and Turkey. These are two very nice attractive markets. We currently signed the agreement between them and Fortis Bank, so we are now implementing the new strategy in Turkey with the business plan that is being formulated. We believe that within quite a short time we will put in a position to disclose this plan. This bank is going to be a totally new bank, most probably for the future one of the leading bank in this market, working in all the business of BNP Paribas and not only the Retail domestic business.</p>
          <p>All in all, revenues at &#x20AC;463 million are down 7.7%, especially due to the lower revenue in Ukraine in which we have continually decreased the outstandings since 18 months. In Maghreb, we enjoyed quite a good performance with a growth that is above 10%: 10% in Morocco, 11 in Tunisia and 15% in Algeria.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses at plus 4.4%. And all in all, with the cost of risk, as already said, that was &#x2013; that is going down significantly, we reached a pre-tax income of &#x20AC;20 million, meaning that this division for the second quarter confirmed its return to the breakeven point. This is the, I would say, the target for this year to maintain this breakeven situation for the year.</p>
          <p>As for BancWest, revenues are up 2.3% at &#x20AC;601 million with a strong evolution for deposits, plus 7.3% for core deposits. Loans are down by 5.4% as compared to last year, in line with the global economy in the U.S. Net interest margin is up 6 basis points.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are down 4.6%, so we can see here the full effect of the cost-cutting program we launched one year ago, 130 million U.S. on the full-year basis. And due to the drop in the cost of risk, pre-tax income is &#x20AC;153 million, compared to a loss of &#x20AC;62 million last year. So we can say for the second quarter, BancWest confirmed its return to profits. And again, this was the main target for this year to establish again the profitability of this bank.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance. For Personal Finance, we are continuing our growth and industrialization strategy. In Italy, with the implementation of Findomestic, we are in line with the integration plan. Germany with the creation of Commerz Finanz, this is a JV between BNP Paribas and Commerzbank, with a potential of more than 11 million customers. And in France recently, we signed a program with BPCE for the creation of a common IT platform to manage consumer loans.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance enjoyed a strong loan growth this quarter. For mortgages in France and Netherlands in particular, and for consumer loans in South America. Revenues at &#x20AC;1,250 million are up 4.8% with outstanding up 2.7%. So all in all, the margin is improving.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are up 4.9%, and this is linked to the fact that marketing expenses was put last year at a very low level. Pre-tax income is &#x20AC;196 million, up 44% as compared to last year. So we can see that for Personal Finance, we have both a strong sustained loan origination and a sharp rise in income.</p>
          <p>So this is for Retail, and I give the floor again to Baudouin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving to Investment Solutions, we see that the assets under management are stable, &#x20AC;874 billion end of June, same number as end of March. The negative market effect of &#x20AC;16 billion somehow compensated a positive foreign exchange effect of &#x20AC;17 million.</p>
          <p>As to the net asset inflow, it was altogether a negative &#x20AC;4.4 billion for the quarter. Although private banking had good asset inflow in domestic markets for &#x20AC;1.4 billion, and so did insurance with good asset inflows in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Taiwan for &#x20AC;2.2 billion, but asset management had asset outflows &#x2013; negative asset outflows of &#x20AC;8.9 billion, accentuated by a client decision to end the outsourcing of its asset management for over &#x20AC;5 billion.</p>
          <p>Revenue wise, the results, I think, were strong. The revenues were up 16%, but at constant scope and exchange rate it was plus 5.7%. Insurance was especially strong, up 21.2%, and security services had rebound in revenues, plus 2.7%, as a result of a rise in outstandings.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were up 3.9%. There were strong increase of operating expense in insurance, 11.4% at constant scope, the effect of recruitment to cope with the growth in the business. And pre-tax income at &#x20AC;470 million, up 25%. So the results up significantly in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Moving now to CIB. We've seen CIB revenues for the second quarter to be at &#x20AC;2.7 billion, down 37.5% to an exceptional &#x2013; at constant scope and exchange rate, to an exceptional second quarter of 2009. The adverse market environment with extreme volatility, reduced liquidity, a sharp movement fueled by the concern of some investors regarding European assets all through the quarter. Capital market, therefore, had lower revenues, a result of limited new issuance and high hedging costs, especially for equity derivatives.</p>
          <p>And Financing Businesses, we had a very balanced activity, especially in Structured Finance and record revenues and we see record profits for Financing Businesses for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses, down 17%. May I remind you that BNP Paribas took all of the one-off taxes on compensation in the U.K. and in France already &#x2013; they were already booked in the fourth quarter of last year. So nothing of that in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Altogether, a pre-tax income at constant scope down 16.4% at &#x20AC;1.3 billion. So income held up well, despite unfavorable environment.</p>
          <p>Regarding capital market's activity, fixed income revenues came at &#x20AC;1,250 million. Interest rates and credit markets, with the impact from the very sharp contraction in primary markets, markets were &#x2013; very little issuance of new names in the second quarter. The widening of the spread and the considerably increased volatility also impacted negatively activity in revenues.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange markets, we had a good performance on G20 currencies in a volatile environment.</p>
          <p>You see on the slide that, in terms of position in market share, we are #1 for all bonds in euro and &#x2013; #1 for all corporate bond in euro. And for all corporate bonds in euro, our market share very much increased from 9% in 2007 to over 13% for the first half.</p>
          <p>Equity and Advisory, the revenues were, well, low at &#x20AC;270 million. We had some sustained demand from Retail Banking clients for simple capital-guaranteed structured product, but we had high hedging costs, due to the sudden deterioration of implied parameters, volatility, correlation and dividends. And as we see in a minute on the next slide, we voluntarily decreased &#x2013; or limited our market risk in this very adverse market environment.</p>
          <p>You see that the VaR, the Value at Risk, was down 19%, &#x20AC;42 million, against 51 and 52 respectively for last year second quarter and this year first quarter. This was result of a voluntary restriction of some market risk, especially for equity derivatives, in this second quarter to curb the impact of market volatility.</p>
          <p>You see that the one day &#x2013; we had only one day of losses above the VaR in this very particularly volatile quarter. And since early 2007, the reliability of BNP Paribas, well, valuation models very much confirm only 10 days of losses above the VaR for over three years.</p>
          <p>Well you see here some major mandates from clients around the world for Advisory and Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>As regard Financing Businesses, strong revenue growth, &#x20AC;1,159 million of revenues, up 38% to the second quarter of last year and up 12% to the first quarter. Certainly the base of last year revenue for the second quarter was weak.</p>
          <p>But we have had very significant business origination in energy and commodities finance, as well as asset finance and project finance, global recovery in acquisition financing after a lackluster first quarter, and the flow business also held up well, especially in Europe and in the U.S. Certainly we're confirming quarter-after-quarter that we really enjoy leading franchises in this Financing Businesses.</p>
          <p>Moving to conclusion, I think it's important that three years somehow day-for-day after the crisis started in July of 2007, we've just wanted to show how BNP Paribas somehow weathered the crisis. You see that we've always enjoyed a strong profit generation capacity due to a strong gross operating income.</p>
          <p>Our gross operating income was &#x20AC;12 billion, &#x20AC;12.3 billion in 2007. It was &#x20AC;9 billion in the very tough year of 2008. It was close to, well, &#x20AC;16.9 billion in 2009. And we now just finished the first half of this year with &#x20AC;9.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that certainly you need your cost of risk, well, to be always significantly lower than your gross operating income, which we've had consistently through crisis. And that resulted in the profit generated, &#x20AC;7.8 billion for 2007, 3 billion for 2008, 5.8 for 2009 and now 5.4 for the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Because we somehow retained most of those earnings, especially in 2008 and 2009, combining a dividend payout of 33%, and a scrip dividend option that was taken by, well, a significant portion of our shoulders for two consecutive years, we very much strengthened our solvency and our capital ratio.</p>
          <p>You'll see that the Tier 1 ratio went from 7.3% end of 2007 to 10.6% end of June. And the Tier 1 ratio from 5.6 to 8.4. So I think we've demonstrated strength during the crisis, ensuring all &#x2013; a level of solvency that has been constantly improving through the crisis, and that &#x2013; which now we feel stands at a high level.</p>
          <p>The loan book of BNP Paribas is of high quality. In terms of our corporate and institutional loan portfolio, we have over 95% of our outstanding was rated below seven. And you see on the graph that the portion of that loan portfolio which is rated one, which is our best rating, is a bit higher by the end of June of this year than it was at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that, if you consider our mortgage portfolio to individuals, which stand altogether at, group wise, at &#x20AC;163 billion, 80% of those loans are generated in four domestic markets, namely, France, Belgium, Italy and Luxemburg. And in all of these markets, we have seen no real estate crisis. Market prices, compared to the end of Q '06, presently stand in France at down 1%, Italy plus 1%, Belgium plus 15% and Luxemburg plus 4%.</p>
          <p>Most of all these fixed rate mortgages &#x2013; are fixed rate, sorry, and they've been granted based on customer's affordability rates and with appropriate collateral. And altogether for our loan portfolio, we have what we believe is an adequate and appropriate reserve set aside for non-performing loans with a coverage ratio that stands, as of the end of June, at 85%, so a good quality loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Just a comment on the recent European stress test, I do believe that European stress test were based on a scenario which, on economic terms and on market terms, was severe and, therefore, illustrated the ability of banks to resist. At the end of 2011, so after two years of in the most severe scenario, BNP Paribas came out with a buffer well over &#x20AC;20 billion, which was the fourth largest from the European peer group, very much reinforcing, which I think was evident before the stress test, but that BNP Paribas' ability to weather the stress test and to weather crisis was also &#x2013; already demonstrated since 2007 is very solidly established. And the solvency, we enjoy high solvency on a very significant capital buffer.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity, we've seen the short-term liquidity for the group very abundant. All throughout the quarter in U.S. &#x2013; in euro as in U.S. dollar, whatever the tension in the market. We've had limited reliance on the interbank markets. Loan-deposit ratio is 115%. BNP Paribas is the #1 deposit bank in the eurozone. We have a highly diversified resources in U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Our 2010 medium-long-term issuance program of &#x20AC;30 billion is nearly &#x2013; three quarters of it is already completed. And you see here the two last issues. On the 6th of July, is &#x20AC;1 billion senior five-year with a mid-swap at the price of mid-swap plus 87 basis point. And the covered bonds issued on the 2nd of June for &#x20AC;1.5 billion five years, mid-swap plus 42 basis point. I think this spread and these terms illustrate the strengths of BNP Paribas' signature and our standing in the market.</p>
          <p>Certainly, we've enjoyed the highest possible diversification of resources by type of products, distribution channels and type of investors too from the bank. So I believe that our liquidity, our competitive edge in regarding funding liquidity is confirmed and is a great strength for the group with our high solvency.</p>
          <p>With that kind of solvency and that kind of funding capacity, we are looking to continuously implement an ambitious and differentiated growth strategy that starts in Europe-Mediterranean. Europe and Mediterranean, as we've seen, between Europe and Mediterranean, we somehow have 80% of our revenues. And this is really a part of the world where we fully deploy integrated business model with a lot of cross-selling.</p>
          <p>We do it to start with in our four key domestic markets. And in these four markets, which all enjoy high household savings rates above 15% and very sound real estate markets and growing loan demand, especially for loans to individuals, we push you growth and we want to outperform in this wealthy and sound market.</p>
          <p>Outside of the eurozone, in Europe and Mediterranean that goes from Poland, Turkey and certainly in Northern Africa, including Egypt, we want to deploy the same kind of integrated banking model that draw on just differentiated we're now going to fully deploy with our merged operation in Turkey. And so we want to also capitalize on Europe's densest and most comprehensive corporate banking set-up, certainly to attract higher market share of cash management and trade business from our customers.</p>
          <p>Outside of Europe and Mediterranean, we really have two key geographical region. One is, well, North America, and especially United States, where we want to drive growth and step up synergies. BancWest is now back to significant profits and we're going to continue capitalize on the new drive of that franchise. And regarding CIB, we want to take advantage of the group new size to be &#x2013; well, which makes it more attractive to large clients, be they corporates, institutional &#x2013; well corporate institutions or institutional customers.</p>
          <p>And in Asia and Latin America, Latin America is mostly Brazil. And Asia, it's, well, China, India, all of Asia. We want to continue to bolster our position, basically, for CIB and for Investment Solution. And for Investment Solution, it's mostly around asset management and private banking, where the Fortis acquisition has also significantly reinforced our position and so we're going to continue to pursue organic growth investment.</p>
          <p>So I think that the second quarter confirmed the capacity to have a significant profit generation capacity, enabling us to combine high solvency and active financing of the economy. The Fortis integration is very much on track and it's quite successful, synergies being ahead of the announced schedule. And I think we have every reason to be well positioned to continue to implement an ambitious and differentiated growth strategy that should create value in the medium to long term for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We are now very happy, with Jean-Laurent and Philippe, to take any of your questions.</p>

          <p>Okay. Guillaume Tiberghien at Credit Suisse. I have two questions. One is with regard to minority interest and the other one is with regard to the monoline. On the minority interest, I'll ask slowly because it's complicated. Before the crisis &#x2013; before you acquired Fortis, you used to have about 120 million per quarter of minority interest. This quarter was 320. So I just assume that 200 is because of Fortis, which basically means that Fortis would have made about 800 million net profit, or 1.2 billion pre-tax, but I can only explain about 400 from the PPA and BeLux Retail. So it means that CIB and asset gathering at Fortis could have made maybe 600, 700 or 800 million pre-tax.</p>
          <p>So can you maybe either confirm or explain me where I'm wrong? I'm just actually wondering whether the drop in non-performing loan coverage at BNP as a whole is basically because you're bleeding the results of Fortis, because when you acquired it, you had more than 100% coverage of non-performing loan. And the second one is very small. But I notice that you...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Very small question. I notice that you reduced your exposure to hedge CDO of RMBS in the monoline section. And I just wanted to understand whether you had incurred incremental losses from what you had already provided, or whether you had some write-backs. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the second one it's easy. It's a commutation. We commuted a gain. So it's, well, without any significant impact on the P&amp;L. On the first question, it's a little bit more complicated. I don't have the precise figures here. But I guess your calculation probably about right. But I can't &#x2013; I mean, I think &#x2013; well, we have to go into more details with you maybe to make sure that you're right but we have not looked at it that way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. Three quick questions, please. On asset quality, so provisions were lower again and coverage was also lower. I was just interested in your views on NPL trends going forward and whether that drop in coverage indicated your view that we might see an outright decline in NPL rather sooner than later. The second question is on business mix. Is it true that on revenues, your Retail is a little bit more than CIB plus asset management, but pre-tax profit is well over 50% and probably likely to stay well over 50% for a while?</p>
          <p>I was just trying to understand whether you felt comfortable with this sort of newish reality, or whether you think that this needs to be rebalanced over time. And my last question is on minorities as well, but rather the capital contribution. Fortis and, I suppose, Klepierre are quite big contributor to the minorities in capital and, given the new regulation and possibly a less favorable outcome or what it was than it was expected, do you plan any other course of action with regards to this minorities going forward or do you think you can just have the impact and move on from a solvency perspective? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Philippe will answer the first and third question. I think that, regarding the business mix, I think there is nothing wrong with the &#x2013; well, the revenue mix is what it is and then the pre-tax profit can be a bit higher to the CIB and IS, depending on quarter-after-quarter. There's nothing wrong with that and we're not going to try to correct that. If anything, I just view that, going forward, as we've seen here already, the rebounding in Retail profits altogether over the next two years, I mean, it's not going to be in the next quarter, it's going to continue to rebalance pre-tax profit in being closer to the revenue breakdown. But that's all. We were &#x2013; we're not unsatisfied in any sense with the present situation, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the NPLs, I think that we are &#x2013; well, we had this quarter a kind of one-off reclassification of loans, which were substandard and which were reclassified as doubtful in Italy and, well, taking a kind of more severe stance, but loans which were not requiring a lot of provisions because they were not too bad, in fact. So it was more a kind of nuance between substandard and doubtful. I think we are approaching, probably, the plateau in terms of NPLs, yes. While coming down, it's maybe too early to say that, but probably we are now close to the plateau.</p>
          <p>On the minority interest, well, roughly, yes, we'll have the impact and we'll move on. I mean, we don't have any specific action to take. This impact is not completely clear yet, especially as we don't know exactly what the minimum will be. We understand that, that minimum is not going to be the overall minimum set by Basel, but rather the minimum imposed by each supervisor for each subsidiary with minority interest. So it could be higher in certain countries and lower in other countries, depending on the local minimum requirements.</p>
          <p>And so we'll have to see what is that minimum for Fortis in Belgium, which remains to be seen. So I think it's a bit early, but overall, I think it's an improvement compared with the first draft of the text, because it's clear that those minority interests are more &#x2013; are recognized in a more, I would say, balanced way, in a more symmetrical way, compared with what the treatment of the risk-weighted assets.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just continuing on credit quality, in the divisional discussion, could you just comment a bit more on BNL and CIB financing? In BNL, you talked about it stabilizing at a high level but some of your more detailed comments there suggested, getting closer to an improvement. I wondered whether &#x2013; when you thought we might see the provision charges start to come down at BNL from that high level.</p>
          <p>And then the other one in CIB, whether the recovery phase, whether we have several quarters of sort of zero, little bit positive, little bit negative, or how you see that trending. And then the second question was more on the CIB revenues. You referred to hedging costs within Equities revenues. I wondered if you could explain a bit more about what impacted you there, and whether it's an ongoing problem or whether it was one-off. And if so, how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jean-Laurent will answer for BNL, and I will then comment for CIB cost of risk and revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if we go back to Page 8, yes, you would see that for &#x2013; since the last quarter of 2009, cost of risk stabilized around 110 basis point. Last year, 2009, we were around 95 basis point, roughly, and the bank was coming from a much lower level at around 60 basis point, 2007 and 2008. The Italian economy suffered from quite a very significant drop last year, minus 5, 6%. It was a huge recession, much more important than in France or in BeLux, for example.</p>
          <p>So it's normal that in that kind of business, you would see for a longer period the impact of higher cost of risk. We would say, as of today, that more probably for second part of the year, cost of risk should remain at the level we have as of today, around 110 basis point. And then after, based on some kind of a stabilization of the economy we can see this year in Italy, next year we could start to see some improvements. So the hit of the crisis in the Italian economy has been much stronger as compared to France or BeLux and the recovery will take some more time. So this is quite logical.</p>
          <p>So as of today, we can say that, as compared to the first period of first quarter, last quarter of last year, cost of risk is stabilized, that we should stay at this level, let's say, for at least one quarter, two quarters and than we can see, most probably, some kind of an improvement. So this is the picture for the Italian business. On top of it, in any case, cost of risk is higher in that market as compared to France or BeLux, but you have to understand also that margins are higher also and, thus, we have a much lower cost-income ratio in this market.</p>
          <p>And also, we have to understand that BNL has a customer base with small entrepreneurs that are more important as compared to the one-off BDDF or BeLux, and this is strongly linked to the structure of the economy that is very importantly linked to small companies. So all in all, this is the picture for Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards CIB, regarding the cost of risk, I think you might expect a very low cost of risk as for CIB-Financing Businesses for several quarters. And regarding the revenues, hedging costs were really, in my view, a one-off of the quarter, very much linked to the fact that market parameters were really very &#x2013; well, it was a very difficult market. I think this &#x2013; hopefully this &#x2013; we see already that, after the European stress test and the mood of investors has been changing lately, so I believe that it should be more of a one-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you quantify the impact of the hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What? No, no. We're not going to quantify that. Other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Omar Fall from UBS. You talked about abundant short-term liquidity. Can you give some more color on that, in particular, with regards to the U.S. CP market? I would guess that's quite a surprising comment for most banks. And then secondly, if you could just touch on the outflows in asset management. Are you seeing any signs of stabilization there? It's still about 4 billion, I guess, ex the outsourced client. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that, regarding the short-term liquidity, I think it's just a measure we've seen week after week at BNP Paribas, that we &#x2013; maybe with, also, in terms of banking, there was a flight to quality, so we've enjoyed every single week over the last quarter abundant short-term funding, both in euros and in U.S. dollar. I think, thanks to a diversified deposit base and to our stronger rating and standing into the market, I think that's worked good. And regarding the outflows of asset management, I believe that some of the ranking, the decision to end the outsourcing by one client for 5 billion was sort of one-off.</p>
          <p>So I believe that, going forward, we should look for, hopefully, as we have seen over the last several quarters, with exception of this quarter, to have altogether for Investment Solutions &#x2013; well, more positive altogether and continuity of asset inflows for this equity. But on, for example, on short-term mutual funds, flows can vary very much from one quarter to the quarter. So I think it's difficult to make a forecast, but that would be the general sense of what we expect. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Kinner Lakhani from Citi. Just wanted to revisit the equities question, actually. The Q-on-Q trend's down about 68%. Was probably sharper than anything we've seen in the industry so far. And again, at the same time, you only had one loss-making day in your quarter, or one day when losses were ahead of the VaR. So maybe you could comment on that, actually. Just seems like the numbers were slightly worse than the peer group. Now that we've, obviously, got a slightly more constructive atmosphere, also wondering how you look at the pipeline. You mentioned how the primary issuance was very depressed with the second quarter. Is there a significant pipeline of transactions that need to done when maybe the markets reopen after summer? What your views are on that.</p>
          <p>On the corporate center, once we strip out the three, let's call them one-offs, that you flagged, the underlying revenue is still very healthy, kind of 450 million. How should we think about the corporate center revenue run rate on a quarterly basis, actually? And final question on NSFR, Net Stable Funding Ratio, which is obviously one area that the market seem to have some concerns. Now we've got some new guidance from the Basel Committee, how you see that guidance impacting your position on the Net Stable Funding Ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding the equity, well, I'm sure you're getting the number right. So I think the revenues for equity activities in the second quarter were low, which is a combination of a, I would say, rather low client activity to start with and then the fact that, by getting &#x2013; by hedging significantly our residual position at a high cost in the kind of market that we were in the second quarter, we somehow got to a limited revenues for that equity for the quarter. I think that's it.</p>
          <p>As regard the pipeline for, especially for fixed income, well, I think the pipeline is significant if and when the market reopens. So it's more, as soon as the market reopens, there will be strong activity. Now whether the market, and at what point, to what extent and to what the market reopening, which will be after August because August is going to be quiet like always, I believe. So September, we'll see whether the market reopens and if the market reopens, really, to a strong extent and I think we'll have a significant issuance in the pipeline. As regard corporate center and NSFR, I think Philippe will answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So if you &#x2013; under the corporate center, if you address for the own debt revaluation, which we can do in opposite direction last year and this year, and if you also take out the exceptional impairment charges last year, and if you also take out the principal investment revenues, which are especially good this quarter. I mean, principal investment is back to some extent with some capital gains. .And, of course, it's the quarter of the dividends for that business as well, so you end up with a kind of a, well, impairment level, which is in the region of, I would say, 600, something like that, 600, 700, including the PPA adjustments, amortizations, which is 170 or something like that. So we adjusted for that, which is recurring as well now. It's around 500 or 400, 500, which used to be the level of the corporate center before Fortis more or less.</p>
          <p>So you have that kind of level with some volatility, nevertheless, because there are several items in corporate center. The Klepierre revenues, for example, may vary from one quarter to another, depending on the capital gains they make on selling buildings or not, depending on the quarter. The treasury as well, the corporate's treasury center, I would say, is especially rich at the moment, because we are somewhat overcapitalized compared with the capital allocation. The capital allocation has gone somewhat down throughout 2009 because risk-weighted assets were down. So the optimization of the risk-weighted assets led to a reduction to capital allocation to the businesses. And at the same time, we raised the equity through the retained earnings and through the rights issue, so the corporate center is rich at the moment in terms of cash. So this explains why, I would say, you can take a kind of recurrent level of something like 500, 400, 500, yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The NSFR. Sorry, yes. The NSFR. I think really that, I mean, as we had said, the NSFR was really flawed and ill-conceived from day one. I think we were among the ones brave enough to say it rather openly. And I think that what the Basel Committee is saying is just recognizing that this was the case, and they just say that they're going to work at it again. So they say the committee will issue a set of proposals by the end of this year, which will be subject to testing during the above-mentioned observation period.</p>
          <p>So they recognize that they have to completely rethink the ratio. The very concept of a long-term ratio, liquidity ratio, makes sense, but you have to define it properly in order to really be close to the actual risk, and it was not the case at all. So now they have to work. They are going to make new proposals by the end of the year and we hope that these timed proposals are going to be more sound, technically.</p>

          <p>And on the same issue, with respect to total assets, reading the Basel III revised proposal, what's your view on how repos are going to be treated? And then lastly is with respect your slides you've given on your growth potential, organic. Yeah, basically the question is, when you talk about the different regions, how much have you set aside in terms of cost impact?

        <plist>
          <p>Well on that, well, we don't know yet, I mean, what they say, I mean, clearly, on the leverage ratio, I mean, they said that there will be a new definition, I think. So they said two thing, I would say, in the new round. The first thing is that they confirm that it will be a Pillar 2 item for at least seven years. So it &#x2013; and they're going to test and try several calculations in between in order to assess what's the proper definition of the leverage ratio. And well, it's understandable that it's complicated, because as soon as it's not connected with actual risk, it's difficult to assess what is the definition.</p>
          <p>But the second thing is that they confirm that they are going to change the definition, which is currently in use in the U.S., by taking into account the off-balance sheet items, clearly, but we don't know exactly how, and by allowing some netting, nevertheless, in order to smooth out the accounting differences between the U.S. and Europe. But again it's not extremely clear. So I think it's work-in-progress, the leverage ratio and it will remain work-in-progress for the next seven years. So we still have time to talk together about it. But the concept is difficult, because the rationale is lacking, if you all know.</p>

          <p>I think that regarding the &#x2013; I think we have enough capital generation to finance the organic growth which we have as a potential. So I think we have no problem of capital tortured with the kind of profitability that we have and the kind of payout ratio we look for in terms of dividend policy, which is still around one third, 33% payout ratio. Maybe, Jean-Laurent, you on French Retail?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the French Retail, so maybe two elements. First, when you look at the first half of this year as compared to the first half of 2009, where we benefit from, let's say, some positive effect of the base second half of 2008, first half of 2009 was quite low due to, let's say, the recession. So when you look at the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year, in the growth, you have something that is linked to the fact that one year ago was still at quite low level.</p>
          <p>And second, if you look ahead, you will &#x2013; you have heard, certainly, that there will be an increase of the taux du livret A. This will have somewhat a negative effect on the interest margin of the network. On a yearly basis all in all, it's always difficult to make a right assumption. But all in all for the network, this can cost close to &#x20AC;100 million. So all in all, on a yearly basis, &#x20AC;100 million is around 1.5, 1.6%. So if you look at the current growth and you have, one hand, this effect and second, the comparison with the first half last year that was &#x2013; that is quite favorable and is going to be less favorable because the second half of 2009 was already stronger. Then the answer to your question is, this is not the trend for the full year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a follow-up on the equity derivative revenues. If I step back to the quarter Q4 2008 where you lost 2 billion, that's just a normal run rate of maybe 0.5 billion or 600 million, you could have argued that you lost 2.5 billion in one quarter. Now the VIX was 80, and the VIX is not in here. And your books were much larger at the time rather than now. So I'm actually very surprised that you might have lost 400 or 500 million on the hedges, which is my calculation, but I just take normal run rate of 700 million minus what you've just published.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know how you get to &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; well, these are not our figures. You have the revenues of equity at &#x20AC;250 million. This is the cumulative revenues of the quarter. And on that, once again, we decided to spend more than usual on buying hedges at a relatively high cost when the market were the most turbulent, but out of that you cannot deduct what would &#x2013; the numbers you just announced. So I think that's where we stand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I would like to add that, this time it was not a loss, in fact, at all. When you are facing such discord markets, extremely volatile, and the implied barometers went up more or less the same way than in the fourth quarter of 2008. It was not that different as a crisis. You are facing a kind of dilemma. I mean, either you try and hedge yourself through the dynamic hedging, the delta hedging dynamic, so selling when it goes down and buying when it goes up.</p>
          <p>And if you do that, it can cost you a lot, because you buy at the highest and you sell at the lowest in order to keep your book balanced or &#x2013; and then you can incur losses, or you just decide to hedge the parameters themselves. So you buy volatility, you buy dividends, you buy all the implied parameters, but you do that at the price which is implied by the market, which is extremely expensive at that moment and this what was done this time.</p>
          <p>So the kind of &#x2013; they look for more perfect hedging this time, and it was possible because the positions were lower and more simple than in 2008 and, in order to lower the potential cost loss, if you want, of the volatility. And it worked to a certain extent, because at the end they make money. Lower than in the usual quarter, but they made money nevertheless.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I just wondered if you could clarify a couple of headlines which were on Bloomberg for this morning. One was suggesting that you'd indicated that you thought trading was going to be better in the third quarter than the second quarter. I just wondered if you could elaborate on that. And maybe also, you've given us an idea before of what you think a kind of normalized range for the Corporate and Investment Bank might be. Has that changed at all?</p>
          <p>The second indication was, you've obviously given us a lot of detailed guidance at a divisional level of your cost-of-risk forecast. The headlines were suggesting this morning that in aggregate, you thought that the global cost of risk could continue to improve in the second half of the year versus the second quarter, albeit slowly. Just wondered if you could provide a comment on that. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we never make forecasts at BNP Paribas. So if this is to clarify, that's clarified. Regarding the cost of risk, we &#x2013; behind some divisional guidance, I said this morning and I'm stick to it, that we could expect the cost of risk at group level, compared to the 66 basis point of the second quarter, should be around that number and possibly a bit lower and that's all for the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>As for the normalized &#x2013; as for the trading conditions getting to the third quarter, I just said that we have seen the worries of investors regarding the eurozone altogether after the stress test and after being &#x2013; getting lower, which I believe could help the overall market environment to be a bit better and a less &#x2013; a bit less unfavorable into the third quarter. I said that this remains to be seen, especially in September, in terms of level of issuance, certainly on the debt capital markets, but also in terms of volatility and how parameters will evolve regarding equity markets. So this remains to be confirmed that, that could be a trend, that could be a positive trend for the third quarter compared to the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As to normalized rate, if that's your question I understand, the normalized rate of revenues for the CIB, we basically said, I think, a few months ago that we would see revenues for CIB somewhere being in the range between the fourth quarter of 2009, which was 2.4, and the third quarter, which was about 3 billion. And well, that's a kind &#x2013; it's certainly not a forecast, but that's a kind of somehow guidance that we could set for CIB. But we all know that market activity's very unusual CIB, tend to be more volatile than financing revenues. And I think that's what I could say.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Two question, if I may. The first one, at the beginning of the year, you set a number of positive jaws target for French Retail Banking, Personal Finance and BNL. And I would like to get, if you can, an update on this target. And specifically on BNL and Personal Finance I have the sentiment that, with recent developments, it's going to be a bit more challenging.</p>
          <p>The second question is on Belgium. Well I mean, following a very strong performance, commercial performance in this second quarter, we see at the same time a decline in revenues compared to the first quarter. And I was just wondering what is behind this. Is this a decrease in commissions or a decrease in net interest margin? Well I mean, what's &#x2013; what is this revenues impact? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So basically for the French Retail, the objective is to maintain one point of jaws effect, which currently we get from more than this with the French Retail network. For BNL, we're looking at something in the range of 3 basis point, 3 full point, which is tough to get this year, obviously. And for Personal Finance, we're looking at something in the range of 2 full point. So we're basically looking at these kind of targets that can be, I would say, slightly different when you look quarter-after-quarter, but I would say, this is our central scenarios for these different divisions.</p>
          <p>As for BeLux, you cannot compare the first quarter and the second. There are very strong cyclical effects and the way revenues are booked are somewhat different from the French Retail. But even if you look at the French Retail, the first half of the year is always stronger than the second part of the year. So you cannot compare the second quarter to the first in terms of total revenues. You can only look at the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of last year. And well, so the evolution is strong, because we regain confidence, obviously, from the customer base and we launched one year ago when we closed the transaction a number of commercial initiatives and this is giving a strong momentum to this division.</p>

          <p>Hello. Three quick question. First question, what is your interpretation regarding Basel III amendment and the insurance business capital, because I read carefully these amendments. Of course, they are not very clear, I do agree with you. And I wanted to see with you what you think about the treatment of insurance in this new text. Second question is quite marginal, but it could be of some help to make some forecast. Regarding BPN (sic) [BNP] Security Services you recently bought and that will be probably integrated in the next quarter figures, can you give us a little bit ideas of what are the revenues and gross income of this &#x2013; of what you bought? And last question regarding Poland, do you have any plans to develop Poland in terms of market share and number of branches. What exactly are your ambitions regarding this country, please? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Philippe will answer the two first question and then Jean-Laurent will answer on Poland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, we understand that as far as significant investments in financial companies are concerned, meaning more than 10%, so if you own more than 10% in another financial company, including an insurance company, those investments are going to be deducted. That was already in the first draft. But now they say that there will be a threshold, a kind of &#x2013; it's going not to be deducted up to a level of 10% of your core Tier 1. And there is a &#x2013; if it goes beyond 10%, there is kind of super threshold at 15% of your core Tier 1, which is going to be allowed, so to say. But for the addition of three items, so that the significant investments in financial companies including insurance, the mortgage servicing rights, so this is a pure intangible, but it was added for &#x2013; because the US were requesting that, so for us, it's nothing.</p>
          <p>And the temporary differences within the DTAs line, so which is part of the DTAs. So we &#x2013; well this is the framework. So now we have to make all the calculations, we have to check how the DTAs, the temporary differences are going to evolve. And so overall, we think that this kind of 15% threshold is giving some kind of leeway, if you want, to protect to a certain extent the core Tier 1 compared with the first draft where all those items were deducted from the first euro.</p>
          <p>So this is the first query. And the second question, yes, the Security Services, you know, they are #1 in Europe, in custody, in securities custody. And of course, it's a business where size matters, because you can reduce the costs, the unitary costs if you have a large size. And so we are always ready to increase that size at, I would say, at an affordable cost, and especially in a domestic market like Italy. So it's a quite normal deal, I would say. More and more banks are, I would say, withdrawing from that business, because it's a cost center for them because they don't have the critical size, and we take advantage of that in order to increase our own size. So it's a win-win situation for both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Poland, Poland is a nice market because of the potential growth and because of the size of the market. We innovated from the Fortis group of Fortis Polska. Fortis Polska is an operation that is rather a mass-market bank. All in all, we benefit from, let's say, close to 2% market share. We intend to grow for the mid-term this bank from 2% maybe to 4% market share, especially in the private banking, in the affluent and in the commercial and corporate banking activities, including any cross-sell with the CIB. So we have quite a strong organic plan for the mid-term in this country, and this is the bulk of our strategy in Poland.</p>
          <p>For BP2S and BPM in Italy, BP2S for a very long period of time has developed in Italy a very strong position. It's a leading bank in that field in terms both of quality and efficiency. So basically, the joint venture between the BPM and BP2S is more or less a kind of synergy we have developed in between BNL and BP2S, meaning that BP2S is going to service the network of BPM. So it's something that is very classical and this is exactly the bulk of the business of BP2S in Italy. And well, with BP2M, they found out a new and strong partner. So this is the situation.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Three quick questions, if I may. The first one is on the Financing division where revenues were very strong. They were up 12% quarter-on-quarter and loan book was up 3%. I'm just wondering if you can give us kind of where these revenues are coming from. My understanding they are probably fee based. The second question is on the advisory business where the cost-income ratio was 70%. The main reason, obviously, is because of poor revenues. I'm just wondering whether you're still looking at cost-income ratio in the region of 50, 60% going forward. And finally on lending, it was up 4% first half on 2009 and finalizes 8%, which is very strong. I'm just wondering whether you see the same level of growth going forward in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes. On the Financing CIB business, it's not coming only from fees. It's coming from both fees and net interest margin. We are seeing an increase in the margin and you'll remember since the crisis, since beginning of 2009, basically, after the big crisis, the margins have widened. And we said, repeatedly said that the back book was not yet repriced. So the repricing of the back book is still ongoing and the margins are widening.</p>
          <p>So it's both a widening in margin and, yes, good additional fees plus a basis, which was relatively low last year. On the cost-income ratio on the market, I mean, the reference you are mentioning, the 60% you are mentioning was for the total of CIB and not the markets alone. And we are below that reference in the second quarter. Otherwise the lending, I mean...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon everyone. I have three question, please. The first one, I'm going back on equity derivative. In the end, you have three very difficult quarter in less than two years. I was wondering to which extent that could be a trigger for BNP to change the business model, because you are very proud, rightly, to say that you weathered well the crisis, because you are very defensive. And it clearly doesn't look like in equity derivative where you are often very impacted compared to your lead competitors.</p>
          <p>The second, you mentioned a potentially low risk in the coming quarters in Financing, but could you give us an idea of a normalized cost of risk for this activity? And the third is, the sovereign debt impact. I can see it's quite impossible to follow any mark-to-market on your trading portfolio in FIG, I suppose. But could you assume that on the banking book, the evolution of your available for sale capital gain or losses, which is in reduction of 2 billion from the end of the last year, is a good proxy of your impairment on this banking book? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well regarding the equity derivatives, I don't see that overall sort of crisis we've been really impacted for that business line more than our competitors. Also altogether, I think that the quarters in which we've seen challenges for that business line have been, well, we've seen the same challenges for our competitors. And depending on the quarters some have ended better or worse or different, and maybe not always the same quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>We still believe that equity derivative is a strong franchise in BNP Paribas that in more normalized market conditions should continue to do well and to create value for shareholders and to bring significant financing solutions to our customers. As regards sovereign, well, Philippe will answer your two other questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a normalized level of the Financing business, it's very difficult to give a normalized level. Certainly it's not &#x2013; the normalized level is not a write-back, that's for sure. Now it's about big corporates, so normalized level is not very high either. But we can't say more than that. I mean, I think it's too difficult to assess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just said earlier that &#x2013; we just said earlier that we would expect at BNP Paribas a low cost of risk altogether that would be most probably the outlook for CIB-Financing Business line over the next few quarters, but without giving a normalized figure of the level of risk over &#x2013; which I don't think we want to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the last question, yes, we &#x2013; well, I'm not sure I have fully understood the question, because we have seen clearly a reduction in the AFS LatAm gains, yes. So this kind of OCI items are moving up and down depending on the market. And this quarter we had a positive revaluation, I would say, of the ForEx effect, very significant, which has offset the depreciation of the AFS. But it's not an impairment to the extent that it's not a permanent loss of value. It shows a mark-to-market, which is moving up and down depending on the market movements, but it's not an impairment.</p>

And no idea of really what could be the main characteristic of that tax. We're just certainly concerned that we want to &#x2013; we would like to avoid double taxation effect between the European countries that are going to raise taxes. And this is certainly an issue we have raised with the Minister of Finance in France very, very well, very clearly, if not vocally.</p>

I don't see really Europe moving on transaction tax without having some, well, a wider coalition on a world &#x2013; if not a worldwide basis, but with other key countries. So I do believe that this &#x2013; and I hope this idea is not going to really materialize.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I'm just considering the significant decline in the risk provision you have quarter-after-quarter. And I'm wondering if you now feel you have some room of maneuver for being a bit more flexible in credit acceptation? And maybe beside that, if you are in danger to have a ring of pressure from, let's say, the politic to increase your lending to the corporate world now?</p>

          <p>Regarding the political pressure, we've no political pressure, basically, on numbers to SME lending in France. And also individual lending in France are very positive and do compare very well to the rest of Europe. So I think that we've no pressure, really, from anybody to lend. And secondly, regarding our credit acceptation standards, I don't think we're going to make them more flexible. If you can expect BNP Paribas one thing which is, we want to be rigorous over the cycle and not stop and go on originating standards at BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>So we're just going, as for acquisition criteria and loan origination standards, these are things that BNP Paribas should be very stable over the cycle because you don't want to go stop and go. So we haven't been &#x2013; we haven't relaxed the criteria and we're not going to now make them &#x2013; we're just keeping &#x2013; trying to write, I would say, good and sound business at all times and all through the cycle at BNP Paribas.</p>

          <p>Okay. So I understand that we're over with questions. So thank you very much for those attending the conference call, and all the best to all of you. Thank you.</p>
