          <p>Good morning. My name is John and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont 2010 first quarter investor call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. <mark type="Operator instructions" />.</p>
          <p>It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Madam, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome. With me this morning are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO and Nick Fanandakis, CFO. The slides for today's call can be found on our website at DuPont.com, along with the news release that was issued earlier today.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 1. During the course of this conference call we will make forward-looking statements. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review Dupont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you please refer to the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and on our website.</p>
          <p>And finally, we've posted supplemental information on our website that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Ellen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Karen. And good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>This time last year we were taking aggressive actions to respond to the deteriorating market conditions. Our initiatives were aimed at enhancing near-term profitability while preparing to respond to the economic recovery when it came. Today those actions are paying off in the form of streamlined business units, a lower cost base, and just as important, much greater customer intimacy with an ability to respond faster to customer demands.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we delivered strong results of $1.24 earnings per share, more than double the first quarter of 2009 and just $0.07 below the first quarter of 2008. I am very pleased with our performance, the way we responded to changing market demands and our momentum going forward.</p>
          <p>The forecast for 2010 global industrial production is about a 7% improvement with recovery rates that vary greatly by country and by industry. Many of our polymers and chemical businesses saw strong demand pick-up in the first quarter, magnified by the comparison to a particularly weak first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Because we stayed close to our customers and supply chains, we could better anticipate demand signals. In some cases our management teams made conscious, thoughtful business decisions to take on cost in order to keep pace with a strong pickup in demand.</p>
          <p>Two cases in point: Performance chemicals and Performance Materials had volume increases of 30 and 56% respectively. Their supply chains were already tight and these businesses skillfully managed significant challenges to produce and deliver product to keep up with market demand. They were able to because our customer relationships gave us better visibility into markets and we were able to anticipate demand signals.</p>
          <p>We believe we were better equipped to meet demand than our competitors and in some cases gained market share as a result. Pre-tax operating margins of 13 to 15% in these two reporting units reflect higher operating rates, coupled with the leverage from outstanding work to take out costs over the past 18 months.</p>
          <p>Estimates for 2010 light vehicle production increased since I spoke to you last quarter. In January, we expected global production to be up 9%. Our current view is a 13% increase for the year. In the first quarter, vehicle production was up nearly 40% against a very weak year-over-year comp.</p>
          <p>DuPont Performance Coatings stepped up to market demands and we saw their earnings improve from a loss of 75 million in the first quarter of 2009 to a profit of 45 million this quarter. With 5% pre-tax operating margin in the quarter, it's clear that there's still work to do. However, I'm pleased with the progress this segment has achieved against formidable challenges. They've displayed dedication and determination as they continue to drive this business towards world class status.</p>
          <p>Demand for consumer electronics continued strong heading into the first quarter, which we anticipated. Demand for photovoltaics surged beyond our expectations driven by new government stimulus programs, advanced buying ahead of Germany's feed and tariff reduction and pent up demand from last year. In addition to meeting strong orders, we continued to introduce new products with added value through increased efficiency, enhanced performance, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
          <p>Electronics &amp; Communications R&amp;D spend is about 7% of sales, well above the company average because our product offering and the value it brings to PV differentiates DuPont. DuPont sales into PV are so strong that we now expect to surpass $1 billion in 2011, one full year ahead of plan.</p>
          <p>Our Safety and Protection segment lagged into the recession but stabilized during the fourth quarter. We're starting to see these businesses improve. Increases in motor vehicle builds and industrial production supported modest sales growth, while outstanding work by our teams <mark type="inaudible" />. Global construction markets remained soft and therefore we focused on differentiating ourselves with new products and increasing market penetration in both developed and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Our global Corian product launches have gone very well and we're actually growing Tyvek and surfaces sale into commercial markets that are still in decline. Overall, new products and applications will help grow sales in Safety &amp; Protection into the mid-teens in 2010.</p>
          <p>Of course, another important market for DuPont is agriculture. We have tremendous momentum in our seed business, particularly in North America, where sales in this region topped $3 billion in 2009, nearly doubling in size in three years.</p>
          <p>Our momentum was hard-earned, with product performance and investments in R&amp;D and sales and marketing. We've executed a sustainable business model that focuses on the right product for the right acre, an approach that benefits our customers and translates into greater value for DuPont shareholders.</p>
          <p>While, first quarter results reflect some seasonal shifts between quarters, the outlook for the northern hemisphere planting season remains very strong and we still expect to gain one to two points of global seed market share in 2010.</p>
          <p>One final comment on our markets this quarter. Company sales in Asia were up 71% to $1.6 billion. Not only was this a record for that region's sales in the first quarter, but they were over 20% higher than the prior record set in the first quarter of 2008. There were many stand-out achievements, including a doubling of sales in Japan and Korea into electronics and automotive markets.</p>
          <p>I was in Asia last month, and witnessed our team's intense focus on the customer and their passion for DuPont's offerings. I visited our Hyderabad technical center in India and reviewed several customer development projects which coupled with our intimate knowledge of local market needs with DuPont innovation.</p>
          <p>Regional technical centers like Hyderabad or Shenzhen, China or Paul&#xED;nia, Brazil provide gateways to local opportunities supported with the power of DuPont and its R&amp;D engine. That's one reason sales in emerging markets were up 33% in the first quarter. This success is reflective of a strong foundation in these important growth markets, coupled with highly attractive offerings and bodes well for continued growth.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to turn the call over to Nick to review our financial performance and then I'll close the call with comments on our outlook. Nick.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ellen, and good morning everyone. I'm delighted to report to you that DuPont has delivered very strong results for the first quarter performance. As the global economy recovers, we drove volume and price up in all regions. This is an outstanding start to what we expect to be a pivotal year for the DuPont company as we replace pharmaceutical royalties with growth from all other business units. By almost any measure, it's a solid, encouraging performance, especially in light of a still recovering global economy.</p>
          <p>Our teams around the world delivered on their commitments to grow revenue and generate earnings while continuing to drive cost and capital productivity all the while staying close to customers, their expectations and their changing needs. I characterize these as encouraging results, because I believe this to be a great start to what we all expect to be a very good year for DuPont. I sense real momentum from all of our business leaders.</p>
          <p>Given the challenges we faced last year, which I know at times seemed very overwhelming, it's a great feeling to know that this company is emerging stronger, more competitive and ready to go the distance. We delivered on the first quarter and we're poised for growth throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, as well as how our actions are continuing to transition from a recessionary environment to one of growth. Let's go to slide 2. It summarizes earnings per share and sales results.</p>
          <p>First quarter reported earnings per share were $1.24, up more than twice our earnings of $0.54 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of 8.5 billion were up 23% compared to the prior year, reflecting a 19% volume improvement, 2% price increase, 3% favorable currency impact, and a 1% reduction from some small portfolio changes. Volume was up in all business segments and in all regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up reflecting our sustained, robust pricing discipline.</p>
          <p>Starting our segment review with Ag and Nutrition, on slide 3, you see that sales grew 6% to 3.2 billion and earnings grew 10% to 941 million, resulting in over 100 basis point pre-tax margin expansion versus the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Seed sales in the quarter reached $2.2 billion, an increase of 8%, with 7% U.S. dollar price gains and 1% higher volume. As Ellen mentioned, the clear driver was the tremendous success we continue to experience in North America, where sales growth was greater than 15%, underpinned by volume and price improvements. With sales volumes higher by about 10%, we're expecting share gains in corn and soybeans, the exact share gains will obviously depend on the final acres planted.</p>
          <p>At this point in the season the orders are in and we are working on in-season opportunities. This is yet another example where our direct sales organization and supply chain capability really thrives. Our sales force is out there working with the growers, responding to late-planting opportunities and optimizing inventories so the farmer gets exactly what he needs.</p>
          <p>Turning to Europe, here the farm economy is slow to recover after the global downturn. This is holding commodity prices down and resulting in flat to slightly reduced plantings in both corn and sunflowers and contributing to intense competition in the marketplace. All of this, together with a late start to the season, resulted in European seed sales being down significantly in the quarter. The implication being that we will see some volume shift into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we captured price and volume gains for the safrinha season. Price gains reflected industry-leading BT penetration to about 48% of our sales in Brazil. Volume gains which favored fourth quarter reflect share gain on slightly increased acreage.</p>
          <p>Before turning to crop protection, I want to give you a brief update on AcreMax 1 plans. We don't have the EPA approval today but we anticipate a positive EPA decision within a week. For 2010 planting, our objective is to demonstrate the product value with farmers in the field setting the stage for a 2011 commercial launch. To that end, we have product in over 2,600 plots strategically placed allowing thousands of farmers to experience the performance during 2010 planting.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Crop Protection. . In Crop Protection product sales were up slightly as favorable currency offset lower volumes and local prices as well as portfolio change. The anticipated competitive pricing pressure was fairly broad based. The volume decline reflects seasonal timing shifts to the second quarter, which was partially offset by the continued growth of Rynaxypyr. Rynaxypyr growth continues at a fast pace as we confidently move toward our 2010 goal of $300 million in sales, a 50% increase over that in 2009.</p>
          <p>This product was the first launched from our reinvigorated crop protection pipeline and we're making the right decisions to deliver the next blockbuster products such as Plainview, a broad-spectrum bare-ground weed control or Cyazypyr in insecticide.</p>
          <p>Our nutrition and health business continued their transformation work of delivering higher value offerings which produced increased sales and earnings from same period previous year.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second quarter for Ag and Nutrition reporting segment, we expect sales and earnings to increase significantly versus same period previous year, reflecting strong performance in all businesses.  Specifically, the Seed business anticipates a strong finish to the North American planting season and seasonal shift in Europe.  Crop protection also anticipates broad geographic and product volume growth, mitigated in part by continued competitive pricing pressures.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide 4, Electronics &amp; Communications segment.  Sales of $631 million improved 73% compared to the same period last year, reflecting 60% volume improvement and 13% higher prices.  Essentially, all metals pass-through.  Sequentially, revenues were up 8% on strong demand, especially in the photovoltaics and semiconductor materials markets.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax earnings of 105 million are $139 million better than the same period last year.  This is due to broad-based demand increases in all products and all regions, with Asia growing an impressive 131% and photovoltaic sales growing a noteworthy 147%.  As Ellen mentioned, we expect to exceed our sales goal of $1 billion in PV sales in 2011, a year ahead of schedule.  For the second quarter, we expect strong broad based demand to continue versus prior period.  Sequentially, we expect sales to be in line with the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide 5, the Performance Chemical segment.  Sales of 1.4 billion increased $344 million, or 32% reflecting a 30% increase in volumes, 3% higher selling prices, and a 1% reduction due to portfolio changes.  The sales increase was principally driven by strong recovery that continues in the titanium dioxide business and the fluoropolymer business in all regions and strong demand for all refrigerants, including strong adoption rates for ISCEON as a preferred retrofit for R22.  PTOI was $190 million, an improvement of $146 million, primarily due to these higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second quarter, sales and earnings are expected to be up substantially year-over-year due to the improved economic conditions in most markets.  Sequentially, we expect sales to be modestly up and earnings to be significantly up, reflecting a strong recovery that continues in most markets and the seasonal uptick in demand for Ti02 and refrigerants along with very strong demand for ISCEON in the European region.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 6, Performance Coatings.  Segment sales of $902 million increased $170 million or 23%.  Sales increased as a result of 17% stronger volumes as well as some pricing gains.  Demand was driven by continued recovery in the global automotive market, as well as a strong rebound in Asia-Pacific.  PTOI was 45 million, up 120 million from the prior year.  The improvement was primarily led by this increased volume, lower raw material costs and aggressive fixed cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Segment sales in Asia-Pacific continued to recover, up 45% versus prior year's first quarter.  Global auto builds were up 39%, led by North America, which was up 68% versus prior year.  For the full year, we are now expecting global auto builds to be about 13% increase, and as Ellen stated, this is an increase from our prior estimate of 9%, and in line with the stronger volumes that we saw this quarter.</p>
          <p>While auto builds have not returned to the pre-recessionary levels, and we don't expect them to until 2011, the strength we're seeing in emerging markets is offsetting declines in developed markets.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second quarter for Performance Coatings, we expect sales to be up significantly year-over-year.  Demand for OEM paints should improve with increases in global vehicle production.  Both OEM and refinish paint products should benefit from continued improvement in consumer confidence in developed regions around the world, and positive momentum should continue in emerging markets.  Sequentially, sales should be moderately up as a function of higher demand in automotive and refinish paint products.</p>
          <p>We expect earnings to be substantially up in the second quarter versus prior year.  Lower costs should also have a positive effect.  Sequentially, we expect earnings to be up on higher sales as automotive after-market momentum continues, partially offset by rising raw material costs.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to Performance Materials segment on slide 7.  Sales of 1.5 billion increased $592 million or 63%, reflecting 56% higher volumes and 7% increases in selling prices.  Higher volumes reflect improvements in automotive, industrial, consumer and electronics markets, with strong recovery in all regions, led by Asia-Pacific and Europe.  PTOI was $230 million, an improvement of 376 million.  We delivered strong volume growth in all regions, as well as margin expansion, with lower raw material costs, higher selling prices, favorable currency, and improved fixed cost productivity.  Looking ahead for the second quarter, sales and earnings are expected to be up substantially year-over-year, reflecting improved conditions in most markets.  Sequentially, we expect sales to be essentially flat and earnings to be down reflecting the higher raw material costs.</p>
          <p>Let's look at slide 8, and here you see the Safety and Protection segment.  Sales of $789 million increased 71 million, or 10% principally reflecting an 8% increase in volume and 2% higher selling prices.  The volume increase was primarily due to recovery in automotive and industrial markets coupled with moderate strengthening in construction markets.</p>
          <p>PTOI was $102 million, an improvement of 38 million, reflecting higher volumes and lower raw material costs.  Looking ahead to the second quarter, sales and earnings are expected to be up substantially year-over-year.  We anticipate improved demand for industrial, auto and construction markets.  Sequentially, we expect sales to be up modestly and earnings to be up slightly, reflecting continued recovery in the industrial and automotive markets.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the corporate view of the first quarter earnings per share variance analysis that you see on slide 9.  Looking at price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.21 per share, this reflects the positive spread between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume.  Again, excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, first quarter variable costs were down about 2%.  We anticipate that the full-year 2010 variable cost will increase about 5% over 2009.</p>
          <p>In looking from a quarter-by-quarter perspective, we believe that the first quarter was the final quarter that we'll see a reduction year-over-year, and we expect the trend to reverse for the remaining quarters of 2010.  Volume improvement resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.57 per share, compared to the same period previous year, in part reflecting the benefits from increased capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all businesses and regions, and was particularly strong in Asia, up 65%.  There's a graph that you can see depicting sales by geography region shown on slide 10.</p>
          <p>Continuing on with variance analysis, let's move to the fixed cost.  Excluding volume and currency, fixed costs reduced earnings by $0.14 a share in the quarter.  Included in that calculation is an $0.08 incremental pension charge, along with actions during the first quarter to support growth such as targeted increases of contractors as production ramps up, increased investments in Seed R&amp;D and specific marketing initiatives.</p>
          <p>Concurrent with the actions that were taken to support growth, we estimate that DuPont realized about $130 million of savings in the quarter due to our cost reduction programs.  In 2010, we have committed to deliver 400 million in fixed cost productivity reductions and 200 million of incremental restructuring benefit.  We will deliver on these savings.  We use a managing process for which I am personally responsible that evaluates growth initiative proposals and tracks progress on cost productivity programs.  Clearly with volumes rebounding so strongly we are adding back resources to support this volume growth and remain firm in our resolve to do so thoughtfully and only when higher volume dictates the need.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year currency was a tail wind of $0.10 reflecting an 8% weaker dollar in the quarter.  We believe this will turn into a headwind for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In the Other category on the waterfall chart, reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, this includes a $0.02 charge for exchange gains and losses.  $36 million charge was the impact of the Venezuela devaluation and is included in this exchange gains and loss.</p>
          <p>Our goal continues to be to achieve zero after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program.  As is typical, the detailed reconciliation is on Schedule D to show you the exact impact of our hedging program had on the effective tax rate and on earnings.</p>
          <p>This Other category also includes a $0.02 reduction in pharmaceutical earnings.  First quarter pharma earnings were 221 million, about 30 million below the same period last year.  While pharmaceutical earnings were below prior year, they were better than expected and as a result we are increasing our 2010 range for pharma pre-tax earnings to 360 to $400 million.  We expect the remaining earnings to be spread evenly over the balance of the year.  There are assumptions and uncertainties to this forecast, such as the generic erosion curve in both the U.S. and Europe, estimated inventory levels and contractual elements.</p>
          <p>The last point on the EPS waterfall chart is our first quarter 2010 base tax rate, which was 23.4% versus 23.1% first quarter prior year which created a net zero EPS impact.  Looking forward, we estimate the full-year 2010 base tax rate to be 23 to 24%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide 11.  First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $1.3 billion.  Higher net income was offset by increases in working capital to support strong volume growth.  For example, our Electronics and Communication segment had volume growth of 60% and Performance Materials volume increased by 56%.  We also were preparing for a significant sales increase in our titanium dioxide, refinish coatings, and refrigerant products as we move into their seasonally strong second quarter.</p>
          <p>As you recall, we have committed to a $1 billion working capital productivity gain over the next three years.  Based on net working capital levels, we are on track to deliver 400 million of that in 2010.  Here again I'm leading a managing process around working capital productivity to ensure that we deliver on these commitments.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, with the dividend payment in March, we have paid 422 consecutive dividends.  Our strategy has been to drive hard delivering cash returns to our investors.  So in summary, for the first quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued and expanded in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations.  This, along with our pricing discipline, and productivity focus, delivered strong quarterly results.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the second quarter 2010.  We expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue along with projected strength in growth in the Ag and Nutrition segment, which is underpinned by a solid finish to the northern hemisphere planting.  For the full year 2010, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against the plan.  We're raising our guidance from a range of 2.15 to 2.45 per share to a range of 2.50 to 2.70 per share, based upon the strong results in the first quarter and our ability to execute the very compelling growth plan we've laid out for our investors through 2012.  The updated guidance puts our earnings per share growth at 20 to 35% versus 2009.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, looking strictly at pre-tax operating income, excluding significant items, we anticipate more than 20% growth, and if you exclude pharma from these results, our growth is greater than 50%.  In line with our increased earnings, we are raising our outlook for 2010 full-year free cash flow to greater than $1.7 billion from our previous outlook of greater than 1.5 billion.  This reflects higher cash earnings and continued productivity.</p>
          <p>As I said at the start, we have a plan for 2010 and we will execute against that plan, which is, in short, grow our business across the globe and expand our margins.  We're off to an excellent start to what should be a great year for the DuPont company.</p>
          <p>With that, Ellen, I'll turn it back to you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, Nick.  I'd like to reinforce what Nick just said.  When we met with investors last November, each one of our reporting units outlined its business mission, priorities and growth targets through 2012.  Our plan is working.  Results so far reinforce our confidence that we can meet or exceed our 2012 goals.  $1.24 first quarter earnings per share was not the product of this quarter alone.  It's the result of the last six quarters' worth of efforts in terms of restructuring, fixed and variable cost productivity, working capital productivity and, most importantly, staying close to our customers and markets.  We've effectively repositioned the company for the recovery that's underway right now.</p>
          <p>As for our Ag business, you can expect continued growth and margin expansion.  We remain committed to deliver 15% segment earnings growth, compounded annually through 2013.  Of course, half our sales for this segment are in seeds, where we see the biggest growth opportunity.  The Pioneer North American leadership team has successfully implemented its reinvestment strategy, building a sales and agronomy force numbering more than 4,000 strong, complemented by an industry-leading portfolio of products.</p>
          <p>We have a track record of growth in international seed as well and continue to build on that position.  We have a strong R&amp;D pipeline and are committed to pricing for value supported by growers who have benefited greatly from our product innovations tailored to their needs and local conditions.  In the end, the strategy has delivered volume and price gains which resulted in strong earnings growth and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 13.  In summary, we remain focused on execution.  Our priorities are outlined on this slide in the form of directives, which are broadly shared with employees.  We have a high degree of confidence in our playbook and in the leaders of our 13 business units who are accountable for delivering the results.</p>
          <p>The first directive is superior revenue growth.  Our 2010 target is more than 10% increase versus 2009.  An important foundation for our growth continues to be market-driven science.  In the first quarter, we introduced 502 new products, which compares to 501 in 2009.  This is an outstanding start to the year, considering that last year we set a record for new product launches in a single year.</p>
          <p>Another measure of innovation productivity is the percentage of sales from new products.  Our target in 2010 is 30% sales for products that have been launched within the past four years.  Recognize that this is a change from our traditional metric where we used to define products as having been launched within the past five years.  The intention behind the newly defined metric is to push for faster, broader product launches for maximum value and return to both our customers and our shareholders.  At the same time, we've been honing our product launch processes to make them more disciplined and more market focused. Productivity remains a cornerstone of our playbook, and as Nick said, we're on track versus productivity goals.</p>
          <p>And finally, our improved outlook in earnings translates to an improved outlook for cash, and we expect more than $1.7 billion in free cash flow in 2010.  While first quarter recovery looks healthy, we realize there could still be a number of market scenarios that play out for the remainder of the year.  Recognizing this, our business leaders have alternate business plans and a number of tactical earnings levers that they will adjust to changing market conditions, both positive and negative, and we will deliver strong results.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on executing the three-year playbook outlined last November and we'll do it one quarter at a time working towards our 2012 goals with discipline and agility.  At the same time, we're laying groundwork for additional growth beyond 2012, capitalizing on the mega trends that form the backbone of today's growth plan.</p>
          <p>We have a tremendous opportunity for investors to view firsthand the progress we're making in one of those growth areas.  In two weeks, on May 11th, we're hosting an event in Knoxville, Tennessee, which will be entirely focused on our applied biosciences platform.  I hope you will join me for the day.  We're meeting on location in Tennessee so we can showcase two important facilities.  First our cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant and second our production facility where we make propanediol from corn or what we call bio-PDL.  We'll take you on tours of both facilities and our business leaders will talk about the opportunity we see and the progress we've made since we last updated investors two and a half years ago.  I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.  Nice job in the quarter, obviously.  Ellen, I'm trying to remember this correctly, and I'm not sure.  You obviously had a very nice start to the year on the Ag side in terms of growth.  And I thought that the last quarter you talked about that the expectation was that Q2 might be better, show better growth year-over-year than Q1 on the Ag side.  Does that still hold correctly and am I remembering that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically I think that's going to hold, a late start in Europe.  I think is going to be one of the drivers there.  So we still see the second quarter being stronger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Terrific.  And then as you looked at the electronics segment, obviously a terrific recovery underway there.  But yet you were talking about flat or Nick was talking about flat growth in the second quarter versus the first quarter.  What would be the factors behind that?  Why would you not anticipate seeing a continuation of the recovery there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we had a tremendous first quarter and the growth there has been largely driven from photovoltaics.  You know, there has not -- we're not seeing restocking in the first quarter.  So you're not going to have that in the second quarter.  So I think sales, we see, as remaining strong.  But by and large on a sequential basis will be pretty flat.  So it's not going to be kind of any diminution, it's going to be continued strength in the electronics market, really driven off of photovoltaics, and we see that there's this year we see probably about a 50% increase in our revenue from PV.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  So I guess the way to think about it is that the first quarter saw some restocking as well as a pickup in underlying demand whereas in the second quarter you're going to see that underlying demand pick up without the kicker of restocking?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning.  Ellen, on AcreMax, are you expecting the approval at 10% refuge reduction, and are you actually selling AcreMax this year or just in some test plots with farmers?  Could you describe what's happening with the 2,600 test plots out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks David.  The EPA has not announced their decision.  We have not seen the registration.  We do expect it within the next week.  You know, they've been &#x2013; the discussions have been very consistent and positive, supporting both refuge in a bag and refuge reduction.  So it's not only &#x2013; it's a convenience factor in there as well.</p>
          <p>Now, if I were to guess and anticipate based off the discussions, I'd call it at a 90/10 product, you know.  And those products yield very, very well versus their conventional counterparts.  So we're going to have it out in demonstration plots probably over 2,600 plots this year so that farmers can really understand the yield and the capability of this product.  So we're very excited about it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly, your competitor has announced their intention to lower pricing across their entire seed portfolio for 2010, what will your competitive response be in Pioneer to that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've always had a strategy of value pricing, "Right Product, Right Acre" that has worked very well for us.  It's a competitive market out there, but I think that our direct-to-farmer model, our value-based pricing, continues to be our strategy, and I think that will serve us well this year and in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  This is Amanda Sigouin on for Laurence this morning.  First off, a question on the Seed business.  Does DuPont have firm market share targets it plans to defend if competitors become more aggressive in going after share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This year is pretty much played out.  Half the seed is in the ground in corn and farmers have pretty much made their decision.  So we see that there is going to be &#x2013; this year is going to continue to progress the way it has.  Tough to predict what 2011 will bring because that basically has to build off of what happens in 2010.  So we're sticking to our playbook, Right Product Right Acre, the penetration that we're getting.  We expect to see one to two points in share gain globally and we think that based on what we've seen so far in the year we're still confident in those estimates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just to follow up, could we please revisit the trajectory for the pharmaceuticals business, particularly how fast earnings are expected to decelerate in 2011 and 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me handle that one.  As you know, we're now saying pharma is going to be about 360, 400 million impact for the full year and we saw 221 of that in the first quarter.  So the remainder will be split evenly over each of the remaining quarters.  So a third in each of the remaining quarters is our expectation.  And as you know, pharma was down about $0.02 year-over-year in earnings per share in the first quarter.  Now, for the full year, we had about $1 billion in the -- $1 billion in prior year, and as I say we're expecting about 360 to 400 million this year.  So you can see the impact is about that $600 million for the full year.  And then as you go forward into 2011, you can take the number that I'm talking about now and you can go by about half and then in 2012 by about half again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Just quickly on AcreMax, just to follow up, you know with all this extra 2,600 plots that you're demonstrating your technology, and you got an extra year to prepare, which is 2010, how big would your launch be in 2011 for AcreMax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're not going to predict that at this point.  Our goal this year is to really allow thousands of farmers to see the yield and the productivity that AcreMax 1 provides and I think that's really going to build the excitement around what we can do in 2011.  Thanks, P.J.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on M&amp;A, now that some of these businesses have rebounded strongly, would you expect divesting some of the more commodity-oriented businesses to move the portfolio up the value chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, would you like to --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., let me address that.  Thanks for the question.  When you look at our M&amp;A strategy really it remains very consistent.  When from an acquisition standpoint, when we look at the opportunity for acquiring potential businesses, we stay along the lines of, an acquisition would be for something really providing significant strategic value, either technology, value chain, etcetera.  It's not just for bulking up.</p>
          <p>On the divestiture side, which I think is really the heart of your question, you know, we put a lot of effort, time and money into restructuring these businesses and we really believe that right now is the time where we can extract a lot of that value as we move forward.  And I would really not want to give up on that opportunity and that value that we can create now with those businesses.  So I really believe that from this point, from my vantage point, looking at those we create the greatest shareholder value by continuing to run those businesses and take advantage of the leverage that we've created.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  Just a question on some of the assumptions behind your guidance.  I mean, clearly you're going to exceed your 10% revenue growth target, just wondering what revenue growth is implicit in your new guidance, and with raw materials rising, do you have the pricing power to maintain increases in variable margin or is this earnings growth still going to come primarily through operating leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, do you want to help Don with that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Don, let me try and answer that.  You know, certainly we have had a great first quarter.  And we're at a rate that's far greater than the 10% earnings growth that we talk about.  Sales growth, I'm sorry.  When you look at quarter 2, we have very good visibility towards quarter 2, and we're expecting, as we mentioned, continued strength in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, third and fourth quarter, it's not as clear, obviously, as to the top line growth and what we're going to see within the market conditions.  We don't anticipate any major softening.  We have some very good bellwether businesses within the corporation like our Ti02 business, it's operating very strong, not only is our business operating strong but the whole industry is.  So we're anticipating continued strong economy, but the visibility beyond the second half is a bit hazier &#x2013; beyond the first half is a bit hazier.  So at this point in time I would stay with our greater than 10% top line growth in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on price variable cost, you were able to get pricing up despite costs being down.  I know Ti02 is pretty tight.  What's sort of the general pricing power within your businesses or is this just due more to your continued focus on the DuPont pricing model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, it's a combination.  I mean we instituted pricing for value for some time now and we have that discipline institutionalized through all of our businesses, so we really do take advantage of that and make sure we get the value for the innovation that we're bringing to the marketplace.  So there's certainly that component of it.  And then there are businesses that are very tight right now, when you look at our Ti02 business, very tight in capacity.  Our polymers business, our refrigerants, all of those have very high S to Cs right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  How are you?  On Ag, I understand the acreage numbers are still to be seen but with half the crop in the ground and the seed selling season done, would you care to hazard an estimate on your share gains in the U.S. markets for corn and soybeans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, that's still playing out as we speak.  It looks like corn will probably plant a little more this year than maybe we had estimated earlier in this year.  And soy will come in late.  But I think that we're on track with what we had predicted, what our estimates were this year, and I really think that globally we do see that 1 to 2% points of share coming our direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then to follow up on Optimum AcreMax 1, just to clarify, would you intend to go to a refuge in the bag delivery system at a 10% refuge level, and if so, when might you be in a position to start sales in a RiB mode?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we get the registration from the EPA which we expect in a week, our expectations or discussions with them indicate that the 90/10 is probable.  At least in the way I'm calling it now.  So that's the product we will be getting out in the bag into the marketplace and get those demonstration plots in this year.  So that's going to provide us with the opportunity to show the real value to the growers, not only its yield, but its convenience, that will be used to greatly support our 2011 commercial launch.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yes, it's quite clear the recovery is significantly stronger than anticipated in November.  You brought forward your photovoltaic revenue target from 2012 to 2011, so how do these results make you reflect on maybe your 2012 targets you put out in November?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one quarter we were very excited about what we've been able to deliver in the quarter, both from a volume and from a productivity side.  But I think we need to see a little more play out this year before we adjust the targets that we put out in November of 2009.  We'll probably be getting together with you guys in the fourth quarter like we do every year and at that point I think it would be very appropriate for us to give you our thinking then.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the only division where the margins were slightly weaker than anticipated was Performance Coatings, target of ten to 12% in 2012 and still early days.  Were the margins this quarter more due to a mix effect in terms of more OEM rather than refinish, do you feel you're on track for the 10 to 12% margins still?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul, thanks for the question.  This is Nick.  When you look at that business and the slight drop in margin that you saw in the quarter, it's really due to mix, as you said, the refinish versus the OEM mix.  And it's also due to some of the raw material increases that they started to experience already in the quarter around monomers and solvents of that nature.  So they're starting to see some of that compression occur in the margin in the first quarter here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Here's my two questions.  First of all, with respect to the competitiveness in the Seeds business, we've certainly talked about that a fair amount.  Yet you saw a 5% increase overall in the segment.  So how does that square up with the competitiveness?  And the second, Nick, I had a question on continued pension contributions, both this year and perhaps even next year.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, for the question.  On competitiveness in Seeds, we've seen the first quarter start.  It's based off of a strong North American opportunity and weaker Europe opportunity than we had projected early.  Europe will come in strong in the second half and we'll have a strong finish to North America.  So I think you'll see a second quarter strengthening in Seed, as we have discussed earlier, and I think that that's consistent with what we're seeing playing out in the planting today.  So I think that overall production agriculture is always a first half story and it's always difficult to call first quarter/second quarter, and I think you'll see from a first half standpoint a very strong positioning for us.</p>
          <p>Nick, do you want to take the pension question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, thanks, on the pension, let me just refresh everyone's memory.  The $400 million that we're taking to earnings this year in the way of pension is not a cash impact item.  It's just an earnings impact item.  For cash impact or cash contributions this year to the pension plan, our preliminary estimates when we look at the funding requirements needed by the Pension Protection Act of the 96% level we believe we'll be meeting that level without having to make any cash contributions outside of the U.S. plan &#x2013; within the U.S. plan.  Outside of the U.S. plan we still have about $300 million of cash contributions to those plans.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much.  Ellen, I was wondering a little bit, you made some positive comments about Safety &amp; Protection maybe starting to turn the corner a little bit.  What would you expect sort of the incremental margin rate as you go back up the slope and how long might it take to get back to that billion-dollar revenue run rate, quarterly I mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, if we take a look at Safety &amp; Protection they were late in, they were late coming out of it.  We're still seeing improvement sequentially quarter by quarter.  In 2012 we put targets in the low 20s for their margin.  I see no reason to come off of those estimates.</p>
          <p>Military, which is about, I don't know, 10% of their revenue, is lumpy, it comes and doesn't come and depends on a lot of different factors.  So when we integrate that all together, and plus construction is going to be stronger this year than last year, but certainly I would not call it anywhere near robust.  So we're confident in our product.  And in the new products that we've introduced in the last year, to continue to aid us in penetration of those markets globally.  And I think that as we say, the focus is on getting back to those margins in the 2012 timeframe.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I look to where that business sort of peaked out a few years ago, it looks like the revenues were up maybe 270, 300 million or 175 million higher, but so was the profit level.  Given all the stuff you've done internally, would you expect the margins if you get back to that same revenue base would be meaningfully higher or no?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that if you take a look at it, there, that mid-20s margin levels are what we're focused on for the 2012, the mix is going to be very different as we come through the next two years, and I think that's a very healthy margin and one that with our advanced products and the new technologies we're bringing forward, that we can focus on.</p>

          <p>John , we're nearing the end of our time, how about one more question?</p>

          <p>The last question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan.  Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  It's Silke Kueck for Jeff, how are you?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any targets to employ the free cash outside of paying dividends?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, would you like to comment on our cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  We have a dividend policy which is fairly well articulated and known.  It's around &#x2013; we return our excess cash to our shareholders unless we have compelling investment opportunity.  Our dividend issuance, we have a range in about 25 to 45% of our cash flow from operations.  We like to stay within that range.  Ultimately, obviously, the dividend policy is a board decision.</p>
          <p>Outside of dividends, when you look at the growth opportunities that we have within the corporation and you look at the opportunities that we spend some of our fixed costs on, our cash and capital dollars on this year, this quarter, it's reflective of the tremendous growth opportunities we have.  So I believe the cash will be put to tremendous use.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow up, if it were the case that currencies stay where they are today for a longer period of time, would that in any way impair your 2012 earnings guidance, or are the underlying operations strong enough to absorb that?</p>

          <p>I think we're anticipating a little bit of a headwind currency in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From this point on we're actually anticipating a headwind in the currency.  Currency right now in the euro, for example, is 1.33, and our assumptions are in the 1.34-ish range.  So we're seeing some headwinds for the rest of this year.  It's difficult to project that out beyond &#x2013; it's difficult to project it even for the rest of the year, let alone into 2011.</p>
