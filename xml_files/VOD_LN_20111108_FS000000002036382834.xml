      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So on to guidance and then I'll draw this piece to a close.</p>
          <p>So we have decided that with the half-year now under our belt and the general trends we see in the business, that we are comfortable to now move the guidance into the upper half of the range that we indicated at the start of the year, so &#xA3;11.4 billion to &#xA3;11.8 billion is where we now think we should end up the full year.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow we've left in the &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;6.5 billion range, still of a view that we should see some improvement in the rate of decline of margins. Capital expenditure, fairly similar to last year, and the 1% to 4% service revenue range is still the target, obviously, slightly at lower end in the nearer term, but within that range over the medium term.</p>
          <p>So to pull it together, I think it's a fairly consistent performance with revenues up 1.4%, margin decline halved, free cash flow for the year confirmed, comfortable with the <mark type="audio gap" /> (01:19) levels, dividends going up 7% <mark type="audio gap" /> (01:24) plus the Verizon Wireless dividend on top. And actually, if you take our normal dividend plus the Verizon Wireless dividend, collectively, we will be about 13% of the FTSE 100 dividend this year <mark type="audio gap" /> (01:43) this year on our own.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will hand back over to Vittorio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So I would like to use 20 minutes now of your time to go through the commercial &#x2013; to the assessment of the commercial performance, what has gone well, what has gone less well. Andy has the privilege to talk about things that go well. I have to focus on the part of the glass &#x2013; which is not half glass &#x2013; which is empty, but there is a part that still is empty. I would like to talk about growth opportunities and then discuss the priorities.</p>
          <p>So first of all, at high level, how is the group evolving? And this is a bit the way I look at the business. As you can see, this part of the chart, we are more &#x2013; we're getting more revenues from emerging markets, from data and a bit less from traditional mature voice. As you can see, we are now 60% coming from the first set of areas, and 40% from the latter. It's a positive trend because this means that our revenue flows are more future-proof.</p>
          <p>In the last quarter, European mobile voice went down 9%. Data in Europe, up 21% and emerging markets up 13%. And this is a positive, I would say, trend.</p>
          <p>If you look at the other part of the chart, we are also managing proactively the risks of the transition to data with integrated and tiered plans. 18% of our revenues are today coming from consumer contract out of bundle plus incoming, which we can see as the more kind of at-risk part of our revenues. And 51% are coming from enterprise and consumer contract in bundle.</p>
          <p>We moved up the share of contract &#x2013; consumer contracts that are coming from integrated tariffs. We moved up 9 points in the quarter to 36%. So I would say, the way I look at the business, the profile of our revenues keeps improving quarter-after-quarter as a consequence of our actions. And we are more and more of a future-proof type of company.</p>
          <p>How are we doing commercially? Here we have put the market share relative to the main competitors. We did better, this is Q1 data, in 14 out of 18  markets. If you let me put also South Africa, given the big market share that we have there, we have done better than the competitors in 15 out of 18, which I think is good, and I'm pleased with it.</p>
          <p>We have three situations which we are not pleased with. One is easy to deal with, is Greece. Clearly, in Greece, there's an economic situation which is difficult. We want to cooperate with Wind there, if we are allowed, and that's more of a macro type of situation.</p>
          <p>The other two are Spain and Australia that deserve a few words.</p>
          <p>First of all, Spain. Spain is a weak economy. There's strong competition in Spain, but there are also some structural problems, and namely high per minute prices and high commercial cost. So to improve our competitiveness, we have strengthened our management team there. We have lowered prices. The &#x20AC;0.06 and &#x20AC;0.08 price plans that we have introduced. We have introduced integrated data plans. And to work on the structure of programs, we are &#x2013; increased the contract length from 18 to 24 month, and worked on distribution cost, and especially on commissions.</p>
          <p>And the results, which are indicated in the right part of the chart, the initial results, I would say, are good. We have an improvement in ARPU, &#x20AC;8 from the new contract versus the base. We are back to positive portability, albeit for a small number, with one-third of the consumer contract now coming from the longer 24 months term, which again is positive. And we have some reduction in channel cost. <mark type="audio gap" /> (06:04-06:18).</p>
          <p>This is good. I think revenue and EBITDA, however, will continue to remain under pressure for a number of quarters. So, I don't see any short <mark type="audio gap" /> (06:24-06:28) short-term return to growth in revenue and EBITDA, but these are structural measures to improve the Spanish market for the long term. <mark type="audio gap" /> (06:38-6:42)</p>
          <p>Australia. Australia is the other situation, which we are not pleased with. This is really started with some network issues due to a switchover that we have to make as a consequence of the merge. That has turned into customer dissatisfaction and then into clear revenue issues.</p>
          <p>So what have we done? We have fixed the network problems. We have first upgraded our 3G network to the <mark type="ph" /> 900 to 850 (7:12) layer with now the program being beyond half of it, 900 sites over 1,500. We are swapping out the RAN and introducing the new, more modern software and hardware with Huawei; the program is under way. And I have to say, we have worked a lot on commercial initiatives, rebranding the shops, closing the wrong ones, fitting the new &#x2013; the good ones with the new Vodafone system.</p>
          <p>The results are there, as you can see there from the chart. Network statistics have improved. We now have network metrics which are back where they should be. We have abandoned-call rates which have gone down to the normal level, and good service levels.</p>
          <p>And I have to say also from a cost perspective, the synergies that we were counting on when we did the merger with 3 are on track. But however, I have to say, I am not pleased until the customer metrics <mark type="ph" /> are not right (8:12). And that will take a few more quarters.</p>
          <p>So these were the two, if you want, situations where I think that the glass is not yet full. Let me now cover a bit the areas of growth potential, starting with Supermobile, the strategy that we illustrated last year, one year ago, which is not just about network. It's about network. It's about customer experience. It's about devices, and it's about pricing and profitability.</p>
          <p>First of all, starting from network and going clockwise, we continue to work to reinforce our leadership in this area. It's really four sets of actions. It's not four actions, but four sets of actions.</p>
          <p>First thing, improving and increasing the speed of our networks. We have gone up another 10 percentage points on both the uplink and the downlink on HSDPA with a target performance that now, I think, is what I would call the video quality type of target. And of course, we are launching LTE where we can. In Germany, we have now about 52,000 customers. We have 1,300 sites. The average speed here, for those of you who have not got a chance to try it, is between 6 and 12 megabit per second.</p>
          <p>Important thing is the latency. Latency is really reduced to DSL-type of level, as opposed to the 120, 130 milliseconds that you can have today on any of these phones. On an LTE handset, you go down to 35 to 60 milliseconds, which again, is a fixed-line level.</p>
          <p>And we're now starting to launch in cities, so not just in urban areas but also in places like D&#xFC;sseldorf. The second action is moving to single RAN. Single RAN has clearly an advantage over cost. It means less maintenance and less energy. But it also means that the network will be upgradable with very little export to LTE. So, in a way, it's an action which is at the base of the previous one. We are improving our capacity &#x2013; backhaul capacity.</p>
          <p>Sometimes I get questions from investors and analysts on, "Are you really going to be able to carry all the traffic out of the base stations?" Now, with IP Microwave, I can tell you we can bring everything that the current technology enables in terms of speed, but we also have Fibre or managed ethernet in about a third of our sites today, up from 20% in the last semester. So, we are strengthening also the backbone of our networks.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to acquire and optimize spectrum. We've got spectrum of course in Germany, in Italy, in Spain in the last six months. We are refarming 900, again, to use the spectrum and the cost of it in the most efficient way. But network &#x2013; the results are here. The results are, I think, positive. Network growth &#x2013; the data traffic growth is now aligning with revenue growth at around 20%. This is happening because we are practically managing this. We have reduced peer-to-peer traffic 20% to 30% in our key markets. We are managing video traffic &#x2013; again reductions, which go in the 15% to 30% range. There's an interesting point here <mark type="audio gap" /> (11:37) traffic is moving to smartphones.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the bottom part of the chart, now 21% of our traffic comes from our smartphone and 79% from mobile broadband. <mark type="audio gap" /> (12:02) Given the 20% overall traffic, it means that all the increment is in the smartphone part, and actually, mobile broadband is gently going down, it's 1% to 2% total reduction. And as you can see from the right-hand part of the chart, smartphone per-user traffic is going up from 100 megabytes to 130 megabytes per month, and data cards are going down from 1.6GB to 1.4GB.</p>
          <p>Now this is a result, of course, of the fact that we all use smartphones, tablets and other stuff, but you might remember that I always use my metaphor of the motorway and saying we have tracks in the motorways and these are the mobile broadband. And when you take out one track, you can fit in seven cars. And these are the smartphones and this is exactly what is happening. By managing our capacity, we can cope with traffic growth.</p>
          <p>And the result is in the usual statistics that I always share with investors and analysts, what is the average utilization rate of our network, keeps being 35%, 36%, 37%. What is the percentage of sites, which are fully used in the <mark type="audio gap" /> (13:09) 7%. So, I think we are managing a good and healthy growth in the smartphone area without any major inconvenience at network level.</p>
          <p>Technology is not just about network. Often I'm asked again, what's the Vodafone advantage in managing technology? Let me talk about IT. Basically, here, we are working on two directions. One is standardization, of course, and so making sure that we have the same thing everywhere, and simplification. We are now on standard information systems deployed in 11 markets. ERP systems in 11 markets. We use &#x2013; we can optimize the sourcing of our services across three centres, one in Budapest, one in &#x2013; actually, two in India and one in Egypt.</p>
          <p>We are consolidating our vendors. We went down from eight to two CRM providers. And we have our cloud infrastructure, which is being fully virtualized, which means that today in Europe, we are virtualized, Dublin, Milan and Ratingen. And next, by the end of this year, we will fully virtualize also South Africa and India. Which means, right part of the chart, that we can see in the &#x2013; we have seen in the last four years, an increase of 20% in the service that we manage, but a decrease in the cost by 40%. So, we are basically developing a very efficient Vodafone way of managing data centres. This has been recognized by Gartner, who gave us top quartile in the efficiency ranking.</p>
          <p>Second element of Supermobile was the customer experience. This is really about redesigning retail. We have the new format of the stores that we are rolling out across Europe. A very positive reaction from the customers here in the U.K. Using more online, 50% of our bills, more than 50% of our bills in Europe are going online. Evolving our strategy in the contact centres areas from what used to be called call centre strategy into a contact centre strategy, using more social media, 55 million contacts per year through our social media contact centres.</p>
          <p>Now, Vodafone deals with customers more outside of call centres than inside call centres. So, call centres are not the main thing, and of course, there is a big efficiency into this, on top of the fact that our customers like this way of interacting. And we are rolling out in all of our markets, 14 today, mobile self-care apps on smartphones and tablets, which, again, is a reinforcement of a good customer experience, but also a cost reduction across our footprint.</p>
          <p>Devices &#x2013; devices is a very important element of our Supermobile strategy. 22% penetration of smartphones, up 7% year-on-year. U.K. and Netherlands are already above 35%. As you can see in the chart, clearly contracts 37.3% penetration versus pre-pay, only 12.4%. So, it's progressing in both segments, but clearly quicker in contract. Essential to get to higher levels is the cost of the smartphone. We said that we had a target to go below the a hundred kind of mark. We are now below &#x20AC;80, and I think our &#x2013; my new target, the target that we're &#x2013; Morten and I gave to our vendors, is now please bring us the &#x20AC;50 smartphone.</p>
          <p>This is very important, not just for what is called the democratization of data, i.e., bringing data to emerging markets, but it's also important, as I indicated earlier, for the prepaid segment and for the lower band of the customer segment. As you can see in the picture, we have some very good Vodafone-branded handsets, the 858 will do more than 1 million pieces by the end of the year. The <mark type="ph" /> fat (17:11) Facebook phone is again another interesting way to introduce Facebook in a low-cost way, and we are now getting into tablets with the Vodafone Smart, which will cost about two-thirds of another well-known tablet.</p>
          <p>A question about profitability that you always ask. Now, these are the latest numbers. Migration to smartphones creates more revenue, positive 27% contracted over the lifetime revenue increase, which is compensated by an increase in subsidy and acquisition and retentions, plus 123%, leaving a small increase in profits.</p>
          <p>Now, the good news here are that the average ARPU uplift has marginally gone up a bit in the last quarter. And we still are, last year I said, in the &#x20AC;2 to &#x20AC;10 range. We are still exactly in the middle of that and gently moving up. But, of course, I don't think that this is enough, it should be better, and therefore, this is what we are doing to improve it.</p>
          <p>First of all, working at ARPU level, tiered pricing with a lower entry level to help people get into smartphones, push integrated tariffs, 24% of European customer &#x2013; consumer contract base up 8 percentage points is now in integrated tariff, and in driving up attach rates. So, we need to improve the ARPU component of data in Europe, I would say &#x2013; I will say kind of bring it into the American space.</p>
          <p>Second element of the strategy A&amp;R, I talked about devices. Clearly, we need to have a deeper portfolio of devices, so that we make sure that we can work on the economic equation also on this element. And finally increasing, lengthening the typical contract length by extending the terms of the contract and, therefore, improving the lifetime value of the customers. And here we have examples in Spain and Ireland. And in &#x2013; even in machine-to-machine in other areas where, if you can go beyond 24 months, I think that would be a very good thing. So, pricing and profitability, very important, very much driven by devices and by ARPU. So, Supermobile is delivering.</p>
          <p>I want to say a few words about new services. We talked a lot about new services. First of all, the philosophical approach of Vodafone, again, this &#x2013; most of you know about this. We have moved from what was the old approach, a walled garden type of approach, a fully vertically, integrated approach and a single operator approach to something which now calls for more open standards. A strong integration of Vodafone and third-party services, so not just relying on our own capability, but our own integration capability being the key selling point. And when needed, or when possible, having a joint operator's approach like, for example, for payment where you need to work with the industry to establish a standard.</p>
          <p>If you look at what new services are today for Vodafone, as you can see in the chart, is about &#xA3;250 million per year of revenue. I can call this like a small OpCo for Vodafone. So, new services altogether are like a small OpCo, and this includes everything from machine-to-machine, near-field communication, mobile advertising, financial services.</p>
          <p>However, the addressable market, I mean, what the market is expected to be by 2020, is more in the &#xA3;10 billion range, which would be kind of a pretty decent, large European market. So, a small OpCo today with a big market in front tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Here, I want to talk about three things. First of all, machine-to-machine. Machine-to-machine is a large opportunity, there's &#x20AC;3 billion market, where &#x2013; which is expected to go to &#x20AC;6 billion in a few years. It's a market, which in terms of connections, could probably go up four times and where Vodafone has, I believe, a strong set of advantages.</p>
          <p>First, scale, second, the platform, we have in non-geographically defined platform to manage machine-to-machine, which enables us to do deals with whoever wants to ship everything, from cars to cameras to toys for playing or whatever, to every market regardless of the geography. And third, we have a network of partners, which covers 70 partners &#x2013; 70 markets, so we can really deliver end-to-end across the world.</p>
          <p>Here, our performance is good. We have a 33% revenue growth and 6.2 million connections. This is an area where we are investing more and where, I would say, everybody who wants to play into the machine-to-machine segment, and namely, we're talking about automotive, we're talking about security, we are talking about metering, we are talking about games, sees Vodafone as the preferred partner. So, machine-to-machine is the first one.</p>
          <p>Second is financial services and typically M-Pesa. You might remember that M-Pesa was a Kenyan-type of thing. Now, it's not a Kenyan-only type of thing. You see there's a blue bar there, which is Tanzania, and there's other market, still small, but going up. We transfer $670 million per month through M-Pesa and this is up from $300 million last year. For Safaricom, it's 12% of revenues, and we are very committed and very convinced that there is a big opportunity in other emerging markets. If you just think of India, in India, out of &#x2013; I think, 700 million people who are unbanked, 230 million of these have a phone. So the opportunity there is really very big.</p>
          <p>We launched in Rajasthan in July. We plan to launch in other circles in the course of the year and over next year. And we are looking at Egypt to where we're trying to get regulatory approval to go into another market where there's another 80 million people who might really enjoy the service.</p>
          <p>There's a small additional business that we will go into, which is international remittances. It's not a huge business, but again, it's part of a very positive customer experience that we can deliver.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would like to talk about operator billing. Now, we all talk about apps. We know that in the world, 25 billion apps are downloaded every year. It's true that 85% of those are free, but there are still 2 billion to 3 billion apps for money that are downloaded every year.</p>
          <p>We have opened our billing, our operator billing, to these developers and to the app stores that are interested in. We now are in eight markets with RIM, Nokia and Google. 70% of the Blackberry downloads are paid through the operators' billing. And whenever we open operator billing' we see very positive take-up of download of paid applications.</p>
          <p>An interesting aspect of this is also other players, not just the app stores. We put here two examples, in Italy and in Germany, we have &#x2013; we gave operator apps also to media companies. And I have to say that in Italy, the number of downloads through our billing is higher than the number of downloads happening with &#x2013; through an iStore that is very popular these days. So, there is a great potential, I believe, for operator billing.</p>
          <p>There's no point in me talking too much about it. Can we show how it works? The short video.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation]</p>
          <p>So, why am I convinced this is good? Because this works very well with pre-pay. This works very well in emerging markets and this works very well for credit-challenged segments. It is a very intuitive and easy way of enabling digital commerce. I'm convinced this is going to be important and we will open to everybody who's interested in all of our markets.</p>
          <p>Final thing, total communication. Here, I'd like to focus a bit on enterprise. Enterprise is the segment where total communication is opening for Vodafone new opportunities. Let me talk about three trends. First of all, mobilization of workers. We all know that in all companies, people are bringing their own devices. People want to use tablets. People want to extend what they usually normally do on a PC, to their personal devices. This is a trend, which goes in our direction because device management becomes very important, because security management becomes very important.</p>
          <p>Second trend is companies &#x2013; large companies moving to IP networks, which means that once they have them, they start looking at unified communications. We have been active in the unified communications across mobile and fixed for a number of years in Europe. So again, we are kind of specialist of this. And third trend, cloud services. Companies going to cloud, especially small companies, bank software more and more as a service from the cloud, where what we have is the distribution, the salesperson, the relationship on a daily basis with companies that don't have the sophistication of large companies.</p>
          <p>So, again, three trends that in enterprise space go into our direction. What are our activities here? I would say we want to play selectively here. Clearly, at the fixed data services level, we are basically reselling where we have our own services or the Verizon services, IPVPN, on a broader scale and we have an agreement to do so. The communication service layers, clearly solutions like the One Net. You have in your appendix the economics, which are &#x2013; look very good for One Net. We have 1.7 million users in Europe of One Net. We are going to push the One Net solution across all of the European countries and also in the large <mark type="ph" /> of course (28:10) outside of Europe.</p>
          <p>We don't intend to play at the hosting level. We don't think we can reasonably be very competitive today at the hosting level. So, we don't have plans there. And instead, we want, especially in the SME segment, and we are already selling in the SME segment, reselling Software as a Service from the Microsofts, the Googles or whoever sees an opportunity to work with us.</p>
          <p>And finally, at the higher level ICT services, we don't have any intention to be a direct competitor or direct major competitor to IBM and Accenture, but for the VGE part, so for the multinational accounts where we are very strong and we have a very strong and dominant position, we are actually acquiring consulting skills to play for those accounts in that space, an integration of the basic services. So, convergence in enterprise is giving us actually more opportunities than in the past and this is how we want to exploit them.</p>
          <p>Now, to conclude, Supermobile, I think, is working. We are &#x2013; we have a small offer in new services, but potentially a big market in front of us. Enterprise can help. What are the priorities going forward? I would say, first of all, geographically in Europe, we want to maintain our competitive edge and of course we need to work on cost because we didn't talk much about macroeconomic situation, but we need to be ready for, especially in Southern Europe, some continuation of the challenging times.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, we need to continue to focus on growth and profitability, but particularly stimulate the data take-up. I'm a great believer in data in emerging markets and, therefore, we want to play in emerging markets the same role that we have played in Europe. And in the U.S., we need to continue the collaboration on technology, on purchasing, and especially on large account.</p>
          <p>In terms of business priorities, on data, continuing our network leadership &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> in best work (30:09) leadership investment, but working also on improvement of the data economics, develop new services integrating our own capabilities with third-party platforms and then enterprise, which as I described, means not just the big, large international accounts, but also SMEs and SoHos. All of this to continue to deliver, as Andy has illustrated, our cash flow, our profit to support our commitment to shareholders' returns.</p>
          <p>This is the end of my presentation. I would ask my colleagues to join me for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could you discuss a little bit what sort of benefit you may have had from entering the iPhone market late in Europe in terms of market share gain? And at what point that might wear off?</p>
          <p>Secondly, whether we should be bracing ourselves for an effect on margin in the second half from the iPhone 4S. And then otherwise, could we see India, given the high rates of growth, start to go in sort of scale mode where we start to see margin gains in that business over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will start the iPhone answer, then maybe, Michel, you can integrate on the 4S and Andy on the India thing. I don't think we got particular benefit for being late on the iPhone, if I have to be honest. Actually, we suffered quite a bit. I think now the situation is normalized. I think we are back to where the normal situation should be. I always said, throughout the two years where we have not had the iPhone, that there was a clear drag on us coming from not having it.</p>
          <p>Now, customers basically are &#x2013; they can choose what they want and that's where our Supermobile strategy should give us a little bit of a differential advantage. But I don't think that you can say we have a real advantage. There was a bit of catch up but not a huge amount.</p>
          <p>On the 4S, Michel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the first point, yes the catch-up is now done and I guess that we're quite successful with the iPhone. On the 4S, we don't, let's say, see a major impact in margin in the second half. We have had a little bit of impact this month in the U.K., for example, because that was the first month of launch. Probably it will substitute to some high-end type of other phones, so we don't, let's say, foresee a major impact of the 4S.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just on in the euro, yeah, I do think we're at the point of seeing scale effects moving forward. I think you've got the benefits, obviously, of pricing feeding through with price increases going in the market, but also greater site sharing, asset sharing, just generally, and I would say optimization of A&amp;R.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nick Delfas from Morgan Stanley.</p>
          <p>Just really in contrast first between Germany, where I think your margins, excluding fixed line, are rising and probably above 50%, versus Spain where another very different macro, but you've actually got a decline in EBITDA, which is just faster than the decline in revenue, which is quite unusual and not what we're seeing from Telef&#xF3;nica. So, what is the reason? Is it the starting point that was more difficult in Spain, the price perception? Why is Spain so much worse than, say, Germany?</p>
          <p>And the second question is you didn't mention fixed line, I don't think, really in your presentation at all. Is there any point having fixed line bases anymore within Vodafone? Is it something you could divest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the broad answers for myself and then eventually, if you have more detailed questions, we can integrate.</p>
          <p>First of all, the Spain versus Germany thing, I don't think our mobile margin is above 50% in Germany, but maybe in Italy, maybe. But you're right. Directionally, it's higher than the 37.8% than the average indicates.</p>
          <p>It's a very different situation from Spain. I mean, Spain had, as I said, a partial point of very high premium prices and very high commercial cost. So, made a deliberate decision to say we need to put the market in long-term sustainable conditions, which means lower prices and much lower structural costs. Also because a country of 40 million people cannot have that type of very expensive distribution. So, we needed to make an effort, which will eat into the customer base revenues for a while in order to rebalance the market.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we're also doing all the other things, so rationalizing distributions, reducing commissions and all these things.</p>
          <p>Germany is a very different case. Germany is a case where the average price is more or less, if not even a touch below the average of Europe, doesn't require that type of treatment. So, it's a very different situation. One is a deliberate choice of restructuring, the other one is a great market just continuing to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess the issue is that there's the &#x2013; the cost structure going up in Spain faster than the revenues are coming down, <mark type="ph" /> which is arriving, (35:59) so that the decline in EBITDA is actually -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your core cost -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you &#x2013; the decline in EBITDA is actually bigger than the decline in revenue in Spain. So, it indicates that actually you're investing more in the cost base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the two countries, first I guess that in Germany, we spoke about Germany in the past few quarters. I guess that we have renewed with growth and so now we are tackled &#x2013; tackling, sorry, the cost structure and that's where you'll see that we have an improvement in our EBITDA margin for the first time in Germany. And I guess that it's what we were committed to do and are still to, let's say, still to be done in the cost structure in Germany in order to make sure that we can still improve the profitability there.</p>
          <p>As far as Spain is concerned, I guess there are two things that we might highlight in the cost structure, one which is around commercial expense, as Vittorio has just mentioned. In order, let's say, to regain competitive traction, we have had to make, let's say, improvements of course in our offers, but also to increase slightly our A&amp;R to push smartphones. And when you look at, let's say, the smartphone penetration in Spain, it has increased quite significantly and our data growth was around 60% on Internet on your mobile in the quarter. So, that was a real choice that we have done there.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, by the way, we have tried to, let's say, work on some efficiencies of A&amp;R, pushing for 24 months contract or also to aligning our A&amp;R to the high value type of package, so which means that our A&amp;R intensities, the level of A&amp;R that we spend per commitment from our customers is decreasing. But that's true that, in absolute terms, it increased slightly.</p>
          <p>So, second in OpEx, you're right. The construction spend has always been quite lean. But for different reasons, meaning just so we're clear, we have, let's say, faced some issues migrating to data. And so, there we have had to make some one-shot investments in our customer care in order to improve it and to improve our customer experience. But there, as well, we intend, let's say, to continue to work on our cost structure in the next coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on fixed line, your second question, we didn't talk about fixed line in broader terms because I always said that fixed line is a local strategy. So, I think Andy mentioned, Italy is going very well, 13% growth. Germany is going well, especially in enterprise, 7% &#x2013; 6%, 7% growth in enterprise in Germany. It really depends a lot &#x2013; and in other markets, it's also &#x2013; I mean, I can mention Turkey or India, which is small but going up a lot. It's a very local type of strategy. It depends on what the competitors do. It depends on the regulatory framework. It depends on our infrastructure.</p>
          <p>So, it's difficult for us to generalize. Do we need to dispose of those bases? No. We need just to make the integration of fixed mobile in whichever way makes sense at the local level. And therefore, it's not a generalized strategy.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>I said Robin, then we come here. Yeah, and then we go back, don't worry. <mark type="ph" /> Andrew. (39:02)</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It's Robin Bienenstock from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
          <p>This time last year, we were all talking about soft SIMs and now we're seeing iMessaging and iVoice into increasingly dominant operating systems. So, I guess, simple question, or high level question, are you more or less worried about value chain threats than you were a year ago? And how do you think you can improve your relative negotiating power, your relative power, versus the operating systems and I guess, in particular, Apple?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, last year you were talking about these thing, you were writing about them the night before, if I remember correctly.</p>
          <p>I would say we are neither more worried, nor less worried. We are aware, which is the important thing. So, the reason why I started my presentation with the &#x2013; how much is what, is exactly because we are aware that there are technological changes. We need to ride these changes, we cannot fight against, and we need to make sure that the revenue composition and how we charge to our customers is consistent with the future.</p>
          <p>So, is iMessenger something that can eat into our SMS revenues? Answer, yes. Revenues?  Answer, yes, if you don't have integrated pricing. Less if you have integrated pricing, or even nothing if you have integrated pricing, which is why we are stressing how much and what's the progress, which we have made in the last six months introducing into the integrated pricing.</p>
          <p>We keep watching. We are very alert. We are very aware and we are very <mark type="ph" /> well (40:31). Can &#x2013; how can we change our power? I mean, I think, here we should be careful in not mixing two things. One, what customers want. If something is wanted by the customers, there's no point in fighting against, it's just a matter of pricing in an intelligent way. I cannot go against the will of the customers. Something is good is good, end of the story.</p>
          <p>Different thing is, how can I change the balance of power in the economic relationship with these guys? And the only answer is by having more choice, which is why we support Android. Now, Android is, by far, our biggest contributor, which is why we would support a third system coming from Windows, Nokia or whoever, which is why we like BlackBerry. At the end of the day, the more choice you have, the better it is, which is why I also made the point about the tablet. Tablets cannot be &#x2013; not just one single thing, but there's nothing as other than having more competition and having choice.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You can see your pricing going in the right direction on contract, more in bundles, et cetera. Are you also happy that your prepaid pricing is going in the right direction?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it only went up to &#x20AC;2.5, right, Michel? So again, even prepaid, you can do the same thing.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not &#x2013; at the end of the day, whether I pay &#x20AC;2.5, whatever per day, or &#x20AC;7 per week, or &#x20AC;20 per month, it's still a concept of bundle. That's exactly the reason why Michel is moving all the European companies in that direction. James, you had a question? And then we go back. Yeah. Emmet and then -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's James Britton from Nomura.</p>
          <p>Firstly, around your cost focus of the company. You've transitioned towards more of a growth angle, but can we expect a new group-wide cost savings plan when the current one comes to an end? And are you going to be able sustain the current cost savings and run rate, &#xA3;500 million a year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you talked about being quite confident about recovery in top line growth in the second half, but I think in the appendix to the pack, I don't find the MTR <mark type="ph" /> relaxation (42:37) in the second half. It doesn't seem that significant. How confident are you still today about recovery in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, on the cost one, we are and we identified a number of initiatives that we've been undertaking. Vittorio talked about some in IT. I talked about some of the network logistics side. We are constantly working away on cost initiatives for the program we've got underway at the moment, which I think we talked about a two-year program, is absolutely on track. We are getting the savings out. We just aren't talking about them maybe as much, but we've given some visibility there.</p>
          <p>We just had another discussion about where the next series of cost reductions will come from. And this is like <mark type="ph" /> filling a hopper (43:18) because from the idea to actually research, you get just starting to put it into motion to get it &#x2013; so we're constantly needing to work a year ahead. So, yes, absolutely working on the cost side, and there's all sorts of errors where we'll be now starting to engage to look at what we can next do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the top line recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The top line recovery. I mean the MTR part, you touched briefly upon, we get the benefit, particularly in Germany, but that starts to roll through in the latter part of the year, so the MTR effect will be slightly lower in the second half than in the first half. What we've said about the generality of the rest of the business, we've got good momentum in many of the markets. And overall, I think we're comfortable with the direction of travel at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you expect the growth to increase in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I didn't say that I expect it to increase, I expect that we will keep the momentum going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmet, Andrew, and then we go &#x2013; yeah. This way. There, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmet Kelly from Merrill Lynch. Two questions, please.</p>
          <p>Firstly, you've increased the prices in some of your key markets. I think <mark type="ph" /> iPhone (44:25) prices have gone up in India, contract prices have gone up in the Netherlands. And I think there were some prepaid price increases in the U.K. Can you just say what impact and traction you have had with those price increases in your second quarter and what you're expecting going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is more a big picture question. If I go back two years ago, Verizon Wireless decided to push ahead very aggressively with LTE. Their balance sheet has started to deleverage and I think they saw an opportunity maybe to grab some market share from some other competitors especially from AT&amp;T who were having problems with their network at the time. Going into 2012, 2013, your balance sheet now looks like it's in a pretty reasonable shape as well. So, is it fair to say that some of your main competitors are quite capital constrained, the likes of Telef&#xF3;nica in Spain or in the U.K.?</p>
          <p>And do you think there is any merit in perhaps replicating the Verizon Wireless strategy and maybe pushing ahead a little bit more aggressively with LTE to maybe win a bit of market share? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the big picture question and maybe, Michel, you want to answer on pricing? Do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, sorry. Yes, so looking the different markets in which we do operate, yes, that's true that we have tried to improve a little bit our pricing when it is feasible. You &#x2013; two examples, in Netherlands on one side, what we have done is, let's say, reduce data allowance, let's say, more and more you will see us trying to do that because we have always said that our strategy was to monetize data in the future, so not to give too much data to start with and then allow our customers to be able to upgrade. And by the way, Netherlands, we have also introduced different type of price plans with additional features in it and which allows us, let's say, to increase a little bit the price in the U.K. that was slightly different. We have rounded some prices and we have also increased some out-of-bundle prices, because customers want to, let's say, be clear in what is in the bundle.</p>
          <p>And, let's say, a little bit has relaxed when it is, let's say, for Spain outside of those bundles. That's the things that we have done in the past in Portugal, in Spain, in Italy, so you can expect from us to try to improve the pricing when the conditions are there, and, let's say, where we can get <mark type="ph" /> protection (46:34). You were asking me whether it has had any impact, now, you see in our figures that in the U.K. and in Netherlands, it has translated in revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, from emerging markets perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think if you take India as the example you used, we put through a 20% effective price increase. Those prices are sort of seeding into the base as we speak. So, we're about 20% penetrated at the moment. <mark type="ph" /> I used to fly (47:04) around the emerging markets, but 20% penetrated as we speak. We expect that to be 60% penetrated by the end of the fiscal year. So, you've already seen, quarter-over-quarter, that our price point has now stabilized. So, I'd hope that it would improve going forward.</p>
          <p>If I was using Africa, I'd say inflation across Africa has clearly made operators acutely aware of the need to consider pricing. So, instead of big headline drops, I think you've seen a stabilization and more promotional pricing, and Kenya, Safaricom, just put up their prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the big picture question, let me tell you, first of all, we are not &#x2013; and I'm not shy of investing if we can create a competitive advantage, which is why, as Andy has said, our CapEx are slightly up and which is why we have never reduced our investments, even in the horrible 2008, 2009 period.</p>
          <p>So, I do believe that technology can be an advantage for a company like Vodafone or for a company like Verizon. And we would definitely invest, if we saw the benefit.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure you can translate the Verizon Wireless LTE story straight into Europe, in the sense that we have, as I have indicated, a little bit of a broader approach, which our HSDPA, which has room to go. We have LTE, so where we get the frequencies like in Germany, the answer is yes. We're getting now into the cities. In other places, we will improve first HSDPA. Use single RAN to make sure that, at any point in time, we can switch and integrate. But there's no point in anticipating a big investment if the handsets are not there, or if you don't see an opportunity.</p>
          <p>So the answer to your question is a philosophical yes, but not exactly the same strategy as Verizon Wireless.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I come back to the pricing question? Can you just talk a little bit about the consumer acceptance of pricing increases? And whether they are starting to see more benefit from higher &#x2013; slightly higher data pricing? And whether it is simply a matter of in-market competition and what your rivals are doing now?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just looking at the costs of network and technology more generally, obviously, you've talked a bit about the benefits of Single RAN. Just wondering about some of the other things that seem to be coming out of the vendors now, such as centralizing the OSS, BSS. Potentially in the longer term moving the baseband into the cloud. Whether those are things that might change the capital intensity or OpEx of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the second is a perfect big picture question for Steve, who is the CTO.</p>
          <p>And on the first one, on pricing, I mean &#x2013; it's very difficult to say. Can you really increase prices regardless of competitors? Answer is no. Are we seeing a certain willingness on the customer side to take decent price increases when there is value in them? Answer, yes.</p>
          <p>What is decent depends a bit on how the competitors react. So in some markets, it's &#xA3;1 or &#xA3;2. In others &#x2013; or &#xA3;0.5 or &#x20AC;0.5 in the Italian prepaid case. In some markets, it's a fraction of a rupee. So you have to go, basically, to follow what the competitors.</p>
          <p>What we are seeing is that, given the low levels of the European prices and the super-low levels of the Indian prices, at the end of the day, there's not a negative reaction, if you do things in an intelligent and proper way. That's what I would characterize it. But it's very difficult to say, can you do it regardless of competitors? No, of course not.</p>
          <p>Steve, big picture. Technical evolution. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this on? Good. Good morning. Yeah, two answers to the question.</p>
          <p>Firstly, similar to that of the IT world &#x2013; in networks OSS and BSS &#x2013; we can centralize, as we are &#x2013; for example, we used our 13 core NOCs, network operating centers in Europe. We now have one in Germany, so we can get the operational efficiencies, de facto, from our scale.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the vendors are indeed enabling new sciences to be more efficient. OSS and BSS centralization is something that we're following rapidly and we're employing, and a key enabler for that centralization in the NOC.</p>
          <p>Cloud or radio baseband in the cloud, we've been trialing that. It has some trade-offs on increased cost in transport, so we're looking for the economic sweet spot of exactly what you'll do and where there. But we're at the forefront of that. I think the vendors would tell you, and there's certainly a leap <mark type="ph" /> about in (52:17) helping shape and design that.</p>
          <p>There are others that you don't mention, but would fall in the same bucket. IP Microwave continues to improve. That can take us over a gig now, which takes us right through LTE, so that offers us economics in scale.</p>
          <p>E-band Microwave, which is brand new &#x2013; this is unlicensed spectrum &#x2013; is yet another example where science keeps pushing the boundaries of efficiencies for us to not so much reduce your CapEx, but allow you to get more for your money and to spend on areas that touch customers in &#x2013; for example, increasing our reach, raising the baseband level, or HSDPA and other things that we share with you in our strategy.</p>
          <p>So yes is the answer, and I would have the vendors, when you talk to them, and say Vodafone is helping shape their future with that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Will Draper, Esp&#xED;rito Santo. One on the balance sheet, one on the P&amp;L, if that's okay.</p>
          <p>Your debts have fallen to pretty low levels now, and will keep falling despite the general shareholder returns, which brings us to what else you might do with the cash. You've talked a little bit about in-market consolidation and you're trying to do Greece. Maybe you could update us a little on Greece, and if there's anything else that you're thinking of by way of in-market consolidation.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the P&amp;L, there was a good beat at operating profit, but earnings was just about in line. Some of that was to do with higher financing costs, but some of it looked like higher tax, also. And I wondered if you could just talk about why the effective tax rate moved up and where you see that for the full year. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me give you a very detailed answer on the market consolidation. I'm sure everybody is ready to take notes.</p>
          <p>First of all, it's not linked to the debt levels. To be clear, market consolidation makes sense. If it makes sense, you look at it. And we are looking at every single possible case, as we have been doing for the last three years.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm not giving you any detailed update. It takes three to dance. You, the other one and the regulator.</p>
          <p>Greece &#x2013; I mean there was some kind of leakage, so we said, yes. We are in talks. We keep being in talks. There's no real update. We are trying to find a solution which can satisfy the consumers, i.e., the regulator; the investment profile which makes sense for the country, i.e., the macroeconomic situations; and of course, the shareholders of both companies.</p>
          <p>And that's the effort that we are making there, which is more specific of Greece, given the situation. We are looking at all other situations.</p>
          <p>I said always I'm in favor of supporting third-party consolidation, or being active. And this is where we are. And when we have something for an answer, we'll announce.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tax rate. Well, it all depends who's expectation you are comparing with. We have said mid-20s. 25.2% is about as close as we could get to that, so that was very close to what we were expecting. The previous first half was, I think, 23%, so which is fractionally lower. But basically, the tax was very in line with where we had expected it to be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. Simon Weeden from Citigroup.</p>
          <p>I wondered if I could ask on Italy, if you could elaborate a little bit on the balance there between competitive pressure versus economic pressure. You've mentioned both, but looking at the numbers, the ARPU is fine and the customer base is where the extra weakness came from, particularly mobile. So that looks perhaps a bit more competitive.</p>
          <p>And then just if I could ask you to elaborate a little bit more on the swap hit to the P&amp;L, and what that might look like going forward and what it's about. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say that in Italy, probably nothing very new compared to what you have seen in the previous quarters. I guess that the competitive position of Vodafone remains quite strong. You know that we have a very differentiated brand there, and that we are doing quite well in the market, whether it's in mobile or in fixed.</p>
          <p>We still are facing some aggressive behaviors from some of our competitors, mainly Telecom Italia, which have slowed down a little bit, let's say, a few quarters &#x2013; a few months ago &#x2013; but which is back, let's say, quite aggressive on mobile number portability. And also in data allowance. I have said earlier on that what we were trying to do was to reduce data allowance in order to, let's say, allow data monetization in the future.</p>
          <p>Of course, let's say, it's better when all the players are moving in the same direction, which is not yet completely the case there. So, a little bit more aggressiveness in the market in the recent weeks.</p>
          <p>Despite that, I guess that, as you have seen, we have posted quite good results, driven by data, driven by messaging, with some pressure on voice for <mark type="ph" /> what I have said (57:11) and also, as Vittorio was mentioning, driven also by fixed.</p>
          <p>So I would say very strong competitive performance. The macro remains unknown for the next coming quarters, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mark-to-market, put simply, is we took the decision, as I said, to fix more going forward. We have done that at rates which, compared with historic averages, are very good. The actual market rates have dropped slightly below that at the moment, and we have to basically account for that difference.</p>
          <p>So going forward, I'd hope it wouldn't deteriorate, but it is just totally dependent upon the market rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Christopher Nicholson from ORACA. I guess that you must have done the necessary scenario planning in case Italy were to go bust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean personally? [laughter]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you want to discuss that. But what is Vodafone's view on its European assets in this case? Do you expect, essentially, for it to be a disaster for you or actually something a little less bad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we do not expect a disaster, but we expect hard work. Specifically in Italy, I don't think Italy will go bust, but of course, there's lot of hard work that has as an implication. Probably consumer confidence being not at the highest, and some pressure on enterprise and business as well.</p>
          <p>Having said that, as Michel has said, if you ask me, Italy is a market where we have already low prices, I mean low price per minute, and a very efficient commercial and distribution cost structure, plus a very strong network, a powerful network, which is fixed and mobile, but very strong on mobile.</p>
          <p>So I would say structurally, Vodafone in Italy is pretty strong. So even if the country goes a little bit through hard times, I think that we have all &#x2013; if you look at our distribution, it's a franchise distribution mostly. So variable cost. Can handle pretty flexible way. If you look at our enterprise distribution, again, it's partners, is a lot of third parties.</p>
          <p>So we have some flexibilities in it. We have outsourced some parts of the network maintenance. So there is flexibility built in the system in a pretty robust body.</p>
          <p>We have time to go in same direction in Spain, which is what I mentioned before, because Spain had a different type of structure. And we are trying to take care of Greece in the way that I described before. So this is a bit the plan for these.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't put Italy, Spain and Greece exactly in the same bucket. They are three different types of pressures.</p>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah. Can you come here? Yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's James Ratzer from New Street Research. First question I had was regarding Germany, please. You've got just over 50,000 LTE customers at the moment. What are they buying the service for at the moment? Is that a fixed line substitute, or are they buying it to enhance their existing mobile activities?</p>
          <p>As you roll into urban areas next year in Germany, can we see a revenue growth acceleration in Germany like we see <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:00:58)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:00:59) wireless, which in many countries, like this one, will be very competitive also with fixed line.</p>
          <p>On the corporate activity in India, I mean, India, first of all, these are recommendations that have to be &#x2013; become rules. We <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:01:15) it because there's still some distinction between GSM and CDMA, which we think is not right. Of course, we welcome if the 35 to 65 market share consolidation could be looked at. Of course, it increases the degrees of freedom of the system.</p>
          <p>Would we look at opportunities, if they arise, the answer is yes. I wouldn't be prescriptive on saying small or big. I mean, it depends. When you have certain players, the number of possible permutations is very high. But again, we would look at it. We would support.</p>
          <p>We think that India &#x2013; we have already done a little bit through the Indus Towers thing, because we clearly are already consolidating infrastructure. I think we are in a very good position because through the infrastructure company, we also have an additional competitive or reasons for being appealing.</p>
          <p>Australia, is it core? Well, now we need to fix it and we need &#x2013; the agreement with our partner there is to make sure that the customers' side of the story is as good as the saving part of the story. As I said, the savings are there, but of course, we need to bring it back in terms of customer confidence and in terms of brand perception. So, in the short term, it's hard work and <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:02:38).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ottavio Adorisio from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Gen&#xE9;rale. I have a couple of questions.</p>
          <p>The first is for Andy. In the slides, there is a lot of comprehensive analysis on the impact on revenues from MTRs, but as you receive MTRs, also you pay MTRs. And ultimately there is the impact on cost.</p>
          <p>So, if it's possible to share with us, with MTRs coming down, and therefore with the cost from MTRs coming down, <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:03:45) the other side of the cost, or how much <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:03:49) retention acquisition costs?</p>
          <p>The second one is to Nick and actually a follow-up from the 20% increase on India. I reckon it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:09) price increase, but when inflation is 9%, it's probably easier.</p>
          <p>As you basically depend more and more on organic growth coming from emerging markets, I was just wondering how we can really offset growth in a hard currency like in Europe, with growth coming from emerging markets, where differentially inflation is going to be reflected in ForEx and, of course. When you have to repatriate cash at some stage, that would be a problem.</p>
          <p>So I was wondering if you can give us a bit of granularity about the great growth in emerging markets, net to the inflation?</p>
          <p>And the last one is very quick one. On data, how much is the basically take on network usage, vis-&#xE0;-vis voice? That's an update. You used to give, in the past, data as percentage of network capacity, vis-&#xE0;-vis voice. Used to be in the past, and if you could <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:10)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I take the first one? I mean as a rule of thumb, and this is approximate, 8% of revenue is mobile termination receipts, and roughly 7% of revenue is mobile termination rate payment. So a sort of 1% delta is probably order of magnitude, the net impact that you should think of.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Inflation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:49)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. It's a very sophisticated question. Let me make it a simpler one. So, just in terms of the emerging markets, I mean if we look ahead, we basically have three main drivers. So, we're still underpenetrated in many of the countries, and so we just get the natural penetration as we roll out network. And what I would say is compared to our competitors, we're pretty aggressive at rolling out network and capturing a disproportionate share as we go into rural areas, et cetera.</p>
          <p>I'd say secondly, the sophistication that we have in our mature markets in Europe in terms of CRM proposition development, stimulation, is still something we have yet to really deploy actively in developing markets. So, that's an advantage for us, given our knowledge of what works.</p>
          <p>And third is data opportunity, which I think Vittorio said was huge in emerging markets, what &#x2013; we're sitting around between 5% and 8% of service revenue, as opposed to an Australia at 18%. So, we're getting good <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:06:50) and 3G to come. So, my view is, yes, I think we've got strong growth opportunities. Relative to inflation, I'm not too sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the data question is 82% in Europe, and 66% group. Let's move totally to the other side, Robert, and then we come back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. I'm in self-imposed quarantine over here. In Europe, <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:07:19) the traffic growth stabilized after a rapid slowdown, only reaching the end of the bulk of the data, for traffic management techniques you've previously flagged or is there more behind this from a technical perspective, be it compression or whatever?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, it seems very logical, you get more dividend coming from Verizon Wireless <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:07:49) this next one. But the timing and the magnitude of any payments might vary. Would you look at smoothing the new level of Vodafone's total returns using your own strong balance sheet to avoid over uncertainty at the <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:08:09)? Thanks.</p>

          <p>It's a <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:08:49) of transport <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:08:56) the network and push relatively, frequently used <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:09:05) out to the edge to the base station, or even a handset, is another wave of data economics to be had and <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:08:11) -</p>

          <p>Thanks, very much, it's Stephen Howard here with HSBC. On slide 40, there's quite a powerful chart demonstrating a line of revenue growth and traffic growth in Europe and a gain, what I'm wondering is, are there any markets where you are seeing that at risk. So, in other words, are there any sort of destabilizing forces in any particular countries that you're worried about?</p>
          <p>And although I appreciate <mark type="ph" /> it's one (1:09:54) outside of Europe <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:09:57) you commenting on pricing pressure in the data segment in South Africa in the Vodacom results yesterday.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, we reduced our South African prices by about 20% post-pay August, pre-pay September and that will have a slowing effect on our service revenue growth in the second half. It was a response to competition. So, previously, it was promotional pricing and then that moved to structural pricing. I'd like to say they haven't quite learned the lessons in Europe, so whether that gets adjusted going forward. So, we try to pitch out what we think is still a very reasonable level, and we'll see what our level of performance is in the market versus the competition on that basis.</p>

          <p>Very quickly on Verizon. It strikes me that there must be opportunities and synergies between Verizon Wireless and Verizon group, which perhaps hadn't been fully addressed when there were perhaps more tensions in the relationship. Is that something you'd be looking at beyond the cost saving synergies that you've talked about already, but more operational ones?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question for Verizon, right? How can I answer about the question of synergies between a company where I'm a shareholder and a company where I'm not a shareholder? What I can tell you is, if you want to ask the detailed question, you should really ask them. What I can tell you is that we are trying to take a holistic view of how can we leverage on everything we can do, including what Verizon fixed line can do in the relationship with suppliers.</p>
          <p>So, for example, we are going to the Oracles, to the Dells, to the whatever, IBMs of this world, and saying, "Together, this is our spending. What can we do together?" And of course, that's how the other side comes in. But this is Vodafone and Verizon group, if you want. Between wireless and wireline, it's a question for them.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Maurice Patrick from Barclays.</p>
          <p>You spent a lot of time talking about driving profitable data growth and you've given examples of where you've seen it. Italy is one way you cited where perhaps you saw aggressive price competition with your competitor, TI. Are there any other markets where you feel as though you're not really controlling or driving those price increases, or where a competitor is driving lower or irrational data pricing?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, I cannot get into specific markets. I mean there's a &#x2013; I can make only generic comments. Otherwise, it could be seen negatively by authorities. Let me say, in general, data profitability in Europe is lower than in the U.S. where we compare notes on a regular basis with our friends of Verizon Wireless and of Asia, where we usually have a lot of partner, markets and friends.</p>
          <p>So, there is, I think, an opportunity and the need, in order to finance the investments, to bring it up. The speed at which this is happening is different by market. In some markets, there's more sensitivity to it, and in other markets there's less sensitivity to it. I wouldn't go market-by-market. The positive news is that in the last six months, as was noted by some analysts in the last year, I would say, it starts trending in the right direction, slowly, gently, back to Andrew's question, because of course, you cannot rock the customer relationship.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, when do you think things like charge-to-bill in emerging markets will become a material part of ARPU we'll see?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say, yeah, we want to deploy as quickly as possible. So, I think you look at emerging markets and we have a bigger opportunity because obviously, smartphone penetration is low single-digits. So, we need to get ahead of the curve to offer a breadth of services, so I think we have an opportunity to get ahead of a potential threat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But let me tell you, let me tell you, you need two things. You need 3G networks and you need smartphones with something like the Opera Mini browser, or something, which is affordable there. Once you have those two elements, then immediately, because there is no credit cards and there's no payment methods. So, as soon as possible, when the two things are aligned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Egypt would be a good example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, we go back there again. Yes. Let me see, one more, two more maybe and &#x2013; okay.</p>

          <p>Sorry. Sorry, Tim, I thought -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lawrence Sugarman from RBS. Just a couple of questions, if I could, on India. Potential changes being suggested by the regulator around MTR rates.</p>
          <p>First of all, could you give an indication as how likely do you think those will actually come in, and secondly, what sort of financial impact that might have? And secondly, the tax case in India seems to conclude from, at least, the judicial side of it. Do e have anything new in terms of timing, actually getting a result from it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on MTRs, so we find the recent announcement from the regulator a bit strange because, actually, the April 2009 current MTR rates are under dispute and are in the Supreme Court. So, basically, we disputed those rates to TDSAT. We won on the basis that they were not including capital costs. So, then the regulator went to the Supreme Court and we are currently in the Supreme Court. So, the next hearing is the 17th of November. So, given we were arguing they didn't include capital cost, it's a bit strange they're lower than the current MTRs. So, what I'd say is we're firmly opposing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with apologies to Tim &#x2013; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just on the tax case, we finished in court <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:16:20) weeks ago. I think it was after a nine-week hearing. Written submissions have now gone in. We do not know what the time period now is for adjudication. So, some point in the next few weeks or months, it's a bit vague.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies to Tim. You're right. I checked. You didn't ask the first question. So, you have the right to the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Tim Boddy from Goldman. So, just two slightly bigger picture questions.</p>
          <p>We're obviously heading into a period of much more challenging economic conditions in Europe generally, not just southern Europe. Can you talk about the structure of the mobile market now compared to how it was in '08-'09? And as we see economic consumer confidence fall, how do you think mobile consumers will react this time?</p>
          <p>And secondly, continue to see very strong growth in <mark type="ph" /> SAC, (1:17:13) 7% growth in customer costs in Europe. The question really is can you stabilize European EBITDA margins before, or without stabilizing that growth in customer cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:17:27) the contingent economic situation. If you think about even Greece, if you think about Italy, Spain, actually Spain despite everything, smartphone penetration is going up, data usage is up 15%, smartphone penetration 30%, so there is an underlying need, which is immediately satisfied by <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:18:10) things and by the tablet and by everything else. I was reading yesterday, 10% of American adults have a tablet now. So, if you come here, I mean there's no doubt <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:18:23) doubt it will come. It can come a little bit later, a little bit faster, but at the end of the day, I don't think that this will change the general demand.</p>
          <p>Now, your second question is absolutely right is will it come at a very high cost. I believe that we should actually continue to do what we're doing in Spain. So, try to reduce the cost <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:18:53).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>- final slide, which probably is the right summary. I think we are delivering solid results. Again, I want to stress the point the revenue profile is <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:19:29) we are becoming <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:19:34), as Andy have said, does mean returning cash and our commitment is to continue to drive the company for the long term and for the shareholders' returns.</p>
          <p>I thank you very much for all of your questions, and I'm sorry we couldn't take all of them.</p>
