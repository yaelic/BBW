          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to the TransCanada Corporation 2009 First Quarter Results Conference Call.  I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. David Moneta, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications.  Please go ahead, Mr. Moneta.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, and good afternoon everyone.  I'd like to take the opportunity to welcome you today.  We're pleased to provide the investment community, the media and other interested parties with an opportunity to discuss our 2009 first quarter financial results and other general issues concerning TransCanada.</p>
          <p>With me today, are Hal Kvisle, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Lohnes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Russ Girling, President of Pipelines, Alex Pourbaix, President of Energy, and our Vice President and Controller, Glenn Menuz.</p>
          <p>Hal and Greg will begin today with some opening comments on our financial results and other general issues pertaining to TransCanada.  Please note, that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks, a copy of that presentation is available on our website at transcanada.com and it can be found in the Investors section under the heading Conference Calls and Presentations.</p>
          <p>Following Hal and Greg's remarks, we'll turn the call over to the conference coordinator for your questions.  During the question-and-answer period, we'll take questions from the investment community first, followed by the media.  In order to provide everyone with an equal opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions.  If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue.  Also we ask that you focus your questions on our industry, our corporate strategy, recent developments and key elements of our financial performance.  If you have detailed questions relating to some of our smaller operations or your detailed financial models, Myles, Terry and I would be pleased to discuss them with you following the call.</p>
          <p>Before Hal begins, I would like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties.   For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please see the reports filed by TransCanada with Canadian Securities Regulators and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd also like to point out that during this presentation we will refer to measures such as comparable earnings, comparable earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT, and funds generated from operations.  These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and are therefore considered to be non-GAAP measures.  As a result these measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities.  These measures have been used to provide interested parties with additional information on the company's operating performance, liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Hal.</p>

          <p>Thank you, David.  Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us here on a Friday afternoon.  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about our 2009 first quarter results and about recent developments in TransCanada's business.  I'll then turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lohnes, who will review our financial results in more detail.</p>
          <p>TransCanada's solid first quarter financial performance demonstrates our ability to generate significant earnings and cash flow from our large portfolio of energy infrastructure assets.  As outlined in today's new release, TransCanada's net income for the quarter ended March 31 was $334 million or $0.54 per share.  Comparable earnings for the first quarter were $343 million or $0.55 per share.  Comparable EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.13 billion and funds generated from operations in the first quarter were $766 million.</p>
          <p>Looking forward we're well positioned to fund our large 2009 capital program.  This is due to our strong internally generated cash flow as well as our prudent decisions to maintain TransCanada's strong financial position and liquidity during these uncertain economic times.  To that end TransCanada successfully issued $3.1 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter and $1.1 billion of common shares at the end of 2008.  Although the carrying cost and dilution associated with these financings will have an impact on our 2009 results, we remain well positioned to generate strong long-term return for our shareholders.  Today we are in the midst of constructing $19 billion of commercially secured low risk project such as the Keystone Oil Pipeline, the North Central Corridor expansion, the Bruce Power refurbishment and three large scale gas-fired power plants that will be completed and placed into service over the next four years.  Each of these projects is expected to generate significant long-term earnings and cash flow for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2009 we continued to make significant progress on these low risk growth projects.  I will now expand on some recent developments.  As you know in October 2008 TransCanada agreed to increase its equity ownership in the Keystone Oil Pipeline partnerships to approximately 80%.  ConocoPhillips' equity ownership was reduced concurrently to approximately 20%.  Certain parties that have made volume commitments to the Keystone expansion had options to acquire up to a combined 15% ownership in the Keystone partnerships.  None of these options were exercised.</p>
          <p>Our 2009 capital spending and financing plans were prepared in the expectation that we would remain as an 80% owner of the Keystone partnerships.  The decision by certain committed shippers does not change our financing plans for the year.  Construction on Phase I of the Keystone Oil Pipeline continues and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.  On the regulatory front TransCanada filed an application with the National Energy Board to construct and operate the Canadian portion of the Keystone expansion to the Gulf Coast and we are proceeding with state and federal regulatory filings in the United States.</p>
          <p>On the gas side regarding our Alberta System, later this month we expect to complete the first section of the North Central Corridor expansion at a total capital cost this year of approximately $400 million.  Construction of the remaining sections and associated facilities will continue throughout 2009 with final completion of the North Central Corridor expansion anticipated in April 2010, about a year from now.</p>
          <p>In February, the National Energy Board determined that the Alberta System is within federal jurisdiction and is subject to regulation under the National Energy Board Act effective April 29, 2009.  Under federal regulation, TransCanada will be able to apply to the National Energy Board for approval to extend its Alberta Pipeline System across provincial borders.  This will allow the company to provide attractive service options and rates to producers in British Columbia and the North.</p>
          <p>In February TransCanada announced the successful completion of a binding open season to connect new shale gas supply in the Horn River basin north of Fort Nelson, B.C. to the Alberta System.  TransCanada also recently concluded the successful binding open season for gas transmission service connecting the Northeast B.C. Montney shale gas play to our Alberta System.  Together the Horn River and Groundbirch pipelines have secured firm transportation support for volumes climbing to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by the year 2014.  The Horn River and Groundbirch extensions of the Alberta System will further strengthen our pipeline franchise in Western Canada and on the Canadian mainline and U.S. pipelines that move natural gas to premium North American markets.</p>
          <p>Further on our Canadian gas pipelines, Trans Quebec &amp; Maritimes Pipeline received the National Energy Board decision on its cost of capital application for the years 2007 and 2008.  The NEB decision granted TQM, an aggregate return on capital of 6.4% leaving it to TQM to choose its optimal capital structure.  This was an important National Energy Board decision for the Canadian natural gas pipeline industry.</p>
          <p>On the U.S. side in our U.S. gas pipeline business we continue to advance our Rockies pipeline initiatives.  TransCanada's Bison pipeline project filed an application in April with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the right to construct, own and operate the Bison pipeline.  The Bison project will consist of approximately 302 miles of 30-inch diameter natural gas pipeline.  The pipeline is designed to transport gas from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming to Midwest U.S. markets.  Bison's contracted capacity of approximately 407 million cubic feet per day has the potential to expand up to approximately one Bcf per day over time.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our energy business, the 550 megawatt Portlands Energy Centre located in downtown Toronto was fully commissioned under budget on April 22, 2009.  We are very pleased with that outcome and very pleased to have Portlands Energy Center in service.  The power plant which is 50% owned by TransCanada will provide much needed electricity to Toronto homes and businesses.  The predictable sustainable cash flows and earnings contributions from Portlands under a 20-year accelerated clean energy supply contract with the Ontario Power Authority, is another example of TransCanada's low risk business growth to the power business in Ontario and Quebec.  Progress also continues on the Bruce nuclear restart project and the Halton Hills generating station, both located in Ontario along with the Kibby Wind Project in Maine and the Coolidge Generating Station in Arizona.  In summary, opportunity such as these and many others I highlighted at our annual meeting earlier today will continue to build long-term value for our shoulder.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to Greg Lohnes, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide additional details on our first quarter 2009 financial results.  Greg.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Hal and good afternoon everyone.  As Hal mentioned earlier today we released our first quarter results.  Net income for the first quarter was $334 million or $0.54 per share compared to $449 million or $0.83 per share for the same period last year.  Comparable earnings in the first quarter were $343 million or $0.55 per share compared to $326 million or $0.60 per share for the same period in 2008.  First quarter 2009 and 2008 comparable earnings excluded $9 million after tax and $12 million after tax respectively of net unrealized losses resulting from the changes in the fair value of proprietary natural gas storage inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts.  In addition, first quarter 2008 comparable earnings excluded $152 million of Calpine bankruptcy settlement, the $10 million GTN lawsuit, and the $27 million write-down of Broadwater LNG project costs.</p>
          <p>Before I review our results in more detail, I would like to highlight for the benefit of those who did not have the opportunity to listen to last week's conference call that we have changed our financial reporting format.  The Pipeline and Energy business segments are now grouped into Canadian and U.S. categories.  We also have enhanced our financial reporting to show asset results at the EBITDA level and segment results at the EBIT level.  Information on these changes along with supplemental financial information for 2008 and 2007 can be found in the investor section of our website under the heading Conference Calls and Presentations.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly review the first quarter results for each of our business segments at the EBITDA level beginning with pipelines.  The pipelines business generated comparable EBITDA of $871 million during the first quarter 2009, an increase of $69 million over the same period in 2008.  U.S. pipeline's comparable EBITDA increased $79 million, primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar and higher revenue from new growth projects at ANR.  The average U.S. to Canadian exchange rate in the first quarter 2009 was $1.25 compared to $1 in 2008.  Canadian pipeline's EBITDA in the first quarter 2009 of $505 million is comparable to $517 million reported in the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>In light of the nature of the Canadian regulated model, we continue to report the Canadian mainline Alberta System and Foothills net income as supplementary information in our quarterly report.  The net income contribution in first quarter 2009 from these three wholly owned Canadian pipelines increased $4 million to $111 million primarily due to the impact of the 2008-2009 Alberta System settlement.  Looking forward, although the global economic downturn can impact throughput on certain pipelines, the short-term financial outlook for our pipeline segments is not expected to be materially impacted on an annual basis.  Our pipeline assets earn a regulated rate of return and are generally underpinned by contracts with strong counter parties.</p>
          <p>Seasonality does affect our U.S. pipeline.  For example, ANR has historically realized approximately a third of its annual EBITDA in the fist quarter.  The second and third quarters tend to be weaker as a result of the spring and fall shoulder season.  ANR's EBITDA then tends to rise again in the fourth quarter as we start into the winter months.</p>
          <p>Next, some comments on Energy.  Energy generated comparable EBITDA of $290 million in the first quarter 2009 compared to $287 million in the same period last year.  Western Power EBITDA for the first quarter 2009 decreased $6 million compared to the first quarter last year.  This was primarily due to lower volumes of power sold in Alberta resulting from lower power plant availability under the PPAs, partially offset by lower PPA costs per megawatt hour.  Approximately 64% of Western Power sales volumes were sold under contract in the first quarter 2009 compared to 72% in the first quarter 2008.  To reduce it's exposure to spot market prices on un-contracted volumes, as at March 31, 2009 Western Power had fixed price power sales contracts for approximately 6,500 gigawatt hours or approximately 54% of planed production for the remainder of 2009 and 5,500 gigawatt hours, or approximately 37% of planned production for 2010.</p>
          <p>Eastern Power EBITDA of $52 million increased $17 million compared to $35 million in the first quarter 2008.  This was primarily due to increased earnings from Becton Coora and the Carleton wind farm at Cartier Wind which went into service in November 2008.  100% of Eastern power sales volumes were sold under contract in both first quarter 2009 and first quarter 2008 and will continue to be fully sold under contract in 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally in Canadian Power, TransCanada's proportionate share of Bruce Power's comparable EBIDTA increased $45 million compared to first quarter of 2008, this was primarily due to increased revenues from higher output and lower operating cost both as a result of fewer outage days at Bruce-B.  Higher contract prices at Bruce-A also increased TransCanada's proportionate share of Bruce Power comparable EBIDTA when compared to the first quarter of 2008.  100% of the output from Bruce-A in the first quarter of 2009 was sold at a fixed price of $63 per megawatt hour compared to $59.69 per megawatt hour in the first quarter 2008.  The Bruce power units ran at a combined average availability of 96% in the first quarter 2009 compared to 79% in the first quarter 2008.  Looking forward the overall plant availability percentage for 2009 is expected to be in the low 90s for the four Bruce-B units and in the mid 80s for the two operating Bruce-A units.</p>
          <p>To reduce it's exposure to spot market prices at March 31, 2009, Bruce-B had entered into fixed price sales contracts to sell forward approximately 8,350 gigawatt hours or approximately 45% of planned production for the rest of 2009 and 7,560 gigawatt hours or approximately 35% of planned production for 2010.  At March 31, 2009, Bruce-A had incurred $2.7 billion for the refurbishment and restart of Units one and two and approximately $200 million for the refurbishment of Units three and four.</p>
          <p>Turning to U.S. Power.  EBITDA in the first quarter 2009 was $30 million compared to $55 million in the same period last year.  This was primarily due to decreased water flows at TC Hydro and a small expected loss at Ravenswood as a result of seasonally lower capacity payments.  These decreases were partially offset by higher realized prices on sales to commercial and industrial customers in New England and the positive impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in the first quarter 2009.  To reduce its exposure to spot market prices, approximately 74% of power sales volumes were sold under fixed-price sales contracts in the first quarter 2009.  At March 31, 2009, U.S. Power had entered into fixed-price power sales contracts to sell forward approximately 5,000 gigawatt hours for the remainder of 2009 and 4,100 gigawatt hours for 2010.  Certain contracted volumes are dependent on customer usage levels.</p>
          <p>Finally, in our Energy segment, natural gas storage comparable EBITDA was $36 million in the first quarter 2009 compared to $67 million in the same period last year.  The decrease was due to lower withdrawal activity and reduced sales of proprietary natural gas at the Edson storage facility compared to first quarter of 2008.  Looking forward when compared to the outstanding results we had in 2008, our energy segment results outlook for 2009 is expected to decline as a result of the reduced market prices we are currently experiencing for power.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Corporate, Corporate EBIT in the first quarter 2009 was a loss of $30 million compared to a loss of $22 million in the same period last year.  The decrease in corporate EBIT was primarily due to higher support service cost in 2009, reflecting a growing asset base and inflation, as well as a third-party reimbursement of certain cost in the first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at some line items below EBIT, on the income statement.  First quarter 2009 interest expense of $295 million, increased $77 million compared to $218 million in the first quarter last year.  The increase in interest expense was primarily due to new debt issues of US$1.5 billion and Canadian $500 million in August 2008 and US$2 billion and Canadian $700 million in January and February 2009, respectively.</p>
          <p>In addition, U.S. dollar denominated interest expense increased due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.  These increases were partially offset by increase capitalization of interest to finance the company's larger capital spending program in 2009.  On a consolidated basis, the positive impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on U.S. pipelines and energy results is almost fully offset by the net negative impact on U.S. interest expenses and other non-operational expenses thereby effectively reducing the company's exposure to changes in foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Interest income and other was $22 million for the first quarter 2009 compared to $11 million for the same period in 2008.  The increase of $11 million was primarily due to higher gains from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to manage the company's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Income taxes were $116 million for the first quarter 2009 compared to $252 million for the same period in 2008.  The decrease in income taxes was primarily due to the first quarter 2008 Calpine bankruptcy settlements, as well as higher tax rate differentials, and other positive tax adjustments in 2009.  Non-controlling interest of $35 million in the first quarter 2009 decreased $36 million compared to $71 million in the same period of 2008 primarily due to the non-controlling interest portion of Portlands Calpine bankruptcy settlements in first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to the cash flow statement.  Funds generated from operations were $766 million in the first quarter 2009 compared to the $922 million in the first quarter 2008.  Excluding after-tax proceed received from the Calpine bankruptcy settlements in the first quarter 2008 of $152 million, funds generated from operations in the first quarter 2009 were consistent period-over-period.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures and acquisitions in the first quarter 2009 of approximately $1.3 billion relate primarily to a number of growth opportunities including the Keystone pipeline system, expansion of the Alberta system, Bruce Power, Kibby Wind, Halton Hills, Coolidge, and Portlands Energy Centre.  TransCanada's financial position remained sound.  At the end of March, our balance sheet consisted of 55% debt, which included our proportionate share of joint venture debt, 4% Junior subordinated notes, 1% preferred shares, and 40% common equity.  I would note that our debt on this slide is calculated net of cash.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity position remains solid, underpinned by highly predictable cash flows from operations, significant cash balances on hand from recent debt issues, as well as committed revolving bank lines.  To date, no draws have been made on these bank lines.  TransCanada has maintained continuous access to the Canadian commercial paper market on competitive terms.  In the first quarter 2009, we issued $3.1 billion and retired $482 million of long-term debt.  We also issued 2.1 million common shares under the dividend reinvestment program in lieu of making cash dividend payments of $67 million.  At the end of 2008, we also issued $1.1 billion of common shares.</p>
          <p>This strategy is strengthening our liquidity and financial position through a proven ability to successfully access capital markets in uncertain economic times has significantly reduced the financing requirements for our 2009 capital program.  While the significant cash balance on hand means we're well positioned to fund our large capital program, the increased interest cost and dilution associated with these financings will have an impact on our 2009 overall and per share results.</p>
          <p>However, the near term impact will in due course, be offset by the incremental earnings and cash flow that will be generated in the future as $19 billion of commercially secured low-risk projects are completed and placed into service.  Going forward, we will continue to look at portfolio management either through outright asset sales or asset sell downs to our U.S. master limited partnership, TC Pipelines.  We will also look at subordinated capital options such as mandatory convertibles and preferred shares to prudently help finance our growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>That concludes my prepared remarks.  I will now turn the call back to David for the question-and-answer period.</p>

Just a reminder, before I turn it over to the conference coordinator, that we'll take questions from the financial community first and once we've completed that, we'll turn it over to the media.  So, with that, I'll turn it back to the conference coordinator for your questions.</p>

          <p>Hi good afternoon everybody.  Just starting in Alberta on the power price issue for a second, can you tell me -- we've got obviously the absolute volumes, how much hedges were actually added in the first quarter?  And I guess I am trying to get a sense of how you're viewing the hedge program in today's prices, if it's just sort of a methodical roll forward of layering in hedges as is typically done?  Or as we go through second quarter perhaps just given where prices are, we are going to hold-off on hedging anymore, I guess I am ultimately trying to see if you guys have a specific outlook you can share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl it's Alex.  You probably heard me talk in the past about this sort of 75, 50, 25 plus hedging percentage that we like to maintain sort of in the prompt year one out and year two.  And what I would say in Alberta is we're probably a little under hedged particularly in '010 and '011 versus that plan.  I would say going forward, when I look at forward power prices, gas prices and the implied heat rates coming out of that, I think the prices we're seeing in '09, sort of in the low 60s for the balance of the year those are probably pretty reasonable prices.</p>
          <p>And I would not be opposed and in fact you'll probably see us continue to hedge forward as opportunity permits and in and around that range.  My general view on 2010 and 2011 is we're talking about implied heat rates at those power prices well below 10,000 and I look at that.  This is a market that on average has cleared average heat rates in the range of 12 to 14,000 &#x2013; or $12 to $14 heat rates.  I look at that an implied heat rate of 9 or 10, it looks to me like 2010 and 2011 are not really good opportunities to hedge significantly right now, I think we'll have a lot of better opportunity later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very helpful.  And maybe a question for Alex with respect to Ravenswood.  It was nice to see the newer capacity summer auction be up actually 3 or 4% versus last summer kind of nice to see that, that's not cratering down with demand.  I guess, I just wanted to ask are you seeing, hearing or smelling anything with respect to the Poletti plant coming off in early 2010?  And given what we've just seen with the summer auction and if Poletti comes out, I mean are we still looking at basically capacity prices in 2009, or excuse me 2010 summer doubling over 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's pretty fair.  You'll recall when we did this deal we very much acknowledged that '09 was going to be our toughest year as we worked through the capacity.  Where we are now, at the time we announced the deal, we had said, one of the reasons we were comfortable with the market was that we felt that the New York City's O&amp;G market was particularly insensitive to even very major economic dislocations and I think so far that assumption has  proven to be well founded.  I think the New York ISO is so far looking at a reduction in peak demand of somewhere only of about 1% over previous forecast.  So the demand and particularly the peak demand is holding in.</p>
          <p>What I would say when I look at capacity we were pleasantly surprised to see that the first of the summer months, the May spot auction cleared close to $1 over our expectations.  We expect -- we're not seeing anything that would suggest that Poletti will not be coming out at the end of January 2010.  In fact I would argue given how incredibly difficult it would be to reverse that decision if there was any thoughts whatsoever of doing it, there would have to be very active intervention going on right now to keep that plant alive.  So, I would say our comfort level with Poletti retiring is probably as high or higher than at the time we bought the plant.  And when that retires we would expect to see probably close to a doubling of the 2009 contribution from Ravenswood.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Just further on Ravenswood, when might we expect to see Unit 30 coming back in to the service over the couple of months?  And can you provide some more color as to the cost impact both cost and revenue impact that it had in Q1 and &#x2013; what might be expected for Q2?  As well as an outlook on when insurance recoveries might kick in and how you'll be booking for those or if you already booking any of those insurance recovery?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll talk about the sort of the technical aspects and sort of my thoughts on the insurance Linda and Glenn might want to talk about how we're accounting for this.  The Unit 30 the router is now repaired.  It is back on site.  We expect to see Unit 30 back in service around the middle of the month in time for the obviously the very important summer capacity season.  With respect to the insurance proceeds we have taken the position that this is a loss that we believe is fully insured under our, both for property and for business interruption insurance.  And I'll pass it on to Glenn as to &#x2013; if he has any comments on sort of how we're treating that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure as we've said before the property insurance side of this is rather small in that the cost is not that large, it's quite small in relation.  But from a business interruption point of view, obviously any time you're dealing with any insurer there is always a debate as to how much will be covered, what it will be and working through all the details of that.  So once we have more clarity on that obviously we'll be able to look more at the accounting, but right now things are still in the discovery stages and working through the details.</p>

          <p>On your Energy side, just in terms of, I guess this is somewhat accounting related, one of your partners in Bruce-B Chemico has indicated they expect to make or to get some pretty major floor payments in the coming year.  And I guess my question is, is that the outlook that TransCanada expects as well and how would it be booked, because I'm understanding that Chemico would actually not book that on the income statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take a shot at that and let Alex jump in.  The floor payments on Bruce-B are the difference between where the market is clearing versus this preset amount.  But due to the terms of the contract with the OPA, these are also refundable at a future date at some point when the actual price exceeds the floor payment.  So as a result to-date as we've disclosed in the quarterly report and in our annual reports in the past, we have not recorded any of that in income.  It really &#x2013; it really requires an outlook of where you see power prices going over the course of the contract.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  I wanted to ask about your gas pipeline strategy because the gas market in North America has changed so much lately.  And TransCanada had a lot of focus on Northern Gas and also developing regassification facilities in and around North America.  Is there a shift now in strategy in terms of what you are developing on the gas front, given change in the pricing, I guess both in North America and globally with LNG?  So, what is the focus now I guess if it is not as much Northern gas and regas facilities, what is the focus for development on the gas pipeline business over the next say five years given where we are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Matthew its Hal.  Clearly, LNG projects are on the backburner for the next little while.  We had our regulatory set back on the Broadwater project, but given that we have full FERC approval and full coast guard approval, we're just working with Shell, our partner and considering whether we should terminate the project or put it on the backburner or just what kind of an approach we should take.  But clearly there is not a strong economic signal that we should be proceeding with Broadwater or any other LNG project in the near term.  We had pretty much terminated work on Cacouna quite a while ago.  So, it's not really an impact there.  Cacouna was not driven by the changes from the gas price market but rather by the Russian decision not to go ahead and enter into the gas supply contract with us.  So, that project was effectively on hold in any event.</p>
          <p>Northern pipes are interesting, I don't think anybody would proceed with the Mackenzie or Alaska pipeline project based on this month's gas price versus what gas prices were eight months ago.  Gas prices are obviously volatile and we look at them today and we would say that our gas price outlook for the longer term is somewhere in the 6 to $10 range and you could see over that period gas prices going well above $10 and you could see them going down into the 3 or $4 range as we're seeing right now.  But we don't think gas prices are going to remain below $4 because you can't actually offset the annual decline that occurs in the supply base every year.  We lose about 13 Bcf a day through declining production in North America and that much has to be brought back on just to maintain flat production and at prices below 4 bucks that simply can't occur.  So we would expect gas prices to move back up into that 6 to $10 range.</p>
          <p>The Alaska project is different from Mackenzie in that it is just a project to bring gas that's on production and that is being processed everyday and bring that production to market by building a pipeline to connect it.  Mackenzie is a little more complicated, there is no field development occurred and so in addition to the pipeline the producers have to make all of the investments to drill up the fields and develop the facilities.  And that's just puts an extra burden on Mackenzie and the urgency if you will of getting going on Mackenzie is not there to the same extent it is in the case of Alaska.</p>
          <p>What are we doing in the mean time?  We've actually got an awful lot of really interesting opportunity in front of us right now.  As you've seen we're building the North Central Corridor in Alberta to connect Northwest gas over into our Eastern Alberta System.  We are building, we are going to be building pipelines to connect Groundbirch that's the Montney play near Dawson Creek and to connect Horn River up near Fort Nelson; those are both large diameter pipes.  And just the magnitude of gas infrastructure is significant.  If you look at the Bison project, that's 300 miles or 500 kilometers of 30 inch pipe.  That's a relatively long haul large capital investment pipeline project in its own right and we've got good commercial terms on that.  We see opportunity to build feeder lines into the ANR system from the Haynesville Shale play and there is other projects like Marcellus and Fayetteville.  Really the things that's going to drive LNG offshore and might delay Northern Gas would be things like Shale Gas.  And so, we just have to shift our focus and look at those opportunities in the near term and we're not uncomfortable with that at all.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there are, we have significant opportunities to develop to both expand and existing reservoirs and operations in Michigan and to develop other -- there is a number of other geological features there that are well suited to gas storage.  In some of them, we have to negotiate commercial arrangements with other people that have a partial interest in them.  But the opportunities are there and we are watching storage closely and if market demand is there for it we've got a number of opportunities to go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Maybe just staying on the storage side, if we look at where gas prices are right now and you look at kind of where the strip is, it looks like there is a much better opportunity to make some money versus where you sat last year.  What's your ability right now to capture that curve and are you seeing the same dynamics at least kind of just building for better earnings as we get into the back half of the year and then into 2010?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>It's Alex.  We are &#x2013; you are correct.  We are seeing some very attractive spreads right now sort of up in the, up towards $1.60, $1.80 range.  We are right, I would say one of the things I would say about the storage, the unregulated storage business is, we are relatively hedged right now.  We're probably about 90, 92% forward sold in terms of our remaining storage capacity.  So, when you look at, I would look at the Q1 results and say they are fairly representative of a run rate for the rest of the year, may be a little lower in the middle and a little higher at the end of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  My other question was, with respect to looking at the subordinated capital or kind of the "equity alternatives", can you give a sense, probably for Greg, what you are seeing in terms of the timing when you want to try to complete one of these transactions?  And then specifically you mentioned TC Pipelines, we've seen that unit price come up quite a bit.  Is it at a level where you think you can do more than just kind of sopping up some of the debt capacity down at the LP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are right, we are seeing the LP market comeback and -- we are actually seeing all of the subordinated product markets starting to improve.  So, we continue to monitor them the &#x2013; we're starting to see the mandatory convertible market coming back.  Obviously the Canadian prep market has been a very active particularly with the banks.  And the demand for some diversification in that product with some industrial issuance would be I think fairly popular, so that market is available to us.  We're in pretty good shape right now but we continue to, to monitor that market going forward.  We're cognizant of the negative carry.  I think we've established for the marketplace that we do have access to capital and that we can fund our growth program and that liquidity isn't an issue for us.  So we'll just continue to monitor those markets as they open up and as the all in cost improve going forward here.</p>

And we're cognizant that, we're still in a volatile capital market and we see things moving up and down.  So we will be opportunistic, but we've got the opportunity to bide our time a little bit here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon.  Hal, if you could just give us some commentary on your thoughts on the value of long haul pipelines?  And in particular when you start to think about some of the shale plays and things like the Marcellus and the [ph} Utica that are closed to essentially big demand centers and what does that mean for the longer term, the longer term viability of pipelines like Transco and really things heading up in the Gulf into those regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I would say we don't know at this point how aggressively people will develop the Marcellus, how sustainable the production is, what kind of decline rates will occur.  Emphatically we don't know what kind of local opposition people are going to run into as they try to get drilling locations.  I am not trying to be pessimistic on it but these are some of the things that we have to see unfold over time.  Obviously if the Marcellus develops into a five Bcf a day play, it will have an impact on volumes coming up from the Gulf Coast.  But it may not necessarily be all that negative for Transco because they tend to be very well positioned to move short-haul gas from Pennsylvania into the New York market and things like that.  And these big U.S. pipes including our own ANR pipe are heavily depreciated and the rate base or the billing determinants for tariffs are much, much lower than the cost of any new build pipe.</p>
          <p>So I think that I expect that the industry would be able to cope with it and it would not have a dramatic affect.  If there was a long-haul pipe that just came from the Gulf Coast to the Marcellus, New York, Pennsylvania area and did not have any distribution element to it at the end I think those people would be more worried.  But both Transco and Tennessee for example have got very valuable end market serving pipes at the North end.</p>
          <p>I think we see, for TransCanada, it's a very interesting situation that, as Horn River and Montney gas come on in Western Canada, we get a little bit higher throughput on our system.  And under the Canadian cost to service model that reduces the toll for everyone and actually could turn out to be a good thing to help keep tolls low and stimulate development in other areas.  As volumes increase, we don't really make a lot more money on the Canadian regulated pipes, but we do sustain our income.  And it gives us a competitive advantage for tying in Northern and other gas, just keeping the volumes up reduces the toll for everyone.  We always like to have 20% spare capacity, so it makes it easier for people just to deliver to us than commit any kind of new pipeline.  And so we're always aware of that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, if you see very aggressive development of shale plays in the U.S. and we do see some of the higher end numbers like the five Bs out of Marcellus actually come to fruition.  In the North American context what are your thoughts and what does that mean for plays like Horn River and Montney?  Do you see that essentially wind up being, since it is the end of the pipe in the North American context essentially not being developed or the base is blowing out pretty wide from an Alberta market prospective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd look back over the last 15 years and people, there have been many interesting new sources of gas come along, but at the time they come along people proclaim that they are going to change the world.  And they get pretty significant some of them, but in the grand scheme of things they're just one more source of supply.  And I would particularly highlight coalbed methane.  Coalbed methane was really going to have a dramatic affect, and a lot of us thought it would never exceed one Bcf a day in Western Canada.</p>
          <p>And it's struggles to maintain 700 million a day.  So that in fact has turned out to be the case.  Looking broadly across North America there's clearly some shale plays that are going to generate very impressive volumes.  But I would argue that they are just the latest place that industry looks to replace declining production.  And that as people turn their attention to drilling shale they tend to leave other plays behind.  Good examples are companies like Talisman which has moved very aggressively into unconventional gas but has pulled back quite significantly on more conventional gas.</p>
          <p>So we do it's always good to remember that we have this 10 to 15 let me say 13 Bcf a day annual decline every year.  In North America we see production including Mexico going from something like 78 Bcf a day down to 65 Bcf a day and people need to drill like crazy to get it back up and sustain 78 Bcf a day.  So I think that big decline gets offset from new sources overtime and I just see that shale is the most interesting opportunity for a lot of companies right now.  But it's wrong -- if there's five Bcf a day of new shale gas coming on you shouldn't just add that to the conventional base.  I think people will be looking to shale in lieu of some of what they otherwise would have looked for to offset decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I'd just add to that is it's still an 80 to 90 Bcf a day market.  And what we're going to need to see this gas come on is something probably five to $6 kind of range.  In order to get that kind of demand -- that kind of price we've got to see demand increase.  And I think it's tied as well to where does gas fire generation go relative to the renewables, where does coal go.  And so there's a number of dynamics.  And your question's a good one, is how does all that play together and I think you can't really take sort of Marcellus in isolation it's everything else that goes on in the declines.  What we've tried to do as a pipeline company is position ourselves to move the gas between supply locations and market.  So for example, Marcellus does come on the gas can't be consumed in that region everyday of the week.  It needs to be dock hauled for example back into Michigan storage because there isn't sufficient storage formations in the Northeast. So again our pipeline system becomes valuable in terms of moving that gas back into storage in the periods when the demand isn't high in the Northeast and back when the demand occurs.</p>
          <p>And so what we've tried to do is set up our systems so that it's all interconnected and what we're finding right now with Haynesville supply Fayetteville supply where that's coming on in large quantities, currently, is trying to get out of that out of that region.  And so what we're seeing is our ANR system the East leg where &#x2013; when we bought the pipe it was probably running at about 60 to 70% capacity; now we're running at 100% capacity.</p>
          <p>So now it's all moving up into Dawn region where we've got storage, but now we got to figure out de bottleneck the system and go East.  And once we figure out that then like you said there will be another change in the marketplace when Marcellus comes on.  But I think where we are positioned today in North America just sort of coast to coast in front of the shale plays in Alberta, shale plays in the mid-continent, U.S., the onshore stuff.  I think we're well positioned in Eastern Canada and as well as in Northeast U.S. to move gas around that region through Iroquois, Portland.</p>
          <p>Like when we originally thought we're going to see LNG coming in large quantities in the East Coast.  We looked at ways of reversing our TQM and Portland Natural Gas pipeline system to deliver gas back up into Eastern Canada.  So there's other ways that we can change our tolling structure as well.  Like when we get there you change your tolling structure to load more cost into those regions that can support those costs; there's postage stamp tolling methodologies.  And given these are all regulated pipelines, at the end of the day we have the ability to recover our costs.  And what we would do is adjust our tolling structure to service the market that needs to be serviced and we would, allocate the cost accordingly.  So, not saying that we don't worry about these things, but we also think that we're very well positioned and we actually look at them as huge opportunities for us.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I'm surprised to hear anybody coming in under budget which you mentioned for your Portlands project.  Halton Hills I could see is progressing along very well, other projects I'm sure are progressing along a little bit better than one might thought on a budget basis.  Just curious as to how much potentially is there in terms of under budget opportunities within your $19 billion set right now, and how would that be shared?  Or do you keep it all in the case of Portlands or do you split it with your joint venture partner?  Just some color about that because that might be some upside here for you on the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all Sam, on Portlands the fact that we came in under budget was the result of our contracting strategy at the time when we entered into a fixed price contract to have that plant built.  And, we do a lot of big projects so we're I think pretty good at the fixed price contracting or whatever other commercial arrangement we make with the EPC contractors.  The Portland coming in under budget was not a result of recent reductions in steel price or anything like that.  This is an outcome that was set up a long time ago and then you just always have to be diligent and make sure you don't go off the rails in the last few months and have a whole bunch of things go wrong and have a whole bunch of incremental cost claims from your contractor.</p>
          <p>So, our contractor there SNC did a very good job on that project and we appreciate their efforts and we're happy for everyone that we came in under budget.  To the extent there's extra economic grant available from that plant because we came in a little bit cheaper than expected.  And I want to emphasize this wasn't a huge under budget, but it was enough under budget that we would like to brag about it a little bit in the current circumstance.  But to the extent there is economic rent there, we do share it with our partner; we're 50/50 I think Alex with OPG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so that would be the case there.  On projects like Halton Hills, we don't we don't have a lot of upside there because again we were very careful to fix the price of all of the major equipment and all of the construction contracts.  What you will see though on projects like Keystone, even the first phase of Keystone because the overheated market is gone.  We're not seeing some of the zany manpower shortages or extravagant over payment demands from contractors or things like that.  People at this point suddenly really like working for TransCanada and so it's much easier to maintain labor stability on the job and it's much easier to keep the contractors happy.  It's just a less overheated market.  So, you don't necessarily set the stage for a big under budget performance but you remove much of the pressure that might have driven you over budget.</p>
          <p>Now looking beyond that, Sam as we get into projects like the Keystone expansion or some of the Northern Pipeline projects or even subsequent phases of expansion here in Alberta, we are going to see pipe costs quite a bit lower than what we were seeing before.  And there is two or three things that drives steel pipe costs, one of them is the cost of steel, which goes up or down quite independently of the cost of rolling that steel into pipe.  So, if everybody is buying pipe but the rest of the world of steel is down, the steel will be cheap but the rolling cost will be high and of course it can go the other way.  So those are all factors that we look at.  But I'd say right now the demand for pipe is down and certainly worldwide the demand for steel is way down.  So that should set the stage for better outcomes on some of our future projects.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.  You talked about some of the sources of subordinated capital you might see.  I was just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in the assets sale market away from potential drop downs to the MLP?  And then second related to that, even though you came relatively recently to the public bond market, is that something you're considering again this year, particularly in light of the market being quite accessible to investment grade issuers during the past couple of weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure on the divestiture side we're always looking at our portfolio and culling our portfolio as necessary.  We have a very high quality group of assets right now, some very valuable assets.  But we do have some that are fairly mature or don't have additional upside.  The market's a little soft right now but in certain cases there are strategic buyers that might be interested in particular assets.  So we continue to monitor that market and to look at our portfolio as we move forward.  I think we're seeing things improving in that area a little bit.</p>
          <p>With regard to the debt side, we've just done a significant debt issuance.  We tend to go in large quantities and then stay out of that market for a significant period of time.  That seems to be what the bond holders like to see particularly in the U.S. market.  We funded the majority of our 2009 spend.  We do have maturity remaining towards the end of the year of about $250 million and then two maturities in '10 and 111.  In '10 and '11 we have maturities in each year of about 400 million for total of about 1 billion.  So it's quite a benign maturity profile.  And as we've said in the quarter and in my comments, we're pretty well funded here for the next while for 2009.  And we're &#x2013; our CP program at the TCPL level is down under $300 million with about $2 billion worth of room under our lines there.  And we still have another 400 million or so of room under our T stone lines, so and that we're funding at sub 2% levels in the U.S. and around 2% in Canada in that market.  So, that's an attractive market for us right now.  We do have some financings to do at the subsidiary and affiliate level.  There's a financing at Northern Border, at TQM and as well as Iroquois that we're working on right now.  And those usually get financed in the private placement market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay,  So, is it fair to say that at this point to the extent you do raise some capital you're going to be prioritizing other forms away from public debt market for the time being?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the debt side that we would look to use short-term using our CP program.  We tend to like to ramp that up not all the way to the 2 billion level but in that 1 to 1.5 level and then take it down but when we do that we like to do benchmark sized deals that are significant.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  Good afternoon everyone.  First question is just pretty much on the NEB TQM decision which was received in March.  Just if you could breakout for me, what the amounts of that was actually recovered for '07 and '08 in the first quarter of '09, if there was an amount?  And then maybe afterward, if you can just given a more general comment as to how you think the move to an out lack formula might actually impact -- attract some other regulated assets, and if there is some kind of strategy position that might be going on with regard to some regulated Canadian pipelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, while they're looking up the answer to the 2007 and 08 I can give you some glimpses to how that may impact the balance of TransCanada's Canadian regulated pipes.  Basically the National Energy Board move from a formula that it used for all of its regulated pipelines in Canada or removed TQM from this formula that it uses for all of the other regulated pipelines in Canada.  I guess, it would be our view is given they've made the fundamental shift on that one pipeline that sort of sets the stage potentially for us to, you'll get a similar result on our other pipelines.</p>
          <p>The Canadian mainline is the largest piece of that Canadian regulated puzzle.  It has a settlement in place with its shippers through to the end of 2011.  So, until that point in time, there won't be any impact on the rates returned for that.  But post 2011 I would expect that over time that the mainline rate of return would migrate towards the TQM like return.  NGTL is the second largest piece, which is now regulated by the National Energy Board as of yesterday I believe the actual certificate was given to us.  It has a settlement in place for 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>The 2009 there is some issues there with respect to how we were going to calculate the rate of return in the event of some sort of generic change in cost to capital in Alberta.  Now that is not regulated in Alberta anymore, we will have to figure out how we're going to manage that or negotiate that change in the light of the TQM decision and in generic review of cost of capital that's going on in Alberta right now.</p>
          <p>And then the other sort of smaller pieces of Canadian regulated pipe would be that the Foothills System that I expect overtime that we would migrate towards that for the Foothills System as well.  There is no settlement in place currently for the Foothills System.  So, just to give you a sort of gut feel I guess is if the return on equity rose by about 150 basis points but just to pick a 100 for example, we have a $12 billion rate base approximately in Canadian regulated assets.  And about 40% equity thickness on average, so you're looking at about $5 billion of equity that we have employed in that business and if you move the return on equity by 100 basis points it's about $50 million of after-tax net income. If the over time, we're able to achieve a similar kind of result as we achieved on the TQM system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's Glenn here, as far as what we recorded on TQM for '07 and '08, as noted in the quarterly report and other Canadian pipelines, we've got variance there of about $6 million and that represents the entire settlement for those two years the impact on TQM.  So it's about six, $7 million but that only reflects '07 and '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you expect that recovery is for &#x2013; that's for the entirety of '07 and '08 or will there be more going forward in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the full amount of '07 and '08 on an EBITDA basis, on a pre-tax basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as '09 it would depend where the final fills fall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe we're still booking 2009 at the &#x2013; formula.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're using the NEB formula because that's what is currently out there for TQM, because the decision only related to '07 and '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think you can kind of take a look at &#x2013; the delta would be approximately what it was for '07 and '08.  For '09, if we're able to achieve in '09 a settlement or litigated outcome, it's the same as 2007, 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And if I could just come back and maybe ask even more generally, do you see a strategy now in terms of looking at Canadian regulated pipeline because of this sort of move towards ATWACC?  Do you think there are some assets out there that might be more attractive for TransCanada to go after in terms of M&amp;A for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what we're more concerned about was the low nature of the number and allocating capital to new projects in our portfolio at that low number.  What we know is that we do need incremental infrastructure in Canada to move new gas around.  And just a couple of the examples that we have underway are the Montney and Horn River plays that the Hal mentioned, the North Central Corridor play in Alberta.  We've got about $2.5 billion of capital under development right now.  And our concern was we were achieving a return that was sub 6% on those assets and our belief was in the longer term we would see a more fair and rational return.</p>
          <p>The positive in the TQM decision is it looks like the National Energy Board supports our view is that long-term infrastructure is needed.  And that you need a return on capital such that you can attract the capital necessary to those projects.  So I would think that you would probably see in our portfolio us pursuing development projects that are necessary where as before we were pursuing them but probably with a little bit less enthusiasm if you will.  We knew volumetrically we needed to bring them online but from a return perspective they are very difficult, they are very challenging.  So that's probably the biggest bonus for us as a company is, is we can move forward with our development work with a bit more confidence than we had before.  And as I said that's a pretty big number it's about $2.5 billion right now.</p>

          <p>Yes to Port Arthur and are we kind of in the environment with producers where they are that we probably shouldn't expect to see much movement on that or because that might be more a refining pool that might still something that could suffer a loss?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was just trying to see if there had been any movement on continuing to contract for additional volumes down into the Gulf Coast area?  Or if just kind of given the state of the commodity markets right now that in all reality that's probably, put on hold for the next six months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that there's still interest on both ends of the pipe.  On the refining end I believe that there's still a number of refiners that can take Canadian bitumen, that are looking at it as an opportunity or an alternative to Venezuelan crude oil or Cantoral crude oil.  Given that crude is not going to show up till 2011 they're kind of sorting out what their options are right now in the current environment.  We're looking at potential lateral to Houston which opens up an opportunity to see about another two to three million barrels a day.  So we've had some inbound calls from those, which may sort of increase our pull if you will at the demand end.</p>
          <p>And so those conversations are ongoing.  And then at the producer end as we see a slowdown or delay in the upgrading projects what that means from a transportation perspective is if the bitumen still comes online we actually need about 140% of that volume -- actually it's greater than that if it would have been turned into bitumen turning into crude oil.  You only need about 85% of the transportation to actually produce a barrel of bitumen &#x2013; to turn it into a barrel of SCO, you really only need about 85% of the transportation capacity.  So as we move from producing synthetic crude oil to bitumen, you move from that 85% to needing diluents.  And you need about 40% more diluents to move the product to market.</p>
          <p>So we actually see a shift on that barrel of which bitumen that would have otherwise turned into synthetic crude oil.  You need about 1.4 barrels of transportation capacity to get a barrel of bitumen plus its diluent to market.  So given that shift upstream, we're seeing again interest in our transportation capacity to get that crude oil, that unupgraded bitumen through to the Gulf Coast where it can actually be refined.  So, we still have in bound interest at both ends of our pipeline right now.  So, I would say stay tuned in terms of various open seasons and those kinds of things that we could have in the coming months to try to assess the demand in the marketplace for additional contracts.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  The next question it's from Bob Hastings from Canaccord Adams.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you just back I guess on Keystone the cost estimates that you had there I guess you're mainly complete everything is pretty much locked in but have you looked ahead of the Keystone expansion and that your expectations to complete you have a cost sharing formula there or incentive formula?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the, I'll start with the expectations I think that our expectations are still in and around level that $7 billion, that the cost sort of rose in the marketplace and they've come back down again around sort of where original estimates were.  As Hal mentioned steel prices have come off.  We're seeing, pipe now in the $1800 a ton range as oppose to say $2500 that we saw last year.  But when we started the processes of evaluating Keystone XL, we're probably in the $1800 range maybe about the $2000 range.</p>
          <p>So, we've seen the estimate or the prices in the marketplace move around our estimate.  So, I'd say that we're still pretty comfortable with our estimate based on the learnings that Hal mentioned.  On the base Keystone project in terms of what we've learned about productivity and those kinds of things, weather related issues that we've encountered and terrain things that we've encountered.  I think we're pretty comfortable at seven.  To his earlier comments, there's always an opportunity to come in under budget, but we've really set ourselves with what I think is realistic estimates upfront.  And I wouldn't expect a big gain or a big loss on that.  To the extent that there is our cost sharing agreement that we have in place is 75% of any cost overage or underage, accrues to our shippers, and TransCanada picks up or Keystone picks up 25%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And then going back to the first phase of Keystone, can you give us some ideas, Hal in terms on or Russ on the step-up of the earnings.  So we know, we know you're going to start putting oil in the pipe but, when do the contracts actually start and how should we think of modeling the EBITDA coming into earnings?  I am sure there's a few step up periods here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think that what we're, we're kind of working today on package that we could put out to the marketplace to get better, help you better understand the step-up.  We're just sort of getting through that period of line fill and then how our contracts are going to ramp up over the year.  And at the end of the year, I could give you the, some sort of view on EBITDA.  We haven't sort of released what our tolls are yet so from a competitive standpoint, you kind of know what the volumes are, but we haven't told you how the tolls are going to work.</p>
          <p>But what we hope is that over the next few months, as we get closer to filing our tariffs and that kind of information becomes publicly available, we'll be able to give you a better road map as to the ramp up in EBITDA over the next year or so.  That's that best that we could do for now.  I guess as you can probably tell, 500,000 barrels a day, if we charge about 3 bucks a barrel, which is your sort of in around a market kind of number that gives you a feel for the end EBITDA number.  And what we'll try to do is fill in the blanks for you over the next year or so.</p>
          <p>That $3 kind of relates to the first markets that we attach ourselves to and then subsequently we will attach ourselves to Gulf Coast markets and those will be higher priced, higher price markets and approximately equivalent volume going in that direction.  So, stay tuned, I guess is what I am telling you.  We recognize that we haven't provided a whole bunch of information.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  But would you give us any comfort on in terms of say your IRRs that you have talked about in past if they are still there and there is not any sort of substandard returns for the next number of years till you get up to those levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely not, I mean it's all, the ramp period is baked into the IRR.  So I mean for the first year as we bring the line fill on and the contracts sort of move in and we go through all of our sort of operating hiccups and that sort of thing, we build in, sort of enough room in year one for that.  But once we're up and operating that cash flow is flat essentially for the next 20 years.  There is some upside with respect to what we think the flat number is for spot volumes moving on the system.  But we've got minimal amounts of those baked into our forecast so far.</p>
          <p>So, I think what I told you before is if we just moved the contracted volumes the IRR is going to be in around 7%.  If we move a base level of spot volumes we can get a return of about 8%.  And if we sort of move all the spot volume or spot available in the system we can achieve a 9.5% kind of an outcome.  So, that's the kind of range and that hasn't deteriorated at all.  So, I would sort of look to 2011 as being sort of first full year of service of the base Keystone and probably 2013 as being the first full year service for Keystone XL or the Keystone expansion.</p>
