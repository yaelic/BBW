          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, just a quick reminder: On the morning of Tuesday, December 7, we'll host our annual outlook meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Those of you that are on our e-mail distribution list should have received an invitation earlier this week. Please RSVP as soon as you can, and for those of you not on our list who would wish to go, just drop a note or call and we'll take care of you.</p>
          <p>Take a moment if you would to read the forward-looking statement on slide 2. During today's conference call we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.</p>
          <p>So let's begin today's review. I'll turn the presentation over to George Buckley. Please turn to slide 3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Matt. Good morning, everybody, and thank you very much for joining us on our third quarter call. It was another very strong quarter for 3M as we continued to drive our growth plan, and overall Q3 sales and earnings were in line with our expectations. And you can imagine I'm especially pleased with the 11% increase in organic volume against a backdrop of continued economic uncertainty and tougher comps.</p>
          <p>Organic volumes are now up 16% through September when we continued to set sales and profit records. Q3 sales were again a new record for 3M with the strongest growth coming in E&amp;C, our Electro and Communications business where sales were up 25%; Display and Graphic where sales were up 19%; Industrial and Transportation where they were up 14%; and Consumer and Office, which was up an impressive 11%. And they for example exceeded $1 billion in sales for the first time ever in a quarter. Health Care and Safety and Security are still robust, but both had some peculiarities to deal with in the quarter which I'll explain in a minute.</p>
          <p>We continued to grow across all geographies once again reinforcing our international growth strategy. Sales in emerging markets as a whole were up 25% in the quarter and now exceed 34% of total company sales. Asia Pacific grew 28%; Latin America grew 14%; and Canada, 13%. Korea was up 48%; India, 39%; Russia, 32%; and the China region was up 31% with Brazil up 25% as well.</p>
          <p>Operating margins remained strong at 23% with all businesses staying at operating margins at 20% or higher. EPS was $1.53, up 13%, another all time Q3 record for 3M. Free cash flow was 1.1 billion with nearly 100% conversion rate.</p>
          <p>We also continued our accelerated investments in the future. We consider that these extraordinary important in solving the puzzle of higher growth rates longer term. So for example we increased R&amp;D investment by 6% year on year, and we supported our brands with increased advertising and merchandising spends more than 30%. New business venture investments, which are those investments outside R&amp;D, continued to track at about $100 million additional annual spend year-over-year. We put more capital work by closing the acquisitions of Arizant and Attenti Holdings, and we acquired a majority stake in Cogent Inc., and in early October we also announced the acquisition of Alpha Beta which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. I'll address those acquisitions in more detail in a few moments. Overall the strength of 3M's portfolio was again evident in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Industrial and Transportation which is the giant of 3M's businesses, where sales rose a huge 14% with broad-based double digits local currency growth in every single unit, led by Renewables Energy division, which was up 83% in sales and limited solely by manufacturing capacity, which we're adding as fast as we can. The growth is everywhere in Industrial. As examples, Energy and Advanced Materials rose 25%, Abrasives was up 18%, Automotive OEM was up 17%, and Industrial and Adhesives and Tapes, which is our largest business, was up 13%.</p>
          <p>As evidence of our success in Automotive, Q3 worldwide automotive bills were up 10%, while 3M's organic volumes were up 18%. Year-to-date worldwide automotive bills are up 29%, while 3M's organic volumes are up 40%. Operating income for the sector rose by 14% to 446 million, with operating margins at 20.2%. The remarkable re-invention of this heartland of 3M's business by H.C. Shin and his team is nothing short of stunning.</p>
          <p>Health Care. Sales rose there by 1.5% in local currency, which is much slower than we've seen recent quarters. The most evident impact in the quarter was the reduced H1N1-related demand, which lowered year-on-year growth rates by a full 2 percentage points. You'll recall that H1N1 demand was the highest in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Low core demand seems to be related to the uncertainty surrounding Obamacare. You've seen that pattern reflected in pretty much every company reporting so far in the health care space. Hospital admissions and treatments are down at many U.S. hospitals, so distributors are wary and evidently running down inventories. As an illustration, I recently read that 50% of Cincinnati hospitals have reported lower admissions. Higher unemployment and weaker financials seem to be causing people to put off elective procedures and even normal health care as well. We have no reason to believe that this is anything other than temporary effect and that it'll pass. But clearly, there is caution everywhere as we've seen similar slowing in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Better news was that our Skin and Wound Care business was up 7%. Food Safety, absent of divestiture we did last year, was up 12%, and Dental was up 4%. Operating income in Health Care was $326 million with margins just short of 30%. At our December outlook meeting we'll give you some additional views on how health care reform might affect our business. But the short form is that the impact is likely to be felt most in expensive treatments and advanced devices where we think rationing through tough pricing mechanisms is going to be the highest. Of course the impact is just U.S. based. While it's clear everyone is going to be affected, we feel that our business, which is mostly consumables and broadly based internationally is less likely to be problematic. Health Care remains a very strong franchise for 3M.</p>
          <p>Moving on, local currency sales in Display and Graphics were up 18.4%, another excellent quarter. Optical System sales were up 28% driven by new products for LED flat screen televisions. In September we saw the beginning of the much talked about and highly anticipated inventory adjustment in the LCD TV industry, and we expect it to continue into the fourth quarter. This is clearly just a market adjustment as our film attachment rates remain as strong as ever. The inventory correction cost is about $15 million of earnings in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall I'm very pleased with the way our Optical business has matured and progressed. It wasn't that long ago that a hiccup in this business would cause us enormous heartburn. Yes, today we still feel it, and it's always going to be a tough industry, but genetically it turns on a dime, so to speak, just as it did in September. But we have a much better understanding of the market dynamics and how to manage them, and we have an absolutely superb management team in place to do it. The rebuilding that we've done in 3M's traditional non-optical core over the last five years also means that our optical business no longer has to haul the sales and earnings growth wagon more or less alone. We're so much diverse in growth now than we once were. When optical catches a cold, yes, it still means 3M taking a bit of nasty medicine, but the company no longer gets a bout of figurative bubonic plague.</p>
          <p>Continue with Display. Commercial Graphics continued a strong recovery with impressive double digits sales growth. Growth is coming from innovative new products right across and up and down the market spectrum. We also have positive growth in traffic safety systems, quite an accomplishment, really, considering there's still no Highway Funding Bill in the United States. Total Display and Graphics operating income rose 37% to 282 million with margins of 26.4%.</p>
          <p>Consumer and Office had a great quarter too, significantly outpacing growth at the retail level, and they topped $1 billion in sales for the first time ever. Joe Harlan and his team drove 11.1% local currency sales growth with a full 9 points of organic growth, yes 9 points and another two points from acquisitions. Office products and the DIY business both achieved double digit local currency sales growth, and home care and stationary products reached high single digit growth too.</p>
          <p>As was the case last quarter, we increased advertising and merchandising investment by over 30% year on year, and that push is advancing many of our key brands. Operating income for Consumer and Office was 235 million with margins at 23%.</p>
          <p>Safety, Security and Protection Services sales were down 1.6 in local currency. Operating profit for SS&amp;PS was $164 million with margins of 20.2%. This is truly a wonderful sector. As in Health Care, H1N1-related demand did not repeat in the third quarter of 2010, in this case impacting year-on-year growth for SS&amp;PS by a whopping 10%. And of course these products were also at margins strongly accretive to both the security segment margins and to 3M as a whole.</p>
          <p>Consequently, operating margin declined 700 basis points year on year, which is entirely explained by H1N1 and secondarily by the impact of inventory corrections in the roofing granules business, both of which we consider to be temporary effects.</p>
          <p>Going forward, Safety and Security margins in the fourth quarter will still be negatively affected by these same factors as well as by purchase accounting for Cogent and Attenti. These lapping impacts are purely an arithmetic issue with nothing fundamental to be concerned about. Margins will normalize around 23% once the H1N1 comps finish passing through the system sometime in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p>In the core of this business, we saw double digits sales increases in security systems, corrosion protection, building and commercial services and also in occupational health and environmental safety, if we exclude the H1N1 effects I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Electro and Communications. Sales and local currency were up 24%, with currency translation adding another 1.5 on top. I think it's important to note the continued strength in our business servicing the consumer electronics industry. For example, local currency sales were up 59% in Electronics Markets Materials and 30% in Electronics Solutions division. In addition, we saw double digit local currency sales growth in Electrical Markets which mainly serves utilities and electrical distribution. Local currency sales were up slightly in the Telecom Infrastructure business also.</p>
          <p>Electro and Communications drove operating income of $173 million, which is up 49% as operating margins expanded 3.6 percentage points up to 22.4%. So all-in-all even with some transient H1N1 and raw material cost impacts, this was another very strong performance across the board for 3M.</p>
          <p>I would like to speak now for a moment about acquisitions. We significantly strengthened our Safety and Security business by adding Attenti and Cogent to their portfolio. Cogent brings to 3M a technology platform that we didn't have previously with its finger, palm and iris-based biometric technologies, and Attenti positions us well in a segment of law enforcement that we didn't have access to until now, as well as opening opportunities for us in the elder care and other industries. Both of these businesses operating in markets growing at greater than 20% annually.</p>
          <p>We see Attenti as a completely new high growth platform. We've long believed that high value asset tracking is a great future business. The logical application extensions to military, first responder, elder care, mobile hospital assets, mining safety and animals and even your children, if you desired it, are massive.</p>
          <p>In Health Care, the acquisition of Arizant bolsters our infection prevention business by solidifying our position in the growing area of patient safety with its line of patient and body fluid warming systems. This market is growing at double-digit rates and is likely to accelerate since the focus on body core warming is specifically laid out in the new health care legislation and is seen as a fundamental method to the reduction of cost by control of hospital acquired infections. Today this is predominantly a U.S. business, and we intend to leverage 3M's world class international footprint to expand it overseas.</p>
          <p>Alpha Beta in our Industrial segment perfectly exemplifies our pyramid strategy in action by B and C tier products to our own line of tape offerings. Alpha Beta is a world class ultra low cost tape manufacturer located in the China region. Over the coming years, we expect growth rates to be very high and will then source a lot of currently outsourced tape manufacturing to Alpha Beta. This is positioned where the fastest growth is, both geographically and segment wise. And importantly it establishes a low cost tape manufacturing beachhead in Asia, something we didn't have before.</p>
          <p>So this is a great business to &#x2013; great addition to one of our most powerful core businesses. It's not an overstatement to say that 3M is the greatest adhesive tape manufacturer in the world so investing here is perfectly logical for us.</p>
          <p>On R&amp;D you all know that for 3M investment in innovation is investment in our future. In the third quarter, R&amp;D investments were north of 5% to sales, and we expect to maintain this level going forward. As a result of these investments, our new product vitality index is now in the 32% range as we continue to drive innovation right across 3M.</p>
          <p>More than a year ago we forecasted economic growth would slow in the second half of 2010 in some of our markets. Some folks disagreed with us, thinking that perhaps we were being too conservative. But I think things have played largely out the way that we anticipated, and so the trend is no longer a surprise. Part of it is purely arithmetic year-over-year comparisons but part is also clearly economic. Looking ahead, the good news is that we see no signs of any broad scale, broad based double dip. Even if it does come we believe it would be limited in geography, short in duration and relatively mild.</p>
          <p> Aerobic growth remains good in those geographies where you'd expect it to be good, and it's hard where you'd expect it to be hard. No, we have not seen China slowing, and ironically if the RMB does begin appreciate, it would provide 3M mostly net positive benefits. After all, we're highly profitable there and a net importer to China. Excluding Japan which itself had a 10.5 local currency growth in the quarter, similar positive observations could be made for Asia broadly, and for Latin America, the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>The practical reality is that those companies with broad footprints in emerging markets will prosper as long as they remain able to compete with small and fast growing local competitors. And for that, you absolutely must be cost competitive. So the near-term implications to the United States, and wherein Europe, Germany apart, are uninspiring. We expect an extended period of slow recovery in these markets. The best news is that the recovery in automotive and a positive movement in housing will look like enormous percentage changes. More broadly, U.S. factory utilization remains low which implies a long recovery period in commercial construction. Inventory transients in the Industrial distribution channel have died down so they're no longer held.</p>
          <p>Unemployment remains I think as we all know the key to the puzzle, particularly in the United States. Nothing in the end markets suggests big changes in anything, plus or minus, except the numbers will look arithmetically slower. Invention and penetration remain the keys to growth for us in these slow markets and that's why the R&amp;D and business development investments that we've spoken about earlier are essential. Breakthroughs in power distribution, smart grid, solar, environmental and innovation more generally still provide big opportunities. Differentiation still works, and 3M has that in spades. Some gradual geographic realignment of our sales force may be needed to fully take advantage of opportunities in faster growing states and market spaces.</p>
          <p>With that I'll now turn the call over to Pat for a review of the third quarter P&amp;L.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide number 6. Sales rose 11% in the third quarter which was the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales improvement. Organic volume rose 10.8% in the quarter. Our growth was 1.4 times worldwide industrial production as the business continues to expand in size in terms of sales, operating income and economic profit.</p>
          <p>We drove 22% organic volumes in Asia Pacific, with both Consumer Electronics and the base business increasing over 20%. So our strategy around both export oriented business and meeting local demand is working very well. Organic volumes grew 13% in Latin America, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in Europe. So no geography was left behind. Acquisitions added 50 basis points to growth in the quarter, and selling prices declined just 20 points year on year. Third quarter gross profit dollars grew 9% year on year and notably were more than 5% above Q3 2008 levels. So our strategy to grow the business is resulting in higher gross profits.</p>
          <p>Gross margin percent declined 90 basis points with higher raw materials accounting about one half of the change. Material inflation was 2.5% year on year. Sales mix also negatively impacted gross margins in the quarter. As an example, H1N1-related respirator demand was strong in Q3 of last year, and factory utilization levels in the businesses were very high. Those same factors ran at more normal levels this year. A lower sales contribution from Health Care, coupled with this attractive gross margins, also impacted the mix negatively.</p>
          <p>Helping to mitigate these factors were savings due to yield improvements, waste reduction, faster line speeds and ongoing productivity, driven by our Six Sigma teams around the world. In the SC&amp;A area, sales and marketing investments rose 18% in the quarter while administrative and other costs were up just slightly. So in total SG&amp;A was up 13%. We anticipated this in our planning as mobilized throughout the year to increase both sales coverage and marketing strength, particularly in faster growing emerging economies. In addition, we increased investment in advertising and merchandising by over 30% year on year to drive higher sales volume with our customers both now and into the future.</p>
          <p>We invested 3r54 million in research and development in the quarter, up nearly 20 million over last year's third quarter. Operating income was 1.6 billion, the highest of any third quarter in our history, and margins were an outstanding 22.9%. All six reporting segments posted 20% plus margins, the third consecutive quarter that we have accomplished this feat. Our Corporate Miscellaneous reporting segment showed a small loss this quarter versus the first six months run rate. This was largely due to lower corporate spending, various compensation related adjustments and a few other miscellaneous items. By its nature profit and loss in this segment can swing a bit from quarter to quarter. On a September year-to-date basis, the operating loss in Corporate Miscellaneous is larger than 2009 by $117 million with a difference largely attributable to higher pension expense.</p>
          <p>The third quarter tax rate was 26.8% down about 5 points year on year, due to lower effective international rates and reflection of some of the great progress we have made in reducing our tax rate. We expect that the full year reported tax rate will be approximately 28.5%. Earnings were $1.53 per share on a GAAP reported basis, an increase of 13%. This also was a third quarter record for the company. Now let's look at the year-to-date results so please turn to slide number 7.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with how the businesses performed thus far in 2010 and are running ahead over expectations going into the year. September year-to-date sales were up 17%, nearly all driven by organic volume improvements. Asia and Latin America have been the stars in terms of geographic performance. On a business by business basis, growth has been the strongest in the Electro and Communications at 31%, Display and Graphics at 29% and Industrial and Transportation at 22%. These three businesses have done an outstanding job in launching new products and taking share in a number of important and growing industries, including consumer electronics, automotive OEM, general, industrial and renewable energy.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, SG&amp;A spending is up 11%, investments in sales and margining are up 14%, a combination of more sales related feet on the street in growing markets, further investments to strengthen our marketing capability, and as you see on this chart a near 30% increase in advertising and promotion to drive current and long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Tight control over G&amp;A remains a top priority for the company as it helps feed additional investment in sales, marketing and R&amp;D. On a year on year-to-date basis G&amp;A is up only 5% compared to sales growth of 17%. So we continue to drive leverage in this area. Operating income is up 33% year-to-date, and operating margins are over 23%. All businesses earned 20% plus margins through the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate through nine months was 28.3%, down from 31.2% in 2009. Recall that our tax rate was 34% five years ago. So we're making excellent progress in this area. We expect the rate to tick up a bit in 2011, which I'll talk more about in a moment, but we remain committed to further long-term reductions in our rate. Evolving the manufacturing base to lower tax jurisdictions will be critical to making this happen. Finally year-to-date net income and earnings per share rose 40% and 36%, respectively. Return on invested capital was a strong 22%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 8 for a balance sheet and cash flow discussion. Free cash flow was 1.1 billion in the third quarter, and we converted nearly 100% of net income to cash. This was 466 million less than the third quarter of 2009 driven largely by three factors. One was pension contributions, as we contributed 241 million more than we did last year. In addition, the year on year difference in cash taxes paid was 111 million. Finally working capital changes reduced free cash flow by 175 million to meet the volume demands. On a year-to-date basis we generated nearly 3 billion in free cash flow and converted 94% of net income to cash.</p>
          <p>Now working capital turns remain steady year on year at 5.1 turns. We had some improvement on the receivable side, offset by somewhat higher inventories, a line of course again to the higher growth rates.</p>
          <p>Acquisition activity has been light in the first three quarters of the year, but as we have recently announced and George has mentioned earlier, we'll close a number of deals here in the fourth quarter, putting to use some of our excess cash. Through nine months of 2010 we returned more than 1.5 billion to shareholder via a combination of dividends and share purchases, a 43% increase versus 2009.</p>
          <p>With three quarters of the year behind us, let me address our outlook for the year. Please turn to slide number 9. We now expect our organic volume growth will come in between 13.5 and 14% for the year versus our prior forecast of 13 to 15%. We also expect that earnings per share will fall somewhere within the band of 5.70 to 5.74. This range includes estimated acquisition-related dilution of approximately $0.06 per share related to the recently closed deals which of course we had not factored into our July guidance. On a GAAP reported basis, we expect earnings to finish for the year between 5.59 and 5.63 per share.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that operating margins will be approximately 22.5% for the year which also reflects previously mentioned acquisitions. The full year tax rate is expected to be at or just below 28.5% on a reported basis, and average diluted shares outstanding should be in the band of 725 to 727 million for 2010 in total.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number 10. As Matt mentioned, we'll be hosting an investor meeting the morning of December 7 in New York. We'll address our detailed 2011 outlook at that meeting, but I thought I would give you a preview this morning. So please wait for the December meeting for some more specifics.</p>
          <p>At the moment, we're targeting 2011 sales growth of 11%, assuming a couple of points of acquisitions in current FX rates. We're driving the business to deliver 35% incremental margins on organic growth. Outside of those incrementals, currency should be an additional income tailwind for us, again reflecting current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>We estimate that pension expense will be a $0.30 headwind next year. This assumes that the 4.8% &#x2013; 4.86% discount rate at the end of the third quarter falls until year end, which in our opinion is an unsustainably low level. But regardless, it is down nearly a point from 5.77 that we used at last year end.</p>
          <p>The 2011 expense estimate also assumes U.S. asset returns of 11%, which was our actual performance through the first nine months of the year. Finally, the $0.30 headwind assumes that we make an additional $700 million contribution to our pension plan, assuming current discount rates and asset return performance levels hold. But candidly, the actual contribution may differ.</p>
          <p>If rates of returns move our way which have happened thus far in October, we would likely contribute much less than this. We don't have any mandatory funding obligations. What is most important for us is to be adequately funded at year end to keep the earnings headwind at a manageable range. The anticipated expense increase is due to two factors. One is the amortization or prior period investment returns, namely the 13.6% loss experienced in 2008. I want to remind you though this is far better than the 30% market decline for that year.</p>
          <p>The second factor is the absolute level of interest rates. Lower rates of course increase the present value of liabilities, which in turn increase future pension expense. We also anticipate an $0.08 per share headwind due to a compensation policy change. As a reminder, prior to 2009 we allowed employees to bank a certain amount of unused vacation. Effective January 1, 2009, we moved to a use it or lose it approach, and employees were given two years to exhaust their previously banked vacation. This change resulted in a $0.08 per share benefit in our 2010 results, which does not repeat itself in 2011. This item is non-cash, income statement only. Helping to offset this will be additional productivity gains due to the fact that employees will have less time off in 2011 which will help reign in additional hiring.</p>
          <p>Finally, at this early stage we're expecting a 2011 tax rate of 30% or slightly below versus an estimated reported tax rate of 28.5 for 2010. We have some more work to do before reviewing our final 2011 plan with you in December, but this should give you a sense where we are headed.</p>
          <p>In summary, I would conclude that our year-to-date results are very much in line with our longer term strategy. We're driving faster growth, reinvesting to secure the future of the business and maintaining best-in-class margins and return on capital. Our balance sheet remains in great shape so regardless of the shape of the economic recovery we'll have a significant funding advantage.</p>
          <p>That concludes the formal portion of today's conference call. So let's begin the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got a couple of questions. Display and Graphics had a good quarter, but I think you mentioned an inflection point in September. Maybe you could just go over that a little bit more, and you talked about the impact in the fourth quarter. Maybe give us some visibility there, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously Bob &#x2013; about every two years you see these kind of corrections that take place in inventory. The great news for us is we haven't lost any attachment as far as we can tell which is unlike what happened to us before. So this is probably just started. I think it will go through the system. The impact, potential impact in the fourth quarter you see of course in the end, you don't know with this market changes so rapidly. But the net impact we think might be as much as $70 million in our fourth quarter earnings. But -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's operating profit, George?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's on profit, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's the sort of numeric number there. Bob. But I think what has really happened so well here is we've got close to these customers. They like our innovation. They have kept us in the product, and that is for us the most important thing and we'll live through these things. And as I said, we've had these things come and go before. This time &#x2013; it puts some pressure on earnings, but it's not the kind of ouch that it once would have been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. You mentioned the Alpha Beta acquisition you had talked about &#x2013; putting some product back in house that had been outsourced and the whole push into that adjacency. I mean what sort of profitability level would Alpha Beta see relative to the 3M average when you have that strategy completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, at their current operating margins Bob, they would be dilutive to the 3M. But when you bring them all together, I mean, first of all we don't need a lot of SG&amp;A in that area. It's not always branded product. And we think it's just, there's huge growth and leverage opportunities in that space, Bob. I mean we were selling into that space and paying higher prices than we'll get from Alpha Beta. So actually I think it will be helpful to us in the long run.</p>
          <p>And obviously gives us that competitive positioning at the bottom of the marketplace which has always been the place where we've got attacked by growing sort of low cost competition. So this is strategically very important for us, not only to provide growth but to provide the kind of bulwark to our higher margin, higher performing tapes, higher up the market &#x2013; so very important, I think Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, I was just going to add, just to kind of build on George's comment. At the, either at the divisional level which &#x2013; that's our largest division, okay, is Adhesives and Tapes, as George mentioned. Our objective there is we'll pull this in and through some of the cost savings we get through insourcing and the like, that the margins in that business should hold to where they're currently at at the divisional level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So margins at the division level would be the same when you consolidate Alpha Beta and push forward?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't 100% clear to me why you didn't have a little bit more of a margin pull through in Industrial and Transportation. I understand there was some raw material headwinds and such, but given that type of growth rate in that type of business maybe would have expected a little bit more of an incremental margin. Can you give us a little bit more detail on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First of all, Scott, I &#x2013; 20% of margin in an industrial business is a damn good margin. We're obviously investing in that business. We're investing in new technology, putting new investment in a lot of the emerging markets and so forth. The reality is the margin in that business will be probably the 21, 22% range over time. It was a little bit lower this quarter, but nothing to be alarmed with. It's something that we've been kind of expecting through time, based upon the investments that we're making. So no alarm from our side at all as to where the margins in that business are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understand. So the answer is basically investments that you &#x2013; now, would we think of that as investments some things that you pulled forward just given how strong of a year that you had discretionary spend and such that were pulled forward in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Scott I guess it would be fair to say, I think, if we go back a couple of calls that in my comments really for the year-to-date is that we are running ahead of where we thought we would be for the year. So we had a number of investments lined up that, if conditions warranted effectively we would pull into 2010 here. So that's kind of &#x2013; this is one example of an area that that's occurred.</p>

          <p>Good morning Jeff.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, can we &#x2013; I guess I'll make my question and my follow-up around the deals. First, when you look at what largely what you've acquired here, George, I would say they have kind of the feel of being a bit more equipment-related companies with the exception of Alpha Beta, rather than being kind of material science-related companies which is kind of the core strength and bailiwick of 3M. And so just as a matter of kind of philosophically, when you look at adjacencies for your businesses, how you manage that, the challenges of that? Some of these are software companies in a sense and just the kind of the DNA for the organization to kind of do these type of deals going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a good question, Jeff. It really is. We've long recognized that one of the big growth areas for the future is going to be kind of software and electronics. In fact, if you look at our strat plans, Jeff, over the last few years you see this kind of creeping in bit by bit. In fact, maybe not creeping anymore, it's galloping. And so we recognize that this is going to be more of the future, a bigger piece of our portfolio in the future.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at some of these high growth spaces ultimately they're about sort of tracking and decision making that ultimately is connected to electronics and software. So I think you're right in that area. These are very high growth areas, and we have some sort of related businesses already, Jeff. You might remember we got that library equipment business that tracks library books. This is kind of in a way a lateral extension of that kind of, instead of tracking a book, you're tracking a person or tracking an elder care person. So they're not that different as you might think if you think of them in that context.</p>
          <p>But I think ultimately, Jeff, while we will always have this heartland of material science, I think we will see some movements into these kind of equipment-related businesses. But you're not going to see us getting into big giant machines like some of our contemporaries have. This is going to be kind of small, carry it with you type stuff on a much smaller scale than those sorts of things. But well spotted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I was just wondering as the follow-up, Pat, if you could help us on the 11% you suggested for next year as kind of a baseline given all these deals are closing at different times. What kind of annualized deal impact is included in that 11%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess all I was going to say right now because we still have some more work to do between now and December is we have a couple of points of acquisition related growth in that 11% number for next year. A piece of this, the deals we've just announced, and there's a small provision for stuff that obviously is currently in the system.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I know, Pat, I know you're going to give all the detail in December on 2011. But just on the guidance that you did provide here, should we be adding that to adjusted or GAAP numbers if we're trying to think ahead to where that 55 or $0.60 is, looks like it's implied is on top of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I'd come off our GAAP numbers. When we present our plan we'll come off our GAAP numbers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just without getting more into detail there, for the quarter pricing was a 20 basis points headwind, I think. At one point, 440 basis points of that was in Asia Pacific. Am I correct in assuming that was mostly in Optical and Display and Graphics, or were you seeing any more pricing headwinds in any of your other businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it really remains in the consumer electronics space, primarily optical.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, this is Matt. Just as a reminder, generally speaking electronics in total for the company is about a 1 point impact on price in any given year. So really, ex electronics pricing might have been up &#x2013; would have been up a little bit for the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the then raw material 2.5%, was that concentrated in any particular segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all it's more in the U.S. than it is international at this point in time. It's probably more in our Industrial related business at this point in time. It is cutting across most of the businesses, but Industrial probably has the largest piece of it.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear on, I guess the fourth quarter numbers. I think the performance, the organic performance this quarter was good, it was about in line with what kind of the comp would have suggested. But your comp gets a lot tougher in the fourth quarter, and you're still really calling for here maybe just a couple point degradation in the growth rate. Can you talk about which end markets are getting better from a kind of comp perspective, that's going to help you out &#x2013; I guess just where these new products are layering in in the fourth quarter so where we would expect the best organic performance here in the fourth quarter? And then one follow-up on 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the &#x2013; obviously we talked about some kind of correction in the Display and Graphics business, Steve. And I think we're still going to be carrying forward headwinds on H1N1. So they'll be the tougher comps. All of these businesses were growing very, very rapidly last year, and so it's not going to be easy. But the forecast from our businesses and our own triangulation suggests you're looking at something like an 8% or so growth rate.</p>
          <p>That's what the number looks like, Steve. It's what the arithmetic shows. And so far the arithmetic has carried us forward. I think in the Health Care business, I think it's going to get a little bit easier, is my guess. I think we've got some stuff which is &#x2013; looks like it is bettering in that area so I think that probably will get a little bit better. I don't expect the Industrial businesses to do all that much different. I think we might see just mild betterment in SS&amp;PS as H1 was &#x2013; the back end of the fourth quarter was easing a little bit. So I think it's a mixed bag, Steve, but all in all, we're comfortable with the projections that we've made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, and remember, that &#x2013; if you back into the number, it's in that 8 to 9 range, which of course, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis and you look at what our performance was last year, which you're doing, which we had I think a 4% last year in the fourth quarter, it is really an improvement in performance. But when you look at kind of where our long-term growth rate wants to be, needs to be, that's consistent -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Consistent.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; consistent with our plan. Electro and Communications continues to run very strongly, and they'll have a continued very strong fourth quarter here. There's no reason, as George said, Industrial will continue to have the double-digit growth here in the fourth quarter. And surprisingly, even Optical being down will still be up on a year-over-year basis.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I hope we don't disappoint you here, Pat, with more 2011. We do appreciate all that. If we look at the balance sheet, net debt to cap now negative. Can you, George, talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the pace of acquisitions? Because you've got plenty of firepower here, but presumably valuations are moving up. And then maybe dovetailing off the share count perspective, you clearly would have room to do some buyback as well, and where is that in your thinking at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think you can certainly start with the assumption, Terry, that we're going to have an anti-dilution strategy, and we've been trying to figure out finally what our position is going to be on more share buybacks. But I think you are right. We probably will continue at a similar pace on acquisitions next year. There's no reason to believe that it will be significantly off where we are today. Of course, you can't define that exactly at this stage of the game, but I think there is one school of thought here that says we might advance some of our share buybacks next year a little bit above what we've done in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>So it's very much in the thinking, Terry, balanced approach. We'll have a higher CapEx number next year. Perhaps at 30, maybe even 40% higher than we've &#x2013; that we've had this year. So you're up in that sort of 1.3 bill, 1.4 bill. You've got a lot of demand in Asia, a lot of demand in some of these market spaces, in abrasives, in the renewables energy area. So, we're going to have a sort of balanced need I think. But I do agree with you, it probably will leave some room for a little bit more share buyback next year than we've traditionally done in the last few years.</p>

          <p>35% incrementals next year flow through. We do obviously across the industrial spectrum see rising raw material prices. Presumably that means you've got to accelerate some of your own price increase activity there.

        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Terry it's something we have to do. And of course our first focus will be on driving productivity, okay, and cost reduction programs. But to the degree that we do need to take on pricing we will do that. Follow up to an earlier comment on kind of raw materials that I think Steve had, it is a little more pocketed, okay? So certain industries will probably have to take some price here. Realistically we've probably lagged a little bit, okay -</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it sounds as though the 2011 framework puts you at or above that longer term 7 to 8% organic revenue growth goal. So I was hoping, George, could comment on some of these recent moves that move you along that target. And just with regard to Alpha Beta, how that fits the pyramid, new product introductions, vitality index, and now 34% of revenue from emerging markets. All of this moves you towards this goal. Should we expect more of the same, or are there further initiatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we like the path where we're going down, Deane. And you've correctly interpreted pretty much all of what we're doing, driving the topline innovation. That's why I mentioned that 32% MPVI number. That's important. That will keep on filling the sort of the top of the hopper. Our pyramid strategy, of which Alpha Beta is part of, helps us bulwark some of the leakage that might come. So that's part and parcel of the puzzle.</p>
          <p>You're right about our emphasis on emerging markets. Completely correct. And also you see some of the acquisitions, Deane, Attenti, Cogent in much higher growth spaces than traditionally have been the case for 3M. So we're playing all of the sort of the strings on the fiddle. And so far, the music's coming out okay. I'm sure here and there things won't turn out exactly as we hoped. But I think the last piece of the puzzle, Deane, not to necessarily end on any kind of a negative note is we've got to start trying to put more of the magic on, I think, on our U.S. business, on our Western European businesses. But with the kind of capabilities that we have, I mean, when you think &#x2013; comparing us left/right versus many of our competitors, you wonder how ultimately we're not going to win that battle.</p>
          <p>So I think it's now just a question of emphasizing those a little bit more. And that might give us yet some more lift in due course. So I think you've already, you've outlined the plan and are dead right on it. I don't think it is going to change a great deal, Deane.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up, the comment on Cogent. You were already in a passport security system, but -</p>
        </plist>

          <p>&#x2013; what else does Cogent add in terms of a security platform for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they're primarily border crossing, border security type applications so they're &#x2013; or high security military, embassies, those sorts of things where you need high security entry. So they're in &#x2013; they're in the classic fingerprint areas and remembering that the only thing that a criminal ever leaves at a crime site is a fingerprint, it's still very important to local law enforcement. So that's still important.</p>
          <p>But you get up in the level of sophistication, iris scanning, palm scanning, those sorts of things are kind of part and parcel of the secular move toward much more secure border crossing environments with smarter passports, smarter, shall we say, biometric interrogation of people passing the border. So I think this is just a steady move up the technology space for us and into higher growth spaces, Terry. Deane, sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, David, obviously we want the same thing that you do. I think understandably investors want to see a track record. They're I'm sure very pleased with how it's gone so far. But I think ultimately, I've kind of view it another couple quarters. Maybe we'll get to the tipping point of people's opinion. But it's still a lot of work to be done before then. We've got to continue to work at this, push this, the stuff that point we know. We know how to do the innovation. We know how to do the customer engagement. And so maybe we're not getting quite the full credit for it yet. But I think it's no time to be impatient, at least not for us. We keep on doing what we do well, and I have every confidence that it will come our way in due course, David. But thank you for the implied help there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, acquisitions will be &#x2013; when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, with the change in guidance that we've had in 2010 here, acquisitions will actually be a little bit accretive for us on a year-over-year basis slightly. Tax rate, at this point in time, from a planning standpoint our structural rate is more around 30 right now. So that's what we'll probably put in our plan for next year.</p>
          <p>Long-term goals, 28.5 and keep driving that down. We're able to &#x2013; we're able to pull some things off this year that were more kind of one-time in nature. And obviously the tax team still has that assignment for next year to keep buying those things. But it's probably prudent at this point in time to probably plan around a 30 rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Do you think the correction in the display marketplace will flush through in the quarter, or do you think it could be something to linger into early 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you never really know. It depends how sell through goes in the kind of Christmas season is the answer to that question. But trying to address it, I think the vast majority of any inventory corrections must be through. This is an inventory &#x2013; sorry an industry with about six weeks inventory in the channel and availability to flush it through is very rapid. So you kind of see these things as short and sharp. They drop fast, they come back fast.</p>
          <p>If history has anything to teach us, I think that you will see the first quarter, once the correction is gone through, you will see the first quarter accompanied by some more rapid growth, a return to rapid growth. But also traditionally, there's usually associated with this some extra pricing pressure as the OEMs try to use that as a means of just sort of bulldozing their way through. They just basically, they don't like volumes dropping, and price is one of the games that they play, one of the tools they use to push through.</p>
          <p>So I think that's the sort of environment you'll see. And so I think that will ease as the first quarter goes through, maybe the second quarter so that's kind of the pattern, short, sharp, wholly fixed in the fourth quarter depending on sell through. Probably associated with pricing pressure in the first half of the year and higher volumes. That's probably the way this thing is going to pan out.</p>

          <p>Just wanted to ask, it sounds like about 40 to 50 basis points of the gross margin contraction this quarter was due to unfavorable mix, and I'm wondering if we should be baking in something around that range of unfavorable mix going forward in the gross margin line?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Lucy, depending on what period of time you're thinking is, a piece of that is raw materials. We think we're going through kind of the peak of that right now. That actually should kind of start to decline, we think a little bit.</p>
          <p>Another piece of this, of course, is the mix of the business that we have between Health Care and Safety kind of being down. The H1N1 piece of this obviously will last us for another quarter. So that in fact will still be there. But we do expect Health Care will start to, will perform better in the fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter. So &#x2013; maybe on &#x2013; a little bit, but I don't think the same degree of reduction, Lucy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow up on your comment on D&amp;G and pricing in the first half next year, so some pressure there but then would be interested in your thoughts on volume the trends you're seeing with LED penetration and then expectations for large LCD TVs, growth rates going into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you'll probably see mix shifts as with &#x2013; when there's any sense of market pressure, these manufacturers try fishing in different ponds to see whether they can catch a big tranche of customers. So that's where I think the pricing mix will sort of pan out. You'll see probably experiments in lower brightness, experiments maybe without films, experiments with fewer LEDs and a few things like that. But I think ultimately, I mean in the past those things have not worked well to be completely honest with you, and the customer has been unwilling to really on a consistent basis accept those.</p>
          <p>So I suspect once the flushing has gone through the channel it will return to more normalized basis. But I think it's &#x2013; there's been a fairly sizeable gap between the standard CCFL TVs and the LED TVs. I suspect that gap &#x2013; that will compress. And so they'll use that obviously to drive I think volume at the top of the performance pyramid.</p>
          <p>So a lot of kind of I suspect turbulence in the &#x2013; even in the fourth quarter but certainly going over into the first quarter until they find a new mix of sales, brightness, sizes, that seems to suit current market conditions. So some turbulence probably putting pressures on price, but volume coming back would be my prediction.</p>

          <p>double-digit grower. LED I think was your &#x2013; you had a specific question on LED. We'll probably, the industry probably will run 20, 25% this year. That number should be about to exit, okay, probably in 2011. You're probably approaching 50%. So obviously that's a favorable mix shift for us.</p>

          <p>Good. Just on that 30% increase and add in merchandising spend, clearly investing to push growth here. Maybe inside into how these expenses track over the next few quarters and then the expectation on the pay back?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's say kind of continuous investment, so it's not necessarily lumpy. Once we obviously get it in the base we'll keep going. It's a little bit &#x2013; it ends up somewhat seasonal related, especially in the consumer business. But our tracking is, we have a very good tracking mechanism as to what we invest versus are we getting the sales back. And it's different by business. But it's a long term &#x2013; it's investment for us, both in the developed part of the world.</p>
          <p>If you at all are a TV watcher you've seen far more both TV ads as well as online ads here in the U.S. but importantly, we're also investing a fair amount in the emerging markets. Now is the time to be investigating in our brands in emerging markets. And in some cases that will not pay back immediately. Some of this is a longer term pay back in some of those emerging markets.

          <p>Thanks for taking my follow up. I appreciate it. Just on the first, on the first half of next year, you talked about Display and Graphics getting better as we kind of exit the fourth quarter. Is there anything going on with the comps that are going to make kind of growth uneven as you look forward for D&amp;G or any of the other businesses?</p>

          <p>Stephen, I'll be honest with you, I haven't completely quarterized next year. Okay? But nothing that &#x2013; nothing that comes necessarily to my mind. You look at &#x2013; there's still is a little bit of H1N1 rollover into the first half of this year so Safety has a little bit probably tougher comp early in the year versus late in the year. Other than that, I don't see anything that is kind of materially different on a quarter by quarter basis.</p>

          <p>Steve, I think H1N1 was in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 million in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
