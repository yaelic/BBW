          <p>Good afternoon friends from the media. I believe this is a press conference that many of you have been waiting for. Yeah, we are very pleased to have Piyush with us. This is his first press conference, since he joined DBS and so what we'll do with regard to the rundown for today's media conference, Piyush will kick-off with basically sharing with us some of his first impression since he has joined DBS.</p>
          <p>Today is his 89th day with the bank, yes, right he joined us on November the 9th, after that we'll hand over the floor over to Sok Hui, who will go through the FY, our Full Year 2009 financials and then in addition to talking about his first impression, Piyush also gives you sort of a high level overview of our results for this year.</p>
          <p>After Sok Hui finishes, Piyush will come back and then share with us, basically his thoughts and his views on the bank's strategic priorities going forward. So on that note without further ado, I'll pass the floor to Piyush. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not supposed to talk about first impressions. Okay listen. Hi, thanks for being here and I guess I can talk about first impressions because I just spent a couple of hours with our employees and staff during our town hall, and so I did talk to everybody there about first impressions.</p>
          <p>And I guess, and I made a joke there, which is true, I didn't realize it was day 89. But I'm not counting, Karen is, so that must mean something. You know, I looked around, let me break it into two parts. It's quite clear as you go through the DBS thing that there is some really great strengths DBS has. And some of these I knew when I came in. Some of these really were things that struck me over the last two or three months that I've been around. Some are pretty obvious.</p>
          <p>So, clearly the first thing that stands out, as I go round this whole thing of financial strength. This is not new stuff for you guys but it is really important. We are one of the only, I think 23 was the last count somebody told me, but let's say one of the top, it was a 25 AA or AA minus/plus rated banks in the world. That's actually quite a big deal. And the fact as I go around and review our businesses in other countries, that strength, the inherent strength of DBS, which is sort of epitomizes and embodies the strength of Singapore, actually means a lot.</p>
          <p>So through the crisis, it was quite clear that irrespective of issues and there was a clear flight to quality, and whether it's in the consumer space or in the institutional space, people, when they look at a diversified banking portfolio or banking providers, we stand out and people are willing to look at us, just because it's a strong bank. And again, from outside, I sort of knew this but having come into the Bank and being around and met our clients and our people, it's pretty stark, how relevant that is.</p>
          <p>The other thing which struck me is something again I hadn't expected positively, is the brand resonance that the DBS brand has. And Singapore it's a obvious thing, right? Everybody knows DBS and we're not the competitor at the other end of DBS in terms of brand recognition, there is no question who is the market leader. But the interesting thing, as you go around the region, the DBS brand has relevance and resonance in strange places. Indonesia, it's really well known, it's a well-known brand people recognize it and sort of see it as Singapore.</p>
          <p>But in Hong Kong and Taiwan, I was quite interested and surprised as we went on our service shows, we are seen as a progressive bank and that's actually a good place to be, to be a progressive bank and a progressive brand. So another second big positive to me, it's actually a good brand, which has relevance in countries outside Singapore alone. Clearly, in India and China, we are small and, therefore, brand recognition is more of a challenge. But certainly in the other countries I mentioned it was a relative positive.</p>
          <p>I think the third thing, which I looked around, I was joking to the people earlier. When I took the job, one of my concerns at the back of my head obviously was I'd spent 28 years with a multinational American bank and I'm moving to a bank, which is Singaporean and on top of that, government linked. So the issue of the people and the cultural challenge is obviously something, which I was worried about. And frankly if I had to say, what's really been the most positive part of the thing of my experience so far, it has been exactly that I just find that the people quality is at least as good, the people quality I've been used to in my previous place.</p>
          <p>We've got good people. We've got, and frankly in some places in the newer countries, because we are a young bank, we've got actually very energetic and young people. And that's a good thing. I feel good about it. One of the things that again, there's is no secret in the past in its history, DBS' leadership was questioned for its solidarity or collectivity and frankly in the last couple of years, from everything I can see under Boon Hwee's leadership and maybe riches, it has come a long, long way. We've got a really good unified collective leadership, which is actually top class. So, it's good. Also I was struck by, clearly some business which everybody knows are good franchises that DBS has.</p>
          <p>And when you come and look at from the inside, they really stand out. The Singapore consumer footprint is obviously immense. It's unique, principally on the back of the POSB franchise. Now I'll talk about it in a bit. We could have done more with that footprint and frankly we recognized it. But the fact remains that if you have a banking relationship with 90% of the people in this country, that's a fantastic asset. People would pay their left arms to be able to own such an asset. So it's something that we should really be able to work and do stuff off. The part that surprised me. I have always felt from outside and my understanding was that DBS is really a top end corporate bank, right?</p>
          <p>So its roots are in the development bank thing, and it's sort of democratic linked and government linked and so on and so forth. I was actually very pleasantly surprised to see how robust and how strongly flourishing our SME and mid-market portfolio book is. It's the fastest growing part of our corporate banking business. And it's now a substantial part of our corporate banking business.</p>
          <p>And also as we look at countries outside of Singapore, it is clearly a segment that we have some fairly good positions in. So that was a positive and a surprise. And obviously, the other thing, which was not a surprise but has really reinforced my thinking, we have a world-class treasury and markets business. So we just &#x2013; it competes on a world-class level with most of the global players and global houses. And frankly, as I looked at it, our understanding and management of market risk is also world class. It is very, very superior, very class. So a lot of strength in the franchise which I saw as I went around. By the way, the other thing I should say is &#x2013; the one thing which is again obvious but again stands out to you.</p>
          <p>We have good geographic platforms, right. So we're one of the few players, we've got a good platform in Greater China. Our acquisition of Bowa Bank in Taiwan was good. We've got a 40-branch presence there. Obviously, Hong Kong has been there for sometime. And our organic growth, our business in China has actually been doing well, has been growing out quite nicely. But also, one of the few, probably the only Asian bank, which really has a footprint there or footprint here and also footprint in India. And it's important. It's a really well &#x2013; relatively well-balanced geographic footprint.</p>
          <p>Now there's issues obviously. The biggest issue, which is a tactical issue, which several of &#x2013; is that we are really a very deposit-flush bank. So, we're a deposit-surplus bank and therefore we're a lot more susceptible to the vagaries of the interest rate cycle than other banks are. So in low interest rate environments, we hurt more than other banks hurt. And that's an issue, so what that really means as we think of about our future. We've got to figure a way to building a more balanced balance sheet, right.</p>
          <p>So that's an issue for us. I referred to it earlier, we've got a fantastic consumer franchise, but if we really think about what we've been able to do in terms of building on or building out that franchise, we have an opportunity. We have work to do. So being able to create a broader and more robust relationship with our consumer base in Singapore, leveraging on POSB. That's an area that there is clearly opportunities to do better than we have.</p>
          <p>People have commented and you go round the streets in Singapore, you will see queues in front of the DBS ATMs. I do never see queues in front of the other two you see, and that's because they are very heavily used. And a statistic, which I learned, our usage of ATMs is the highest of any bank anywhere in the world, DBS ATMs, right. It's just very, very heavily used, Now that's a strength, but obviously focusing on being able to improve the consumer experience, being able to put the consumer experience in the heart of what we do, is an opportunity.</p>
          <p>So we need to be able to do a better job of that than we've been able to in the past and that's something that's part of what we will build. And frankly from a franchise standpoint, I said that, we have some great business franchises. There are challenges. We have a presence and footprint in India and China, but quite clearly the regulatory environment there is not as friendly to rapid growth as it is in other markets. So we've got to work with that and work around that. But bottom line, as I put the pieces together, it's quite clear to me in the end of three months that we really have a very good platform. We have some of the best building blocks and some of the best platform to really be able to take off and grow on. So this is a high level thing on observation.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the, quick this thing. So I think if you look at the results for '09 for DBS and frankly I don't claim ownership for the results, but &#x2013; and secondly, as objective as you or the analyst can on this sort of thing. I think frankly it's a strong set of results. A 9% growth on the top line in the economic environment of last year is actually very strong. It's very good and then, because, and like every other smart banker around the world when you have a tough economic time, the controllable you have is your expense base. So DBS did a good job controlling expenses.</p>
          <p>The arrangement on the expenses, which gave 17% growth, and operating profit. 17% operating profit growth is pretty damn good, by any measure. Clearly, the bottom line, earnings are flat to '08 and that really reflects the credit cycle we are in. The credit environment and the credit cycle that we are in. I'll speak about that in a second, but just sticking to income growth, the income growth is pretty balanced, so despite the interest rate environment, I spoke a minute ago about the fact that DBS gets really badly hurt in down cycles in interest rate right.</p>
          <p>Despite the interest rate environment, we will able to get a 4% growth on the net interest income line. That's very good. That speaks of some pretty efficient management on the asset books. And 24% growth in non-interest income to $2.15 billion, now that's again not in this and Sok Hui will speak to it, it's also fairly balanced, it not only includes good trading performance, which a lot of the houses dive and we have a good trading house, but included really robust performances in areas as diverse as the capital markets and investment banking, and a loan book and so on. So it is a good, diversified performance team.</p>
          <p>Back to the credit cycle. So as a bank we've generally tried to be prudent. I think we've done a fairly good job of doing that. Our NPLs are obviously at a high, but as Sok Hui will point out, we tend to be conservative in our recognition of NPLs. And so we take things into non-performing before they necessarily need to be taken and before a lot of our, the global benchmarks are in terms of when you take them into non-performing.</p>
          <p>And one of the good things we did in the last quarter frankly is that we still had a residual CDO portfolio. Not sub-prime, sub-prime we pretty much provided for before. But we had a fairly large $700 million of non sub-prime only business in the portfolio. We've pretty much been able to get rid of all of that. And so really from the exposure that we still have on our books, so the vulnerability, we've sort of &#x2013; we manage to put that behind us. I think what I'm actually quite pleased about as I look back at what DBS did is this thing about standing by the customer.</p>
          <p>Boon Hwee, I think a year ago and several of you reported it, came out and said DBS will stand by customers through this down cycle. And, we can look back with some satisfaction that we were really able to demonstrate doing that. In the consumer banking front, we not only stayed with customers, we were able to actually increase our loans dramatically, so we are out there lending. This is our strongest loan growth here ever for DBS. And that's actually saying something and 13% growth rates over the previous year.</p>
          <p>We continue to stay Singapore's largest mortgage loan provider. And frankly we're doing that, we're also building up our deposit base, which is a good thing. But I think that was an important statement. And on the SME side as well we continued to build, I told you, our SME business is continuing to gain momentum. And in '09 I think that was demonstrated.</p>
          <p>We were a leading lender in the government loan programs. More than half of the government loans that we approved were to new customers, so we weren't just stopping up loans to previous customers. And even in Hong Kong, we disbursed over 4 billion Hong Kong dollars and so we're rated the best SME partner in 2009. So we've been out there standing by our customers whether in the consumer segment, the SME segment. We're also able to do a lot of good things in the Capital Market side.</p>
          <p>That was a capital market, as you know, came through quite nicely, certainly in the Asian space, both in fixed income and equities and we are quite proud of the fact that we were able to leverage our platform in Singapore to retain some fairly impressive leadership positions. Of all the rights issues done in Singapore last year we did 76%, while 75% of funds raised in Singapore. We are number one in the SGD bond market with more than 25% share. We were number one in the Singapore REIT market with 29% market share. So clearly, our range of our customer activities was very strong.</p>
          <p>And finally, outside the region we were quite pleased with our progress in particularly two countries Taiwan and India. In Taiwan we integrated Bowa and we had our own internal projections for how long it would take and when we could make it profitable, while we became profitable in '09 and that was you know, a year ahead of what we thought we could do. So that was actually a great result.</p>
          <p>And in India, I mean, as growth rates have been astronomical, we've been sort of growing at a CAGR of almost 100% for the last few years and '09 were no exception, but just a very strong performance. So with that I'm going to pass you over to Sok Hui who's going to take you through some more details of our financial performance and our numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Piyush. A very good afternoon to all of you. We delivered a strong set of results for 2009. Revenue were up 9% to 6.6 billion. Profits before allowances reached a record 4 billion in a fragile economic environment, up 17% from the previous quarter. The performance was underpinned by broad-based revenue and business volume growth as we stood by our customers. Net interest income was up 4% to a record 4.5 billion. Backed by our strong balance sheet, we grew our market share of Singapore Dollar loans for the second consecutive year from 18% at end of 2007 to just over 20% currently.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong, we have a loan market share of 5.6%, the highest in several years. Non-interest income was up 24% to 2.2 billion. Full year expenses were unchanged as we reined in expenses in the face of a challenging environment. The stronger operating performance was offset by higher allowances, which doubled to 1.5 billion from the previous year. We continue to adopt a prudent approach to recognizing NPLs and setting aside allowances. The increase in NPLs was largely due to borrowers outside of Asia, in particular the Middle East. Asset quality in our main markets in Asia has been improving since the second half of 2009. Net profit for 2009 was 2.1 billion, unchanged from the previous year.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter earnings were 493 million, up 29% from a year ago. Like the earlier quarters of the year, we grew revenues faster than cost. Net interest income was stable as margins were resilient and momentum in mortgage lending was sustained. Non-interest income was 25% higher with a wide range of fee income activities benefiting from better capital market and economic conditions. Expenses rose 2% due to higher accruals for technology projects and higher seasonal advertising and promotional activities.</p>
          <p>We took additional allowances this quarter in line with our prudent approach on asset quality. This quarter, the allowances were mainly for exposures outside of Asia. We also took the opportunity of better market conditions to divest some 650 million of our non-ADS CDO investments in the fourth quarter. Adequate allowances have been set aside which was more than sufficient to offset the loss on the sale of the portfolio. The remaining CDO/CLO portfolios are adequately provisioned and we have put the issue behind us. There was also a net tax write back of 47 million this quarter as we reached resolution on prior year's tax position. Compared to the previous quarter, net profit fell 12%, as revenues were stable for seasonal year-end expenses contributed to a 10% increase in costs.</p>
          <p>Full year net interest income rose 4% to a new high of 4.5 billion. Asset growth was led by housing loans. Net interest margin was firm and funding cost was tightly managed to offset the impact of lower market interest rates. Fourth quarter net interest income was steady from the previous quarter at 1.1 billion. Loans grew 2% over the quarter bringing full year loan growth to 3%.</p>
          <p>Loan growth for the quarter and the year was led by housing loans as we enjoyed strong disbursements in Singapore and Hong Kong. Overall, housing loans rose 7% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Business loans were little changed for the quarter and for the year, in line with the industry. For the full year, fee income rose 9% to 1.4 billion, leading the growth to investment banking and loan related fees. With capital markets recovering from dislocations in 2008, we benefited from activities including equity offerings, Singapore Dollar bonds and mid-market M&amp;A advisory, for which we continue to lead in Singapore. This helped to offset declines in wealth management fee income. Other non-interest income rose 65% to 754 million driven by strong trading gains as a result of better trading opportunities.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, fee income was 358 million, little changed from the previous quarter. Investment banking fees was stronger, which offset declines in stock broking and other fee activities. Other non-interest income was also stable.</p>
          <p>Full-year expenses: full-year expenses were unchanged at 2.6 billion, as we maintained expenses in a challenging environment. Fourth quarter expenses rose 10% from the previous quarter, driven by increased accrual for technology projects and higher seasonal advertising and promotional activities. These increases were partially offset by lower staff cost.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong: Hong-Kong full-year earnings rose 19% in Singapore dollar terms to 464 million from lower cost and allowances. Revenue fell 3% due to weaker contributions from unit trust, insurance, and trade finance activities and lower gains from the sale of investments. Net interest income was stable and margins improved underpinned by higher customer loan volumes.</p>
          <p>Expenses declined 17%, the previous year's expenses included significant non-recurring expenses. Allowances fell 10% as asset quality improved from the second quarter. NPL rate, which had peaked at 2.6% in the first quarter, improved progressively to 1.7% at end 2009 and changed from end 2008.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong's fourth quarter performance reflected a continuation of recent operating trend. Net earnings of 128 million were significantly above a year ago as expenses and allowances declined. Revenues rose 2% from a year ago. Non-interest income was boosted by unit trust, insurance, stock broking, loan-related activities, and treasury product sales to corporate. Net interest income was boosted by loan growth, but offset by record low interest rates.</p>
          <p>Expenses fell 25% from a year ago as there's been significant non-recurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. Allowances fell two-thirds from a year ago as asset quality continued to improve. Specific allowances were below a year ago and a little changed from the previous quarter. The increase in allowances from the previous quarter was due to general allowances in line with loan growth.</p>
          <p>Non-performing loans &#x2013; non-performing assets rose 10% from the previous quarter to 4.2 billion, mainly due to exposure in the Middle East. 43% of assets classified as non-performing assets are still current in interests and principals. Our Group NPL now stands at 2.9%. NPL rates in most markets, including Singapore, Greater China, South and South East Asia improved during the quarter. The increase in NPL came largely from the rest of the world. Cumulative allowances remain healthy. Including collateral, allowances coverage amounted to more than 100% of non-performing assets.</p>
          <p>We divested most of our non-ABS CDO investments during the quarter, reducing our total CDO investments to 195 million from 859 million in the previous quarter. The remaining 45 million of non-ABS CDOs will mature in 2010 and 2011. The 150 million ABS CDOs already have an allowance coverage exceeding 90%. With Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 13.1% and total CAR of 16.7%, our capital position remain strong and comfortably above regulatory requirement. We're in a healthy position to take advantage of economic upturn.</p>
          <p>We're proposing final dividends of $0.14 per share. Based on yesterday's closing share price, DBS shares give investors an annualized dividend yield of 3.9%. The DBS Scrip Dividend Scheme, which was approved at the previous AGM will be applicable to the new &#x2013; to the final dividend. New shares will be issued to shareholders who elect to receive the final dividend in script at a price, which is at a 5% discount to the average of the last dealt price for DBS shares on each of 20 May, 21 May and 24 May, 2010.</p>
          <p>To sum up, our 2009 performance demonstrated the strength of our franchise as we focused on customers, costs and risk management. We achieved broad-based revenue growth underpinned by higher business volumes in consumer and corporate banking. We made efforts to rein in expenses given the fragile environment. We have been prudent in classifying non-performing assets and setting aside allowances.</p>
          <p>Asset quality in our main Asian markets continue to improve. We divested a large part of our CLO investments, and already set aside ample allowances for the remaining one. Our balance sheet is strong. Our capital was reinforced with the rights issue earlier this year. Our deposit franchise also ensures us ample liquidity. With these we are well positioned as we work with customers to capture emerging opportunities in 2010 as the economic upturn continues.</p>
          <p>I would now hand you back to Piyush to cover our strategic priorities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Sok Hui. So, we have, in addition to spending a lot of time obviously trying to learn the business, we spent a lot of time equally as a management team thinking about what are the key things we need to do as a bank and where are we headed to. And we really defined, I guess, nine key priorities for ourselves; three each in the areas of geography, business build up and what we call enablers or perhaps more internal capabilities.</p>
          <p>And before I dive into those, just as a preface, it's quite clear given where the world is and given where Asia is today that we are in the right part of the world and we are in the right place. Asia is where it's all happening. Asia is driving, increasing the growth. My economist colleague has this really neat chart, which he again showed us this morning, which suggests that 2010 is going to be a watershed year in many ways, because by our research for the first time Asia's contribution to incremental new demand in the world is going to outstrip the U.S. If you go back to 20 years ago, Asia's contribution to new demand used to be half of the U.S. It's been gradually increasing and we think in 2010 for the first time we would be 1.0 time &#x2013; 02 times of the U.S., so, which is a big deal.</p>
          <p>So, domestic consumption in Asia is indeed driving growth. And therefore, for us, as DBS, in terms of what kind of bank do we want to build and where do we want to play, that's a starting assumption. We really want to build an Asian franchise with an Asian footprint. I mentioned earlier we're privileged that over the last decade we've build good platform positions in what I call the three axis of growth in Asia. We have a position in the Greater China axis, we have a position in obviously in Singapore, and we have a position in the South Asia axis. And so we are well positioned.</p>
          <p>Our aspiration is to continue to focus on this playing field. And in this playing field to build out a leading Pan-Asian regional bank, like the leading Asian bank. What that means therefore also that we are unlikely, we are unlikely pretty much will not be looking at expanding our businesses in domestic franchises in Europe and North America, frankly even in the Middle East. We have enough to do in our backyard and that's where we hope to focus &#x2013; that's where we hope to build our future, certainly for the next five or ten years, foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>So with that background, let me walk you through the nine priorities that we think will define what we intend to do in the next few years and frankly help us to achieving this leading Pan-Asian nation bank.</p>
          <p>Number one priority &#x2013; three geography priority &#x2013; the number one priority for us is really we've got to entrench our leadership position in Singapore. We are privileged in some ways, because we have had the largest &#x2013; we have been for a long time the largest bank in Singapore, we've got the best footprint in Singapore. But the truth also is we've just not capitalized enough on our position of strength. And so there are a few things that we think we need to do. One, I talked about earlier having an unbalanced balance sheet, right. And that's because we tend to be very deposit surplus.</p>
          <p>One of the areas that we do need to focus on and concentrate is to build out our customer assets. And that is as much in the consumer space, whether it's home loans or unsecured lending, as in the SME space. So that is an area of priority we are going to continue to focus on doing that.</p>
          <p>I spoke to you again earlier about the POSB franchise. It's a fantastic franchise and we have to be able to do a lot more with the franchise than we have hitherto. So seeing how we can build a more full service relationship with the POSB customer, how we can make it something more than just the savings bank, but into a broader relationship which includes financing, mortgage and so on, the right sort of investment choices, is something which will occupy us. It's something that we will focus on.</p>
          <p>We do think that we have a unique opportunity to lead the payment space in the Singapore market, right. We already have, the reason that you see 10 people at every DBS ATM and zero at all the other ATMs is we already have a position as a payments provider in Singapore. We think we can leverage on that and really continue to build a leadership position in the space, and whether it's more modern payment, whether its debit cards, prepaid cards, mobile technology, but we will continue to focus and be the dominant provider in the payment space in Singapore.</p>
          <p>And finally the fourth thing we've got to work very hard in improving our cross-sell across all our customer segments. And that's something which we can do frankly not only to make our relationships more meaningful, more sticky, but also to juice up the returns in our business. We tend to be loan-centric and loan-denominated. If we can start leveraging some of the capabilities we have in other areas and improve the cross-sell that will allow us to achieve therefore more customer's centricity but also improve the quality of our own earnings.</p>
          <p>So, focus on Singapore, entrench our position in Singapore, make sure the leadership in Singapore counts, that's our number one geographic priority.</p>
          <p>The second thing we need to do, and then a lot of people have talked about this; I call it re-energize Hong Kong. There's always a big question, right? The DBS paid too much for its acquisition in Hong Kong. And frankly, it's debatable. There are enough people who frankly in today's day and age, if you want to go and acquire a bank and do a deal, you could make a good case you didn't pay too much.</p>
          <p>The more important issue however is what are we doing, and how are we being able to bring value from the integrated Hong Kong franchise that we have. And frankly that is an area of &#x2013; which is going to be an area of focus for us in terms of what we can do to improve that. We have a good footprint. We have 50, 55 branches. So we can be a leading universal bank.</p>
          <p>Our Hong Kong market shares today are in the 4, 5 &#x2013; 3, 4, 5% range. Having a 5% plus market share in a banking system is not a bad market share at all. The bank I come from and most of the global banks are very happy to run with 4, 5% market shares because banking tends to be a very fragmented industry. So at a 5% market share you will very happily be in the number five to number ten position in the market, and you can build a sustainable business in that position; it can be a broad universal position.</p>
          <p>But there are a couple of things we need to do. One we &#x2013; I call it &#x2013; we need to rebuild our management bench strength in Hong Kong. So what we've done in Hong Kong, it's been our source of talent, we've used it to build our China business, we've used it to build our Taiwan business; we've pulled functions out of Hong Kong and brought them to Singapore, in the process we've not devoted as much talent to the management bench to the Hong Kong proposition itself as perhaps we should. So that's something that will engage us, how do we re-energize, rebuild our management bench strength over there.</p>
          <p>The second thing is &#x2013; and we inherited and we got from, when we did the acquisition of Dao Heng, we inherited some really large and very interesting customer pools. So, on the consumer space we got circa 300 to 400,000 consumer customers, right. But we haven't done a very good job of segmenting those consumer pools, customer pools. We actually got a fantastic SME portfolio, but we haven't done a very good job of segmenting that SME portfolio, and driving and managing the distinction between the mid caps on the one side and the mom and pop shops on the other side. So, thinking through and developing a far better refined segmented strategy for our Hong Kong businesses will be a priority.</p>
          <p>We believe that if we do that we can manage our presence in those segments better. And we believe we can improve the profitability of the business that we do by doing that segmentation.</p>
          <p>The third thing, obviously in Hong Kong, we need to invest a little bit in rebuilding our brand, and all of you know, so we've stubbed our toes a couple of times in Hong Kong, both the safe deposit incident some years ago, and our investment sales in the last couple of years. So we will do that. We will invest in making sure that we invest in rebuilding our brand, so we are relevant, we're resonant and use a more segmented strategy to rebuild our Hong Kong position.</p>
          <p>The third thing, we need to do, is I call it rebalance the geographic mix of our business. And that's really got a couple of elements to it. One is, as a team we've thought about this, if we really think Asia is the future, and Asia is going to propel our growth as a pan-regional, as an Asian bank, then our current mix of earnings, the current mix of our businesses, will probably have to be balanced somewhat over a period of time.</p>
          <p>And frankly, as best as we can see together, what we really need to get to is this 40-30-30 kind of mix, maybe 40% of our business will be Singapore, it will be our anchor market, it will be our home market, and we really need to be big there. But we would like to be able to get maybe equal business presence in Greater China on the one side and what we call South and South East Asia on the other side, and so a more balanced mix of businesses.</p>
          <p>From an organic standpoint, I mentioned, we really have good ability to build out a broader consumer proposition in Taiwan and Indonesia. In Taiwan, we have 40 plus branches and in Indonesia we have 40 branches and rapidly increasing. In both of these markets, we think in addition to doing corporate and SME kind of banking, we can &#x2013; and affluent banking, we can actually go down to the next consumer segment, which is the upper middle class if you will. So and we think we will do that. In China and India it's a little more tricky because of the limitations on distribution. So our focus is likely to be in the corporate space, top-end corporate space, and in affluent consumer banking, right. Top-end corporate and frankly we can do SME banking in these countries and then affluent consumer banking. So that's the thinking we have around the rebalanced geographic mix of our businesses, so, three geographic priorities.</p>
          <p>Outside of that, we've looked at our business and we really figure that while in most of our markets we have the capacity and will be a broad universal player, there are a couple of businesses, which are really important for us to build out, which we would like to be the go to bank in the region, right.</p>
          <p>So we want to make sure that in these businesses we are known for excellence. The first of these is we want to build out a leading SME franchise, SME business across the multiple markets we're in, anchored around trade finance, right. This obviously speaks to the opportunity in Asia. And everybody knows both inter-Asia trade and intra-Asia trade is expanding. Asia's always been for the last twenty years the heart of the global supply chains, the global hubs, but interestingly Asia is now beginning to consume more of its own production as well.</p>
          <p>So the spaghetti mesh of integrations across the countries in Asia is only going to increase exponentially. We believe that the opportunity to build the best-in-class bank in the space is still out there. And that's what we want; we want to run it with a reasonable business model. We want to develop best-in-class state finance capabilities. We have some very good competencies. We're one of the few banks which has warehouse financing capability. We have factoring capability, we have traditional trade finance, the LCs and bills capability. We have commodity risk-taking capability. We have exposure management capability in currency, rate, and some extent commodities. So a lot of the building blocks we can build to put together to really build a world class leading business in the space.</p>
          <p>And the good news in the space is that as these customers grow and evolve into mid-caps, we believe that we can grow with them and we can continue to offer them some capital markets opportunities as they grow up. But &#x2013; so that's one business that we really want to focus on and try and build a dominant position in.</p>
          <p>The second business that we really want to focus on pan-regional and take a leading stake in is the whole wealth space. Everybody knows, there are more millionaires being created in Asia, and particularly in China today, than anywhere else in the world. And that's true across the region. But it's not only the high net worth position, it's the affluent space. So there are just a lot of affluent customers being created in Asia rapidly.</p>
          <p>And we think for a bank like us, this is a logical and obvious place in which to stake a position and in which to grow. For one, it builds on the Singapore position and the Singapore heritage. And, I say loosely, Switzerland built a fantastic position in the wealth space over the last couple of hundred years, maybe longer because of its reputation for safety, security, reliability, AAA status and all that kind of stuff. Well, Singapore is the Switzerland of Asia.</p>
          <p>We have all of the same ingredients that Switzerland did, safety, security, reliability, solidity, and so on, which is why a lot of the wealth industry globally is shifting here. And well guess what within that, DBS is better positioned than anybody else to actually embody that positioning. We have heritage, parentage, and ownership which is as strong as Singapore is. So that's a huge opportunity for us. We believe that we have good presence already. We're a significant player; we are number six in terms of AUMs and private banking today around Asia, and that's without adding in our treasures, affluent AUMs and some of the other businesses we have, we have a good capability in execution. We have a good &#x2013; in a brokerage function. We have a good asset management function. So we have the wherewithal to pull together the pieces, which allow us to create a leading wealth management capability around the region. So that's the second business that we hope to take and make sure we build a leadership position in as we go forward.</p>
          <p>The third priority we have is we really have to build-out capabilities in two areas, in both areas we've got positions. In treasury and markets, as I told you before, is world class, and cash its getting there. But we need to build these two positions out in all of our markets just so that we can make sure that we have broad customer relationships, that we have sticky customer relationships and that we are not just a single product, loan-centric bank. We want to be the leading provider of Asian T&amp;M product right. So there is a lot of Asian product, which is created. We are already known for that. But we want to continue to build on that capability, so various local currency bond product, local currency equity product, local currency structure product, we want to make sure that we are known for being the best provider of Asian product in the T&amp;M space.</p>
          <p>In the cash space, I spoke about our payment aspiration in Singapore, but frankly across the region, in terms of payment systems connectivity and in terms of being able to offer our clients, both through electronic means and through physical means, one of the best capabilities to receive, to pay, and to manage the liquidity, we want to build that. And both of these will support our principal customer activities.</p>
          <p>Outside of the business view, the three priorities I talked about which are a little more internally focused, which are more capability building. What we need to build to be able to achieve the stuff. The first of these I call, creating a more customer-centric DBS. We really want to a) create a values-based service process and a service program. And by that, several of you know I mean Ritz-Carlton is a great example of that, Singapore Airlines is a good example of that. While we were putting all the metrics in that a good customer service organization does, in our call wait times, queue times, turnaround times, cycle times, that the best customer focused organizations are able to build a customer focus and a customer experience, which is emotive, which comes from the heart, but that means working with all of our employees, all up and down the region, and making sure that we focus on our values base, which is really important. We've got a good set of values, we call them our pride, but we will take those and run a program which really puts those at the heart of what we do.</p>
          <p>The second is customer-centric processes. A lot of our processes over the years, processes and documentation, frankly a policy over the years, have not really put the customer at the heart of the process. So when we've had to make tradeoffs often times we wind up making tradeoffs in favor of either control or compliance or productivity or et cetera and lot of banks do. They're important considerations.</p>
          <p>But we're going to go back and revisit all of our processes, all of our documentation, to see if we can make it more customer-friendly and more customer-facing. We've already launched a program, which is a continuous improvement, process improvement program across the company to see how we can find the right processes that we need to move to, to make a difference.</p>
          <p>And finally, customer-related data analytics. One of the things that we really have to put a lot of effort into is building a customer-centric MIS, management information. And it's not just financial MIS, which also we need to do, you know understand better which customers are profitable and which are less profitable, which segments are good and which are not good, but frankly, understand better customer drivers.</p>
          <p>And so what do customers do, or why do they do it, when do they do it, because then that allows it to be a lot more predictive in terms of managing the customer relationship and marketing your services to the customer. So really creating this huge customer-centricity is the first internal capability that's important for us to focus on. It will take us some time and effort to build this, but it's important.</p>
          <p>The second is focus on like our organization people and culture. One of the issues that we have is as a regional organization we're somewhat young, right. So unlike my previous company which started on their journey 200 years ago, we started ten years ago. And to put in place a regional management framework takes time.</p>
          <p>So this includes not only policy guidelines, but a general understanding of how we do things and why we need to do the things we need to do. It includes making sure that we are consistently aligned in terms of processes, in terms of procedures, in terms of risk appetite. So there's a lot work that has to be done in respect of that. Our intent is not to create a cookie-cutter approach in every country, because we don't believe that works, and so people used to call it a McDonald approach. And the truth is that you see McDonald had to evolve, and so even now McDonald has different products in different countries.</p>
          <p>We recognized that, so our intent is not a cookie-cutter approach but at the same time, if you want to leverage our regional presence, if you want to leverage our position of being in more than one country, then we have to put in a management framework that enables us to do that.</p>
          <p>A building bench, we have very good people, but we have to do &#x2013; focus a lot harder, which we will, on growing our own timber, building our own people. So we will groom and grow I call it &#x2013; groom and grow our own. So whether it's at entry level from the universities and schools or at mid-talent level, so we will put in place the competency and capabilities of identifying and building and growing people, giving them both lateral mobility, cross-country mobility and frankly vertical mobility.</p>
          <p>And finally, we've got to build capabilities around this culture of empowerment. Now that's a buzzword. So a lot of people talk about a culture of empowerment, but certainly in the context of DBS, it is something that we have to work on. The ability to give our people the right authority to take decisions at the frontline, at the coal face, and frankly this links in to the customer experience issue as well. So that's the second internal capability, set of capabilities that we will focus on.</p>
          <p>And the last really is around technology. So we in some places have a world-class, very good technology. It's the same technologies, application systems, which all the global players use and we use that. In other places, we have very good technology, outstanding technology, but we're not leveraging it enough.</p>
          <p>Overall, we need to put in place a technology roadmap and we're essentially calling it a roadmap based on our distributed services architecture. So we can actually build some large product processors, which we &#x2013; in some cases we have, some cases we need to build. But with some middleware on top, which allows us to publish services through any of our processor and allows all our interface points, whether it's the Internet applications, the ATMs, the branches, the banker, to be able to pull these services off the middleware. And that gives you the ability to be flexible. It gives you the ability to be quick, as well as be able to be cost efficient.</p>
          <p>So to put together a technology roadmap on that basis is something that we're going to focus on doing. And then we need to essentially leverage on rationalizing our technology operations platform, but most importantly, leverage technology to promote innovation. We do believe that a large part of innovation in the next few years will happen in our part of the world. And in Singapore particularly, we think it's a fantastic laboratory with which to do things, which if they work, we can take around the region. In the payment space, in the online space, we will leverage technology to do that as well.</p>
          <p>So three geography priorities, three business focused priorities and three effectively capability priorities. Admittedly, nine priorities are still a lot. So as a team we're going to spend some time making sure we can focus on phasing these out, we do the right things. Nevertheless, we have building blocks in place. So we're pretty confident that over the next 12 to 24 months we should be able to put a lot of the building blocks and enablers, which will be the platform to our future growth.</p>
          <p>On the back of these priorities, we think we can indeed &#x2013; we have a real opportunity to be that leading Asian bank. We call it the Asian Bank of Choice for the new Asia, for the Asia that is on us and the Asia that is coming over the next couple of decades.</p>
          <p>That pretty much describes what I wanted to talk to you about. And are we doing Q&amp;A Karen?</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Piyush. All right. We'll commence the Q&amp;A session. And as always, please identify yourself, your name and which publication you represent. Yes, as always Reuters first off the mark, Kevin?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question; in the provisions made, are your Dubai &#x2013; is your Dubai exposure completely covered? And also &#x2013; and the next question is are you taking any steps to what do you call recover the loan in terms of say, negotiating with Dubai or perhaps even trying to force Dubai World into bankruptcy? Can you give us some color on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Kevin so, I would say completely covered, it's a pretty big statement, right. So you're never completely &#x2013; so I'll tell you what we've done. It is, as you know, I've said, our stance on provisions is normally very conservative, right. So, we &#x2013; and Sok Hui has a number, I don't know whether you showed it, 43% of our NPLs are actually current. Now that's a significant number, because in most cases company banks tend to move into NPL when the loan stops performing, right. That's the case, in Dubai World, Dubai World is current. So Dubai World is current, today they've been paying interest, interest is current. So theoretically speaking you won't have to have actually even move it into a non-performing category.</p>
          <p>And as best as we can tell, we've obviously, as you can imagine, we've checked around the world, as best as we can tell a lot of people, a lot of our competitors are unlikely to even be moving into &#x2013; it into a non-performing category. I can't say, that's too open, that's as best as we can tell, right.</p>
          <p>What we have done is recognized the loan as a non-performing loan, right. And so pretty much earlier than now. We've done that even though a lot of the visibility in the loan is actually quite positive, right. So as you know, with the Abu Dhabi bailout, all the Nakheel bonds, which came up in December got paid, right. And so there is a lot of concern at that time, that there would be a default in the bonds, there wasn't.</p>
          <p>Dubai World has appointed a full time Chief Restructuring Officer, who they hired from one of the consulting accounting firms, who is actively engaged with us as well as with the rest of the banks to figure out the right way to restructure the debts in the company. And so as best as any visibility is available, we are actually quite positive on the way the dialogue and the discussions are headed.</p>
          <p>That notwithstanding, we have chosen to be somewhat conservative and we have actually taken some provision for that exposure as well. But our balanced view is that that provision will be conservative.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...either, so does this mean you might divest other Islamic bank agreements, since your priority is actually now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you go back to &#x2013; I think it's a good question. If you look at our original strategic intent for Islamic bank and frankly for all of our Middle East businesses, it was really to serve as a link between the Middle East and Asia, right, as a gateway into Asia, frankly. And the thinking was, all of the Middle East wealth that is being created, if you can create an institution that serves a link from there to Asia, that would be a good thing. And frankly, that does not &#x2013; there's no change in that strategy.</p>
          <p>We still believe &#x2013; when I say we will not go into those areas, we still intend to service and be the gateway into Asia, because that speaks to our Asian Bank strategy. So to the extent that our Islamic bank business will allow us to focus on intermediating flows &#x2013; whether they're trade or capital flows, from the Middle East into Asia &#x2013; that's a good thing, and we hope to continue to be able to do that.</p>
          <p>What we might do is reorient our focus. So &#x2013; which is at the current point in time in addition to doing that, we've also been open to building out domestic presences in some of these countries and we will probably take a pass on that going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So our current &#x2013; our Singapore business itself is about 62 or 63% of our total business. Our Greater China business, if you add it up, is about 27-ish I would make it. So it's about &#x2013; between them, that's about 90% and then the rest of the stuff outside is about 10%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think our whole view &#x2013; and if I may just talk about it. The Asian presence, we have a general view that we really need to focus on making sure we're in the right cities. So it doesn't necessarily mean that you've got to be in every village in every sub town, right. And by and large, if we can figure and focus on 50 to 75 cities around the countries we talked about, we will have a very robust Asian presence. In Indonesia, we're really looking at eight or 10 cities that you need to be in to be a meaningful Indonesia-wide regional presence. And in some ways, we actually have a footprint now in &#x2013; what's it, Rajan? Eight? Ten cities. So we have a footprint now in ten cities.</p>
          <p>So we really don't need to expand our city presence. What we do need to do, which we will, is continue to build depth inside the cities. And how we build depth, we're open to several things. We can do branches, we can do sub-branches, we can do large outlets. So we're still working on the exact nature of what it would take to build the right penetration we need.</p>
          <p>Yes?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mayuko Tani from Nikkei. I'm just wondering if you have already started or you're going to start hiring the staff that you have trimmed down in the past couple of years. And if you do or if you plan on where &#x2013; how many altogether, and in which country and in what kind of business? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. I don't have an answer for you. Because that is work that we hope to be able to do over the next couple of months, which is actually &#x2013; take our strategic intent and then make it a little more granular to understand what kind of resourcing we need to put in different businesses and different countries.</p>
          <p>So in terms of exact hiring numbers by country, I can't &#x2013; I can tell you in general terms. It's quite obvious that we would hire pretty much across the board. We want to hire in China, we want to &#x2013; need to hire obviously here, we need to hire in Indonesia, so there will be broad-based hiring to support the businesses that we talked about, the key businesses that we want to grow and need to grow.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> advantage? And thirdly, are you looking at any sort of inorganic growth in India, since &#x2013; as you said organic growth was difficult and challenged because of the RBI regulations. So any acquisition targets, any private bank that you could be possibly looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly we'll just work backwards. If organic growth is difficult in India, inorganic growth is even more difficult in India. And that's because the RBI allows you to buy 5% maximum stake. So 5% stake is not a stake, right? So essentially at a 5% stake, you have a financial investor, you can't do too much more.</p>
          <p>So yeah, you could look at inorganic opportunities outside of pure banking, per se. But those really don't move the needle. So if the right thing comes along, yeah we'll look at it. So it's really in the short-term till the Indian government liberalizes a lot more, it will really be organic-focused.</p>
          <p>Now in the organic space, that correctly has been our biggest challenge. In India, we're permitted to open X number of branches. We have 10. I'll link it to your second question. One of the advantages we have is because of the Singapore-India FTA agreement, we've been allowed 10, and frankly we can go up to 16. We have put in applications for six more, so we have every aspiration of getting up to 16. The problem is those 16 all have to be in 16 different cities. Okay?</p>
          <p>And that becomes challenging, because if you want to build out a consumer presence, then one branch in a big city doesn't let you build out a consumer presence. So pretty much this is challenging, we're being directed in the short-term, so you're going to have to build out a corporate franchise, right? And you can do some affluent banking, which you can within this thing, but you really can't do mass scale consumer banking. And so the regulatory framework in India defines our strategy of what we can do.</p>
          <p>Now within that space, we've found &#x2013; as I mentioned before, the Indian market is very attractive. So in the corporate banking space &#x2013; and frankly maybe getting down into the mid-cap space, which is something we haven't done yet, but we aspire to &#x2013; there's a large and significant opportunity in India, in that space itself. As I said, it's been our fastest-growing business in the last three, five years, even.</p>
          <p>And so we have enough to do. Obviously, if the regulations change, then that will allow us to do a lot more than we're doing right now.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, one is about &#x2013; you've said that obviously &#x2013; technically, the Dubai World loan is still performing. But you have recognized that as a non-performing loan in taking some provisions. Why do you say that it's performing given that it's under standstill agreement, because they are not &#x2013; are they servicing the debt, how is that working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's what I meant. So the standstill means they're still servicing the debt. So which is how &#x2013; if you go back to thinking how banks define performing, as long as they haven't defaulted or got delinquent on any payment, then it's a performing loan. So far, they're not delinquent. They made the interest payments in December, was it? November, December whenever it was &#x2013; they made all their interest payments at the last payment time, so it's a performing loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Other question is about your plan to have 60% of revenue outside of Singapore in five years. We have heard about similar plans before, but it has not worked, because still Singapore accounts for 67% or roughly close to 70% of revenue. How would you do it organically? Because that's the most difficult part to do to grow your business to a certain level without buying anything.</p>

          <p>Goola from the Edge. Could we have some idea of the trends in loan growth in Singapore, and also net interest margins and the outlook for interest rates in Singapore? Because that affects your bank? And also, Mr. Gupta talked about rebalancing the balance sheet. What's your loan to deposit ratio now and what's your ideal loan to deposit ratio in terms of rebalancing the balance sheet? And then the last question is...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Goola, I won't remember all these questions at one time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, can you bring up the slide on our loan growth and then the one on our margins, so that we just refresh the data points for everyone to see. So you look at the loan growth for the DBS Group, our loans are up 2% on quarter and 3% on year. So it's been actually very steady growth and we actually increase our market share of single loans from 18% in 2007 to actually more than 20% currently. All right.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin, you'll find that it's been quite resilient and that has been possible only, because we actually have to actively manage both the assets as well as the liabilities. As you all know, DBS has a large pool of surplus deposits, which we actually place in inter-bank. Now with inter-bank lease at the record-low in 2009 of around just 12 basis points or so, you will find that actually deposit margins have actually suffered. But it has been made up for by better credit spreads on the loan side. So the picture going forward, if the interest rate is actually on an uptrend, actually it will be very positive for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Goola, let me give you some more color. On the loan growth in Singapore, in the overall business, loan growth in Singapore has been down. So it's actually been reducing and so, we've been able to grow share there. The consumer side, the loan growth have been positive and we've been able to hold share actually there. So our consumer loan growth was up, I guess nine or 13% on the market book.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>13% was the consumer loan growth, quite good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other question was on the loan to deposit ratio.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our loan to deposit ratio we have the number...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the loan to deposit ratio is currently at about 71%. So I think we need to do more and you've seen that we have been actually quite active in growing our loan base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have it now. You don't have to get there and then stop. We want to &#x2013; the only target you would have is a liquidity driven target, right. So, beyond a point in time, having a loan to deposit ratio, so if you get to 100% or 90% then you start worrying because do you have enough liquidity. We have just so much room and headway it doesn't really matter. So, I think we'd better improve that ratio.</p>

In your &#x2013; in the breakdown &#x2013; in your regional breakdown, last year, because you said earlier that Taiwan has made money, Taiwan &#x2013; a year ahead of expectations. But last year in the rest of Greater China, your net profit &#x2013; this is on page 14 of your results. You have 104, I think it must be a 104 million in net profit. But this year it seems to have fallen. Is that for the full year? Yes. And this year it seems to have fallen to 68 million for the rest of Greater China. What was that caused by?</p>

          <p>No, no that's not correct. In relative terms, China is still the larger contributor in that number. I was talking about growth rates.

        <plist>
          <p>Joyce you had question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just on capital raising, because you raised four billion of capital, what do you intend to do with the money? And on re-energizing Hong Kong, how do you intend to do it? I mean Hong Kong &#x2013; analysts have been talking that Hong Kong has been pretty disappointing. So, what do you intend specifically to do in Hong Kong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joyce, again, let me take the second question first. And frankly that's what I put up on my slide on what we need to do with Hong Kong. I really have nothing more to add than that. There is a customer segment view, there is a segmentation view and that is actually putting some more people in the country view. And frankly, in over time we can start figuring out more specific details, if you want.</p>
          <p>In terms of, what we want to do with the capital, one of the &#x2013; well there are two things, right. So one is, clearly the capital and my response to Sayed was over time we're going to have to find the right inorganic opportunities to put that capital to work. In the short term, there is one uncertainty, which we and every other global, every other bank faces, and that's the regulatory environment is changing rapidly on us. In fact it's one of the big uncertainties for 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>You saw in December the BIS came out with what people loosely call Basel III, which is a completely new set of recommendations. There is QIS out right now. So it's not clear what of those will actually go into effect. But if those do go into effect that will mean impact on the capital utilization of every bank, including us. So we might have to preserve some capital for that kind of stuff. And those are not the end of the capital regime; it is unclear whether there is going to be a global requirement for a minimum core capital requirement, right?</p>
          <p>So people are throwing numbers like nine, 10, 11, 12%. So if there is a regulatory framework which has a minimum core capital requirement, as well as potentially some of the Basel III kind of stuff starts going in, every bank in the world will have to be better capitalized than it has been traditionally. Now, we are lucky. Our Tier-1 ratio is already 13.1%, right. So it's unlikely that we would have to raise capital to do this and as you know the Chinese banks, the Japanese, they're all scrambling to raise capital, we don't need to do that. On the other hand, we might not have as much cushion as we think we do right now, if the capital rules change.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm Sam Holmes from Dow Jones Newswires. Can I just ask about I mean, are we likely to see NPL ratios go up much beyond, I'm talking about the group here, beyond 2.9 from herein? And second question, just talking about regulatory constraints. Is this the serious issue that you see in making any potential acquisitions? Or how serious is this for inorganic growth this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the NPL thing. Sam, the answer to that question is actually wedded in your take on the macro economy. Is the recovery a liquidity-driven recovery, or is there some real recovery out there? Which is why the markets have been spooked the last week or so, right? So people are unsure with the Chinese banks tightening and with all of the stuff. If there is only liquidity bounce and there is a continued downswing in the macro economy, obviously you're looking at a different kind of outlook.</p>
          <p>As best as I can say right now, I think our NPLs are pretty much peaked, all right, but that has to have a view on the economy, which I have, that there is some real growth out there and our economics and our research team is pretty bullish there, for if you look at the underlying growth in Asia, it's pretty clear that there's genuine consumer demand. And even in the U.S. the last couple of quarters, there's been positive consumption demand. So if predicated on that, our view is that the economic recovery is more than just liquidity filled. Obviously, liquidity plays a big part of that. And therefore, if you take that view, then I would say repeat and we should be headed down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the inorganic thing, frankly the regulatory thing, it's really the same thing I talked about right. The impact is really going to be how much of our capital, we have a significant capital buffer right now, right. And so if there are no regulatory change, we would have enough capital to be able to go out and do deals. If the regulatory environment changes, so a large part of our capital is now going to be allocated to our current businesses, then obviously we have to go and raise more capital to do this, right. It is not a problem because given the nature of the company at this time, we could raise capital quite easily. The markets are open and we would be able to price capital quite effectively if we really wanted to and needed to. So, I really don't see it is as a constraint on an inorganic growth if you wanted to get out and find the right opportunities.</p>

          <p>Yes, the question is about bonuses at DBS. Can you give us an indication of what its going to be like this year? And second, has DBS like changed its wage structure to more basic and less bonus in line with State Banks globally? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, first of all, I think our overall compensation for '09 will be better than it was in '08 and that reflects the overall results and the markets in general. I think you'll find across the world '09 compensation did better. Several global players, from what I can tell, sort of went back to peak levels of compensation. So I can tell you DBS is not at peak levels of compensation by a long shot, but it'll definitely be better than the '08 numbers. As a general philosophy, we are also trying to do a little bit of what the global industry is doing, which is rebalance the mix between variable and base. We are doing it because we got to align to where the market is. So we have done some of that, but again in our context the numbers are not huge. So they are not really very significant.</p>
