          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Investor Earnings Conference Call for the first nine months of 2010. For your information, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our performance for the first nine months of 2010, the outlook for the year and a preliminary outlook for 2011. I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk, and as usual with me I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and present are also our investor relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our home page, novonordisk.com, along with the slides that we'll be using for this conference call. The conference is scheduled to last approximately one hour. As usual we'll start with the presentation as outlined on slide number two. The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number three. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual result to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation. Also note that mentioned, this conference call is being webcast live, and a replay will be made available on Novo Nordisk's Web site after the call.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number four. We're very satisfied with the performance of the first nine months of this year. Sales growth in the first nine months was 17% reported and 12% in local currencies. The global sales growth is driven by the continued penetration of our modern insulins, NovoRapid, Levemir and NovoMix, and a solid Victoza launch performance.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, the key growth drivers have been North America and International Operations. With Victoza launched in Europe, North America and Japan, we are encouraged by the ongoing expansion of the GLP-1 class. Within R&amp;D we are happy to announce the results for trials with Degludec and DegludecPlus. The second of five Phase 3a trials with DegludecPlus, a new ultra-long-acting basal insulin with a bolus component, have now been completed. This trial confirms that DegludecPlus improves long-term glycaemic control and reduces hypoglycaemic event in people with type 2 diabetes when compared to NovoMix 30.</p>
          <p>The first of 12 Phase 3 trials with Degludec, a new ultra-long-acting basal insulin, has also been completed. The trial result shows that Degludec has the potential to offer dosing flexibility without compromising its glycaemic control or safety profile.</p>
          <p>For liraglutide marketed under the brand name Victoza for type 2 diabetes, an early obesity Phase 3a weight maintenance study showed that people treated with liraglutide following an initial run-in periods of 4 to 12 months -- 12 weeks, actually -- lost an additional six kilos compared to the placebo group.</p>
          <p>In haemophilia, we have completed a Phase 1 study with an ultra-long-acting recombinant factor IX derivative that potentially allows for once-weekly or less frequent dosing. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 1 study with a long-acting recombinant factor VIII derivative.</p>
          <p>Turning to financials, our gross margin improved 130 basis points to 80.8% during the first nine months of 2010. Operating profit grew 24% reported and around 15% in local currencies. We now expect sales growth in the range of 11 to 12% in local currencies compared to previously 9 to 10%, and operating profit growth in local currencies is now expected to be more than 15%, compared to previous guidance of 12 to 15%. And our preliminary plans for 2011 indicate close to 10% sales growth and a 10 to 15% operating profit growth, both in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five. Our portfolio of modern insulins continued to show strong performance overall. In the first nine months, the portfolio of modern insulins were the main growth drivers, accounting for more than 60% of total sales growth in local currencies. Sales performance reflects the steady and durable penetration of our modern insulins in an expanding market.</p>
          <p>Victoza sales reached DKK 1.366 billion in the first nine months, representing 27% of the sales growth this year in local currencies. NovoSeven sales grew 13% reported and 9% in local currencies. Sales of our growth hormone therapy product, Norditropin, increased 6% in local currencies, with all regions contributing to growth. Novo Nordisk is the second largest company in the global growth hormone market, with 25% market share measured by volume.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the regional split. In the first nine months, all regions contributed to growth measured in local currencies. North America was the main contributor, with 60% share of growth measured in local currencies, followed by International Operations and Europe. In local currency the sales in North America increased 21%. Sales growth was driven by strong performance of the modern insulins and Victoza. European sales grew 5% in local currencies driven by continued progress in the portfolio of modern insulins and solid performance of Victoza.</p>
          <p>Sales in International Operations increased 15% in local currencies, and here the main growth drivers were modern insulins, primarily in China. Sales growth in Japan continues to be impacted by a change in the underlying insulin market dynamics where growth of basal segment, in particular basal modern insulins, have accelerated at the expense of the premix segment, where Novo Nordisk has its strongest position.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven. In the United States Victoza's launch performance continues to be encouraging. We are now 38 weeks into the launch and Victoza has gained more than 35% of the GLP-1 market measured by total scripts. Since the launch of Victoza, the GLP-1 market has expanded measured both in volume and in value. In volume, the number of weekly prescriptions has grown more than 20%. In value, the GLP-1 market now constitutes more than 4.2% of the overall diabetes market, up from 3.2% immediately prior to the Victoza launch.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight. The Victoza launch in Europe is also solid. The GLP-1 class continues to increase its share of the diabetes care market, and Victoza has gained a significant share of the GLP-1 market. More recently the product has been launched in Italy.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Mads, who'll give you an update on the development within our clinical pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to slide nine. I'll start out with DegludecPlus, the fixed ratio of insulin Degludec and aspart combination product that targets several important patient segments, one of them being the premix segment that constitutes 30% of global insulin use. Within this segment, the Phase 3a treat-to-target study with DegludecPlus in people with late-stage type 2 diabetes has now been completed as part of the BOOST program.</p>
          <p>The trial was conducted in three continents and had multiple end points with emphasis on efficacy and safety, i.e., different measures of glycaemic control in hypoglycaemia. Patients were randomized to treatment with either DegludecPlus or NovoMix 30 twice daily for 26 weeks as add-on to oral antidiabetic therapy. DegludecPlus effectively improved long-term glycaemic control, achieving the primary objective of showing HbA1c noninferiority, with HbA1c decreasing by around 1.5 percentage points to 7.1 in both arms.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the study yielded a number of significant positive findings. Thus in terms of glycaemic control the patient's titration targets were achieved faster, and fasting as well as mean plasma glucose levels were lower for the DegludecPlus group compared to the NovoMix 30 group. Furthermore, the total daily insulin dose at study completion was lower in the DegludecPlus group than in the NovoMix 30 group. The rate of confirmed hypoglycaemia was statistically significantly reduced overall, and by more than two-thirds during the night for DegludecPlus compared to NovoMix 30.</p>
          <p>Participants treated with DegludecPlus gained on average slightly less weight than those in the comparator group. DegludecPlus demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile, and there were no apparent differences between the treatment groups with respect to adverse events and standard safety parameters.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 10. We've also completed the first Phase 3 Degludec study with focus on flexibility in day-to-day treatment. Thus today's basal insulins must be administered at the same time every day, implying that busy people, sporting people, kids, elderly, et cetera, have to adjust their lifestyle to the insulin treatment rather than the other way around, which obviously would be more desirable from a quality-of-life perspective. Based on this unmet need and piggybacking on the ultra-long half-life of Degludec, we decided a labeling study seeking to show that Degludec, when given once daily at various dosing intervals, was as safe and efficacious as insulin glargine given at 24-hour intervals according to the label.</p>
          <p>The 26-week controlled Phase 3a <mark type="inaudible" /> study in type 2 diabetes patients randomized the patients to one stage treatment with either Degludec in the evening, Degludec in a regimen with dose intervals between 8 and 40 hours, or insulin glargine given with 24-hour intervals according to the label. For all three treatment groups the insulin therapy was added to pre-existing oral antidiabetic therapy, if any.</p>
          <p>The primary objective of HbA1c non-inferiority for Degludec in the flexible dosing regimen compared to insulin glargine was confirmed, with HbA1c decreasing by 1.3 percentage points to around 7.2% in both treatment arms. There was no difference in HbA1c between the two Degludec arms. In the once-daily flexible dosing regimen, Degludec was statistically superior to insulin glargine in lowering the fasting glucose level.</p>
          <p>A trend towards the lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in both groups of participants treated with Degludec compared to participants treated with glargine. Degludec demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile, and there were no apparent differences between the treatment groups with respect to adverse events and standard safety parameters.</p>
          <p>Based on the above results, Degludec's ultra-long-action profile has now paved the road for a dosing scheme that is more flexible than for today's basal insulins through allowing daily administration of the insulin when it fits best into the individual's 24-hour life cycle without compromising on safety or efficacy.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11. Shifting gears to GLP-1 therapies now, liraglutide is currently, based on the Phase 2 obesity results published last year, in Phase 3 for weight management in obesity. It is our belief that future pharmaceutical treatment in this field should be seen as adjuvant therapy to behavioral modification that must include dietary and exercise counseling. To support this belief, the first Phase 3 study had a primary end point looking the ability of liraglutide to maintain a 5% weight loss induced by dieting.</p>
          <p>The study was double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of 56 weeks duration investigating treatment with three milligrams liraglutide daily as an adjunct to dietary counseling in obese people without diabetes who had already lost at least 5% body weight during a 4- to 12-week run-in period on a low-calorie diet.</p>
          <p>More than three out of four patients achieved a 5% weight loss during run-in, and the mean weight loss for the participants in the remaining trial was approximately six kilograms during run-in.</p>
          <p>The trial then randomized a total of 422 patients with an average body weight at randomization of approximately 100 kilograms. Participants treated for one year with liraglutide lost approximately six kilograms additionally compared to the placebo-treated group who maintained a stable body weight during the study period. During the treatment period beneficial effects were also observed on markers of metabolic and cardiovascular risk.</p>
          <p>Liraglutide was generally well tolerated, and the 56-week completion rate was 75% and 70% for the liraglutide and placebo groups, respectively. Withdrawals due to adverse events were below 10% and similar between the two groups. Consistent with previous liraglutide trials, the most common adverse events were related to the gastrointestinal system.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 12. Moving now to haemophilia, our portfolio is one which has evolved very significantly over the last couple of years to the extent that we now have two Phase 3, two Phase 2, and two Phase 1 programs ongoing. Today I will focus on promising recent results from our long-acting factor IX program. Using enzymatic site-specific GlycoPEGylation that provides release of the native coagulation protein human factor IX upon activation at the bleeding site, we have now completed a Phase 1 study in haemophilia B.</p>
          <p>The Phase 1 study showed the compound was well tolerated with a very long half-life, enabling IV infusion once weekly or less frequently. Compared to other factor IX molecules from which human data have been presented or published, that duration of action of the new molecule appears to be longer. And we've now conducted an inter-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. Based on this, we expect to initiate the Phase 3 haemophilia B program during the first half of 2011. Regulatory discussion with other agencies are, however, still ongoing.</p>
          <p>On another note, we likewise conducted inter-Phase 2 meeting on the ultra-fast-acting factor VIIa analogue in NN1731, and similarly we expect Phase 3 initiation during the first half of next year for NN1731.</p>
          <p>Finally, using the GlycoPEGylation technology described above, we are developing in Phase 1 a long-acting factor VIII compound for haemophilia B.</p>
          <p>Within growth hormone, Novo Nordisk has finalized a single-dose study in children with a long-acting growth hormone compound intended for once-weekly dosing. The study showed a good safety and tolerability profile, but a satisfactory once-weekly profile could not be achieved. Nordisk has thus decided to terminate the project.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk has initiated finally a Phase 2a study with a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody to obtain proof of principle in rheumatoid arthritis. Also, we have initiated a Phase 1 study with anti-IL-21 in-licensed last year from ZymoGenetics, a recombinant, fully human monoclonal antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>With that, over to Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to the next slide. We are satisfied with the financial results for the first nine months of 2010. The sales growth was 17% as reported and 12% in local currencies. Growth was realized within both diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals, and the primary growth contribution originated from the modern insulins and Victoza.</p>
          <p>The gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 increased to 80.8%, compared to 79.5 in the same period of 2009. This primarily reflects a favorable product mix impact due to increased sales of modern insulins and Victoza, supported by a 40-basis-point positive impact from the currency development.</p>
          <p>Total non-production-related costs increased by 18% to just over 22 billion. This development primarily reflects the cost associated with the global launch of Victoza impacting sales and distribution cost and the ongoing Phase 3 program for the next generation of insulins impacting the R&amp;D costs.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the first nine months of 2010 increased by 24% to 14.5 billion, up by around 15% measured in local currencies, reflecting the solid sales growth, the increased gross margin and a higher level of license fees. Net financial showed a net expense of close to 1 billion in the first nine months of 2010 compared to a net expense of around 700 million in the same period of 2009. The number of full-time employees has increased 4%, primarily reflecting the expansions in the markets in International Operations.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the currency development. This slide shows the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. Further, the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in our key invoicing currencies and the current extent of hedging for the same currencies are illustrated.</p>
          <p>During 2010 the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner have both been above the average levels of 2009. During the third quarter we have seen the U.S. dollar depreciate significantly against the Danish kroner, bringing the current exchange rate down to a level close to the average of 2009. Notably, though, the current exchange rate for U.S. dollar remains above the level in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Please note that the positive impact of the higher exchange rates during 2010 compared to 2009 on our operating profit to a large degree are countered by a loss on our hedging contracts, which is reflected in our net financials. For the first nine months of 2010 the foreign exchange result was an expense of 800 million, primarily caused by losses on foreign exchange hedging of U.S. dollar due to the appreciation versus the Danish kroner in 2010 compared to the exchange rate prevailing in 2009.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial outlook for 2010. Novo Nordisk now expects sales growth in 2010 of 11% to 12% measured in local currencies. This is based on expectation of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key strategic products within diabetes care, including continued global rollout of Victoza and biopharmaceuticals, as well as expectations of continued intense competition, generic competition to NovoNorm in the EU, and in the impact from the implementation of healthcare reforms, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is now expected to be around five percentage point higher than measured in local currencies. For 2010, growth in operating profit is now expected to be more than 15% measured in local currencies, primarily driven by increased growth expectations for sales. Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is now expected to be 10 percentage point higher than the one measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2010 Novo Nordisk now expects a net financial expense of around 300 million. The current expectations reflect expected losses on foreign exchange hedging contract and non-recurring income of approximately DKK 1.1 billion related to the divestment of shares in ZymoGenetics.</p>
          <p>The income related to divestment of Novo Nordisk share holding in ZymoGenetics is exempt from tax charges under applicable Danish tax laws. Consequently, the effective tax rate for 2010 is now expected to be around 21.5%. This non-recurring event will reduce the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is now expected to be more than 3 billion in 2010, primarily related to investments in new insulin formulation and filling plant in China and a new prefilled filling device capacity in Denmark. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are now around 2.6 billion, whereas free cash flow is now expected to be more than DKK 14 billion. The increase in the expected cash flow for 2010 is reflected in the announced expansion of the share repurchase program for 2010, with 1 billion to now DKK 9.5 billion.</p>
          <p>With regard to the financial outlook for 2011, it is Novo Nordisk's intention to provide detailed guidance on expectations in connection with the full-year release of financial results for 2010, which is scheduled for the 2nd of February 2011.</p>
          <p>At present, the preliminary plan for 2011 indicate close to 10% sales growth and 10 to 15% growth in operating profit, both measured in local currencies. The preliminary plans for the expectations for continued solid penetration of the portfolio of modern insulins, continued global rollout of Victoza, and progress for key product within biopharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p>The preliminary plans also reflect expected generic competition to all antidiabetic products, further impact from healthcare reforms and continued intense competition within both diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals. Due to an expected negative currency impact following the recent significant depreciation of Novo Nordisk's main invoicing currencies, the reported sale growth for 2011 is expected to be around two percentage point lower than the growth measured in local currencies, whereas the reported operating profit growth is expected to be around four percentage point lower than the growth measured in local currencies. The profit and loss effect of foreign exchange hedging contracts deferred for income recognition in 2011 when the hedged operating cash flows will be realized is currently expected to be approximately neutral.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectation are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly change the business conditions for Novo Nordisk during the remaining part of 2010 and in 2011, and that currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar, remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner during the remaining part of 2010 and in 2011.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results. Lars will now moderate the Q&amp;A session. Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question for today comes from Peter Hugreffe from ABG. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Peter Hugreffe. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Firstly just a clarification for your 2011 guidance. If I look into history then one could say that your preliminary guidance has been rather conservative or you can say a minimum level. Is that also the deal for your 2011 guidance, or is there anything that has changed in that context?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in terms of Degludec, Mads, I believe you previously have stated that most of the studies are, or at least all the studies, were powered for showing lower hypoglycaemic events at a range of 25% to 30%. Is this also the case with this BEGIN flex study? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. First question is on the 2011 guidance, and then Mads Krogsgaard, if you kindly take the Degludec question.</p>
          <p>Well, yes, I mean already being 14 months ahead of the closure of 2011, obviously there are some uncertainties and we would like to be cautious as usual. The main issues that are impacting our caution is of course the expectation of a continued penetration of our modern insulins and continued consistent rollout of Victoza, of course facing competition so that nothing is given there. Then we have the headwind that we are facing on healthcare reform full impact in the United States, which is going to double from the impact that we saw in 2010. We're also seeing full impact next year of healthcare reform throughout Europe, which is also going to double the impact.</p>
          <p>And then we have some uncertainties around when we will see a final genericization of Prandin in the United States. We've made certain assumptions. They could change, and so therefore that has been factored into the picture as well. So this gives a relatively conservative estimate. But if we take out the uncertainties, I would say it's a quite a bold projection in the sense that if we take the negatives out that I just mentioned, it would indicate a guidance for 2011 of a growth in sales of 13% to 15%.</p>
          <p>Mads, Degludec powering for hypoglycaemia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much for that question, Peter. First of all, I'd like to shed a little bit of light on the beginner BOOST programs. In total, as you know, there're about 17 trials, 12 on Degludec and five on DegludecPlus. And out of those in totality most are indeed powered for hypoglycaemia as an end point. This one is an outlier in that regard inasmuch as this is a highly specific study designed for one single purpose, namely utilizing the long half-life of Degludec to prove the point that you can actually live a more -- or live with a more flexible dosing scheme because of the ability to use the product maybe one day in the morning, one day in the evening, the day after midday, whenever it suits into your lifestyle, even if you are forgetful or doing sports or whatever you're doing. So this particular trial is designed differently and that among other things includes the inclusion of sulfonylureas into the study. So among the BEGIN and BOOST trials in only two cases have we included sulfonylureas.</p>
          <p>And why do we have 15 out of 17 studies without sulfonylureas? Well, the reason being that when you want to look for hypoglycaemia you want to have a leveled playing field, and a level playing field would mean that you compare one insulin up against other insulin and then you look for hypoglycaemia rates in those two regimens. What we have here is a big population of which about half are taking sulfonylureas, and that also means that the signal-to-noise ratio has been significantly blurred vis-&#xE0;-vis hypoglycaemia.</p>
          <p>So if you compare, for instance, to the Phase 2 study where issues were not in limit we had a hypo rate on Degludec of 0.6 per patient year and 1.1 for glargine per patient year. In this study it was above three, and that really reflects that we have a three- to four-fold increase in the risk of hypoglycaemia in this study and that it is indeed driven by the sulfonylurea use, so that we have blurred the signal to noise statistically in a way that doesn't make it meaningful to measure hyperglycemia statistics.</p>
          <p>Yet we do see a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycaemia, even in the group where the dose was administered Monday, Wednesday, Friday early in the morning, and Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday late in the evening. I.e., the patients on some days would have 40 hours between the dosing and on some days only eight hours because they had an overnight sleep. In spite of that we actually saw a numeric reduction in nocturnal hypoglycaemia.</p>
          <p>So to -- the short answer to your question is, Peter, that most of the remaining studies -- they are designed for hypoglycaemia, most importantly the ones that are of one-year duration because that allows us to take the A1c down to seven, which it was not quite clear, and also including large number of patients, so you can even go for statistical superiority on some of the subgroups of hypoglycaemia, and then inclusion of patients who are not taking sulfonylureas so that you have level playing field to measure for -- hypoglycaemia from.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead. Hello, your line is now open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry; Henrik Simonsen, Enskilda; sorry. Two questions, Lars. We had two major events impacting on your business shown long-term last week and also on share price quite significantly. I was wondering if you could add a little bit of comment to the Pfizer-Biocon, biosimilar agreement last Monday. What is most important, significant negative you would see come out of that if that were to come into the market some time later?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was noting in your side pack this morning you had like 12% of patients on Victoza U.S. coming from Byetta. Now that Bydureon is pushed further out, I would assume that some of the patients on Byetta have been kept on Byetta in anticipation of getting on to Bydureon. Should we expect a pickup in patients diverting from Byetta on to Victoza or could you comment a little bit on that, how you see that panning out in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. Let me start by reflecting a little bit on the announcement for Pfizer and Biocon. This in a way is nothing new to most of us that are on this call in the sense that there has always been an issue that at a certain point in time there would be patent run-out on the modern insulins. Patents have run out on human insulins and we have been completing for years with the Biocon group in India and in other overseas markets in a number of years. And they have been, if I should diplomatic, modestly successful in competing with us. They have a market share in India which is less than 10% based on their current capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, obviously by popping up with the world's greatest pharmaceutical company, what they do get is they get market reach; they get market understanding in the key developed markets. But as we understand the current collaboration agreement, it is upon Biogen to do the clinical development and the regulatory approvals of eventual new modern insulin biosimilars in the developed markets. And that of course is still somewhat of a deficiency in the sense that they have not been so successful in doing so historically.</p>
          <p>There are issues also, when we reflect on this, of scope. Biocon, as I mentioned, has a relatively modest market share and modest capacity. To be a real substantial player in big markets like Europe and United States we would need to see a significant expansion of their capacity. This is going to pose some execution risks in terms of expanding manufacturing and doing it in a way which is quality-wise and compliance-wise acceptable to European and to American authorities.</p>
          <p>So we've now got a name on the competitors, one of the competitors, but we have always anticipated that there will be competitors. We've always anticipated that, for instance, sanofi-aventis is going to defend their LANTUS franchise, so they probably will be selling a genericized version of LANTUS as well. So there's nothing really new in it for us. It only highlights the importance of the next generation of modern insulins that we have been working so hard on, and that's why it was of course gratifying that we were able to, at the same release that this took place, to give the first data on these two compounds.</p>
          <p>And adding to that that we are also working on a fast-acting version of the rapid-acting segment which is currently served by NovoRapid. We are clinically working on an even faster formulation which may actually offer a unique product when and if our patents, which includes formulation patents, for NovoRapid expires in 2017. So that was the comment on the Pfizer agreement.</p>
          <p>With regards to uptake of Victoza as a result of the Bydureon postponement, one can of course speculate whether or not that's going to have an impact. We have internally adjusted our internal targets which has been included in the guidance that we have given you to reflect the fact that we are not seeing competition from Bydureon. However, we are not anticipating a larger shift rate than what you're seeing currently, somewhere in the range of 10 to 15%. We are hoping to expand the market and that's what we're working on. Obviously by not having a full force of Lilly and Amagen out there, that is going to be a more difficult task. So not major changes in terms of pickup and conversions from Byetta.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I've <mark type="inaudible" /> It's actually <mark type="inaudible" /> from Goldman Sachs and thanks for taking my question. I have two, if I may. First, just following up on the previous question of kind of a Pfizer Biocon deal, you obviously spoken about the lack of existing excess manufacturing capacity at Biocon. But Biocon obviously has spoken about them using the cash that they receive from Pfizer to the tune of about 200 to $300 million to set up a new -- sorry -- to set up a new manufacturing capacity. On your estimates, kind of can you provide us your perspective how much of the world global insulin demand could earn a CapEx spend of that amount provide?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the study for liraglutide in obesity, you said -- you have suggested that the primary end point was maintenance of the weight loss. Can you help us understand how to think about the six-kilo weight loss on liraglutide versus placebo, because kind of largely flat? Is that statistically non-inferior? Is that statistically significant? How should we think about that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And Mads, you will prepare for the question on obesity. I just make a sort of brief comment as much as I can on how Biocon anticipate to use the cash in-flow they got from the Pfizer deal. I would rather say that it -- if you want specific answers on how that will enable them to service the global market, you should of course ask them. But I would say, though, that we had previously when we had been talking in more generic terms about the barriers to entry to the insulin business, we've spoken about the very high capital cost of getting into the business, exemplifying that by saying that in our estimations if you want to have a sizable operation, you need to invest somewhere between $300 and $500 million in off-stream manufacturing of active ingredients. You need to have an investment of approximately the same size in downstream formulation and filling. And then finally, either you make devices yourself or you have to partner and pay for the development of specific devices for your need. And then after that comes of course the clinical and regulatory approval of the product and launch. So, as you can appreciate, even though 200 to $300 million is a lot of money, it's a far cry from enabling Biocon to become a global player in one go.</p>
          <p>Mads, lira and obesity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, it's important to notice that this study is not a classical regulatory obesity study, in that what we've done here is actually had a running period, as you -- as I mentioned, in which people over max 12 weeks on a hypocaloric diet should lose at least 5% body weight. More than 75% did so and they were then eligible for randomization up to 56 weeks of treatment with either placebo in a blinded manner or liraglutide. And essentially six kilograms of weight was lost pre-randomization -- that is from 106 kilos to 100 kilos -- and a further six kilograms were lost during the lira treatment down to about 94 kilos. So in total people went 12 kilograms down in a time span of about a year and a quarter.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of the weight loss for liraglutide compared to placebo, it was indeed highly statistically significant, and the amount who achieved a 5% weight loss on top of the running period weight loss was more than twofold that of the placebo, and the arch ratio for actually meeting a 5% baseline body weight loss was about four in favor of lira. So there were actually three composite primary end points. There was the body weight maintenance, there was the change from baseline and there was the proportion who lost at least 5%. And in each case the p-value in favor of superiority had several naughts in front of it before there was another digit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard Vosser from J P Morgan. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, going back to Victoza and the impact of the delay to Bydureon, just wondering what -- if you could give us the details of what you think for 2010 your Victoza sales would be? I think previously you've spoken about $200 million.</p>
          <p>And then I think I've seen comments that you think you can reach blockbuster status by 2012. I think previously that was around about 2015. So if you could give us an idea of your new or updated long-term expectations for Victoza, that would be great?</p>
          <p>And probably the second question, also on Victoza. I was just wondering if you could help us with the split in terms of the U.S. and rest of world split yet with Victoza. The launches obviously in Europe looked as though they're going pretty well, so I'm wondering if you could give us some help there? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; thank you very much. Jesper, why don't you kick off the estimates for this year and perhaps reiterate your comment and projections on when we believe that Victoza will come a blockbuster. And then we will revert to sort of broad numbers on split between Europe and U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. The delay in the approval of Bydureon of course gave us clarity in making predictions on the sales volumes of Victoza both for 2010 where we, with the 700 million in sales in the third quarter and no significant pipeline filling involved in that number; have a clear indication of a sale for 2010 which is going to be slightly above DKK 2 billion.</p>
          <p>And also having clarity on the U.S. market providing more than half of the value of overall Victoza sales, we now feel comfortable in saying that Victoza will develop into a blockbuster product by 2012. Giving predictions beyond the development of Victoza over and beyond 2012 will have to wait how the competitive situation is going to look in the years beyond 2012. But the blockbuster status by 2012 seems to be a safe indication now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you, Jesper. You actually answered both questions in one, because you indicated that about two-thirds of the sales is in the U.S. and approximately a third in Europe. So well done; two in one. Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; good afternoon. Two questions, please. First, could you give us some regulatory and development update on the haemostasis portfolio and mostly for the factor XIII? When could we see some data and when do you expect the filing for this one? And also on the factor VIII, on data whether we can see or read something in the course of next year?</p>
          <p>And the second question. Do you already commit yourself to a new share buyback program for 2011, and would it be fair to assume a similar amount to the one seen in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mads, the haemostasis pipeline, factor XIII and factor VIII filing data and what are the next -- the milestones that you are foreseeing? And then, Jesper, on the share buyback expectations for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, as regards the pre-BLA, i.e., biologics license application as we call it with the CIBA, that we have for factor XIII, this is moving towards the later phases of preparation, i.e., doing all the process validation and the things that you need to have in good order before we submit. So it is still our anticipation to submit in the first half of next year the factor XIII dossier for congenital deficiency. As you are aware we will also during the first half of next year have proof of concept data for cardiac surgery for the same molecule.</p>
          <p>Novo VIII is still recruiting, and it's too early to give a precise indication of when the submission will be, but I can inform you that we are targeting submission of the fast-acting factor VII analogue, NN1731, that is destined to start Phase 3 also during the first half of next year in advance of any potential entrant, at least outside of Russia, in regards of biosimilars factor VII or factor VII analogues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mads, any data on when we'll see data on factor XIII to keep the profile up <mark type="inaudible" /> and factor VIII, if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Yes, the factor XIII data will be announced at a haemostasis conference over the next 12 months. We think it's very prudent that the data which are very strong even though they compare to historic controls, that they come out well in advance of the launch so that the physicians know exactly what they have in their hands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesper, the share buyback expectations going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've continued a policy of returning whatever excess cash we are generating to our shareholders over and beyond the just over 40% in payout ratio that we return in terms of dividend. We have returned that in the form of share repurchase program. And you have seen us when we get a non-recurring cash flow like the ZymoGenetics cash flow, then we also return that in the form of a share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>So for 2011, although we haven't yet had the discussion with our board on the exact amounts, et cetera, I think it's safe to assume that we will continue with a payout ratio in terms of dividend which is aligned to where we see the general pharma industry at a level of 40%-plus in payout ratio, and then we will continue to combine that with a new share repurchase program, and the exact amount of that will be aligned with our expectation for cash flow, free cash flow generated in 2011, and we will announce that on 2nd of February.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I also have two questions. First with respect to gross margin, now Victoza is apparent developing much better than you previously expected and also the price in U.S. has been on average been quite handsome to you. What kind of impact should we now actually expect from the gross margin for 2010 to 2012 just for Victoza alone, everything else being equal?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, now we have seen of course a setback with the Tesco and the delay of Bydureon, and even you have failed with a long-acting growth hormone. Have that put any thoughts into your mind with the once-weekly Victoza and semaglutide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Martin. Jesper, gross margin predictions of what impact Victoza is going to yield given the pricing situation and given the handsome launch and how that is impacting our margin picture right now. Then, Mads, any thoughts on long-acting versions of proteins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Martin, as you are aware we have given quite clear guidance in terms of how our growth margin will develop this year and I think the guidance we're giving of an underlying improvement in the ballpark of 100 basis point is still one that you can safely trust for 2010. We are guiding to the level of 50 to 100 basis point in effect for 2011 and we still think that is a relevant one. We certainly have a more positive impact from -- a higher mix impact from higher share of Victoza sales. On the other hand, as Lars alluded to in his review, the impact from U.S. healthcare reform is also slightly bigger than what we previously anticipated.</p>
          <p>And then making statements about 2012 is getting tricky in terms of impact on gross margin as a number of factors are influencing that. But saying currencies are the same and assuming no significant additional impact from healthcare reforms, I think it would be safe to say when we look at 2012 that we will have a high probability of being able to continue to expand our gross margin in the ballpark of 50 to 100 basis points also in '12, everything else being equal. But it is a lot of equals that has to stay the way they are and life is probably not going to be that good, but that's the best guidance I can give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper. And then, Mads, your thoughts on long-acting proteins as opposed to various efficient daily administration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, Martin, excellent question. Now you mentioned three. You mentioned Tesco, Bydureon and our own long-acting growth hormone. They are actually three very different cases, so you cannot generalize here. Terms of Tesco, this was actually a protein with a built-in -- or actually two built-in unnatural amino acids put into a sustained release formulation that stayed under the skin for more than one week. Together that created a hypersensitivity problem and also some GI side effects. So that's a specific Tesco thing.</p>
          <p>Then with Bydureon, it was to my knowledge two other factors that came into play in the complete response letter. One was some clinical safety constraints, i.e., the QTC testing demand from the FDA, and the other one was a CMC concern, i.e., that they had done the duration one study with the pilot-scale formulation and not a commercial-scale formulation. So those are Bydureon-specific issues.</p>
          <p>And if you look at our long-acting growth hormone preparation, it was a pegylated version. But what actually happened here is that in the kids where we've just finished a study we were simply not able at the clinically relevant doses to document -- as we had previously, by the way, done in adults --that we actually had indeed week-long elevations of the biomarker IGF-1. Henceforth, we didn't meet the target product profile, so that failed for a third reason.</p>
          <p>So, Martin, in all honesty, you cannot generalize as to once-weekly destinies, but I would concur with my boss Lars that when you have a once-daily product such as Victoza that doesn't rely on sustained release technologies and doesn't include unnatural amino acids, you're at least having a pretty safe bet.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Carsten from Carnegie. Just couple of questions here. If you look at the underlying market growth in the U.S. diabetes market and that is excluding Victoza, it seems that the growth is slowing a bit down. Could you give us a couple of comments on that and how you plan to attack this?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if we look at Victoza and where the patients are coming from, 20% of patients are coming from insulin, the way you mentioned it today. Giving the strong launch and this rather significant numbers where you probably reach in 2011, what do you think the impact will be on your insulin analogue and human insulin franchise from the strong Victoza launch? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'd prefer, Mads, if you would comment on the insulin switches first, and then we're going to revert with our comments to the U.S. growth perspective in diabetes exclusive of the GLP-1 segment. Mads, insulins switches is a complicated matter and then a somewhat hazardous enterprise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's very important to notice here that the reason why people add GLP-1 therapy to insulin is not to discontinue insulin therapy. Rather what they do is they lower the insulin consumption somewhat, i.e., equivalent to the GLP-1 that is then substituting for that insulin, and the benefits gained being less hypoglycaemia and less weight gain plus maybe certain other benefits. So what we are seeing is not a switching, but surely the fact that people have been insulin-sparing effect of adding the GLP-1. And if you consider the sheer volumes of patients that today are on insulin therapy and the fact that they are not switched but rather have an insulin-sparing effect, this is a rather minute thing we're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mads, for that clarification. And then as regards to the U.S. growth in the insulin market, so excluding Victoza, our numbers indicates that it is relatively stable and it's relatively high; it's around 6.5% to 7% throughout, and we're talking here net numbers throughout the last 12 months. So there's no changes as far as we can see it.</p>

          <p>Yes; thank you very much. The first question deals with how much is the script data coming from PCPs and from endos in the United States. It's about two-thirds that are coming from the PCPs and one-third which is coming from the endo. It is obvious from our launch brands that we are starting with the endos and we are in the position right now where we are working with managed care organizations to have a similar tier as Byetta, meaning that the products are not necessarily have to have prior authorization. That is a question of rebates and negotiations of pricing with managed care in the U.S. When we launched the product we did not offer any rebates. We are now negotiating with managed care to change our pricing status with these organizations, and that should benefit prescribing from the PCPs going forward if there -- the PCPs are largely attached to these major managed care organizations.</p>
          <p>And the second question was the withdrawal of human insulin in the UK. Obviously withdrawal of products in the insulin market is always met with apprehension on the part of the patients as patients -- and this also shows how conservative the insulin market is -- are very unlikely to change. And therefore when we do withdrawals we usually try to announce this in very long time perspective. We try to deal with the authorities to make the withdrawal in a safe fashion. We deal with patient associations, and then we get the withdrawal done with as little impact as possible.</p>
          <p>We have not seen any noticeable loss of our market share in the UK as a result of this, but there has been some PR pushback, if you say so. But this is to be anticipated. Human insulins are available in the UK market from other vendors, and what we do have to do is we have to refer the patients that are insisting on staying on human insulins, that they can procure other variants of insulin as opposed to the Novo Nordisk product. That's a sad reality; people want to stay on products when we withdraw, but no major impact.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Next question, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you, gentlemen, for taking my questions. Just a question on the R&amp;D expenditure. It seems sort of like looking at the cost margin level is sort of going a little down. I'm just wondering if the, sort of the amount level like the 2302 you just reported for this quarter -- is this sort of the level we're going to expect going forward or are you still sort of looking to a -- I believe Jesper mentioned the Q1 presentation and then there around 16% cost margin, even a little higher. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And just on the weight losses we're seeing with liraglutide, I'm just wondering the sort of approximately six kilograms referred to as the weight loss. There's sort of a little sort of blurred, I think, to say that. What is -- can you shed a little light over the confidence intervals are around these six kilograms, because I assume that's against the approximately 100-kilogram average we saw before they started. That brings it above the 5% sort of the magic border for -- in this area, if you could help me with that. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. With regard to the first question, the R&amp;D expense, I'd better give this question to Jesper because otherwise Mads Krogsgaard will tell you that the expenses are going up significantly, because he really wishes that they would do that. So to get a unbiased qualified answer you should probably get Jesper Brandgaard on that one. And then Mads can come back on the weight loss. Yes, Jesper?</p>

          <p>It is great. When you look at the quarter alone we are only reaching in reported numbers a level of around 15% and that's of course below the 16% that we were hoping for. We have been kind of impacted by having a high portion of our overall R&amp;D cost located in Danish kroner. And the ramp-up of the Leader trial is happening in the third quarter and of course going into the full phase trial as we get into the fourth quarter. So you should anticipate that our overall ratio will increase as we get to full year, but the currency impact is bringing it a little bit down. In the third quarter alone you had a positive 80-basis-point impact on the ratio solely coming from currencies.</p>

          <p>Okay; thank you, Jesper. And then, Mads, weight loss.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, indeed, interesting question. If you look at the bisection out between the weight loss curve from lira treatment compared to the blinded placebo treatment, you see already that after two weeks the standard errors of the means are by no means overlapping and neither are the standard deviation. So the bisection out happens already within the first fortnight after onset of therapy and increases up to and including the first half-year where after we have more or less parallelism between the two lines suggesting that the difference between the curves is maintained over time. Not surprisingly, upon cessation of therapy after 56 weeks we of course do see some weight increase, as expected again.</p>

          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately the hour has passed 2 o'clock in Denmark and our investor team has to go for an investor presentation in Copenhagen. So we apologize. We have to close this exciting meeting. We thank you for listening in and we are looking forward to come back to you next year on the 2nd of February with a full year result and with guidance for 2011. Thank you.</p>
