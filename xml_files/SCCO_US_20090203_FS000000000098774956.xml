          <p>Thank you very much, Rebecca. And thank you everyone again for joining us for the fourth quarter 2008 Southern Copper results conference call. Participating in today's conference we have Genaro Guerrero, Southern Copper's CFO.</p>
          <p>Mr. Guerrero will now lead the conference.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ra&#xFA;l. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation fourth quarter '08 and final year 2008 results conference call. Today I will comment on Southern Copper production sales, operating costs, financial results, and capital expenses. After that we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>As we all know, the world economic recession has severely impacted commodity prices. Copper has deteriorated sharply. The LME 2008 fourth quarter average copper price was $1.77 per pound, lower by 46% than the $3.26 per pound average for the same quarter of 2007, and 49% lower than the third quarter of 2008. In fact, 2008 ended with an LME copper price of $1.32 per pound.</p>
          <p>Major drivers for cooling copper prices are demand contracting and inventory build-up. We expect both of them to prevail for at least the first half of the &#x2013; of 2009. However, we also believe that demand will stop declining and start growing at certain point close to mid-2009 after China and other major consumer finish their destocking process. The demand recovery will certainly depend on how fast the global economy turns around again to growth.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, several copper producers have announced production cuts for approximately 100,000 metric tons in 2009. Additionally, there are still several operating units worldwide that have higher cash <mark type="inaudible" /> market prices. As the new low price scenario sets in, we expect some additional announcements of mine closures for 2009 that will help to balance the market.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper fourth quarter '08 copper production was 125,000 tons, 1% lower than the fourth quarter of 2007, but 6% higher than the third quarter '08. Regarding our copper smelting and refining production, in the fourth quarter 2008, such production was 29% and 26% higher than in the fourth quarter 2007, mainly due to 7% higher concentrates production at La Caridad mine, processing a third-party concentrate at La Caridad smelter, and the full capacity production of our Ilo smelter plant after the conclusion of its modernization in August 2008.</p>
          <p>Taking advantage of the first major maintenance for this plant, we made some operational adjustments that will allow the plant to process 1.2 million tons of copper concentrates; that is a 20% increase in the smelting rate. We expect copper production and sales to be approximately 470,000 tons for the full year of 2009. Please note that in our production guidance, we're not going to consider the Cananea, San Mart&#xED;n, and Taxco operations due to the current labor stoppages that we have in such operations. If we were to do that, we should have approximately 15,000 metric tons of additional copper production per month of operation at full capacity.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum prices were $14.60 per pound for the fourth quarter 2008, 54% lower than the fourth quarter 2007. The molybdenum price at the end of 2008 was $9.50 per pound. Molybdenum production was 4,029 tons and 16,390 tons in the fourth quarter '08 and the year '08 respectively compared with the 4,261 tons and 16,207 tons in the comparable 2007 periods. The annual increase of 1.1% was due to higher ore grade at La Caridad mine and higher recovery at Cuajone mine partially offset by lower ore grade at the Toquepala operations. Moly production and sales plan for 2009 are 17,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Regarding zinc, in the fourth quarter 2008 price averaged $0.54 per pound, 55% lower than the fourth quarter 2007. The year-end zinc price was $0.51 per pound. Zinc mine production in the fourth quarter '08 increased 6.7% to 27,706 tons compared with the 25,964 tons in the fourth quarter 2008 &#x2013; 2007, excuse me. Refined zinc production for the year 2008 was 95,420 tons, 5.1% higher than in the year 2007. The company expects to sell 98,000 tons of zinc during 2009.</p>
          <p>In respect of silver, silver prices in the fourth quarter 2008 averaged $10.15 per ounce, 29% lower than the fourth quarter 2007. The 2008 year-end price of silver was $11.27 per ounce. Silver mine production in the fourth quarter 2008 increased 2% to 3.1 million ounces compared with the 3 million in the fourth quarter 2007. Refined silver production for the year of '08 was 10.8 million ounces, 8% higher than the year 2007, due to the recovery of full capacity at the San Luis Potosi refinery. Company expects to sell 16 million ounces of silver in 2009.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper sulfuric acid production during the fourth quarter 2008 was 473,000 tons, 22% more than the fourth quarter 2007, due to the better smelting performance of the Ilo and La Caridad smelters. For the full year 2008, the company produced 6% more sulfuric acid than in 2007.</p>
          <p>Please note that 18% of the total production is consumed by our Southern Copper Corporation SX-EW and leaching processes. Our full year sulfuric acid production guidance for 2009 is 1,500 tons. As I already mentioned during the last quarter, we had a dramatically drop in metal prices that has severely affected our fourth quarter 2008 results.</p>
          <p>Following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the terms and conditions on our sales contracts, Southern Copper Corporation has a portion of its sales provisionally priced using the forward prices in the case of copper and the last available report for molybdenum concentrates. These provisional price sales are finally adjusted using the average price in subsequent periods.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we recorded a negative provisionally priced adjustment of $409 million for such open sales. This figure compares to a negative provisional price adjustment of 67 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2007. The estimated adjustment on open sales is recorded on their net sales and the provisional price metal volume sold for copper and molybdenum are disclosed in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs.</p>
          <p>Net sales for the fourth quarter were $450 million compared to the $1,295 million for the fourth quarter 2007. Fourth quarter 2008 sales without the already mentioned price adjustments were $859 million. This figure compares to $1,361 million for the fourth quarter 2007. Copper volume sold increased by 4.4% when comparing fourth quarter '08 with its 2007 equivalent. Molybdenum volume sold increased by 1.3% for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>Additionally, during the fourth quarter 2008, we held 30,000 tons of copper derivative contracts with average prices of $3.40 per pound of copper. In the fourth quarter 2008, we have gains recorded in net sales of $74 million and $137 million gain for the full year 2008 for such derivatives.</p>
          <p>Total operating cost for fourth quarter '08 was $581 million. This figure compares with the cost of $663 million in the fourth quarter 2007 or $764 million in the third quarter of 2008. The cost reduction from the third quarter through the fourth quarter 2008 of $183 million is explained by the following variances.</p>
          <p>Fuel cost decrease of $6 million; $30 million in power cost reduction, mainly due to lower tariff at the Peruvian operations; third-party copper purchases decreased by 48 million as a result of lower metal prices; and other cost reductions of $96 million, including workers profit sharing and mining royalties.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter 2008 EBITDA was negative $49 million. This figure compares with $712 million for the fourth quarter 2007. EBITDA without price adjustments was $327 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, equivalent to 38% of sales. These figures compares with an EBITDA of $773 million or 57% of net sales for the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>The company's fourth quarter 2008 cash cost per pound of copper produced before byproduct credits was $1.50 per pound, $0.06 lower than the $1.56 per pound for the same period of 2007, and $0.52 lower than the $2.02 per pound in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The company operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct credits, was $1.17 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2008. Byproduct credits were affected by the adjustments necessary to write-down provisionally priced molybdenum sales. The impact of this write-down reduced the byproduct credits by approximately $0.61 per pound. Excluding the effect on this adjustment, the company estimates that the operating cash cost in the fourth quarter 2008 would have been $0.56 per pound.</p>
          <p>Net earnings in the year 2008 totaled $1,407 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.60 compared with the 2,260 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.51 in the year 2007.</p>
          <p>Net loss in the fourth quarter 2008 totaled $125 million or diluted loss per share of $0.14 compared to the net earnings of 311 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.85 in the fourth quarter 2007. Not considering the effect of sale adjustments, fourth quarter '08 net earnings would have been $130 million. The equivalent 2007 figure would have been $353 million.</p>
          <p>All of our capital projects have been suspended temporarily or are under close review. The company believes this is a responsible action to take considering the current economic downturn, and also it is prudent at this time to preserve cash in response to low metal prices and improving cost of capital equipment. As a consequence, the company have decided to reduce its expected 2009 budget from over $1 billion to $415 million including explorations, which represents the minimum investments the company will maintain in 2009 to be ready to move forward when circumstances improve.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper Corporation will continue with environmental projects at its mining and metallurgical facilities and will move toward completion of some smaller projects with a short payback and good returns.</p>
          <p>In respect of Tia Maria project, Southern Copper has expended $180 million through December 2008, and currently is awaiting whether to book this project or hold or to slowdown the standing in light of the current market conditions.</p>
          <p>As of December 31, 2008, we have expensed $38 million for the Toquepala expansion. We are continuing with the feasibility study, as well as the basic and detailed engineering. The environmental impact assessment is also underway and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>The company has decided to put on hold any new additional capital expenditures regarding this project. For the Cuajone expansion project, we have signed a feasibility study contract and will only continue at this point with the engineering and the environmental impact assessment.</p>
          <p>Regarding maintenance and replacement capital, the company is budgeting $81 million for this concept for the year 2009. By taking the mentioned actions, the company believes it will be able to take advantage of more reasonable capital equipment costs in the future aligned with the current sales expenses.</p>
          <p>About Cananea strike, in December 2008, the Mexican Federal Labor Court moved in favor of the company and declared the Cananea strike illegal. The union appealed this decision and on January 7, the judge of the Fifth District on Labor Matters annulled the decision favorable to the company. The company has filed a request to review this judge decision, and we'll maintain the corresponding legal process to review such decision and continue pursuing a positive resolution of the work stoppage.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, I would like to remind that it is the company policy to review at each Board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources, and expected future cash flow generation from operations, in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividends. Accordingly on January 29, 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend of $0.117 per share to be paid on March 30, 2009 to shareholders of record as of March 11, 2009.</p>
          <p>In addition, as part of the 500 million share repurchase program approved by the Board in 2008, Southern Copper have purchased 29.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $13.52 per share. With these repurchases the outstanding shareholders have increased their stake in the company by around 3.5%.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us. And we would like to open the forum for questions. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to make sure I heard the correct &#x2013; copper guidance correctly, you did state that you would be missing some 15,000 tons, I believe, per month, and then you named various mines, could you just recap that, and in summary, I just need to know what is your baseline guidance for 2009 for copper production and also for molybdenum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jorge. The 15,000 metric tons of additional copper production per month is basic &#x2013; would be basically Cananea production at full capacity. Then again we are not considering that production and our guidance for 2009 is 470,000 tons for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other mines, San Mart&#xED;n and Taxco -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did I hear that correctly, it's 4-1-7?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 4-7-0.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, 4-7-0. Okay. Thank you. And for molybdenum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For molybdenum, it's 1-7, 17,000 tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could you talk a little bit about unit costs? Obviously the calculation of the unit costs was affected in the fourth quarter by all the provisional pricing net backs, but roughly speaking based on what you quoted being the fourth quarter net cash cost of about $0.56, where would you see net unit costs going, holding molybdenum prices constant and knowing what you know about your predicted production for 2009? How much more do you think you can get that unit cost down on a percentage or a cents per pound basis in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jorge, for 2009, we are expected to get a cash cost of around $0.60 per pound. This is considering &#x2013; or we are calculating that considering an EBITDA of $1.2 billion for the year using a copper price of $1.75. And this is &#x2013; and that is very close to the 56.8 or $0.57 per pound that we got in the fourth quarter 2008, if we exclude the adjustment that we recorded during that quarter for adjustment in prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what molybdenum price are you baking into that assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, I'd like to add &#x2013; this is Ra&#xFA;l Jacob. I'd like to add that the fourth quarter has usually a little bit more production for Southern Copper than the first three quarters of the year. So the $0.60, it's a conservative position that the company has taken. Even though we are seeing some cost reductions developing in the third quarter, we are not considering them in the $0.60 cash cuts indicated by Genaro.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Actually if I could ask a clarification on just that last question. You said 174 million of your sales in '09 are provisional, can you &#x2013; is that what you're expecting, I mean, could you just elaborate on what that means in terms of your expectation for offset on revenues? And is that in the fourth quarter or throughout multiple periods in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this $174 million is what is pending, and is the open position that we have for the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first quarter '09, that's what you &#x2013; that amount you expect to have offsetting your revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is what is going to take price during &#x2013; in the future, in the subsequent periods, and of course this is, as I mentioned, is considering the copper crude the copper forward crude price, and the last price of molybdenum that is &#x2013; that we know. And of course if these prices go up or go down, then this number is going to change, and it's going to &#x2013; and it depends on the date or the periods when the sales are taking prices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's based of the current copper futures curve, and it's mostly just for the first quarter, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not exactly the first quarter, because again if our sales that are open, and the sales can take price during January or can take price during February or in the subsequent months, but more or less it's a quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks so much. And then, my other question relates to Cananea, I know there's a lot of uncertainty regarding the labor issues in opening that, but do you have &#x2013; what is the cost structure of Cananea and is there a certain minimum copper price outlook before you would consider opening that from an economic perspective. Can you just clarify what the cost structure is of Cananea, or your expected cost structure of that mine is? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes. Jamie, hi. Cananea has a cash cost of about $0.77 per pound. In this case, the company will move forward as soon as we can with opening up the operation, and always as long as we have the perfect condition to operate and we are looking for -- to get to that point. Also, I'd like to comment a little bit on the open sales question that you did. We always have an open sales adjustment all the quarters, but usually they go unnoticed because of &#x2013; because we move in a certain band of prices. Problems or significant adjustments arise when we have a change in trend, which was what happened in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>

I was wondering if you could tell me at what range of copper prices would you reconsider resuming the Toquepala expansion project and Tia Maria project?

          <p>Yes, sure. At what range of copper prices would you be reconsidering the &#x2013; resuming the Toquepala expansion project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There are two things here. One is the uncertainty of this current market environment, where &#x2013; that has made our Board after a discussion and a review to hold on moving forward with the projects as we were doing. And the second issue is regarding the capital cost of equipment that we are seeing, and we think that we will see much lower prices for major capital equipment in the future. And we think that the proper thing to do is not to stick to a budget that was approved in 2008 with much higher equipment cost and obviously steel and some other materials, petroleum, but to look for a couple &#x2013; I'm sorry, equipment costs that in &#x2013; that is looking to current prices. So we think that it's going to take a process of spending all the backlog equipment that maybe have been &#x2013; has been built at much higher input cost, and that's another reason for this adjustment in our capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Regarding copper prices, the projects were valuated at copper prices quite similar to the ones that we have right now, but we think that given the current volatility and uncertainty in the market, we believe it's a wise thing to wait for a while before we move forward with them.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, it's &#x2013; it is very difficult to determine or to make expectations in terms of the date that this is going to be resolved. Even though the strike has been declared illegal, the union maintains the stoppage. Then the situation is complex, and the strike doesn't have any systematic labor causes or issues, but seeking for personal interest of the leaders. Then I can tell you that the labor authorities continue making the necessary actions to achieve a solution. And we are positive that such a solution will come in the near future. But again, it's very hard to determine a particular date.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Ra&#xFA;l, and good morning, Genaro. I have two questions that are much more market related. If you can give us a feeling of how sales volumes are behaving for the months of January and February. Are you seeing delays on orders, are you seeing a significant collapse, are things better than fourth quarter, if you can give some color in terms of demand? And the second one, if you are reducing significantly your CapEx, does that mean that you are looking more actively into acquisitions or you just want to preserve your cash? Is there any change that we should expect on dividends, if you can give us some ideas in terms of what's the mindset of the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Victoria. Well, just in terms of the sales and the volume of sales, I would like to tell you that we are not seeing any problem in order to allocate all of our production volume, and probably Ra&#xFA;l, in the terms of market, you can share with Victoria some of the expectations that we have in this respect, and I will take again the second part of the questions in respect of CapEx and acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Victoria regarding &#x2013; I believe that you ask about moly specifically, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, copper mainly, and if you also have some color on moly, that's fine, but I just wanted to see how that demand is going on January and February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On copper, what we are seeing is severe adjustment process of inventory, and I mean by this not only the warehouses inventory, that are increasing but not that much actually, but private &#x2013; the private garret inventories that the company &#x2013; that the copper industrial consumers have. Those are being reduced, and well, you can work out the numbers, but usually if you reduce 10% your inventory in a company of certain material, what will happen is that for a while your purchases will reduce even much more than 10%. So that is creating a sensation or a sense of much lower demand decline that what we are seeing.</p>
          <p>Also we believe that demand, it's not responding yet to the stimulus packages that have been put in place in the U.S. and China, being the Chinese one, the more &#x2013; the most important for our industry in terms of their relationship with basic metals consumption and specifically copper. We don't see at this problem &#x2013; at this time any problem, as Genaro indicated, with our copper sales at all, actually with none of our metals, but in terms of demand, we are seeing some decline in demand for the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>We believe that at certain point after mid-year, we should see a recovery in demand, basically driven by China. On moly, the molybdenum market, as you know moly is used for steel production and for special alloys and steel, and on that obviously demand has decreased more than what we have seen for copper. And this is affecting somehow some molybdenum producers, some of them were operating at much higher cost than what we are, and they have to shut down their operations. For us, we have molybdenum at a very low cost, so we don't plan to reduce our production and we're moving forward to sell 100% of our molybdenum production in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One question, one clarification, do you have to offer deeper discounts than some of your competitors in order to place all your production or you don't &#x2013; it's more like market rates? What you are giving, right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually I'd like to report that our metal has a premium over market price as refined copper, and we think that due to the quality of our product we are pushing some other producers in terms of taking our metal instead of them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in respect of the CapEx, Victoria, well the CapEx is as I mentioned is going to be reviewed. And we think that at this time point of time is a responsible action that the company is taking. Of course, we think that it's prudent to preserve cash in this kind of circumstances, and we are looking to review to adjust the capital cost for equipment in all of the projects that we have in the pipeline. And that is the first or the main driver, but of course, we are open as always for opportunities in the market in terms of acquisitions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I think my question was answered. It was about dividends. But maybe we could just also talk about CapEx. If in fact we do see copper, say, hover around $1.50 roughly, I think, your company's EBITDA would be in the sort of 7 to $800 million range given your commitment to CapEx, taxes and a higher debt load. Would you essentially just be paying the excess cash, excess free cash flow as dividends, or could you see potentially deficit spending, in other words paying dividends with an increase in further borrowings in order to sustain some kind of a minimum dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jorge, I'm afraid that the answer would be more or less the same. If the copper is increased to $1.50 that is what &#x2013; what I understood is &#x2013; in your question is &#x2013; well, then the excess cash is going to be analyzed and depends on the projects that we have in the pipeline, the decision is going to be taken in the &#x2013; at the Board of Directors meeting. Then &#x2013; well, it's &#x2013; it would be more or less the same answer to your question, Jorge.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple of follow-up questions, Genaro. IMMSA lost money in the third quarter and presumably lost money again in the fourth quarter, and we have not seen any recovery in zinc prices nor on silver. Is there any possibility that you consider temporarily closing that operation down? That's my first question. And my question has to do with Minera Mexico bought some or sold forward some U.S. dollars in order to secure the requirements of Mexican pesos. I mean, what's the rationale behind that transaction if I may ask? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In respect of the IMMSA or zinc operations, we are not planning to close or to shut down any operation in that respect. We are expecting to reduce costs, and we have entered in a very short and important program in order to reduce cost in not just only in the zinc area, but in all of our operations, and we believe that even the low prices or even the level of prices that we are seeing currently in zinc our operations are going to be able to continue operating with profit.

          <p>The FX derivative, yes, those types of derivatives was protecting the FX, well, the Mexican peso-dollar exchange rate, and we have reported in the fourth quarter around $53 million. It &#x2013; this is a provision, it's a unrealized number and we have recorded that as a realized &#x2013; an unrealized net loss, and both those derivates &#x2013; well, the rationale for both derivatives was to protect the appreciation of the pesos against the dollar, and those derivatives go to more or less the middle of 2009.</p>
