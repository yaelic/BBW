          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Presentation of Inditex Results for the Interim of year 2011. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a question and answer session comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone, followed by those questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex' results for the interim half year 2011. I am Pablo Isla, and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO, and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, our Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for the first half 2011 show that Inditex continues its global multiconcept, multichannel growth. Sales in the first half have increased 12%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period.</p>
          <p>Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our store opening plan for the year is on track. We have opened stores in 35 different markets over the period, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex' business model. We have also rolled out e-commerce operations in selected new markets over the period. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth, we have maintained a strong expansion over the period. I would like to highlight the rapid growth we are experiencing in markets with a strong potential in Asia. As a result, Asia has grown to 17% of group sales from 15% 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Ignacio, who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers and I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In the first half of 2011, all the lines from the profit and loss account show significant growth as a result of the operating performance. Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;6.2 billion, EBITDA of &#x20AC;1.3 billion and net income of &#x20AC;717 million.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales, let me tell you, the new selling space has contributed 7% to total sales growth in the first half of 2011. Like-for-like sales growth was very strong at 6%. The translation of sales in currency different to the euro had deducted one percentage point to reported sales growth, due to lower exchange rates versus our reporting currency.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross profit, this line has increased 11% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion. Gross margin on sales reached 58.4%. Operating expenses are tightly under control. Operating expenses in the first of 2011 have increased 11%, due to the growth in space and the variable cost linked to the strong sales performance. Operating expenses include all the start-up costs for new openings.</p>
          <p>Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the trend seen at fiscal year-end 2011. Inditex continues to show a strong financial condition.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Marcos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, in terms of space addition, we are on track, as we have opened 177 net stores in the first half of 2011 to reach a total of 5,221. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 35 markets over the period. Regarding the performance in the first half, as you can see in this chart, all the concepts have continued increasing their sales significantly. The differences reflect mainly the comparable base of the previous years. I am now handing over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>For the rest of 2011, we will continue to invest profitably in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns. Our store opening program is on track and our capital allocation process remains strict. We expect ordinary capital expenditure in 2011 to be around &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the acquisition of unique retail premises at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York and Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Milan has resulted in an extraordinary investment of &#x20AC;333 million in the first half of 2011. Regarding the start of the Autumn-Winter season, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1 of August to the 17 of September have grown 9%.</p>
          <p>We continue to identify significant opportunities for global expansion. In the coming months, Zara will launch stores in new markets such as South Africa, Taiwan, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Peru, confirming the global reach of our business model.</p>
          <p>Following on with its online rollout, Zara has launched e-commerce operations in the United States on the 7 of September with a strong reception. Direct communication through social media has played an important role in the launch. Dear America, a collection of photographs by prominent local artists of each of the 50 states, was especially curated to celebrate the U.S. launch of Zara online.</p>
          <p>The next step in the process will be Japan. We will launch Zara e-commerce operations in Japan on the 20 of October. We plan to roll out Zara online sales in other selected markets until we establish our global presence.</p>
          <p>Following the successful launch of Zara and Zara Home, all Inditex concepts are now present in e-commerce. Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Pull &amp; Bear, Stradivarius, Oysho and Uterq&#xFC;e have launched online sales in the most relevant European markets on the 6 of September. The launch has been very well received.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&amp;A session starts now. We remind you that online questions will follow. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. The first question comes from Richard Chamberlain from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me? Good morning. Just a question please, Pablo, on the online development. I see, obviously, you've launched Zara in the U.S. recently, appears with free delivery and free returns. And I just I wondered if that's something we should expect for Inditex in other markets going forward and whether you think that will have a big impact on margins in those markets where you're offering free delivery and returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I would say that we are offering free returns in all the markets. And regarding free delivery, what we tried to do with our online launch is to be very competitive in all the different markets. And then when we were considering the launch in the U.S. market, we thought that this was the best possible approach.</p>
          <p>In other European markets, we will have to decide having in mind all the elements. Of course, we always have free delivery in our stores in every market and then in some markets in which we have many stores, this also makes a big difference, another possibility to pick up their goods inside our stores without paying anything for the delivery. We will try to be very competitive in all the different markets and in the U.S., we have felt that this was the best decision from the launch itself and we will see the other...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So where it's sort of industry standard then is to offer free delivery, we should expect Zara to do the same, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will have to decide on the different markets. We will have to decide on the different markets. But in any case, you should not expect any big impact regarding the profitability of our online activity because of this. It's something manageable. With Zara Home, from the very beginning, we had free delivery for a certain amount of money. These are commercial propositions in order to try to be very competitive in the different markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Warwick Okines from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I was wondering if I could ask a question with two parts, actually. The first is, did you have less inventory in your Summer sale this year compared with last year? And the second point is, what components of the gross margin are negative factors in the second half of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I will answer you a little bit about the gross margin and later on regarding the inventory, Ignacio, you can elaborate on that point. Well, regarding the gross margin, what we would say is &#x2013; and what we always say, I mean, that the gross margin is a combination of many, many different factors, as you know, mark-ups, markdowns, fashion trends, product mix, inventory management, currencies. So we prefer not to elaborate on the different topics.</p>
          <p>So I think the relevant point here regarding the gross margin is that having in mind the gross margin that we have in the first half of the year 2010, this gross margin in the first half of 2011 is a very strong gross margin and we maintain our view for the whole year in the sense that we will be able to lock in a minimum of 50% of the gross margin gain that we achieved in the full year 2010. But it's a combination of many, many different factors, and we prefer not to elaborate in advance what could be these factors. Regarding the inventory, Ignacio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In relation to inventory, as we always say, the inventory position is <mark type="ph" /> just opportunities (08:23) and thus, it probably reflect the company at any given point in time. Our commitment is still to manage and remains relatively the same than last year. In any case, on a two-year basis, inventory position is growing in line with the sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you say whether you had less inventory going into the Summer sale than you did the year before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Warwick, it's Marcos here. Just adding on what Ignacio say, remember that the inventory is not the best way to look at our business, because it's just not a snapshot. Just to give you an example, remember that at the beginning of the Spring-Summer, our inventory was 22% higher. And in that period, sales grew by 12% and the gross margin was very strong.</p>
          <p>So this clearly proves that looking at our business just through the inventory, which is a snapshot, is not the right way. We believe the commitment is much more relevant. And regarding your point about more or less discounts, I think that, well, in the first half, we delivered a 6% like-for-like, and obviously, last year was also very strong, so nothing very different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Simon Irwin from Liberum Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Can I just ask about the tax and any implications on e-commerce? Q2 tax looks quite low and there have been stories about you using other tax countries in order to book your e-commerce &#x2013; so what should we look for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. At this point in time, our best expectation for the full year is a tax rate between 23% and 24%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And is it fair to say that the tax rate on your e-commerce is going to be noticeably lower than it is for the rest of your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, very similar. Very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, our tax rate, our global tax rate is the combination of the different tax rate that we pay in the different countries all across the world and they're very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is it fair to say that e-commerce was the principal driver behind the first half like for likes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a combination of many different factors. So when you see a 6% like-for-like sales growth, which is quite strong. This means that the evolution of sales in the different markets, the reception of our collections in the different markets, has been very strong. So I wouldn't think about one particular factor as being behind this 6% like-for-like sales growth during the first half. In the last year, without online sales, we were also having a healthy like-for-like sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and is there any geographical features within that like for like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any strong geographical features within that like for like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. When you have 5%, 6% like-for-like sales growth, it means that you have positive sales growth in all the different geographies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, and congratulations for the very strong set of figures. First one is a little bit of a follow-up on the latest question. Basically, I was wondering whether we could read some positive performance out of the Spanish operations in this first half, which seems to be the case, according to your latest answer?</p>
          <p>The second one was to &#x2013; if you could elaborate a little bit on the extraordinary acceleration that we have seen in sales growth in the second half of the second quarter, whether that is to be blamed on a terribly successful sales campaign or I don't know, whether you could provide some light on that front? And then just to finish, I was wondering whether the first half figures include any launching costs for the online operations of the non-Zara format? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding your question, what I would say is that, as I was saying before, yes, we are having positive sales performance in all the different geographies. And then about the evolution of our sales during the season, we always say that we prefer to analyze sales thinking about the whole season, not thinking about one month or six weeks or even a quarter.</p>
          <p>So within that, the best way to analyze our sales evolution is to look to the whole season and this is the very figures that we are publishing. And about costs involved in the online launch, as we anticipated during a previous conference call, we were not expecting big launching costs, something very similar to what we had for the Zara online launch at around &#x20AC;12 million, which are partially already included in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then we can assume that the rest of the launching costs could be included in the third quarter figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding Spain, Martha, yes as you mentioned, we always insist that in Spain, we know the market very well that we feel very, very comfortable that our expectation is for a stable performance. And yes, working with the numbers we have provided, you see that the numbers were positive in Spain in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perfect. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Anne Critchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Are there any reasons why you've had quite a slowdown in like-to-like sales trends, total sales trends between Q2 and the first few weeks of Q3? Any reasons, I think, to weather perhaps or the phasing of ranges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anne, good morning. It's Marcos here and we what we would like to say is that the 9% sales growth from the 1 of August to the 16 of September is very healthy and we're pleased. Obviously, we're not going to elaborate too much on six week of sales, but let me add that in this period, we have a very demanding comparable. And also bear in mind the space conversion of the first half. You can very well estimate where we stand.</p>
          <p>Also, what I would like to tell you is that the space contribution, apart from the space contribution, the store opening program this year is slightly more biased towards the second half than in the previous ones. So in the second half, we're going to have a strong number of openings. And additionally, it's very late into the period when we have launched on the 7 of September U.S. online sales, then on 6 of September, online sales for all the formats in Europe and then on October 20, we're launching online sales in Japan. So just to wrap up, we are pleased with this very healthy 9% sales performance in the start of the season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then, just a follow up on the store openings, how will those be split between Q3 and Q4? Will you be opening them fairly early in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the main difference is between first half and second half versus last year. Obviously, just to give you an idea, by the end of September, we expect to have opened around 70 Zara stores, which is a very strong number of stores in this last part of the month.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Good morning, guys. A question on gross margin from me as well. Just to clarify, first of all, when you said that you are expecting to lock in 50% of the gain of the previous year, do you mean that you are going to have an expansion half as good as previous years or you expect a reversion &#x2013; half of the reversion of the previous year?</p>
          <p>And then, if you can talk about 2012 and we expect raw material prices are declining, we expect gross margin tailwinds there. What is your policy on pricing for 2012 and if you would be tempted to keep the potential gross margin gains in 2012 or invest those in price, if they come? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will answer your question regarding the 2012. I think it's too early to talk about 2012. We are very focused on this Autumn-Winter season. And as you know, we always elaborate on the gross margin expectation for the year. In the previous year results presentation. So we always elaborate in the month of March about what are we expecting regarding the gross margin for their whole year. And, Marcos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding the gross margin guidance we're providing at the beginning of the year, we sustain it in full in the sense that we expect to retain 50% of the gross margin gains we achieved last year. That, as you remember, was the highest ever for the company. And we feel comfortable with this guidance and we have no updates to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. If I can ask a second one on CapEx, do you expect to do anymore acquisitions of specific retail premises that you see or are you going to return out a more normalized CapEx spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can say is that these two acquisitions have been something very, very exceptional. We are talking about very, very special occasions. Of course, our general policy remains to continue have insights on a leasehold basis, and this will be the general policy. So these have been two exceptions. In the world, there are four or five streets which are the most relevant streets in the world. And sometimes, there is a very clear opportunity and then, it could make sense to do something like this. But the general policy, of course, is not changing at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Robert Miller from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Another question on gross margin. When I look back at history of Inditex, it's clear that the second half gross margin in absolute terms tends to be higher than the first half gross margin. So for example, in the last five years, it was on average, 150 bps higher in H2 than H1, which seems logical given that the sales base is a lot higher in H2 and you're selling winter product in that period. Do you agree that that's a logical relationship?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a logical relationship, but the difference &#x2013; the only element is like-for-like sales evolution. If you analyze what is going on this year or the previous year, in the year 2010, we had 5% like-for-like sales growth in the first half.</p>
          <p>And this year, we have seen 6% like-for-like sales growth in the first half. So if the like-for-like sales growth is the same, then what you are saying is totally right. But then, it has a lot to do with like-for-like sales growth evolution also. That is the other factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. So your guidance about keeping half of the gain, implying that gross margin for the year might be down 100 bps or so as it was in the first half, it does appear therefore to be quite cautious relating to markdown, because it would imply your nominal H2 gross margin is only the same as your H1 reported gross margin. So you're building in quite a significant counter factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In &#x2013; what I would say that having in mind the very, very significant gross margin gain that we had in the year 2010 within that base would be a good achievement. And at this stage of the year, we feel comfortable with what we announced in March about being able to lock in at least 50% of the gross margin gain that we had in the year 2010.  We prefer to maintain our vision for the whole year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. And may I just ask, will there be a point, do you think, that you will disclose the contribution of e-commerce to your sales or are we always going to be lacking that information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will have to decide. This year is a sad year. The problem with our online sales is that as far as we continue launching in different markets, then to disclose our figure could be difficult to understand, I would say. This year is a &#x2013; last year was the year of the Zara launch. This year, we have introduced Zara in many different markets, now in September in the U.S, in October in Japan. We have launched all the other brands online in different European markets. Next year, we will continue increasing the number of countries in which we will have online operations with Zara and with the other brands.</p>
          <p>We will have to decide at a point in time. But currently, we are very, very focused on the execution on the &#x2013; having a very attractive proposition to our customers. And we think it could be a little bit misleading now, because we are not presenting all the markets or even in the main markets. So I don't have a very specific answer to your question but what I would say is that right now, I think it would not be the right thing to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But can you say whether you believe that the online sales are incremental to your group's operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If they are incremental to the group operating margin?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that they are not at all, the opposite, no? So that is what I would say.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The next question comes from Andrew Hughes from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Andrew Hughes from UBS. Just going back to the current trading and looking at the comparative period from last year, it doesn't seem to be that much different from the performance in the first half. So I'm just thinking as to why current trading may be weaker? I mean, specifically, are you seeing signs of stress in the Eurozone area, which has affected current trading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andy. It's Marcos here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our view is that the current trading is very healthy and we have insisted on this, that we are pleased, because 9% is sales growth in local currencies from the 1 of August to the 17 of September. Again, it's just six weeks, not a very relevant period, but again, against very demanding comparables.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you've seen the space contribution over the first half, so clearly very solid positive territory. And then the space addition this year, as I mentioned, is more biased towards the second half. So if on top of this, you add that the online launch is taking place very late into that period in the sense that the U.S. online sales were launched on September the 7. The concepts in Euro were launched on the 6 of September. And we have Japan, what we can tell you is that we are clearly pleased with this start of the season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is there anything you can say at all about regional trends then in terms of current trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the six weeks, it is simply not possible. But I think it's important to just reaffirm what you say. The current trading is not very different to the current trading at this point in time last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Fraser Ramzan from Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody. And first of all, congratulations on a very strong set of numbers. They're really good. Well, the first one from me really is on Bershka. Wanted to see if there were any particular <mark type="audio gap" /> (26:14) to highlight there, obviously given the sales growth in the period relative to the space you've opened over the last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fraser, as we mentioned over the presentation, it is mainly due to the very strong comparables in the previous years and the calendar of openings for Bershka. So, as you can imagine, managing eight concepts and trying to diversify risk, you are always going to have some concepts which are over performing. But in any case, they all run the same business model. So in that field, I believe that is much better to do it our way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So like-for-like sales were positive at Bershka?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose like-for-like sales for the concepts. But you have a 6% like-for-like growth for the group as a whole, which I think is the relevant figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just finally in terms of pricing, obviously, it seems like a good decision to have held prices in the first half. What in the end was your sort of average selling price outcome? Were you up or were you down over the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Prices have been stable. So all the growth in terms of sales, both like-for-like and total sales growth, is volume driven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Good morning to you all. We are now going to cover the questions that we have received over the webcast platform. Some of them have been covered already during the question-and-answer section regarding sales and online, for example. We have a question from Pedro Balcao of Nm&#xE1;s1. He would just like to confirm if the Internet sales are included within the like-for-like calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Okay. We have another question. It's regarding your new stores at the Stratford City Mall near the Olympic Park in London. Which formats will you be taking there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would say is that this shopping mall is a very, very attractive project here in London. We are present with Zara, with Bershka, and with Pull &amp; Bear. We have a big Zara store, and we are very happy, I would say, with the development and we have very nice stores there. And those of you who are based in London, I would invite you to visit this shopping mall and to see our stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we have another question. It's in reference in particular to the recent launch in Australia. Can you provide us with feedback regarding your Southern Hemisphere Collection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can say is that the reception is very, very strong. Now, we're operating stores in Sydney and Melbourne, and the performance in both capitals remains very, very similar. And we're obviously looking for new stores in Australia.</p>
          <p>The fact that we are running a different season there is not a problem because with our business model, we've had a Southern Hemisphere Collection for many, many years. He said, you need to have a completely independent team to run the Southern Hemisphere and to have dedicated collection, because obviously, they're slightly ahead in terms of fashion. But we think our business model is not a problem. We're sending garments to Australia every 48 hours, and the freshness of the collections is exactly the same as the rest of the group, so very pleased with the launch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, as I mentioned, we've already covered some of the topics, particularly online, we had a number of questions online that were covered during the question-and-answer section. So that concludes the questions from the webcast platform. Thank you.</p>
