          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the BCE's Fourth Quarter Results and 2011 Guidance Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Thane Fotopoulos. Please go ahead, Mr. Fotopoulos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diana, and welcome everyone on the line this morning. Our call today rather will focus on BCE's Q4 2010 results and our 2011 financial guidance. As usual, I am joined today by George Cope, our CEO, and Siim Vanaselja, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our news release announcing our fourth quarter and full-year 2010 earnings. The release, supplementary information package, and slide presentation for this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at bce.ca.</p>
          <p>Siim will begin with a quick overview of our Q4 results before he moves onto 2011 guidance, and George will take you through a quick overview of the business and strategies and operational focus for the upcoming year. After that we'll move onto Q&amp;A. However, before we do begin I'd like to remind you that today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements with respect to items such as revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, and capital intensity. Several assumptions were made by us in preparing these forward-looking statements, and there are risks that our actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>For additional information on such assumptions and risks, please consult BCE's Safe Harbor notice concerning forward-looking statements dated February 10th, 2011 filed with the Canadian Securities Commission and with the SEC and which is also available on the Investor Relations section of BCE's website. These forward-looking statements represent BCE's expectations as of today, and accordingly are subject to change.</p>
          <p>Except as may be required by Canadian securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise and additionally I'm making this cautionary statement on behalf of both George and Siim, whose remarks today will contain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>So with that behind us, Siim, I'll hand it over to you to get us started.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Thane. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. I'll start with the review of the results that we issued this morning on slide eight. The fourth quarter capped off a strong year for Bell highlighted by continued momentum in the wireless market and positive trends in our wireline business. Financially, we met all of our guidance targets for 2010.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we enjoyed strong wireless, TV, and Internet growth, as well as better business ICT sales resulting in service revenue growth at Bell of 1.3%. Wireless enjoyed another standout quarter of accelerating postpaid subscriber acquisitions with increasing year-over-year ARPU driven by strong data growth.</p>
          <p>In wireline, we continue to shift our customer and revenue mix increasingly towards growth services and away from legacy voice, while improving EBITDA margins through further operating cost reductions and slowing NAS line losses. All of this gives us good momentum as we begin 2011 providing support for our revenue and EBITDA trajectories going forward.</p>
          <p>Bell EBITDA was up 1.1% this past quarter, a good result recognizing the incremental expense incurred to add 33% more postpaid subscriber loadings and a 150,000 more customer retention upgrades. Consistent with our outlook, capital expenditures in the quarter were significantly higher as we stepped up spending on broadband fibre deployments and upgrading of our core network to support the expansion of our IPTV service.</p>
          <p>Wireless CapEx spending was also higher year-over-year reflecting increased investment in network capacity to meet our growing data demand, the deployment of Dual Cell technology consistent with our evolution toward LTE, and ongoing improvements to network coverage and signal strength.</p>
          <p>On a full-year basis, we maintained our capital intensity, in line with guidance at 16%. Statutory EPS for the quarter increased to $0.58 per share from $0.46 per share last year, mainly reflecting increased EBITDA and lower year-over-year restructuring costs. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 per share before restructuring costs corresponding to a $0.09 per share or 17.6% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>That improvement was driven by higher EBITDA, lower depreciation, accretion from fewer outstanding BCE common shares and the tax benefit arising from the $750 million special pension contribution made last December. For the year, adjusted EPS grew 13.6% to $2.84 per share exceeding our original guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per share.</p>
          <p>Finally, free cash flow, before taking into account the special pension contribution, we generated free cash flow of $201 million in the quarter, good performance, I'd say, given the higher level of capital expenditures, payments made in the quarter upon the vesting of BCE's RSU program also had an impact. Free cash flow, before the special pension contribution, was just over $2.1 billion for the full 2010 year, that represents an 8.6% increase over 2009. So, overall, well balanced operating and financial performance.</p>
          <p>And I'll turn to our operating segments. The clear highlight of the quarter for the Bell Wireline segment was EBITDA, which increased 6.9% year-over-year. This was underpinned by growth in TV and Internet, easing in NAS losses and cost reduction measures. Bell saw 13th consecutive quarter of reduced year-over-year retail residential line losses from higher penetration of our service bundles and Home Phone packages. We also benefited in the quarter from higher wholesale NAS additions as a result of a resale agreement entered into with a third-party reseller of residential services.</p>
          <p>Our TV business stayed the course, adding a similar number of gross activations and contributing meaningfully to overall residential wireline performance with revenue growth of 7.9%. Higher churn from competitor acquisition offers in the quarter resulted in lower net additions year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In Internet, the quarter saw higher residential net adds, which more than doubled year-over-year. This was driven by lower churn, stronger Internet attach rates on NAS winbacks and positive consumer response to our Fibe Internet packages. Fibe subscribers now represent approximately one-third of our residential Internet customer base. And residential Internet ARPU increased 3.8% on a growing mix of premium tier customers.</p>
          <p>Turning to our business markets, we saw a similar trend for the past few quarters, consistent, I'd say, with low levels of employment growth in the economy. But business NAS erosion has flattened and volumes in professional and managed services have picked up.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, Wireline segment revenues for 2010 remained essentially unchanged year-over-year. The revenue lift from TV and Internet as well as from higher product sales in the first half of the year from The Source was largely offset by lower year-over-year voice and business market performance.</p>
          <p>For the year, wireline EBITDA grew 5.9%, which we believe to be industry-leading performance for wireline. Continued strong execution in our efficiency programs to reduce labor expense, G&amp;A, and discretionary spending resulted in wireline margin expansion of over 2 percentage points to around 39%, our highest level in more than five years. With this strong wireline EBITDA, we generated considerable headroom, which we used to invest in growing our wireless market share, and let me take you to that now.</p>
          <p>It was another exceptional quarter of wireless subscriber acquisitions. We achieved record gross activations of 553,000 and a near record level of postpaid net additions, which increased close to 43% to 157,000. For the full year, Bell Wireless activated almost 2 million gross subs, attained over 0.5 million postpaid net additions and grew its smartphone customer base by 82% year-over-year. Based on Street estimates and our own channel checks, we expect to have captured at least one-third market share of incumbent postpaid additions. That's a good improvement compared to just a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p>Our focus now is on improving churn. Our 2011 plan calls for incremental retention spending and a further scaling of Virgin postpaid and Solo Unlimited to compete with new entrant offers. Wireless ARPU grew 2.5% in Q4 representing a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Data ARPU now represents about 25% of total ARPU and smartphone users represent close to 30% of our postpaid customer base and generate ARPU in excess of $90 on average. Cost of acquisition is consistent with the increasing mix of postpaid and smartphone activations reflecting higher handset subsidies, so another strong quarter of wireless metrics.</p>
          <p>On the financial side for wireless, service revenue growth was over 9% in the quarter. That was driven by the significant postpaid subscriber growth, the greater data usage and smartphone adoption. Data revenues increased 38% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Wireless product revenues were also higher in the quarter, up 3.9%, reflecting higher handset sales and upgrades consistent with our acquisition and retention activities. At the same time, overall handset prices were lower across the market given Christmas period offers.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, wireless EBITDA this quarter is consistent with the step-up in activations and upgrades and retentions. We spent about $125 million more year-over-year in gaining 99,000 additional postpaid activations and extending upgrades featuring higher end data devices to 150,000 existing customers. EBITDA before COA expense in the quarter grew 4.1% with a margin just shy of 40%. The additional investment in postpaid subscriber acquisitions and upgrades will support stronger revenue and EBITDA growth trajectories going forward and help to improve churn. So that's it for results.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to our capital structure and where we stand with our capital markets objectives. On slide 14, we finished the year with over $2.1 billion in cash and credit facilities and a strong investment grade credit profile consistent with our financial policies. During the year we repaid approximately $400 million of long-term debt and approximately $150 million of capital lease obligations.</p>
          <p>We repurchased 16.2 million common shares for $500 million, funded the acquisition of Hypertec for $70 million and contributed $750 million into the pension plan. We also raised $1 billion in proceeds late last year from the issuance of Bell Canada five-year notes at a 3.6% coupon, improving our overall average cost of debt to 5.75% with a weighted average term to maturity of 13 years. Approximately 75% of our overall debt is fixed.</p>
          <p>And we closed 2010 with a cash balance of $752 million. Of that closing balance, $700 million has been earmarked to pre-fund our normal course financing requirements in 2011 and those would include a $250 million debt maturity in December, capital lease repayments, and the acquisition of xwave, which has already been completed in January.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that in early December Moody's announced that it has modified its rating methodology for Bell Canada's preferred shares, BCE's preferred shares in a manner that is aligned with S&amp;P to attribute 50% equity treatment to those preferred shares. This revision better reflects the true equity nature of BCE's perpetual preferred shares in our capital structure. So, as a result, we've adjusted our credit metric reporting to be consistent with that rating agency treatment. There is no change to our financial leverage policy of 1.5 times to 1.25 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, but the new treatment results in a modest increase in headroom of about 0.2 of a turn to our leverage ratio.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, you can see that Bell is well positioned with an attractive long-term debt maturity and minimal near to medium term debt repayments apart from the CTV financing. Each of the rating agencies have confirmed our A (low), BBB+ credit ratings pro forma the CTV acquisition, which is on track to close in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The financing structure for CTV will bring our leverage ratio in 2011 to the higher end of our policy range and that ratio should improve over time as we continue to generate growth in EBITDA and cash flow. And we will look to be opportunistic in refinancing the CTV acquisition bank facility over the 2011 and 2012 timeframe.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you'll see the progress BCE has made in establishing its track record as a dividend growth company with six successive increases in BCE's common share dividend on the back of earnings growth representing an aggregate of 35% increase since the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>BCE's current 7.7% dividend increase for 2011 maintains our payout ratio at the lower end of our policy range of 65% to 75% of adjusted EPS and is comfortably supported by our EPS and operating free cash flow for 2011. BCE's dividend coverage of around 1.5 times earnings and free cash flow also offer strong support for our dividends, which currently yields close to 5.5%. With regard to share buyback plans, as I mentioned in December, given the decision to pre-fund $750 million of pension obligations and the financing requirements for the CTV acquisition, we will not be undertaking an NCIB in 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2012, however, we would expect to have the financial flexibility to again assess how we deploy surplus cash and how we deploy it towards our capital markets objectives. So with that, let me turn to our 2011 outlook and financial guidance. First I want to quickly run through the changes that the transition to IFRS has on our reported 2010 earnings, because, after all, that sets the jump-off point to put our 2011 guidance into context.</p>
          <p>I discussed this last year, last quarter, and I can say that the impacts are all minimal. The slight decrease in EBITDA results principally from the reversal of the pension valuation allowance we recognized under GAAP in the first quarter of 2010. That valuation allowance is not allowed to be recognized on the P&amp;L under IFRS. That's a one-time issue.</p>
          <p>On EPS, the one difference I wanted to point out is the tax impact of the special pension contribution. Under IFRS that tax benefit related to the pension payment is lower than under Canadian GAAP as it is limited to the pension expense recognized on the income statement. So, the remaining amount is recognized on the balance sheet through shareholders' equity under IFRS.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the tax benefit relating to the special pension contribution is recognized under IFRS at a slightly lower tax rate compared to Canadian GAAP. So all that together means that there is about a $0.04 EPS tax impact, which explains the variance in our 2010 adjusted EPS between Canadian GAAP at $2.84 and IFRS at $2.79.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, you have our financial guidance targets for 2011 prepared on an IFRS basis. Given the trajectory of our wireless, TV, and Internet businesses, and an outlook for continued improvement in residential NAS erosion, we're targeting revenue growth of 1% to 2%. We expect a relatively steady economy with nominal GDP growth at about 2.5%, but given the slow pace of employment growth, we anticipate continued cautious spending in our business customers.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA expectation for 2011 is for growth at Bell in the range of 2% to 4%. That guidance range leaves us a good degree of cushion to support continued wireless subscriber acquisitions consistent with our objectives of achieving our share of the incumbent postpaid market and it also gives us some flexibility to increased spending on customer retentions. Driving this total EBITDA improvement is significant wireless revenue flow through and further cost savings, particularly, cost reductions in support groups, procurement, and client care.</p>
          <p>On CapEx, we'll manage Bell's capital intensity at around 16% of revenue, allowing for continued broadbands investments, expansion of our IPTV footprint to 2 million homes, the implementation of Dual Cell technology and meeting growth and demand. At the BCE consolidated level, our guidance is for adjusted EPS growth of between 4% and 8% over 2010 and free cash flow in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. So, overall, our guidance reflects confidence in our business prospects for the coming year with EPS and free cash flow growth providing a strong and stable foundation for our common share dividend.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the financial targets we're providing today exclude CTV. So I'll point out that we intend to refresh our guidance upon closing of that acquisition expected in the second quarter. I'll give a bit more color on revenues. Bell Wireless revenue growth is expected to benefit from the flow through of significant investments made in 2010 in customer acquisition and retention and continued acceleration in smartphone activations and data usage to sustain overall ARPU growth.</p>
          <p>Bell Wireline, our revenue plan for that for 2011 assumes a further slow down in residential local line losses as we leverage IPTV to drive triple play urban household penetration, increase our MDU market share and generate higher pull through attach rates for other residential services. So with IPTV contributing to strong overall TV subscriber growth and ARPU support from programming mix and pricing, video revenue growth is expected to remain healthy in 2011.</p>
          <p>We also expect higher Internet growth in 2011 as we leverage our broadband fiber network to drive further growth in Bell Fibe subscribers. In our Business Markets unit, while economy related and market challenges will likely continue to impact performance, we do see a further easing of NAS losses and improving data service revenues should help moderate overall revenue pressures.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 21, wireless will be the key driver of Bell's EBITDA growth in 2011. As I mentioned, our EBITDA guidance reflects an overall increase in subscriber acquisition cost and retention spending. We should, nevertheless, see higher wireless margins in 2011, given the substantial incremental spending we incurred in 2010 to grow our postpaid market share.</p>
          <p>2011 EBITDA guidance also reflects OpEx savings in labor costs as we further streamline our work force, a stronger Canadian dollar benefiting our U.S. dollar purchases, and the elimination of capital taxes, which took place at the end of last year. With all that our guidance reflects Bell's overall margin being maintained, if not, modestly expanded.</p>
          <p>Turning to pension expense on slide 22, our overall pension expense on an IFRS basis is expected to decrease approximately $90 million to around $120 million in 2011. Unlike Canadian GAAP where all components of pension expense are included in operating income, under IFRS only the current service cost is reflected in EBITDA with interest and asset return components reflected below EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The improvement in total pension expense results from three main factors. The first is the special $750 million contribution made in December and that improves 2011 pension expense by about $20 million contributing about $0.03 to adjusted EPS. Second, our pension plan delivered a strong 11.4% return on assets for 2010, which improves the pension funds valuation position. And third, the lower accounting discount rate for 2011 reduces our overall net pension financing expense.</p>
          <p>At the EBITDA level though, the lower discount rate has the opposite effect resulting in a slightly higher current service cost in 2011. So in terms of cash pension funding, Bell's solvency deficit at year-end 2010 was reduced and the pension plan solvency ratio improved to a little over 90%.</p>
          <p>Taking into account all the puts and takes, our overall pension funding in 2011 declines to $400 million from $509 million in 2010. And as I mentioned on our call in December, our goal is to eliminate Bell's pension plan deficit by the end of 2014 and that would certainly improve our earnings and cash flow generation and reduce the overall volatility of our pension funding going forward.</p>
          <p>Moving to our tax outlook, we expect an increase in cash taxes for 2011 to approximately $200 million compared to the $127 million liability in 2010. We do still have a pool of unused R&amp;D tax credits of over $300 million that will help shelter taxes at the federal levels through to at least 2012.</p>
          <p>In addition, with the completion of our CTV acquisition, we will also have access to approximately $400 million of tax losses, which we expect to utilize over the next three years. The statutory tax rate in 2011 reduces to 28.3% from 30.6% in 2010. That's owing to reductions at both the federal and Ontario levels. So our projected effective accounting rate for 2011 is about 25%, slightly below the statutory rate. Now, in 2010 we realized a relatively high level of tax adjustments and recoveries of $0.27 per share. And I'd say that for 2011, we expect a range of approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per share in tax recoveries.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, we expect adjusted EPS of between $2.90 and $3.00 per share in 2011. That growth is coming from, first, stronger expected wireless EBITDA. Second from reduced net pension financing costs, as I described. And third, from slightly lower year-over-year depreciation expense resulting from asset retirements that took place at the end of last year. Our EPS growth is moderated a bit by the decreased level of tax adjustments in 2011, but with growth of 4% to 8% it maintains our dividend payout ratio at the low end of the range.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, I've provided the details of our free cash flow for 2011, which we're forecasting to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. The year-over-year improvement mainly reflects higher EBITDA and a similar level of capital intensity of around 16% of revenues. Normal course pension funding, cash restructuring costs, and payments under our long-term incentive plan are all expected to be lower in 2011. We also expect a favorable pickup in 2011 on our US dollar spends, which we've now hedged at an average exchange rate of close to par. So, strong reliable cash flow generation in 2011, while absorbing, as you see on the chart, close to $250 million of CRTC deferral account mandated rebates that are to be returned to customers. And that will take place largely in the first quarter. And, as well, a $100 million decrease in cash distributions from Bell Aliant upon its conversion from a trust back into a corporation. We do expect to end 2011 with a healthy cash balance in the range of $400 million to $500 million.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, for further clarity, I've provided a breakdown of some of the reconciling items between EBITDA and free cash flow. And I hope you'll see that all of the components there line up well with the guidance that we are providing this morning.</p>
          <p>And slide 27 and 28 are really for your reference. They summarize our key economic and market assumptions that frame our 2011 outlook as well as the main financial and operating assumptions that underpin our guidance.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I'd say that 2010 was a good year for all BCE stakeholders. In 2011, we expect to build on Bell's financial and operating momentum consistent with the 2011 targets announced today. So with that, I will turn the call over to George.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Siim. Good morning, everyone. I'm just going to make a few comments on some of our strategies for next year around our five imperatives. I have turned to the slides. This is called Business overview, Five Strategic Imperatives. From an investor perspective, the message here is they're the same imperatives as they have been the last three years. And everything we're doing at Bell is focused on those five strategic imperatives, which continue to serve us well from an execution perspective.</p>
          <p>So if I turn to slide 31, and just for a moment on our strategic imperative around investing in broadband networks and services, we are clearly starting to see the benefit of our execution in the marketplace where we saw RGU growth of 78% in 2010 versus 2009. And also the customer mix reflecting our investments in wireless, TV, and Internet exposure, as you can see on the chart from '07 to '10. And I think most important for investors, and maybe fairly unique from a telco on a global basis, is we managed that transition of the reduction in NAS and the investments in wireless and the other areas, yet seen our EBITDA margin remained flat, if not slightly increased. And so we have been able to manage through this focus on cost of this transition, and we expect to continue to do that going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 32, Siim talked about where we will be investing our capital. I thought I'd just break it down a little bit between wireless and wireline. On the wireless side we think we will see a capital intensity of around 11% or 12% this year. And that is up over 2010 because, as you know, in 2010, we had a brand-new network and most of that capital had been spent in 2009. I think that will be consistent with what most of the analysts would have expected and most of our capital dollars on wireless are going to meet the demand for data.</p>
          <p>On the wireline side, 18% approximately capital intensity, stable year-over-year. Significant investment there being our fiber expansion in Quebec City, continued focus on IPTV, and meeting the continued demand for Internet capacity by the marketplace by the consumer. On top of that, this investment we continue to make on the business side in both hosting and in cloud computing.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 33, in terms of accelerating our wireless business, I think Siim's covered that well. I will remind our investors that it was a year ago we set an objective to make sure we achieved 33% share or better of the postpaid market growth. In terms of defining that, competing with our incumbent competitors. And you can see, in three years we have been successful in taking that from 18%. It was 38% year-to-date at the end of the third quarter. We don't know the fourth quarter results of our competitors but we are pretty confident we would have achieved our 33% goal on a year basis, particularly with postpaid up 43% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And as Siim said, the 500,000 postpaid net adds, the most significant part of that going forward is obviously the way how that helps us from a revenue perspective going forward. Lifetime value of that type of customer base that you've added in a year is almost &#x2013; is a little over $2 billion. So very successful year for us in the wireless market.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 34, in terms of 2011, the strategy has been pretty transparent, continuing investment in the network, the devices, the distribution channels, our multibrand approach, and enhancing our data capability with access to products or from time to time having access to them exclusively such as the Motorola ATRIX, which is just getting launched in Canada. We will have that on an exclusive basis for some period of time. What I would expect in 2011 and us to continue to focus on the postpaid market. We think we will continue to see soft results in prepaid. Our focus is in postpaid to make sure we maintain the market share that we have achieved this year. And the prepaid segment, as everyone would know, marginally profitable and where really the bottom end of the market is taking place and where we're not particularly focusing our dollars. And so analysts should expect to continue to see that in 2011 for the focus from Bell on postpaid.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 35, an excellent year for us in data, as we've commented. And really, one significant note is we are now generating more wireless data than we are from the wireline Internet business, which is a significant milestone, when you think of just a few years ago. I think the opportunity for investors is that our user base, 28% of our postpaid base have smartphones, which, of course, the investment opportunity is the 72% that don't. And we continue to see an ARPU of clients who have migrated of over $90. So we think that positions us well for a natural migration of customers to smart phones, providing a natural migration of ARPU, without doing any type of price increasing in the market, which clearly the markets are not ready to accept given how competitive and intense the market is in Canada.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 36. Siim had touched on this. You are going to see more investment for us in 2011 because of this opportunity for upgrades, and the revenue and ARPU we see off of the upgrades with our customer base. Our retention spend, as people would know, has historically been a little lower than our competitors. We will increase that this year because it is so accretive for our shareholders from both an ARPU and then ultimately an EBITDA perspective. And so you should look for that going forward and we hope from that focus we will also see some improvement in our postpaid churn, which we would like to see through managing upgrades with more investment.</p>
          <p>Turning to 37, the question that every investor asks us on an ongoing basis and that is will the rate of NAS losses accelerate. We believe that in 2011, that rate will not accelerate. I think we'll continue to actually see a reduction in the number of customers we lose on a year-over-year basis. We have done that now for three years. We anticipate that same development next year. We think there is some challenge on the business side, as Siim had mentioned, slow growth in job creation and obviously the cable competitors starting to play at the bottom of the SMB market had some impact on our NAS numbers. Importantly, also, we've been able to see our average revenue on NAS increase while managing the decline in the overall NAS base, particularly now due to technology substitution.</p>
          <p>Turning to 38. This really just illustrates how our business mix on the consumer side residential, what has changed dramatically from just 2008. With the acquisition of CTV, which will close this year, you can see that 70% of our revenue is from Internet, TV or CTV from the household. More importantly, local voice and LD have declined from 53% of our revenue in residential in '08 to probably less than 30% at the end of 2011. So we continue to derisk the revenue profile of Bell. And, of course, that ignores all the consumer wireless that we would have, as well, if we were to report that way and obviously we don't, and won't be going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 39, an important year for us in 2011 is our rollout of IPTV in the marketplace. We think there is a significant opportunity to grow our urban market share similar to the success we've had with our satellite products in the non-urban areas. You can see on that chart at the bottom, we have roughly 24% of the non-urban, so suburban, rural. And in Toronto and Montreal we have only a 4% market share, so very little cannibalization of our base with the focus on IPTV. And our focus this year will be Toronto and Montreal. And we anticipate exiting 2011 with 2 million households passed and all of our FTTN nodes are equipped with VDSL2 cards now, enabling us to deliver 25 meg services as we rollout this product on IPTV. And early numbers are positive for us, meeting our internal expectations. And as we add footprints we continue to see momentum building.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 40. Bell Business Markets, Siim's talked about. Probably the area of the company that continues to be most impacted by the economy in terms of not seeing job growth has an impact on companies' investment. And if they're not growing, obviously, Bell is such a significant part of the economy we see that impact. Connectivity is still the cash flow engine for our business unit. We are, however, obviously focusing on areas where we can drive market share, or wallet share, if you will, of our current customers, focusing on hosting, video solutions, and security. By way of example, recent contracts we received in Ottawa over time will generate an additional $100 million for us business we don't have today in the hosting area through the building out of hosting centers. And that is a great recurring revenue business model for us, and one that you will see us continue to invest in as you've seen this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 41, turning to our service improvements. Continued focus, as that is one of our key strategic imperatives. Really starting to see the benefit of service improving while reducing costs at the same time. Our Internet churn has come down. We actually handled 9 million fewer calls this year than we would have in 2008. And we expect that call volume to continue to drop from our improvement in service and streamlining our operations. And you can see on the slide, a number of bullets here around what we are doing for the customers. And we absolutely would put our service in the home up against any of our competitors now in the marketplace. And we also are doing this while at the same time reducing our costs.</p>
          <p>And turning to cost, on page 42, we have a chart that shows some of the annual cost reductions that we have been executing on. And in 2011 we anticipate the same strategic focus on cost at the company. And we have clear sight of about $200 million on operating cost savings for 2011, a number that coming through consolidation of roles in our operations, in our technology area, in our satellite TV area with our consumer business, and in our mobility and residential areas as well. And as Siim had mentioned, some FX improvements and some tax savings as well. So we have really good visibility on the $200 million of savings for 2011 to help contribute to our EBITDA growth, as Siim has talked about.</p>
          <p>So just to wrap up, on page 43, we think a very strong year for the company in '10, and we think our strategic imperatives for 2011 I've just taken you through put us in a position to meet the expectations that we set this morning from a financial perspective.</p>
          <p>With that I will turn it back over to Thane. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Phillip Huang from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. My question is on the wireless side. Obviously a great quarter of postpaid net adds and you made some big investments in getting those subscribers in the quarter. You say you expect the wireless margin to improve this year. I just wanted to get a better understanding of where you expect that improvement to come from. Obviously, you are growing, smartphone subscriber base helps, but to what extent do you expect your shift from acquisition to retention will also help margins? And how does that balance with the higher retention spending assuming competition remains intense?</p>
          <p>And then my follow-up to that is, your priority remains on a higher value postpaid customers. As the prepaid market continues to grow in importance, when you think is the right time to give the prepaid market more attention? And are you concerned about the potential impact on your postpaid base when you decide to make that move? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, on the wireless, why do we anticipate EBITDA improvement? And really, it's just driven by the dramatic market share change this year in 2010. Not this year, last year, in 2010. We wouldn't anticipate a 20% change again in market share this year for Bell. So if you assume a market share we've now achieved our targeted roughly what our objectives were around market share, we've maintained those shares, we won't have the gross add expansion. And as a result, the COA investment won't be as significant, and as a result you would see margins should improve. The offset to that, which we have been very transparent on, is you will see some increase in retention spend but we believe that is present value positive. So, the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>And then on the prepaid segment, we've been in the prepaid segment for well over a decade. It's the bottom end of the market. And at the moment, with the competitive intensity at the bottom end of the market, it's not that we are not playing there, but our focus on execution is on the postpaid and smartphone market where we think the most value is for our shareholders. And so we will monitor the situation. If we start to see something change in that area that looks like an opportunity, we will pursue it. But at this point in time, our focus in the whole organization will generally be on postpaid.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for taking my question. I just want to go back maybe to talk about your NAS losses in the quarter. You mentioned that you saw some improvement due to a contract signing on the wholesale side. Can you quantify what that contract would have represented in the quarter, just so that we can have a better understanding what the underlying fundamentals are in terms of NAS losses on the residential side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not going to disclose the number but let me try to help you little bit. If you look at our historical decline we've seen in NAS year-over-year, if you were to look back at that, that's generally where we have been, and the wholesale transaction helped that. So if the number looks more than it has normally been, you can back in, assume that the retail side of our consumer saw the steady decrease that we've seen historically. And that's probably as far as we are going to go on that because it's got competitive elements to it for us and for the wholesaler who's doing that work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just maybe to follow-up on the free cash flow guidance you gave. If I take out the deferral account payment that you made &#x2013; that you're going to be making this year, your dividend is about 60% of free cash flow. If I adjust for the lower taxes you're paying it's probably at 65% of cash flow. How much do you think the dividend &#x2013; we know that your dividend policy is on adjusted EPS, but on a free cash flow basis, can you maybe talk about where could you take that up to in terms of continuing to implement investment in the company long-term? Is 65% supportive of the long-term needs of the company's growth potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Maher. I'd say first that we principally look at our dividend payout based off of adjusted EPS payout policy, as you said 65% to 75% of adjusted EPS. When you look at it on a free cash flow basis, there really is not a significant difference. Our free cash flow basis payout is at around 65%, maybe a little less. You are right, if you view the CRTC deferral account rebates as a one-time item that would take it down closer to 60%. But the reality is that that's the cash cost that we need to incur this year. So for 2011 we're comfortable with the 7.7% increase in dividend that we announced at the beginning of the year. And in the absence of any significant over performance relative to our guidance targets, that's what we would expect our dividend to be through the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thanks very much. I want to ask you guys about the broadband situation that is going on. A lot of investors are obviously quite concerned about what's going on in the regulatory front with usage-based billing. So perhaps can you give us a little sense of what your fixed broadband ARPU trends are and kind of what the drivers are? And perhaps the revenue drivers that is coming from just people upgrading to higher tiers versus actually usage cap, just to give us a sense as to how &#x2013; what the impact this could be should the government move forward on a more Draconian basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, let me make a few comments so that everybody understands the facts as investors, and then try to address a little bit of what you are saying without giving away competitive information. The first thing everybody needs to realize, in the retail market, meaning our direct end users, for five years in Canada we have had usage based billing. UBB is the term that is used. And even today, as we have said, those clients who go over that monthly amount, it affects less than 10% of the customers. So the first thing is that's been the market for a number of years.</p>
          <p>Second, key point for our shareholders is that cable companies have been allowed for 10 years to charge UBB in the wholesale world. All we are asking the CRTC for was parity with our competitors. And that's what the decision was last week. And it's important to know that less than 1% of users in Canada who would be on wholesale, that's less than 1% of the entire Internet market, are affected by this decision, if you assume the usage.</p>
          <p>So I think there's been some confusion over what the CRTC ruling was about, and we've gone back to clarify that. And we know that the head of the CRTC has taken that file as of last week and is relooking at that process. But that process is around wholesale billing for UBB, not around retail. And there was some early confusion on that.</p>
          <p>In terms of usage billing, we do see some usage billing. We mentioned that every month in our ARPU now. Those are the clients that are exceeding the buckets that they purchased. There are ways to buy buckets that include larger packages. And you're right, we also see increasing ARPU as people upgrade and speeds. We're not going to split that out, for competitive reasons, other than, because we will have other than investors on this call, less than 10% of our users are impacted on even the retail side. Hopefully that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that is. Maybe a quick follow-on then. What is the risk of this migrating over to a retail issue? I know, I understand your point about being a wholesaler and that's how it should be dealt with, but it looks like the government has been more proactive in perhaps trying to make this a retail issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you read the Minister's comments, I can't interpret or make future comments on the government, but if you read the Minister's comments, he has said that what he was talking about was wholesale usage billing. And the comments were, the retail market will take care of itself, and it's a forborne market and it's competitive. So I'm not going to put an assessment. There's always business risk, but if we read the comments and see the comments, this was a file around usage based in wholesale, which, as we mentioned here, is less than 1% of Canadians.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Glen Campbell from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks very much. George, you made some very, I think, confident statements about where you see NAS trends going and ARPU going in 2011. And I'm wondering, we've got about a year's experience now with the wireless new entrants and there's a big concern out there that they're both going to harm ARPU in the wireless side, and, I guess, more important for you, accelerate line losses. Can you tell us what you've learned or what you're thinking that gives you confidence that you won't see those problems in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and Glen, this is always about a &#x2013; it's a good question and it's one we are asked all the time. I think it's been three years in a row we've been able to do a little better on NAS than we all expected and we continue to &#x2013; we don't have a crystal ball on that because there are those risks you've talked about. Our trends would show us that we expect NAS to improve year-over-year. And we think part of that is we now have the triple play or will in core urban markets as we roll out in Toronto and Montreal, which is something we've not had in all markets, as everyone knows, against our competitors on cable. So there's that ability to bundle the triple play in, and that's part of it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you look at the wireless substitution in the marketplace, Canada has had unlimited wireless calling for evening and weekends for over a decade. And the rate plans that are in the market today on voice-only are more competitive than we have seen before. But most people also are interested in the entire smartphone package. So we think one of the reasons you don't see that complete migration is smartphone packages include data pricing in it so you don't get this just unlimited voice packages in the market. That's part of it as well.</p>
          <p>And we don't anticipate ARPU growth at Bell Mobility through the marketplace because of an ability to have any type of pricing power in this competitive intense market we are in, more just through managing mix, Glen. And if we see the upgrades, we would think that should give us the ability to have stable ARPU, and if we are fortunate we'll see that a little more positive through the year. But at a minimum we are hoping the upgrades offset the downward pressure we are clearly seeing on the voice portfolio because of the competitive intensity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up. There are a lot of these unlimited subscribers out there in the market. Have you been able to do any research to identify what they are doing, whether they are keeping landlines, never had them? Is there anything in there that's <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the only thing I would say is we absolutely &#x2013; the only thing we'd say is there is no doubt there is some acceleration every year in wireless substitution and less in the cable companies taking share from us, because now we take share back from them because of the size of their base. So there's some leveling out there, and you've seen that, I think, in Ontario numbers. If you really looked at the NAS that we lost up in the first nine months of the year, they weren't to our cable competitor, they were actually to wireless substitution. So there's that natural migration going on. But I want to caution, I don't want to sound like I was too bullish on the comment other than we are confident based on what we see that we think NAS will improve year-over-year again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just to go back to the wireless EBITDA. If I look &#x2013; you launched HSPA last year and then you've managed the loading and market share shift costs very well up until now. In this quarter it was a surprise, the EBITDA impact. I'm trying to understand really what has changed in this quarter's results and why that shouldn't continue going forward. So if you could look at it really in two parts. First, is there anything in the quarter that we need to know? Was there more migration than what we would've thought, that we've seen in previous quarters, or what happened there?</p>
          <p>And then you talked about the idea that you have made your efforts already to get to change the market share within the market. And maybe you can just explain why you don't have to continue to put the same efforts forward to maintain where the market share is versus to gain that market share. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, if you looked at, for instance, slide 11 of Siim's deck, I mean, the postpaid growth in the fourth quarter was 33% year-over-year. Our overall year growth was 26%, which means the rest of the quarters were not &#x2013; were proportionately lower than the 33%. So that type of growth in postpaid gross adds is absolutely what flowed to the EBITDA. I think the expectations of the Street on postpaid were somewhere of 120,000 and we are 157,000, and that will calculate for everyone. And one of the reasons, to help everyone, we added on slide 12, which we don't normally, if you take a look, we put on an EBITDA before incremental COA expenses, not before all COA expense. We wanted to let it that our &#x2013; make sure the analysts and investors could see that if we hadn't had the incremental volume or the rest of the expenses where we need them to be, and they are. I mean that's really what drove the EBITDA impacted some increase in COA year-over-year.</p>
          <p>You can see that on page 11, as well, where COA in the fourth quarter was up 37% versus 18% year-over-year, and that is as a result of the smartphone mix. But the model we have for next year, and the business plan we have, reflects higher COA for the smartphone, higher cost of retention because of the investment we are required to make, as we talked about, and because it will be accretive. But not an increase in gross adds year-over-year on postpaid that would be 33%. That would be &#x2013; we would love that outcome, but the probability of that, given we were hitting close to 40% share in this highly competitive marketplace, we just think would be not a prudent thing to ask our shareholders to believe we could actually execute on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are increasing our retention spending, as well, up to sort of more industry levels. In the current quarter, we added 150,000 additional retention customers and that had a big impact. We have been doing that steadily through the course of this year. As we get into 2011, we will be more towards the goal of retention spending as a percentage of revenue where we would like to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just one on postpaid growth, as a follow-up. This was the first full quarter you're competing with Videotron and the rest of the new entrants out in the market, yet postpaid growth, as we just said, growth actually accelerated to 33%. So my question is, do you get the sense that market growth is actually accelerating or is it taking greater share from peers? And then just on the back of that, on the new entrant topic, obviously very aggressive promo activity during the quarter. And I'm wondering to what extent you saw any meaningful impact on your business during the quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all, no one else has reported yet, so it's hard on the first one. We are all just going to have to see how the market expanded. Where we have seen an impact for new entrants, I think, trying to be as transparent as I can, is in the prepaid segment. It's the lowest ARPU of the industry and the churn levels I've struggled actually for over a decade to figure out is it NPV neutral, positive or slightly negative. It's always a hard one to be figure out, to be completely honest there. But that's where we've seen the impact. I would anticipate some market expansion given the new entrants and what-have-you, and the strong quarter we had. But it's hard to know until we see everyone's numbers. And as we maintain and have said for two years, the impact in the province of Quebec should be less on us because we have the bundling capabilities. And we'll remain to see whether or not that happens, but clearly in the fourth quarter the evidence would show that we were on the right track on what we thought would happen.</p>

I think someone else brought up the whole deferral account issue, which could be treated as one-time. And so looking at the potential for upside longer-term, I'd like to get your commentary, particularly in the context with one of the offsets to the deferral account going away in 2012, there'd be some pressure on capital intensity. You've managed it in the 16% range, I guess, 18% in wireline, and 11% to 12% in wireless. But you hear on and on again the impact of video on capacity networks. And wondering with that, we're looking at your plan, you are getting into TV, whether there would be some pressure on CapEx longer-term or should we think that as a very manageable issue for the company?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will continue to manage CapEx intensity, we believe in the 16% range. But this isn't a call about 2012, it was guidance for '11. But as we've tried for our investors on this, to give them a sense of the model, we're trying to run the business on that bound -- 16%. We have been able to do that. That's consistent with AT&amp;T, it's consistent with Verizon, and it's consistent with other carriers. So we think that should play itself out. The deferral account is a one-time issue.</p>
          <p>The things going forward for us on '12, our cash taxes grow, but if we are fortunate on the pension, maybe that offsets. As I think Siim said, yes, it's very clear we have some real strong cash flow growth, if not for the one-time deferral account issue. But it is real cash coming out of the company so it's reflected in our guidance. And it's an unfortunate outcome of a decade-long item but we'll get through it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Dvai Ghose from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning, George. If I could just quickly revisit the UBB issue here. I understand your comments as to how it's restricted just to wholesale and wireline at the moment. But you saw earlier this week that Shaw said that they will not introduce bandwidth billing to their Internet customers until they have a dialogue with them. And I suggest that perhaps their customers will tell them they don't want bandwidth billing, so TELUS may be forced to pursue flat rate pricing and MTS and others. Don't you think there's a risk that it would spread across the industry? And what are the implications for over-the-top video?</p>
          <p>And on a related point, on wireless, we've never had unlimited data usage in Canada until recently with the new entrants in the U.S. AT&amp;T tried, has got tiered billing but none of its competitors have matched. Isn't there a risk that you'll be forced to go unlimited on the data wireless side as well as you've had to do on the voice side for wireless?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks, Dvai. What I would say is and I don't want to be &#x2013; there is always risk, because you know that and everyone on the call would know that, as well. I would think the model, the business that we have seen on wireless usage base, which has been adopted literally on a global basis for wireless data, and we are seeing that trend in the U.S., is how we believe that market will evolve and will continue to evolve.</p>
          <p>On the retail side of the Internet, in the markets that Bell competes in, our competitors implemented the tiered pricing for the Internet, frankly, long before we did. It's now a standard in the market where we compete. You're talking about markets that we don't compete in. And I think in those markets that hasn't been their standard mode of operation, as you would know, Dvai, over the last number of years. So we will watch and see how they execute their business.</p>
          <p>But in our marketplace, we're in a forborne price market. That's the regulatory structure that we are in. And as I said before, it's very important, I think, to read carefully what the Minister has said and then what CRTC is doing. And I think we have seen comments from the Minister that in the retail side that's not what his comments were. They were &#x2013; could you relook at the wholesale issue to understand it. I don't think people understood that it was less than 1% of Canadians. And I think Canadians, in general, the concept of if you use more you should pay more, otherwise those that use the average amount are going to subsidize those that use extreme amounts, is a reasonable argument, one you see on every utility business on a global basis. So we'll see how it takes place in the marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a quick follow-up there, George, there was an article in the Globe yesterday commenting about errors in terms of your bandwidth billing. The fact that you've taken that off your system now. Is there a risk that you're going to have to give big rebates and people, consumers may not even trust your bandwidth billing at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we had &#x2013; I think it was about 2,700 people, who we've now talked to individually, of a base of millions, who had seen something in a small billing issue that we have corrected.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. George, could you perhaps just give a bit more color towards your IPTV opportunity? You talked about the 4% stake in the urban markets. Obviously 2 million homes passed by the end of the year, that's a great bit of runway there. Just on your expectations broadly for the demand. And also your ability to install, I guess, would be the key thing as to how the penetration gains are seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Yes, thank you. What I would say is, based on the experience we have seen AT&amp;T have and our, not competitor in the space, competitor in wireless, but we've seen TELUS, as well, that managing the pace of this and the customer experience has been critical to what we're doing. The results from the customers we have, have been actually excellent. Satisfaction levels are the highest of any product we actually have. And so we're feeling quite positive about that but being very deliberate in the rollout of the installations. You are correct. We think the opportunity is significant, given the market share that we have seen other telcos achieve after a period of time in the market. We hope our execution would be similar.</p>
          <p>And secondly, given our expertise in the TV business, we're approximately 25% of the market where we haven't &#x2013; we've had the product on the satellite side, we feel pretty confident but it will take time to build that momentum. We think it will also help us on our broadband solutions into the home for the Internet and provide some defense for us on the NAS because now we can price the three products. And the third product, if you will, in the bundle becoming TV, on par with our competitors where in the past, as you know, we haven't had that TV product. But now it's all up to execution and we will have to show that, and that will be what will drive our results here.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And the last question is from Vince Valentini from TD Newcrest. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. The question is on churn. On both the TV side and the wireless side, postpaid anyway, you went from 1.3 up to 1.5. George, is this what you think is reflective of the new competitive reality out there? Rogers is fighting hard to win back video customers, and obviously there is a lot of competition in the wireless space. Do you think these churn numbers are a blip or is that what you will see throughout 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question. The churn issue for sure, part of it we have seen, and we saw last quarter from everyone else, we will see this quarter, there's no doubt there's a new competitive intensity there. Our investment in upgrades, why we've shown you today that we are going to spend more as a percent of revenue in upgrades, is a reflection that we think we need to move a little more aggressively than we have in the past. So that's reflected in our guidance. So hopefully that will help part of it. So that's the focus that you will see as we go forward. It is important to know that our revenue churn is lower than our subscriber churn.</p>
          <p>In other words, we are losing, where we are finding the issues, is at the lowest end of the market. I think everybody on the line will know what that's about. And quite frankly, we think it's managing the upgrades of our current base a little more aggressively so that we don't lose them to competitors. And that's in the cost structure that we tried to give for this year going forward. And then in terms of predicting the churn rate, I really can't do that other than I would say whatever that churn rate will be is clearly reflected in this guidance.</p>
