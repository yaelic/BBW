        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to be back here in New York and go through with you the 2010 results for this year. 2010 has been a challenging year for us, but we did fully meet our financial guidance made good progress, our operational excellence, initiative and I think most importantly in spite of the aspects, which occurred in our late-stage product pipeline we did progress in important two medicines in late-stage development. And today we have 12 new molecular entities I believe the most promising pipelines in the industry.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look into the slides. We've seen Pharmaceuticals up by 5% excluding Tamiflu local currencies, Diagnostics even up by 8% so there is slight market growth on a Group level 5%. We had to cope with major headwinds in 2010, first of all, as expected Tamiflu sales were down by 2.3 billion sales. You can see that we still have about 900 million sales and I will come back to that when we go into the outlook for the current year. You are all aware of the situation with metastatic breast cancer discussions with the FDA. They have had already an impact on 2010 of CHF125 million. And again, you will see that it continues have an impact for the current year.</p>
          <p>And very importantly, we had to cope with price cuts due to the U.S. Healthcare Reform, the austerity measures in Europe and also, the bi-annual price cuts in Japan. In spite of those healthcare reforms in spite of the pressure on our prices we did keep the momentum both. Now, if we turn to the profitability, we increased profits ahead of sales Core operating profit up by 7%, Core earnings per share up by 10% in local currency. Also our margins increased again on the Group level from 33% to 35% on an operating level. Based on the good results, the Board of Directors proposes to increase the dividend by 10%, which is 6.60.</p>
          <p>The goals have been achieved in 2010 both on the sales and on the earnings level if you now turn into 2011 the priorities are clear first of all, to execute our operational excellence initiative, which we announced last year. But then, very importantly, to drive our future growth by progressing our pipeline, and I think it is good to see how the depth and breadth of our pipeline has developed over the last years with now 12 molecules late-stage.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to point out as well is that six of those new molecular entities are poster-childs (sic) for personalized healthcare. We are hopefully going to launch our BRAF compounds, malignant melanoma this year, there's another five important medicines lining up, medicines, which are clearly tailored to specific patients, but the promise of personalized healthcare is getting real getting to patients.</p>
          <p>To conclude, if we look into our core EPS guidance for 2011, we have announced that we want to increase earnings by single-digits. You see on the one hand the positive effect from our operational excellence initiative, and the remaining synergies from the Genentech integration so that in total its CHF1 billion. We do see organic profit growth, but at the same time, we have to digest major items going through this year.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, continued pressure from the U.S. Healthcare Reform with introduction of exercise tax. You see the full year impact of the price cuts in Europe. We expect lower Tamiflu sales. We still had pandemic sales of 600 to 700 million last year. We are not planning for stockpiling orders by governments in 2011. So, that should result in a normal seasonal flu year of 200 to 300 in sales.</p>
          <p>We have patent expires in certain geographies for Boniva and CellCept. And as you are all aware, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding metastatic breast cancer. We have already seen an impact in 2010, and we expect this clears up to 800 million for metastatic breast cancer as we go into 2011, and the vast majority of this shortfall looks <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Avastin is still growing in the other indications, in particular, in the emerging markets. International market, where penetration rates are very low, but there is no doubt that the ongoing discussion with the FDA impacts us for 2011.</p>
          <p>So that's again a summary on the outlook, and before I hand over to Pascal Soriot for the Pharmaceuticals Division, let me just also take this opportunity to close on a personal note. It's the last time that Erich joins us today here in New York at our Investor Conference, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for the many contributions over 10 years of service with Roche. Erich has built up a first class finance organization during his tenure. And as you are all aware of, he secured the financing of the Genentech acquisition in the midst of the financial crisis with very favorable conditions and this is rightly so, widely regarded as one of his professional masterpieces.</p>
          <p>So Erich, thank you very much, again. Thank you for the many contributions to Roche, also an enormous debt of gratitude for outstanding contributions you made to the successful development of the Group. Thank you very much. With this, thank you.</p>
          <p>With this Pascal over to you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. You can see that Erich loved Asia. He is master of the Japanese bow technique so and very, very well. And it's a pleasure to be here with you today and present these 2010 results for our Pharma Division.</p>
          <p>As Severin told you a minute ago, certainly 2010 was a very eventful year for us and we often felt like we were sailing through a double storm, the external one, that is the so-called healthcare reform in the United States, the very substantial and very aggressive cost reductions we faced in Europe and Japan and internally, of course, we have to deal with a few pipeline setbacks, and the ongoing controversy around Avastin in breast cancer in particular.</p>
          <p>Despite all of this, we are very, very proud of the results, we achieved because if you exclude Tamiflu, which really is a one-off, in a way, the pandemic and sales, of course, declined dramatically because the flu pandemic receded last year, but if you exclude Tamiflu we achieved 5% growth rate at the constant clearance &#x2013; constant exchange rate.</p>
          <p>If you look at the market growth rate, it is actually 1%. I know IMS is reporting 4 to 5%, but we all know that IMS is underestimating the increasing level of rebates that are given to managed care in the United State, and are overestimating the market size, and the growth rates in some countries around the world.</p>
          <p>If you use pharma evaluator, which is collecting real data from companies, the market growth was actually 1% at constant rate and minus 1 or 2 at current exchange rates, so 5% versus 1 as certainly, we believe a very, very good result given the circumstances we were under. The one other point, I would like to attract your attention to here is the growing importance of the so-called international region, this is essentially made of the emerging markets in our construct and that region is almost as big as Western Europe growing by double-digit. So, you can immediately get a sense for the growing importance of those countries on our business.</p>
          <p>If you exclude Tamiflu, but also look at the healthcare reform, and the price reductions in Japan and Europe, essentially the core portfolio grew by 7%. At the end of the day, of course, we have to manage the total top line, but this analysis is giving you, I hope, a good sense that the core portfolio, the core of our portfolio is still very well alive and growing quite nicely.</p>
          <p>If you look at it by product, unsurprisingly, the growth drivers were Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin, as well as Lucentis, but the few points I'd like to attract your attention to here. First of all, in blue international region as you can see for all our products, the international market are representing very large proportion of our total growth. So, despite the questions that have been put to us as far as the ability of those so-called expensive products to grow in the emerging markets, you can see here that we are doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>The second point is maybe a little bit more &#x2013; the third one is that we didn't grow in the U.S. and we don't see any green part on the Avastin line here. We did very well in Japan in yellow, but we didn't grow in the United States. This we expect to continue in 2011. Actually we expect a decline of Avastin in 2011 as our cancer sales continue to decline.</p>
          <p>Lucentis did very well and you can see here our newcomer Actemra, which essentially grew in Europe because we don't have reimbursement around the world yet. And in the United States we didn't have a J-Code last year, so we didn't have reimbursement. We obtained a J-Code in January. Finally, you also see the impact of patent expiry on CellCept.</p>
          <p>Now despite the sales decline we &#x2013; and again, you have to &#x2013; some of the sales decline you have to keep in mind we lost $3 billion, 2.3 billion coming from Tamiflu and 800 million, or so coming from the healthcare reforms around the world. So, 3 billion is pretty substantial amount of top line to deal with, especially because the healthcare reform impact went straight to the bottom line and for a very active cost management started at the beginning of the year, but intensified with the launch of the Operational Excellence program, we still managed to actually deliver an operating profit growth.</p>
          <p>You see here that we actually cemented what we told you at the beginning of 2010 we managed the R&amp;D line <mark type="inaudible" />. That led to an expansion of our operating margin. We are close to 40% now, coming up from 38% in 2009. If we now look at product-to-product, first of all, the oncology franchise overall grew very nicely. Each product: Avastin, MabThera, Herceptin grew by 7 to 9%.</p>
          <p>Here, of course, the impact of breast cancer in the U.S. you see these continued up take on in CLL with MabThera and in NHL in the emerging market, and the impact of maintenance in Europe, impact of the gastric cancer indication for Herceptin in Western Europe. And the negative effect of the price cuts in Japan, which were quite substantial for Herceptin.</p>
          <p>All-in-all a very sustained growth rate for all these products. Avastin on this slide, I guess, the one message I want to leave you with is the breast cancer patient share, which was about 60% as you probably remember historically, and declined rapidly to close to 35% at the end of last year. We expect further decline moving into 2011 due to the confusion that is surrounding the discussion on the breast &#x2013; the indication itself with the FDA, of course.</p>
          <p>Now the international regions now represented here for some reason, disappeared from the chart, the blue part, but we grew 31% in international region and 51% in Japan, as you can see, a fairly sustained growth rate. The other indications are either stable or growing. We are making good progress in Europe with lung cancer. In colorectal cancer across Europe we had 5 &#x2013; 45%, it's stable. It varies of course, by country of course, and I believe we need to make more progress in colorectal cancer across Europe, but overall, no impact of this debate on the other indications, the one indication that was really impacted is breast cancer and particularly in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now moving forward, of course, the challenge is this indication, but there are reasons to believe that after we've kind of washed out the effect on sales of the breast cancer indication, there are reasons to believe that Avastin can grow. First of all, there is still quite a long way to go for Avastin in metastatic colorectal cancer in a number of countries around the world. In Europe, but very much still in the emerging markets where we are only beginning really with Avastin and we've launched in China, and so far we are getting some pretty good results, so that's one growth driver.</p>
          <p>The second one is the treatment duration, and the treatment through multiple lines, the lines with TML study will read out early next year. If the results are what we believe they will be, this will be a reason for extend treatment duration, which is for longer treatment and will of course, be a growth driver for Avastin. And finally, the ovarian cancer indication should help us grow this product. So, given the circumstances we are under &#x2013; we revised the estimated peak sales to around CHF7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now Lucentis grew very, very nicely last year and we really saw a pretty good growth rate in Q4 through longer treatment duration in AMD, but also the launch of the RVO indication. We are making good progress with Lucentis so far in the RVO indication. We are expecting this year a new data in DME and we are awaiting of course, the results of the CATT study, which we expect to come out in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Actemra did very well, everywhere we launched it we've experienced a pretty good response, and you can see the quarterly sales are growing, fourth quarter grew very rapidly and we are gaining &#x2013; we're getting more countries on stream every month as we gain reimbursement, including as I've said the U.S. getting a J-Code in January. So far, the response is very good. We filed for the pediatric arthritis indications, which is a small indication from a strategy point, but a very, very important indication for patients, and those kids are suffering from a terrible disease and clinical results of Actemra are absolutely outstanding and we are looking forward to getting an accelerated approval &#x2013; a priority review, so an early approval for this indication and we also got a label extension.</p>
          <p>Now let me cover a few points, first of all, the emerging markets, as I've said are representing a fairly important part, a very important of our total business. You can see here we have &#x2013; we have experienced a CAGR of about 10% over the last few years. Last year we gained 11% growth rate and all our key products are actually growing very nicely and representing a very substantial part of our total sales. So, that shows that we can do well in the emerging countries, with the kind of portfolio we have. You don't need to have branded generics to do well in those countries, you can also succeed with an innovation driven strategy.</p>
          <p>Second question, I would like to say a few words about, I know it has been on the minds of many people is the Herceptin treatment duration. Now, that we have a study looking at two years of Herceptin versus one year, the HERA study, we expect that it will read out in 2012. There are a number of studies looking shorter treatment durations, usually six months versus 12 months. They are listed here.</p>
          <p>The point I wanted to make to you is that they typically will read out at the same time, or later than our HERA study will read and a number of these studies will actually, after their protocol be terminated if HERA is positive. So, essentially we look forward to the results of HERA. We believe that this study will support longer treatment duration, goes very well with our plan to develop a subcutaneous formulation of Herceptin to facilitate the administration of Herceptin over a longer period of time.</p>
          <p>There is already today a number of patients who are receiving Herceptin for pretty long durations and we are really convinced that this will be a pretty strong growth driver for Herceptin.</p>
          <p>Second thing is biosimilars and I wanted to take the example of Herceptin here. So, what do we do as far as biosimilars? The first thing we do is focus on &#x2013; is in line with our strategy of innovation. It's the focus on moving the standard of care forward. So, if you look at breast cancer across adjuvant first-line and second-line, you can see that all the time we will actually be reshaping the way HER2-positive breast cancer is treated. First of all, we'll introduce the subcu formulation that I was referring to and this will really help longer treatment duration. It will also help improve the tolerability of the administration and suddenly is a way to improve the care of these patients, but also way to perfect Herceptin from biosimilar response.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we will launch pertuzumab in combination with Herceptin. We released the results of the NEOSPHERE study and CLEOPATRA study now is running and we should get results this year in combination with Herceptin. And our goal here is to increase the level of clinical efficacy, again move the standard of care forward and reduce the use of monotherapy Herceptin.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have developed T-DM1 for second and first-line treatment of breast cancer. So, you can see here that essentially the way HER2-positive breast cancer will be treated will change over time, and the place left for Herceptin monotherapy will suddenly be reduced substantially.</p>
          <p>The second message for you today is that in Europe we have essentially biosimilars will impact us the most. We expect an impact of course, but that impact is not going to be a small molecule like erosion curve it's not going to be like Lipitor or some other small molecule losing patent protection.</p>
          <p>Look at what happens in the EPO market or the G-CSF market across Europe and see some effect that it is across Europe because in some countries like Germany the impact is more dramatic than this. But you can see here that the impact on value and volume share is actually not that huge, I mean, of course, the impact is there, but is not a very, very sharp decline like you experience with a small molecule.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the emerging markets there is an opportunity for us to actually introduce a more flexible pricing policy and actually offer proposals to payers, in particular, our public payers in a number of those countries we improve access for patients. Look at China, for instance, as an example, there is only about 7% of patients today who could benefit from Herceptin who receive it and it's essentially out of pocket expense. There is very, very little reimbursement by regional formularies in China.</p>
          <p>In Russia it's a bit better, but there is still an enormous number of patients that are not treated. This is only looking at those patients who are diagnosed. These countries typically what happens is, early breast cancer patients are not well diagnosed, and they are picked up at time they are metastatic.</p>
          <p>What we are now working on is implementing screening campaigns to make sure we actually diagnose those patients early. So, there is an opportunity to actually help patients get access, increase the volume by introducing more flexible pricing policies.</p>
          <p>So in summary, first of all, you have to consider the landscape over the next few years and by geography. First of all, you in the U.S. it's patent protected for both Rituxan and Herceptin, till 2018, 2019. So, we really are talking about Europe, and the rest of the world when we talk about biosimilars. So, in Europe, we are going to move forward the standard of care, as I explained earlier, with new products.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the impact of biosimilars on Herceptin itself will be there, but we believe not as much as in a small molecule. And thirdly in the rest of the world, we think we can grow the volume by reducing our price, lose, of course, some share to the biosimilars, but overall grow our volumes.</p>
          <p>If you combine all of this, we believe that over time we have a chance to actually go the HER2 franchise. This is a schematic representation. We of course, don't disclose any of our internal forecasts, but we believe there is potential for this entire franchise to grow post patent expiry.</p>
          <p>I can finish by sharing with you what the 2011 picture looks like as far as our portfolio and see a lot of activities, a lot of projects are ongoing. We'll have a lot of news, lot of clinical flows throughout 2011. And just let me just highlight a few here.</p>
          <p>BRAF, we recently announced that the BRIM3 study reached its co-primary endpoint Overall Survival and PFS and we terminated the study early. We allowed the patients in the control arm to cross over and receive BRAF. We are now preparing with a great sense of urgency to file with the FDA, the EMA and other agencies around the world.</p>
          <p>Second is pertuzumab, I've talked about the pertuzumab in the last few minutes, the CLEOPATRA study will read out this year and, depending on the strength of the data there is an opportunity there for us to file early in 2011 again.</p>
          <p>And finally, hedgehog in advanced basal cell carcinoma, the Phase II pivotal study that will read out this year could also enable us an early filing. There's many other projects, I don't want to list them all.</p>
          <p>Let me say maybe Actemra, this is a very critical study, the head-to-head study versus Humira. We believe it has the potential to change the way patients are treated in rheumatoid arthritis, break the cycle that exists moving from one anti-TNF to another so a very important study that will also read out this year.</p>
          <p>And so very quickly BRAF, I have talked about it, want to file this year both in the U.S. and Europe on the basis of the BRIM3 study, very, very strong results, extremely strong results, which we will be communicating at this year's <mark type="inaudible" /> Congress.</p>
          <p>The hedgehog, I've also talked about this one, pivotal Phase II data should enable us to file later this year. We will have the data by Q1, for basal cell carcinoma, which is a small indication, but certainly a very important indication, patients don't have many options a sad story for melanoma.</p>
          <p>And finally, the CLEOPATRA study will also read out this year for pertuzumab. We had earlier results with NEOSPHERE, you remember there we showed a very nice pathological complete response rate when combining Herceptin and pertuzumab together with docetaxel. So, clearly a very great opportunity to move the way patients are treated in HER2 breast cancer.</p>
          <p>Finally, to wrap up, those are the priorities that we set ourselves for 2011. We are preparing to launch the BRAF, pertuzumab and hedgehog inhibitor. Launching these products, in particular, BRAF, is actually going to require that our Pharmaceutical Division, and the Diagnostics discovery country-by-country work very close together so we launch the product, and the diagnostic test at the same time, in a very coordinated fashion, so we actually facilitate testing. Typically, what happens with something like this is testing lags and if testing is not well done, then, of course, we impact the utilization of our drugs.</p>
          <p>Second is we will maintain our focus on the emerging markets. We are investing a lot in the emerging countries, in particular, in China. We're investing really a lot in China, expanding our service scores around the county.</p>
          <p>Investment in the late-stage pipeline, we have the message that we need to manage our R&amp;D cost and we are doing this, but certainly we are prioritizing and investing what it takes to progress this pipeline, which is extremely rich.</p>
          <p>And finally, the implementation of our Operation Excellence plan. It started late last year, but we still have quite some work to do this year, particularly in the development area as we are reshaping our organization. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel we've made tremendous progress as a management team that Pascal is now talking about Diagnostics. That's maybe the first time; please remember that.</p>
          <p>If you allow me, I'm not very good behind a podium. So, I'll come down here because part of my objective is to try to &#x2013; for those of you who don't cover diagnostics routinely, is to bring it closer to you. So, I want to physically get closer to you as well.</p>
          <p>Bottom line is for Diagnostics at Roche this year, we had a very strong year. And this was &#x2013; we also face some of the same healthcare constraint that Pascal talked about out there in our markets. We're the number one company in in-vitro diagnostics with 20% share, with the next competitor at 12% share, and despite all of that, we were able to grow almost two-times the global market growth rate at 8%.</p>
          <p>And I believe that says something about the diagnostics industry, by the way, in terms of these pressures on the healthcare markets around the world, that we see an 8% growth in this time period even with pricing pressure, suggests that there is this pull for diagnostics, for a buyer to be able to better allocate healthcare within a calculated budget. And we're certainly seeing that within each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>So what you see here is across each of our businesses, some very healthy growth and I'll tease this apart a little bit for you, but an 8% overall growth in a market that's growing 4 to 5% as the global market leader we're essentially of course, taking share, but we're also creating market in terms of what diagnostics brings to the healthcare environment.</p>
          <p>Regionally, as Pascal presented, we are also experiencing some very significant growth in the emerging markets, but in every single one of our markets we've been successfully growing faster than the market growth rate, for that market by each.</p>
          <p>In the E7 countries alone, in diagnostic now, that accounts for 13% of the overall turnover; that's growing at 21% and China grew 38% <mark type="audio gap" /> greater than 40%. So this infrastructure spend in the emerging markets, when they build up their labs and their hospital base is clearly pulling our products in that direction and we're still at the very early stages of penetration.</p>
          <p>So this is what I am particularly impressed at Roche Diagnostics, which is reshaping the P&amp;L and I said you last year we would do this. We came through with the 8% growth with a 30% core operating profit margin. We improved our operating profit margin by close to 4% as you see on the next slide. And that's driven obviously significantly by the top line sales growth, but also in terms of sustainability for the future, it's driven to a large degree by product mix.</p>
          <p>So the new products that are driving the sales growth are products that have larger gross margin and that's falling down to the bottom line. That combined with an ability to manage the cost line and the R&amp;D line and very importantly, and I have a slide on this, the cost of goods line, the ability to drive our cost ratio much better in relation to our sales ratio, at a 4% cost of sales increase. This in the recent past was growing faster than sales, other than the systems put in to place, I believe it's sustainable that we will see the cost of sales line <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
          <p>So overall, a 30% increase in operating profit margin and this is when I do my little commercial on those of you who haven't yet put diagnostics in your valuation models. I was a little hesitant to ask you last year when we ended up on a slightly different accounting method that Erich will talk about at a 12% margin. But at a 20% margin &#x2013; greater than a 20% margin in a business that has a different risk profile than Pharma, I would ask and urge all of you to take a look at this <mark type="audio gap" /> I think sustainable and a very important part of the Roche engine in addition to what it does diagnostic field, I will give some examples on why I think it brings the group <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>So you see the operating profit margin increasing by 3.6%, that translates through to also the operating free cash flow. Now as I said, why do I think some of this cost of goods is sustainable? Because we systematically put programs in place to be more efficient in driving our economies of scale, particular at the manufacturing. So we have programs that we're now almost two years into driving in terms of manufacturing efficiency. We have more to do there and more savings to get to.</p>
          <p>On the service side, which is a big part of our business, because once we place the systems, service costs are considerable, we've found an ability to deliver best-in-class service a bit more efficiently across our countries, and then finally, this margin mix of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>We also took advantage when the group looked at the operational efficiency programs to consolidate some of our sites. We did this not just for cost reasons, although it is for cost reasons, also because it allows us to streamline our product development. So for instance, we have now our point of care products all being developed in Switzerland versus Switzerland and Austria. And now we've done the same thing for our diabetes care products, <mark type="audio gap" /> diabetes R&amp;D <mark type="audio gap" />. So this will occur over the next couple of years and we'll continue to look for opportunities like this <mark type="audio gap" /> sustainable to <mark type="audio gap" /> improve our business.</p>
          <p>Now just to talk a little bit more about each of the businesses. Professional Diagnostics, our largest business growing at 11%, I'll give you one example next to show what's driving that business. But this is our Clinical Chemistry and our Immunoassay business the large central lab business where we are a significant player here growing significantly faster than the market and you can see our regional mix for the growth pretty equal across the regions <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Diabetes care is the one market within our diagnostics that's suffering a bit more from the economic conditions, overall global diabetes care market is growing at about 1% to 2%, we're still growing faster at 4%. But this is more of consumer led business; discretionary income comes into play as economic cycle puts more pressure on this. But you can see here in Europe we've been successful at driving our new products into the marketplace. Our goal is now to get these outside of Europe, so the type of growth we saw in Europe.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics, we are the world-leading company in Molecular Diagnostics, 30% share. You have to take the next three competitors combined. And yes, at a 4% growth we feel we can do better there. We're getting into some of the high growth businesses this year with our launch into HPV in the United States and then you'll see significant entry into oncology also in molecular diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Applied Science, 4% growth, we were also affected here. This was our Tamiflu effect, so to speak, we did have H1N1 sales in that business in 2009 that we didn't have in 2010, but the underlying business, the core technologies, are growing quite well at high single or <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>And then Tissue Diagnostics, really a growth story here, it's 17%. This &#x2013; remember was the Ventana acquisition several years ago. It's still a business that has its greatest presence in the U.S. and significant opportunity outside the U.S. But even in the U.S. where we have almost an 80% share, we're growing at about 15%, outside the U.S. more than 20%.</p>
          <p>So if you remember, we have razor-razor blade model in diagnostics, and what I want to show you is the power of our installed base out there, when you have a good innovative menu placed onto those. So, once we get our systems in the lab, they are very difficult to displace, and then the key is to get new innovative menu on that system. And I just took one example, which is &#x2013; typical an example, which is our immunoassay business, our largest business in Professional Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>But first of all, I mean, it's nice to see a number like 2 billion on the assay. Close to some of the numbers that Pascal already <mark type="audio gap" />. And the second thing is that this has grown double-digits for the past 10 years. In fact, we probably could have gone a little further past 10 years. But you see here, last year we had a 17% growth on this and this is an example also, the gross margins I spoke about, because the gross margin on the new assays are very strong, <mark type="audio gap" /> So this growth also brings big growth in our bottom line.</p>
          <p>And then an equal example in our second largest business, the diabetes care business, where I've said in Europe we had the new products represented here in the orange line that is penetrating <mark type="audio gap" /> in the marketplace and those are the products we also need to get into <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>So our strategy is focused on two key components because of this razor-razor blade model, it's testing efficiency, which means you get a good instrument into the lab that meets the lab customers <mark type="audio gap" /> and that I think we do well. But here, I would argue, competitors can also do this quite well <mark type="audio gap" /> ahead of <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>But what I want to concentrate is the second aspect of our strategy which is bringing the medical value equation to diagnostics because I believe that that is where we are unique, where we differentiate from the competition, where we leverage our strengths in pharma and diagnostics, where we bring really this value on the reagent business pull- through on our instruments. And we look at it as diagnostics, so those things that are involved in prevention, <mark type="audio gap" /> or therapy monitoring and then we put another bucket above <mark type="audio gap" /> diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Let me just speak about three key events in 2010 and in terms of the R&amp;D portfolio on medical value. This year we have filed similar to files that are done in some respects for pharmaceuticals to demonstrate the clinical value of our assays. Here is also where I believe we can <mark type="audio gap" /> the growth rate of the <mark type="audio gap" />. So three key studies, I won't through go all of them in detail, but just to give you &#x2013; drill down into one example, the ATHENA trial <mark type="audio gap" /> was really a pharma level prospective trial where we <mark type="audio gap" /> 47,000 patients. And what we discovered from this trial is that with our test, you can identify one out of ten women with our test that are missed with a routine Pap screen <mark type="audio gap" /> 10% of the women are missed in a cancer that is the second leading cause of death &#x2013; of cancer death in women and that if it is found early, it's actually quite prevent <mark type="audio gap" />. So here, I mean there is a strong medical case, a strong pharmacogenomic case and we just released the highlights of the data in July of last year and we'll be rolling to subsequent analysis out in the course <mark type="audio gap" />. So this is a game changer in terms of HPV. We also then have a system that is able to identify <mark type="audio gap" /> lab customer base and we will be rolling this out in the largest market <mark type="audio gap" /> 2011 in the U.S., second half in <mark type="audio gap" /> and that's a 250 to <mark type="audio gap" /> U.S. dollar market growth &#x2013; market today growing at double-digits.</p>
          <p>And there is similar examples we have for instance, in our professional diagnostics business, heart failure and looking for proBNP and diabetes care and looking at glucose monitoring. So, this is I believe a unique aspects of Roche because being able to do these trials requires competence that not all diagnostic companies have, and we also leverage greatly the know-how and frankly, also the expertise in pharma to be able to run these trials.</p>
          <p>The other aspect of medical value I just wanted to mention here is the Companion Diagnostics portion that were mentioned by both Severin and Pascal this just represents some of the programs we have in fact, within the Roche Group we have more than 100 collaborations now in the R&amp;D level between diagnostics and pharma really speaks to the innovation driving. We have more than 22 that have Companion Diagnostics hypothesis, and then we have these six, which are our latest stage compounds in Phase II and getting ready to market.</p>
          <p>And couple of points I want to make here and that is that the breadth of Roche Diagnostic's difference <mark type="audio gap" />, because what you see here is three of these come from our tissue diagnostic, <mark type="audio gap" /> two come from molecular diagnostics <mark type="audio gap" /> and one, periostin, comes from our professional diagnostics.</p>
          <p>The reason that's important because you never know where the science is going to reveal sometimes until late phase, sometimes earlier and being able to have the breadth of portfolio means that regardless of where the science goes, we're in a position to be able to supply the diagnostics and help us get a PHC [Personalized Health Care] product onto the market. And we certainly believe as a group, that that is obviously the future of healthcare to be able to target the patient population. Both on obviously regulatory review and approval, but also off take in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So it's not to be underestimated. By the way what it takes to get two groups to work together two R&amp;D groups, two commercial groups, but it has been very successful and Pascal is right, BRAF is the one that we're most focused on now commercially to have a joint launch so there will be a launch in diagnostic that is available on our large installed base throughout the world, so that it has &#x2013; doesn't get in the way at all of patients access for the compound of Pascal's group.</p>
          <p>So in addition to our internal innovation, we've been externally focused too this year. We have two reasonably sized acquisitions which are supportive of our business strategy. Medingo, the patch pump technology, overall business <mark type="audio gap" /> and Bioimagene, which is an important complement to tissue diagnostics by bringing, really tissue diagnostics into the 21st century. Instead of a pathologist always having a look through microscopes at a slide and literally count HER2 &#x2013; the levels to determine whether you are HER3 or HER1-positive. This takes it, puts it into a computer generated image and has an algorithm that allows you to determine more reliably, what's the type of cancer <mark type="audio gap" /> pathologist and oncologist.</p>
          <p>So these are the types of innovation that will help us continue to drive that Tissue Diagnostics growth of 17% also forward into the <mark type="audio gap" />. We had a number interesting research collaborations <mark type="audio gap" /> business in HPV and also freedom to operate on our companion diagnostics is very important <mark type="audio gap" /> EGFR freedom to operate <mark type="inaudible" /> all of which have major programs with Roche.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, I think we're in a good phase right now with Roche and Diagnostics, the commitment level to bring obviously new innovations to marketplace 2011 and it's with that confidence that we say that we intend to continue to grow significantly faster than the market in 2011 as well. And do that with good margins. So we don't intend to go backward in margins. <mark type="audio gap" /></p>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. And I'll turn it over to Erich now to cover the finances.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Great to be back in New York and to see so many familiar figures &#x2013; faces. So, if we &#x2013; okay, if we look at these &#x2013; most of them do not have any surprises for you, but I think some of them deserve some explanation.</p>
          <p>2010 our tax rate was quite high and many of you were concerned that there was a wrong trend in this. I guess the good news is that the full-year 2010 tax rate developed exactly in the right direction. What happened in first half and the second half? One element has to do with the developments in this country, a) remember that the final days actually of 2010 there was a huge struggle in Congress about the big tax bills. Hidden as part of this tax bill, there was also the R&amp;D credit. We were very glad that this actually passed, and we received R&amp;D tax credit. And I think it's also not only a figure, it's really important for us that this country honors investments in R&amp;D. We are one of the largest employers of scientists. I know very well for some of you this is just R&amp;D cost or R&amp;D expenses, but for me, this is building the future. The company dares even in difficult times to really generate important jobs for scientists.</p>
          <p>The other development, which deserves an explanation is of course, the operating free cash flow. Here people could say hey, this is a negative trend, it goes down by 10%, but also here I give you an explanation, which I think is basically understood. We had an excellent Tamiflu year 2009, and especially in the last quarter of 2009, we sold a lot of Tamiflu. And you know that Tamiflu doesn't originate in Roche Group labs. It actually was originated in the labs of Gilead, and therefore, Gilead deserves a nice royalty. And this royalty is usually paid in cash after the quarter that the sales were generated.</p>
          <p>So in January 2010, we have a huge cash out to Gilead for actually the royalties, which happened in the last quarter of 2009. And the other element, which also was at times delay effect was, I think even in this room, the former Genentech management informed you that during taking Genentech private, Genentech employees no longer received any options, but they received a so-called retention program. And the last part of this retention program was actually paid out by the end of March 2010. So, this was also a cashout.</p>
          <p>If we go to the financial expenses there, all these funds we raised in 2009 in March, many of those have an annual coupon, which means accounting-wise of course, the interest expenses are charged to 2009 in their proportion, but cash-wise, it all hit for the first time in March 2010. And therefore, we are absolutely not concerned about the cash flow development I think can be explained.</p>
          <p>If we look at the level of operating profit and of course, after Pascal has explained the development of the Pharma operating profit, and Dan has shown you how great he is doing in diagnostics. And I think that's kind of a promise to do more. If I understand it correct by coming closer to you so, I think there is a positive trend also in there. But what you can see is that we couldn't get it from the market. We had a very rare flat sales, and still, we contributed an increase in operating profit. And of course, here the interactions &#x2013; the integration of Genentech and Roche Pharma USA were important. And again, here, you can read every day, companies are cutting cost. I think it deserves that you look a little bit behind this because just cutting cost in a stupid manner means just putting the same work on less and less shoulders, and this is just not sustainable.</p>
          <p>We tried very much, and also, in the whole operational excellence program, we try to fundamentally reengineer our business. This means we take old processes out, which are no longer done. We do not just try to put the same work on less shoulders. And just to give you an example, we had totally independent IT systems here on the Roche Pharma site in Nutley, and of course, Genentech had their U.S. IT system.</p>
          <p>So to bring these systems better, we actually invested 350 million, to not just only see which system is better, but out of the experience of the two systems to get a much more efficient system for the future, which is also better for our internal customers, for the external customers, and, which is much more cost-effective.</p>
          <p>And I think this was also the driver for the whole operational excellence program that we looked behind just figures, but looked into the processes and wanted to make this look better for the future. And you can see this operating margins, I leave it up to you, every day, our competitors are reporting their figures, and we can lean a little bit back today in the peer comparison.</p>
          <p>We are not leaning back to even improve these margins. But as you will find out, we are quite already in the top quartile of the industry, and we are fighting to be even better. If we go into the details here, and I don't dig into this chart to become too complex, but just one point of reference, Roche was always in the lead supporting very rigid accounting standards. We think it's very important that we have clear accounting standards and that the figures we present actually follow this accounting standard.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we respect that investors would like to see underlying business, and there was always this conflict of interest, because between the accounting standard setters who said everything has to be a strictly according to the rule, and on the other hand, there were the investors saying, hey, can't you show us a little bit where the one-time effects are? Can't you explain it a little bit better, what is the development of the so-called underlying business?</p>
          <p>So what, from this year onwards, you get from us is that absolutely full standard international financial reporting standard accounts, but you get also the so-called core accounts. And the core accounts reflect, from our perspective, the development of the underlying business.</p>
          <p>And of course, since I'd say by our interpretation, we also have to be totally transparent. You have a full bridge in our financial report between the international financial reporting standards account, and these core results. And since it's the first time to show you these figures here, I have the key experts, my top experts in accounting and controlling here, and they will also offer a workshop here, should any questions with these figures arise here.</p>
          <p>If we now go below the operating profit and come to the financial result, we had also, as you can see, the financial result is worse in 2010 than 2009. So, what were the delta, which go down and again, here you see a one-time cost to have a better future, If you remember, we raised all these bonds for the Genentech transaction prior to seeing any swine flu on the horizon.</p>
          <p>So we had a very, very clear financial plan over the next 10 years, and I can tell you this plan is still absolute valid, and suddenly we had an additional 3.5 billion in Tamiflu cash, which came into our company.</p>
          <p>And as you can see, we are fully committed to our bond holders, what we then did in 2010, we actually called one 2012 bond, only $2.5 billion, early. And we even by the end of the year had another extra $1 billion for which we called $1 billion of the 2014 bond early. This gives accounting-wise, this gives a one-time charge now, but on the other hand, of course, it will give a relief in the interest payments in the following years.</p>
          <p>If you go into the so-called ForEx results, this has also clear origins here. We've seen in past calls charts and also, Dan was saying, we have growth rates in China I think 38% and in other smaller markets too. Of course, all &#x2013; many of these international smaller markets have a very volatile currency. And therefore, we always have to charge is it better to take this volatility into our account or to hedge it.</p>
          <p>And there is one currency, I think nobody ever would touch to hedge because this famous gentleman that Venezuela has not only declared his own time zone, he has also declared his own currency exchange rates. So, Mr. Chavez just in December changed the exchange rate, the official one for pharmaceuticals and diagnostics and this has given a one-time hit, which you find there. But altogether, I personally think this is the lowest financial result you should see from Roche. And it should be an upswing into the future.</p>
          <p>This is the cash situation, where you see where we started with our net debt position, very strong operating free cash flow. And then we paid you a nice dividend last year and as Severin has pointed out, the Board of Directors has submitted to the annual shareholders meeting of March 1, an increase of the dividend to CHF6.60 and I can say it, Swiss francs, which means hopefully something to you also as a currency.</p>
          <p>So what you can see, the free cash flow &#x2013; the free cash flow here of 4.7 in a year, which even had some extra effect if you put it in proportion to the remaining net debt then I think you would see why we are fully committed to bringing this company back to a net cash position at the latest by the end of 2014.</p>
          <p>Here, you have the maturity schedule of the bonds, but the next chart, I think is even a little bit better, here you now see how over the next 20 years, the bonds were raised, and you see there is just one 2013 Eurobond remaining, the big green one. You may ask why. Why didn't they call part of this one? And there is just a difference, if you issue American bonds, you have an option to call them. The European bonds do not have such property, so that's why we went for the 2012, and the 2014 bond that you may see this is definitely a maturity profile, which absolutely doesn't mean a huge challenge for Roche to follow.</p>
          <p>And I did this in Europe, but I kept it in also for you. Interesting element, this is the five years credit default swap. For those who are not so familiar with this, this is just the insurance premium at the start of a five-year bond, which you pay to be assured that you get your principal of 100 at the end of five years.</p>
          <p>Interesting element of this chart that Roche was almost debt free in 2009. We had three bonds outstanding of &#x2013; adding up not even to $2 billion and we had a net cash position of CHF23 billion. And still if you wanted to get an insurance coverage for Roche bonds, as you can see you would have paid 72 basis points. What does this mean? We were an absolute nobody, we were not in the United States with bonds. We had no cash program in the United States. So, we were absolutely not on the map, and therefore, the insurance premium was very high. Then we raised over 40 billion in bonds, and then you can see of course, with rating these bonds and with having the financial crisis we shot up to 250, but the good news is, just in the last month, if you look at the developments, it seems for many bond holders or investors safer to entrust money to Roche than to Germany and we consider this as a nice reference to where we have developed. So, this is the balance sheet, which is also getting healthier and healthier by each half year, so we go very confident into the future. And with this I hand over back to Severin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Some pipeline questions on dalcetrapib, I assume you're having the interim &#x2013; interim analysis this year. Two questions on that. I mean, if the efficacy is specifically significant at time of the interim analysis, is the trial set up to early stop? Conversely up to that point have you had any DSMB look on the safety issues on that particular outcome study?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For this &#x2013; I guess two elements to that question. I think you're probably referring when you say &#x2013; when you mention interim analysis, I think you're referring to the interim analysis on the dal-OUTCOMES study. But there is another dimension, which is we are running two studies or we've been running two studies one called dal-VESSEL, and then we will come back to OUTCOME &#x2013; dal-OUTCOMES later. But we've been running a study called dal-VESSEL, which is looking at the effect of dalcetrapib on blood pressure, and the endothelial function and another study called dal-PLAQUE, which is looking at the effect of the dalcetrapib on the plaque itself. Those two studies are safety studies. We will present them at a congress this year.</p>
          <p>The dal-PLAQUE results we just received and we're analyzing them and we're preparing to present them as quickly as we can. I can only tell you that so far the safety data we have seen are very reassuring.</p>
          <p>And then, we have the dal-OUTCOMES study, which is actually a cardiovascular outcome study, and that study has two interim analyses. One at 50% of the events and another one that exists at 70% of events reached. So, the 50% of events reached, we will analyze this year, this is purely a safety analysis that one, so the DSMB will look at the analysis, and tell us whether we should stop or continue and that's all we will know out of this one. I have to say we are relatively comfortable with this analysis considering what we know, or what we've seen in dal-VESSEL and dal-PLAQUE, but of course, we have to wait.</p>
          <p>And then there is another interim analysis when we reach 70% of the events. That one is also an efficacy reading, but it's only next year. So, for this year we'll have no efficacy reading. To answer your question, we'll just have a safety signal. Does that answer your question?</p>

          <p>Well, I mean &#x2013; essentially, you know &#x2013; we think this study is really going to be a very critical study not only for our products, but in terms of the treatment of Alzheimer, because it will also answer with, give some clarity as to the effects of A&#x3B2; on the plaque and also, importantly whether the plaque is indeed the reason for the Alzheimer's disease.</p>
          <p>The thing &#x2013; what we believe of our product is that it is safe. You know that other A&#x3B2; compounds in development have side effects that this one doesn't have, and we developed a subcu formulation because we want to facilitate the administration of this agent over a long period of time.</p>

          <p>Well, I think the subcu will certainly help patients who need to be treated for a long period of time, but really the key, the fundamental question here is whether the drug works or not, of course, you know, and we know from animal model that it removes the plaque, but it is a theory that the plaque, of course, is responsible for the Alzheimer's disease, but there is no proof to this. So, I guess that study will answer not only whether this question of &#x2013; this very fundamental question to Alzheimer's disease.</p>

          <p>Question in the first row, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You have outlined the strategy concerning the Herceptin franchise by changing the paradigm. Can you sort of share your thinking on the Rituxan franchise? How do you see the pressures on that evolving, and what's the importance of your initiatives on protecting that from -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You said the HER2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rituxan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Rituxan franchise. Yes, so I've covered the example of the HER2 franchise. The MabThera franchise, similar situation where Rituxan is patent protected in the United States for most of the decade; so we are really talking Europe and rest of the world.</p>
          <p>And here our strategy is similar to what we're doing with Herceptin. We're developing a subcutaneous formulation that we believe will help us protect this part of the franchise, and we are developing a follow-on agent, GA101, which we believe will increase the efficacy level and help us move again the standard of care.</p>
          <p>It is clear that MabThera doesn't have &#x2013; I mean, within Herceptin, we have a full range of products with T-DM1 pertuzumab and subcu formulation to defend the franchise, MabThera, we are purely relying on GA101, moving the standard of care.</p>
          <p>But again, keep in mind that first of all, in the U.S., we are patent-protected. Two in Europe, biosimilars, let's assume they get approved, which the question is how long does it take them? At some point, they will get approved. The question then is for what indications do they get approval, and how do they extrapolate from one indication to another? So you can imagine that if you get an approval as a biosimilar for NHL ,then you could extrapolate to maintenance NHL. It would be reasonable to assume it could be done with some limited data, but you cannot extrapolate to CLL for example, separate indication.</p>
          <p>So before a biosimilar gets a label that is as expansive as the Rituxan label, it will really take them quite an amount of time. And so by then, we will have hopefully developed GA101.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Essentially, we want to lift the efficacy level, and you know we certainly &#x2013; so far, we have response rates that are elevated by 30%-plus, and so that's basically what we're actually targeting in our late-stage program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a question in the back, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How will treatments in patients change that go from the way you dose Herceptin now, as opposed to a subcu Herceptin as far as dosing, and how often you get treated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I hope I'm getting your question right. I mean, essentially we can just &#x2013; we are going to move from an IV formulation to a subcu formulation, so it's relatively simple. The only difference between the two is that IV formulation, the administration is &#x2013; the dose is weight-based, whereas for the subcu we have a flat dose. That's a difference, but from a clinical practice viewpoint, it's not such a big difference, it's actually simpler with a flat dose, and it will be given subcutaneously.</p>
          <p>And I believe it is really important. First of all, because the other data we have tends to indicate that we have less infusion reactions, less reactions to the administration of the drug, but more importantly, if the HER2 study shows that two years of Herceptin is better than one year, then compliance will become an issue. People would think you have breast cancer, if your doctor tells you, you need to take Herceptin for two years, as a patient, you're going to take it.</p>
          <p>The reality is not like this, the reality is that when patients start feeling better, they want to stop the drug, and what we see from our research is subcu formulation really helps because they feel, that they are under control, that they have moved on, they're no longer a cancer patient, and they are just taking subcu formulation as opposed to going to an IV. So, it really helps them psychologically. And it helps with the compliance. In fact, without the subcu formulation, our forecast would be that the average treatment duration, which is about 48, 50 weeks today with Herceptin would increase, but not to two years, it would increase only 20% to 30% based on the research we have done, So the subcu I think will really help drive that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I read somewhere that you have a new drug for lung disease or lung cancer. Can you talk a little about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have moved &#x2013; or we are in the process of moving a monoclonal antibody, which blocks the c-MET receptor on lung cancer cells into Phase III. And we have communicated positive Phase II results. So, we are moving this now into pivotal trials. It's one of the 12 new molecular entities, which you find on this list of our late-stage portfolio. Now, it's called MetMAb, so it's a monoclonal antibody, which docks on the c-Met receptor, and it's developed in combination with Tarceva. And we have seen very good results when combining this MetMAb with Tarceva in c-Met positive patients. So, it's a very interesting example for personalized healthcare, because we can stratify a bit like HER2 and Herceptin. We can stratify patients into those where we expect good response and into those that we would not expect the response.</p>
          <p>What I find really exciting with this phase II data is that our hypothesis originally was, if you have a high expression of c-Met receptors the drug should work very well. If you have a low expression of c-Met receptors, you should have no effect of the drug, a bit like Herceptin.</p>
          <p>Now, what turned out to be the case is that indeed, if you have a high reception &#x2013; at high expression, as expected, you have a good efficacy. But very interesting, if the expression of c-Met was low, we had actually negative clinical outcome. So, it was worth treating with this monoclonal antibody.</p>
          <p>Now what that tells you is that if we would have developed this drug in the traditional way, the positive events would have been compensated by the negative events, we would have seen no efficacy, and we would have said well, probably there was something wrong with the hypothesis, and it just doesn't work, or there are some other effects, which we don't understand.</p>
          <p>Only due to the fact that we have the stratification, only due to the fact that we could closely collaborate between pharma and diagnostics, in this case with Ventana for a very specific c-Met tissue test, we have now a very promising drug in late-stage development. So, it's hopefully one of the next poster childs of personalized healthcare. And you know there is a huge medical need still in lung cancer. So, let's keep fingers crossed, the data are confirmed in the late-stage pivotal trials, very exciting data coming through.</p>
          <p>Do we have more questions? Yes, another one here in the second row.</p>

          <p>Yeah, well, the only information I can really share today is that as you know, we've requested a hearing. We are waiting to hear from the FDA whether we will be granted a hearing. And we should hear from them in the next few weeks, and that's as much as I can tell you for today. They can deny a hearing, yes, and then technically, we have another option to go further with this, but essentially, we are waiting to hear from them, and then we &#x2013; based on their response, we'll just have to decide what we do from there.</p>

          <p>Second-line, we got a complete response letter for that application. And I think we are looking at what our plans moving forward are, but essentially at this point in time, we have a &#x2013; we were rejected, we had a complete response letter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But did -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the most important step for us is really what happens to the first-line indication, and so if we lose it, if we had to withdraw the indication ultimately, of course, that would have an impact, and that's basically the rationale behind the steady decline that we are forecasting at this point in the United States in breast cancer, but also elsewhere in the world, because even though European authorities reconfirmed the indication, essentially, the payers might actually challenge us on the basis of the situation in the United States. But this is really an important point to keep in mind.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we got a confirmation and in the U.S., we've got the NCCN Guidelines that reconfirmed their recommendation that Avastin is a useful option in the treatment of breast cancer, and they did that almost at the same time, as the &#x2013; knowing full well that the FDA was reviewing the indication with a negative view to it. But it's a very complicated situation, as you can imagine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it impacts us on the sales, but I would emphasize, and I said this before, it's after all a big disappointment for women in the U.S. They have taken away this option to treat a devastating disease, where the European authorities have clearly stated the benefit for Avastin also in the indication of breast cancer. So, that's where we are, and the harsh reality is that oncologists are insecure.</p>
          <p>What does this mean for reimbursement? If I take new women on the treatment, will reimbursement be insured as we go forward, given the pending discussion with the FDA, and we see penetration rates coming down, so we have flagged this to you from the shareholder point of view in terms of our guidance for next year. But really, the sad news is for women in the U.S., who do not have access to this treatment option. Yes, please. If you could pass that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If this discussion with the FDA decides the data you have provided on &#x2013; or supports the prognosis that was going to be based on this data you've provided in other words, that your data is good and you are successful so it should go with you, is there something wrong with the data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, of course, data need to be interpreted, and people take different views. And I prefer the interpretation of the European authorities rather than our own interpretation because people might assume that I'm biased as the manufacturer of this drug. So, all I can say is that the scientists in Europe take a very different stance on the drug. They feel it is a very important treatment option, and if you read the press release, which EMEA did at the same time when the FDA communicated that they would withdraw the label for this indication, it was also worded in a very, very positive and strong way.</p>
          <p>So the European authorities clearly positioned themselves in that specific question against the FDA. What I'd also like to emphasize is that the Europeans took a very differentiated view. So, they looked at the various combinations of Avastin with different types of chemotherapies, and they were very specific on those chemotherapies where they think there is less value for patients and in particular, Taxo, and they felt that the clinical benefit is given. So, we feel that the doctors in the U.S. should have the choice to give Avastin to women. Actually the NCCN guidelines, which are the guidelines by the physicians, very much confirm that view, but FDA takes a different position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a critical message that two different, two reasonable people can have a different view, looking at same data as far as the interpretation. And again, in Europe, <mark type="inaudible" /> there concluded the NCCN guidelines they are closer to you because they are issued by a group of the top breast cancer experts, not a group of general oncology. Those are the best breast cancer experts in the United States, and their guidelines would confirm the use of Avastin in breast cancer in combination with Taxo. So, it is of course, a pretty confusing kind of a situation, and really, a question of interpretation of data in front of us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What assumption is included in your long term Avastin guidance for ovarian cancer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The ovarian cancer is included in the guidance for peak sales. We're not specifying exactly how much we expect for ovarian cancer, but we did indicate value on this could be well between 500 million and 1 billion. So, we are not giving an exact number here, but we are giving the peak sales for the entire Avastin franchise.</p>
          <p>Yes, a question, here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Potentially both T-DM1 and pertuzumab may be approved in first-line and second-line metastatic breast cancer. I was wondering how Roche would position those two drugs if they both reach the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if at some point the question would be asked to Danny, when does he reach 40% operating margin? [Laughter]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much. The combination of pertuzumab and T-DM1 as I showed you on my chart, we see pertuzumab in combination with Herceptin as the ideal treatment for the adjuvant setting, and we have a program running in the adjuvant setting, and also, first-line setting.</p>
          <p>T-DM1 in combination with docetaxel or any taxane, I should say, we see as a good option as a <mark type="inaudible" /> agent. And we are also &#x2013; we see a place for it in combination with trastuzumab in second-line, potentially even without taxane, so it would be trastuzumab plus T-DM1. So, we see the combination of taxane, Herceptin more as adjuvant first-line and T-DM1 coming in later lines of treatment. But I'm showing combination with trastuzumab as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is of course, an exciting proposition if we can work both on the tolerability with the T-DM1 because we eventually replace chemotherapy and at the same time, can increase the efficacy with pertuzumab, but that would really shift the standard of care in this important disease, both on efficacy and on the safety dimension.</p>
          <p>If you can take the question in back, and then move forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is for Pascal. He was talking about flexible reimbursement plans in emerging markets to improve penetration rates in markets such as China and Russia. If you could maybe give us some examples of those flexible arrangements, and how they might work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I was general on purpose because the plans &#x2013; we have a variety of options. Some of those are essentially &#x2013; some of those &#x2013; I mean, and those plans can range for a reduction of our price &#x2013; simple reduction of our price provided we get extended access, and broader access in a certain geography.</p>
          <p>In some other cases, we are looking at packages when we actually provide testing, screening, support to screening campaigns because in many of those countries the issue is, as I said a bit earlier, women with early breast cancer are not diagnosed early enough.</p>
          <p>And I was explaining the other day to a group of people. If you compare, say, Poland and Spain, which have very similar population and quite frankly, Poland is not even what you would call an emerging market, it's closer to Europe. But still you see similar population, same number of metastatic breast cancer patients, but much lower number of adjuvant breast cancer patients.</p>
          <p>So people tell you, there is no breast cancer in our country. The reality is that, unfortunately, patients are not diagnosed early enough, and they are only diagnosed when they get to the metastatic setting.</p>
          <p>So really the key is to diagnose them early enough so we can save their lives, because when you treat them in the adjuvant setting, you talk about saving lives. When you treat the patients in the metastatic setting, you unfortunately typically only talk about extending lives.</p>
          <p>So often what we try to do is, offer to provide free screening campaigns and sometimes testing, in particular, the Ventana test for HER2 testing. So, there is a &#x2013; in other cases we have &#x2013; we're doing like an example with Pegasys in Egypt, since where we have two trademarks. One is Pegasys for the private market, and another one is a different brand to supply the public market where we sell to the government at a totally different price point.</p>
          <p>Another example, in Morocco we have tier pricing. So, we have all sorts of options, ranging from the very simple price reduction to tier pricing to package offers, all sorts of things here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important element, if I just may add to Pascal's comment is, when you go and discuss with government in the emerging markets on pricing, really the important element is that then you really get access, that access is increased, and that can be very lengthy discussions. And I would not see certainly a sudden change in the dynamics. This is really step-by-step &#x2013; almost on a deal basis where you are in discussions with government officials, and we would only go for a price reduction if we see an increase in volume. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense neither for patients in those countries concerned, nor for ourselves, but it's not a process which is going to happen overnight. I think this is something, which we will see being implemented over a longer timeframe.</p>
          <p>I think we had another question here in the third row, and then back over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Two questions for Dan. First is on margins -</p>
          <p>[Laughter]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter] The 40% number -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you did identify in your presentation the effect of mix on margins for your business. The ongoing effects of the manufacturing actions you have taken in the last couple of years, and then you have still ahead of you some of the contribution from operational excellence, where would those factors bring your segment margins? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second is, Erich has painted a picture for the next number of years after he has left that the business is going to really be putting free cash flow towards deleveraging. Are you not going to be looking for acquisitions? If you are not, does that inhibit at all your ability to grow ahead of your industry for the next number of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. First of all, on the margin side, yeah. I believe when we look at the four percentage point margin increase, there are significant product mix issues in there, as well as operational efficiency, so product mix I really think is sustainable. And also, the operational efficiency is obviously year-on-year. In this business, given the dynamics of the business, we're seeing margins in the range of 17%, 18% to 22%, 23%, so to speak.</p>
          <p>Yeah. I believe given our size, given our economies of scale, given our penetration level, we should be at the upper end of that range and driving that. However, you know, continuing to reinvest in the business, clearly particularly with some of the medical value components that I spoke about up there, I mean, those will require investments, particularly, if you want to see value-based pricing more so in diagnostics than we've seen today.</p>
          <p>So we don't guide specifically on the margin and certainly, 40% would be a nice dream. But I do believe that we should be very competitive on the margin side just as we are on the share side and on the volume side.</p>
          <p>But relative to your question relating to acquisitions absolutely we want to remain flexible for that I believe the Ventana acquisition was really the last significant piece in the in-vitro diagnostic puzzle that we didn't have a good presence in. With the Ventana acquisition we've basically covered the front. I mean, we cover everything from proteins to DNA to RNA to tissue-based diagnostics. So, from the overall big piece puzzle of in-vitro diagnostics I think we're quite complete. However, we want to continue to do these types of acquisitions that I spoke about in the past.</p>
          <p>I mean, looking at a continuum of care in diabetes, and how do we get to the artificial pancreas, and what components do we continue to need either within or with outside our company for Tissue Diagnostics. So, I think we'll see these bolt-on type acquisitions, and then the other area that we have to be very keen about in addition to our own internal research is the fast emerging areas of diagnostics.</p>
          <p>And that's where you saw the research collaborations, for instance, in sequencing, I mean, to use Erich's famous S-curve comment, that's diagnostics, the fastest S-curve generation I've seen so far is in the area of sequencing. I mean, getting to this single strand sequencing, this $100 genome, or the $1,000 genome I think will come over the course of the next five years.</p>
          <p>So what we're trying to do is, first of all, protect support our in vitro &#x2013; our in-vivo sequencing business, the 454, but place a number of bets out there in the mid-term to make sure we don't miss the next S-curve. So, all these things are very important and that's why I also say I mean, the margins we should be competitive with, but we should &#x2013; I mean, you could manage this business, for a margin that is much higher than that, but I think you would cut out your longer term future doing that in this business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the point was made that you hope to have 10 new compounds on the market in three years, I don't have the exact quote, but that's the gist of it. That would give you probably the largest new market share in the business in the United States, if you are successful. Is that your expectation that you will be successful often enough in the next three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The comment was really relating to the 12 new molecular entities in late-stage, and of course, we hope for as many to be filed and come through to the market, but I also want to manage expectations. It is unlikely that all of them will make it and all of them will make it especially in this short timeframe.</p>
          <p>Now very concretely, the BRAF, based on the early termination of the BRIM trial two weeks ago, we are now very confident to not only file this year, but hopefully have accelerated approval especially here in the U.S. and be able to launch the product already this year.</p>
          <p>The two other products, which are imminent for filing, provided that the data read out positively, is Hedgehog and is pertuzumab. The other compounds will follow step-by-step, not all of them would be launched within this timeframe, but we hope that as many of them will make it.</p>
          <p>So it's really reading the crystal ball. How many of those will make it, but what I would say is that if you look at the compounds, they are really shifting the standard of care. So, if they make it, they make a difference for patients. They really make a difference in the practice of medicine, and therefore, I think we are particularly well-positioned in few of the increasing pressures, which we see in the healthcare system. I do think it's not only a matter of the quantity of the compounds, which you are getting through. It's increasingly a matter of the quality of the compounds, which you have in your pipeline.</p>
          <p>I think increasingly this is what will count because if resources are getting tighter, if the pressure on prices is getting higher. I mean, eventually payers will allocate the resources to products and solutions where you have a real difference for patients, where you prolong life, where you increase the quality of life, I'm totally convinced of that.</p>
          <p>I think especially these times where we have this huge price pressure, I'm convinced that with our focused strategy on hi-tech innovation, our strategy of combining the expertise between pharma and diagnostics, we are well-positioned. Then we'll see in a couple of years how many made it. But those, which made it I'm sure have a very good prospect.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Do we have other questions? Yes, there are two questions on that side if we start here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question for Daniel, one general, and then one more specific. I'd be interested in your comments on how important you think the shift in point of care is within the diagnostics space? And on the second question, specifically how do I understand the HPV opportunity? Is it going after the traditional Pap market or is it also going after existing HPV diagnostics in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. On the point of care shift, I mean, we see this as an important future trend, for sure, in the diagnostics environment. The question will really be in terms of the economics just to step back from it.</p>
          <p>Principally, point of care tests are higher cost tests, higher cost of goods test, but they give a quicker results. So, the real question, when looking at point of care for us is, is there a benefit to that rapidity in results. And if there is &#x2013; if there is something a clinician can do in a short period of time, so things like emergency room, cardiovascular testing, very clear they can do something. If it's an oncology point-of-care test, where you get the result in one hour versus overnight &#x2013; I'm sorry to say that that's not really such a benefit.</p>
          <p>So if what we see dynamically is if it makes a difference, that will drive it towards point of care and we want to be in that. If it doesn't, the economies will shift it to the central lab work, because as long as you can do it overnight and do it in a large reference lab, that's always going to be more efficient and more cost-efficient.</p>
          <p>So we're keen on that sector. The other thing that's very important in that sector strategically is reproducibility of results, also similar to the central lab and IT connectivity and workflow.</p>
          <p>So we see it as very important, but if you have a point-of-care test, a clinician or patient should be able to get the exact same quality as if it were done in the central lab because oftentimes patients are going between these different satellite centers or hospital centers. And so that's another feature in terms of reliable results that we look at, and then have the IT system to be able to record that result regardless of where it's taken and done so you have those patient's record that's consistent.</p>
          <p>On the HPV opportunity, our clear strategy is to &#x2013; is to first of all &#x2013; in most countries it will be &#x2013; sorry, in United States it will be a test that's used in conjunction with Pap initially, as it is today with the competitive products on the marketplace. And because that's the largest market, our first strategy is share displace of the current on market HPV DNA test and we feel that we have significantly differentiated data, and the systems specifically because we can separate out 16 and 18 and have the clinical data to do that.</p>
          <p>So that's the short-term, more displacing the current HPV Test. Longer-term, however, particularly with the results of the ATHENA trial, we think we can really displace Pap in a primary screening setting. And that's why the ATHENA trial is also a three year follow-up longitudinal study. We have data we'll be reading out over the course of the next two to three years and presuming you can demonstrate that with an HPV DNA Test 16 and 18 that you can identify women with cervical cancer better than Pap, and by the way over the course of three years they don't develop Pap, they don't develop cervical cancer or HPV 16 or 18. You can change the market from an annual Pap smear to a once every three year HPV DNA Test.</p>
          <p>And particularly in Europe that's going to be important, because in Europe we don't see co-testing being supported by the healthcare systems, frankly. I mean, they will either continue to do Pap or they will switch to HPV, but they are unlikely to do two test strategies just for simple economic reasons.</p>
          <p>So that's our strategy also particularly ex-US is to look at the strong ATHENA data to get countries to look at replacing Paps with HPV and better and more accurate diagnostics.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question here in the last row, and then perhaps one last question. Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another diagnostic question. You mentioned in your presentation about the IP protection on your new <mark type="inaudible" /> (101.21) molecular markers. Taking into consideration of the recent U.S. Patent Court decision against Myriad on the patentability of genes, should the Supreme Court actually uphold that decision, looking across Roche's &#x2013; or any diagnostic portfolio in your company, does that have any meaningful implications for you, if you no longer have the ability to patent &#x2013; to protect the genes &#x2013; the diagnostic based on the gene patent? Conversely does that open up new business opportunities for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, our feeling on that, I mean, our feeling on that is that gene based intellectual property will continue to be upheld in the marketplace. The Myriad case is a specific case, and it deals with the strength of the Myriad patent situation as well, which I obviously won't comment on in any detail, nor have I any right to do that. But from our intelligence, and what we know about it, we think it's very unlikely to go to a stage where they say there is absolutely no ability to protect IP associated with a biomarker used in Diagnostics. And I think that would really be stifling to innovation around the world. So, that's &#x2013; I mean, that's our current view on it I have to say. And our model &#x2013; our business model does of course, rely to a certain extend on IP, but very differently from pharma.</p>
          <p>So yes, we have IP on some assays, but many assays have open IP and even with that, we compete from a different barrier to entry and that is that on our systems, the way that we sell our systems is by being able to have breadth of menu, and then unique menu on one system. So, I would say that we really look to have unique menu, whether it's IP-protected or not, and that's what really makes the difference in terms of the sale of our system versus a competitive system out there in the marketplace. But of course, we are always looking to protect IP whenever we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is also more common in the diagnostics industry that you exchange IP so if you have specific IP in the pharma industry, then you stick to your IP and you develop your product for the market. Very often what you see in the diagnostics industry is that the players have mutual interest to exchange IP. If you look into the history of Roche, we very often took an approach to make our IP available for other players, and I think it was a good strategy. I mean, first all from a financial point of view it's resulted in royalty income for us, but also by doing that you set a standard in the market.</p>
          <p>Probably the best example is the PCR patents, which we actively out license. But we did this with other parameters. One example, which Dan showed on the &#x2013; on his slide was NT-proBNP. So, we've been actively out-licensing NT-proBNP to set the standard in the market.</p>
          <p>And likewise, we have also the possibility to access IP, which is provided by our company. So, we have seen each year far up there which we're licensing from Genzyme in this specific case and other parameters. So, the dynamics in terms of how the industry operates in IP is different between diagnostics and pharma. And you can see &#x2013; immediately see why this is the case, because you would stifle the growth of the market for all players if you cannot develop a menu on the platform. Imagine everybody who has IP needs to place an instrument in the lab. I mean, there comes a point when you get to a space limitation, if you need for every new test, a new instrument. So, all the players have an incentive to exchange IP.</p>
          <p>But having said this, it's an important element of driving the business and I believe in this combination between pharma and diagnostics we have a particular good opportunity to generate IP with the expertise of pharma and also, with the possibility to &#x2013; if you almost like, free ride on the clinical trials, which are done in pharma.</p>
          <p>If you look at BRAF for example, no other company in the world could develop a new BRAF test as we can, and the simple reason is because our own test is part of the clinical trials, and the filing of the BRAF inhibitor, and there is a number of other examples in our pipeline.</p>
          <p>Look at the c-MET test that we discussed beforehand for lung cancer, a very similar situation or if you look at periostin for IL-13, we have specific opportunities here, but we would always consider to provide such IP to other players to set the standard in the market and to drive menu expansion across different platforms.</p>
