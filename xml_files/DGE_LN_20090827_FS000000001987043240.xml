        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for your time today. We're going to stay with the format we've used previously in these results webcast. Firstly, Nick and I will take you through the results we released this morning in some more detail, and then we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>At that point, we'll be joined by our four regional Presidents, Stuart Fletcher, Ivan Menezes, Andrew Morgan and Gilbert Ghostine, who is appointed President of Diageo's Asia-Pacific region from July the 1st. We also have Andy Fennell, our Chief Marketing Officer with us today as well.</p>
          <p>This year, Diageo has, like every global company, faced unprecedented challenges as a result of the economic environment. However, Diageo's position as the leading full-line beverage alcohol company gives us the brand and category range to respond to changes in consumer and customer demand. Therefore even in this tough environment, we have been resilient.</p>
          <p>We held net sales constant in organic terms. While, overall net sales benefited from favorable exchange and from the brands that we've added in the year.</p>
          <p>We delivered 4% organic operating profit with overall growth also benefiting from ForEx and our brand additions. We've achieved 10% growth in reported EPS, in line with our expectations. Our free cash flow is &#xA3;1.2 billion. We distributed &#xA3;870 million in dividends in the year, and as a sign of our confidence in our performance, we are recommending a 5% increase in the final dividend, which is the same level of increase delivered over the last few years. In addition, we returned &#xA3;352 million in share buybacks in the first half.</p>
          <p>We've delivered a set of results, which demonstrate the strengths of our business. Diageo's core strengths is the range of our brands and our global reach. We have consistently invested to strengthen the business, building well supported brands and effective routes to market. Consequently, in a difficult year, we had been able to access growth across a varied landscape of markets and categories. For example, scotch, wine and gin have been difficult categories. But we've delivered growth in vodka, rum, tequila and beer.</p>
          <p>Similarly, the impact of the economic decline across most of Europe has been more than offset by the growth we've delivered primarily across Africa, but also Great Britain, North America, Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil, and in Korea, Japan, Thailand and Taiwan.</p>
          <p>During the year, we refocused our marketing activity against growing brands on markets. We used our scale to optimize the effect of media rate deflation and we have changed our marketing mix as consumer trends changed in the economic downturn. Our marketing campaigns are reaching our consumers in effective new ways, and in important market such as the U.S., we have increased our share of voice.</p>
          <p>Innovation continues to widen our brand reach, and enables us to meet changing consumer trends and provide our customers with new sales opportunities. And in a difficult year, we were quick to reduce costs, so that we can both invest for the future and grow this business in fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>We have focused our global restructuring program on ensuring that the Diageo continues to be agile in what is still an uncertain global economy.</p>
          <p>I am going to return to some of these things later. But first Nick is going to take you through the financials in further detail. Nick?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Looking first at net sales. Although overall, we saw no organic growth, we did see strong performance in our beer business, primarily in Africa, but also another parts of the world. And in total, beer delivered 5% net sales growth. Within spirits, the vodka category was more resilient in the economic slowdown, and we grew NSV by 8% participating in the premium segment through Smirnoff and a higher price points with C&#xEE;roc and Ketel One. The brand additions of Ketel One vodka, Rosenblum Cellars and Zacapa rum have performed well, contributing &#xA3;151 million to reported net sales.</p>
          <p>And finally, our business also benefited from significant exchange rate movements, which added over &#xA3;1 billion to reported NSV, as the U.S. dollar translation rate moved from 2.01 to 1.60 and the euro translation rate moved from 1.36 to 1.17.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the slide, organic volumes declined 4%, while net sales remained flat. The decline of the ready-to-drink segment in North America and Europe and the impact of excise duty increases in Australia led to an 11% decline in ready-to-drink volume.</p>
          <p>Overall category declines in scotch, coupled with the continuation of our value strategy, led to a decline in Scotch volume. This is was offset by eight percentage points of price mix as we chose not to compete at certain price points in certain countries. The strategy can be seen most vividly in secondary scotch, where our volumes reduced 23%, but with 15 percentage points of positive price and mix.</p>
          <p>Innovation made a significant contribution in fiscal '09, resulting in an increase of over &#xA3;100 million to net sales. And we are particularly proud of having full of the top five product launches in U.S. spirits this year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to organic net sales growth on a regional basis, performance was mixed, reflecting both the macroeconomic environment and our product mix across regions. In North America, the total beverage alcohol market remained in growth. Strong performances by our core brands within the premium segments, Smirnoff and Captain Morgan and Cuervo, were supported by the contribution from innovation and the continued growth of C&#xEE;roc vodka where the combination of Diageo, Sean Combs and the brand itself continued to drive out-performance against the segment.</p>
          <p>The spirits market grew in Canada and price increases taken on core brands in the first half, plus an increase in marketing spend throughout the year, led to net sales growth of 7%. The other three regions are clearly more multi-market, and so let's now look at those in a bit more detail.</p>
          <p>Europe was severely impacted by the economic downturn with conditions in Spain and Ireland proving difficult throughout the year. And these two markets alone contributed over 80% of the net sales decline. We also saw the trading conditions in Russia deteriorate significantly in the second half of fiscal '09. Against this, GB outperformed, delivering overall NSV growth as a result of strong Christmas sales.</p>
          <p>In International, net sales grew 7%. Beer in Africa delivered 19% NSV growth. And price increases across our scotch brands in Latin America delivered 19 percentage points of price and mix. Net sales in our global travel and Middle East business declined 13%, a sharp reduction in passenger numbers, plus destocking in the travel retail channel drove this decline. In contrast, we delivered net sales growth in the Middle East and North Africa, particularly from Johnnie Walker.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific was impacted by the 2008 excise duty increase on ready-to-drink in Australia, which reduced overall net sales growth in the region by four percentage points. In addition, the region was impacted by reduced sales through the on-trade channel and destocking throughout the supply chain. This was particularly evident in the markets of Southeast Asia and the Southern and Eastern regions of China, which account for the majority of scotch sales in that country.</p>
          <p>On the upside, Korea was a significant highlight as we returned to in-market distribution, and Windsor and Johnnie Walker both posted net sales growth and share gains. Excluding RTD, Australia grew net sales 11% with good performance from Smirnoff, Bundaberg and innovation.</p>
          <p>Moving to our second half performance, the worsening global situation, which started in mid-November is reflected in the decline in volume and net sales in H2. Looking at the second half performance by quarter, our Q3 performance was impacted by the significant stock reduction in the U.S. on our spirits brands. In fiscal 2010, I expect our volume performance to be stronger, but I don't expect us to achieve as much price and mix. The decline in scotch volume accounted for over 60% of our overall volume decline. The reduction in the volume of scotch brands at lower price points, which we orchestrated together with the price increases we again put through on scotch, also accounted for over 60% of the overall price and mix we achieved.</p>
          <p>As we now have scotch supply and demand broadly in line with our long-term projections, I anticipate a closer relationship between volume and net sales. Given the economic volatility we've seen this year, our quarterly performance has been varied. Net sales growth in quarter one was 6% with 1% in Q2.</p>
          <p>And there was a similar variation between Q3 and Q4. This means that as we comp these quarters in fiscal 2010, we expect to have a similarly variable performance between quarters, with the H1 performance much weaker than H2.</p>
          <p>Reported operating profit, excluding exceptional, grew by &#xA3;309 million to &#xA3;2.6 billion, within this organic growth contributed &#xA3;99 million in the year and therefore organic operating margin improved by 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>Cost of goods increased on the like-for-like basis by about 6% as we anticipated. This was more than the price increases we implemented. And in addition, we experience some mix deterioration and excise duties increased in Great Britain and Australia, and therefore, gross margin declined. This was offset by a 9% reduction in marketing spend, as we are able to benefit from media rate deflation in many markets around the world. We also reduced overall marketing spend behind certain brands and segments that were most impacted by the economic climate. In the U.S., we increased our share of voice, and in Latin America we've maintained our significant leadership in share of voice, and Paul will cover this in more detail later.</p>
          <p>While the full benefits of our global restructuring program will accrue in fiscal '10, we reduced overhead spend this year, which allowed us to fully fund the growth opportunities available to us while still delivering four percentage points of positive gearing from organic net sales to operating profit. In fiscal 2010, I would expect some improvement in operating margin again. We estimate the COGS will increase by a couple of percent, which will exceed the price and mix we expect to deliver. However, there will be substantial cost savings from our reorganization programs amounting to around &#xA3;120 million next year.</p>
          <p>Looking at organic growth through a regional lens, we again see the strong contribution from international, where organic operating profit grew 10%. Effective management of cost within North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific was also key to overall growth, as they adapted quickly to the weakening economies they faced.</p>
          <p>The contribution to organic growth in cooperates is due to a 12 million reduction in overheads, plus a residual foreign exchange benefit generated by a difference between achieved and forecast exchange rates in the year.</p>
          <p>Currently, we hold this in corporate, but from next year, following the change in segmental reporting under IFRS 8, the forecast to the actual exchange adjustment will be allocated back to the four regions.</p>
          <p>Our brand additions added &#xA3;43 million to reported operating profit. The majority of this came from Ketel One in North America, which performs strongly throughout fiscal '09. And this was after a payment of &#xA3;40 million in respect of the earlier-than-anticipated termination of services provided by Nolet Spirits USA. Exchange movements increased reported operating profit by &#xA3;167 million. This is below our estimate in February of &#xA3;210 million.</p>
          <p>As a result of the weaker U.S. dollar over the last few months of the fiscal year, the translation impact was reduced by about &#xA3;20 million. And as you know, we hedged our transaction exposure about 18 months in advance based on our forecast volume. The weakening market conditions in that period gave rise to an over-hedged position mainly on U.S. dollar sales of UK-sourced brands. The volatility of exchange rate movements, over the course of the year, meant that the over-hedged position created a transaction loss, which was about &#xA3;20 million higher than we had anticipated in February. This increased the effective average transaction rate for the year to 2.29 from the 2.25 we had forecast. In the new fiscal year, we will, however, see a resulting transaction benefit, as our transaction hedge rate on the U.S. dollar for fiscal 2010 is 1.72. We have hedged approximately $850 million of exposure for fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>So looking now at the remainder of the P&amp;L, the 13% increase in reported operating profit has been offset by a reduction in associate income, mainly from Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy, and the increase in finance charges. Reported PBT is therefore up just 1%.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the net finance charge in more detail. Net finance charges have increased by 273 million in the period to 592 million. Net interest charges have increased by 175 million, as a result of the increase in net borrowings, adverse exchange rate movements and increase in our interest coupon and an increase in the adverse impact from the mark-to-market of interest rates swaps under IAS39.</p>
          <p>Our strong cash flow means that cash interest cover has moved modestly from eight times to seven times. Net other finance charges of &#xA3;76 million included 44 million of IAS 21 and IAS 39 exchange movements, 33 million is due to translation differences inter-company funding arrangements that do not need the accounting criteria for recognition in equity, and 11 million is caused by exchange movements on net borrowings, which do not qualify for hedge accounting. Other finance charges were 34 million, including 21 million the unwinding of discounts on liabilities.</p>
          <p>For the next fiscal year, I would expect our average interest rate, excluding the impact of IAS 21 and IAS 39 to be approximately 70 basis points lower at 5.5%. Other finance charges will be higher as a small credit we've seen this year for IAS 19 is likely to be a debit of around 45 million in fiscal '10.</p>
          <p>An increase in exceptional charges for the year following the announcement of our global restructuring program in February was offset by lower tax charges leading to a 10% increase in reported profit for the period. And I'll now take you through these impacts in more detail.</p>
          <p>Exceptional charges in the year amounted to a &#xA3;170 million, being a 166 million in relation to the global restructuring program and 4 million relating to our Irish brewing operations. The 166 million charge for the February program is broadly in line with the expected charge highlighted on the 1st of July, when we announced further restructuring initiatives whereas the charge in Ireland has been reduced from our previous estimate by a related pension curtailment gain.</p>
          <p>The cash element of the exceptional charge incurred in fiscal 2009 was &#xA3;53 million in fiscal 2010 and expect total restructuring charges from these programs to be about &#xA3;200 million. This is about &#xA3;13 million lower than we estimated in July, as we've refined some of the project detail.</p>
          <p>I still anticipate that we will deliver cost savings of &#xA3;120 million in fiscal '10 and that when fully implemented our reorganization programs will reduce our cost base by around &#xA3;185 million a year.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver further reduction in our underlying tax rate. In fiscal 2008, the underlying rate was 24.5% and at the 31st of December 2008, this had reduced to 22% where it remained for the full-year. And you may recall at our interim presentation, we anticipated that changes in tax legislation would increase our full-year underlying tax charge to 24%. These tax changes have not come about and going forward, I expect that we can sustain this 22% rate for the next few years.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate was 14.5% for the year as we've agreed a number of settlements with tax authorities. This has given rise to changes in the value of deferred tax assets and tax provisions held in the balance sheet, which have to be recognized in the P&amp;L. And as you may remember, in fiscal 2006 and 2007, similar movements in balance sheet values also gave rise to differences between the P&amp;L tax charge and our underlying tax rate.</p>
          <p>This 14.5% rate is better than the 17% I was expecting when we announced our interims, primarily due to the fact the tax legislation did not changed. And as said at the interim results, I expect our ongoing cash tax rate to improve slightly to 20%.</p>
          <p>And for a number of years, our cash tax paid has been below this rate. But in fiscal '09 it was above this rate as we made payments associated with our settlements. I expect this to be the case in fiscal '10 and cash tax paid to be approximately &#xA3;640 million.</p>
          <p>We've continued to generate strong free cash flow delivering &#xA3;1.2 billion. The increase in reported operating profit generated over &#xA3;300 million more cash this year. Average net debt has increased in the year by around &#xA3;2.3 billion. This increase in average debt combined with an increase in our interest coupon of about 40 basis points to 6.2% increased interest paid by &#xA3;95 million. Tax paid increased by a &#xA3;153 million, as I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>The movement in working capital was the same as last year, with an increase of 282 million in the year, principally due to increased maturing stock levels. Net capital expenditure increased by &#xA3;51 million to 330 million in the period, with decreased capital expenditure of one million and lower disposal proceeds of &#xA3;52 million.</p>
          <p>The movement in other includes cash spend of 53 million on our reorganization programs. I expect cash spend on this to be about 285 million in fiscal '10.</p>
          <p>Net borrowings of 7.4 billion were almost a &#xA3;1 billion higher than at June 2008. Exchange rate movements accounted for almost 800 million of this increase. At the half-year, exchange rate movements accounted for an increase of 1.5 billion in net debt.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was 1.2 billion. Dividend payments were 870 million and share repurchases totaled &#xA3;354 million. We've not implemented the share buyback program in the second half and I would not expect we will restart the program in the current market conditions.</p>
          <p>Acquisition payments include the purchase of our remaining minority interest in our Russian joint venture and an increase in our investment in Chinese white spirits.</p>
          <p>As of the half-year, the net positive impact of translation and transaction exchange on trading profit of a 184 million was partially offset by the negative impact of ForEx on next finance charges of &#xA3;66 million.</p>
          <p>Mark-to-market movements and negative foreign exchange under IAS 21 and IAS 39 had a further negative impact of &#xA3;51 million. For fiscal 2010 at current rates, I'd expect the foreign exchange will again increase operating profit by around &#xA3;80 million and decrease the interest charge by about &#xA3;10 million. Reported EPS was &#xA3;0.652 per share against &#xA3;0.593 per share in fiscal '08, an increase of 10%.</p>
          <p>Underlying EPS grew 3%. The difference between the reported tax rate of 15% and the underlying tax rate of 22% was again the biggest driver of the difference between the reported and underlying EPS growth with the movement in exceptionals more than offsetting the favorable foreign exchange impact on reported EPS.</p>
          <p>Economic profit improved by &#xA3;86 million, driven by the increase in operating profit and the reduction in the underlying tax rate. Return on invested capital decreased by 30 basis points. Balance sheet values for intangibles and associates were both higher as a result of exchange rate movements in the year. And maturing stocks were up &#xA3;335 million. And therefore average invested capital was up &#xA3;2.2 billion in the year.</p>
          <p>The ROIC calculation does not include the position in post employment plans. At the 30th of June 2009, the deficit on all post employment plans was &#xA3;1.4 billion against &#xA3;400 million at the end of June 2008. This is due to lower than expected returns on planned assets and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions.</p>
          <p>We'll now consider along with the pension funds trustees what action we need to take to ensure the long-term funding of these liabilities. We're already making annual contributions to the UK pension scheme, which has the most significant deficit. So I would not expect there will be a significant additional annual cash contribution.</p>
          <p>In summary then, as Paul said earlier, these results demonstrate Diageo's resilience in a difficult economic environment. Fiscal '10 will remain challenging, but we will continue to benefit from our brand range, our geographic scale and the restructuring program that we put in place.</p>
          <p>In North America, what we expect that market growth will slow. The market is expected to remain in growth. The focus of our brands in the premium segment puts us in the sweet spot of current consumer trends.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we will focus on cost savings and be very targeted about where we drive growth. International will continue to be a key driver of Diageo's overall performance. It represents a quarter of our business and covers both countries which to-date have been least affected by the economic downturn. We have leading brands and strong routes to market and therefore we will continue to drive growth in these markets.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific has had a tough year. Stock levels are now at the appropriate level and there are some signs that these economies maybe some of the first to recover. And therefore, we do anticipate that our Asia-Pacific region can deliver a stronger performance in fiscal '10.</p>
          <p>And while Sterling is strengthened against most currencies in the last few months, which will give rise to a negative translation impact in fiscal 2010, we will benefit from our transaction hedging and therefore currency movements will again be a benefit to reported earnings in fiscal '10.</p>
          <p>Interest rates have fallen, and we are reducing our debt, which means that our interest charge will be lower than in fiscal '09. And finally, we will continue to focus on cash generation to enhance the financial strength of Diageo.</p>
          <p>All of these lead me to believe that in another tough year ahead, Diageo will again report growth in organic operating profit. And now, I'll hand back to Paul.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Nick. These results were delivered despite the challenges of the global economic downturn. Currency movements this year have been extreme, and the impact on our business has been sizable.</p>
          <p>While there has been a net positive benefit at operating profit, the impact of volatile currencies in markets, such as those in Latin America had to be managed. And we increased price to offset local currency devaluations.</p>
          <p>We've implemented a restructuring program. As events became clearer during the second quarter, we decided to move fast to restructure our business and aggressively reduce cost. As Nick described, we've now announced programs, which we will reduce our cost by about &#xA3;185 million when they're fully implemented.</p>
          <p>During the year, we saw a significant destocking across the supply chain. It's difficult to establish quite how big an impact this had on our business, but on scotch alone it probably accounted for two-thirds of the net sales decline that we saw in the year.</p>
          <p>We are a resilient business, and our brand range, and our geographic reach provides that resilience. We have seen some strong net sales performance this year in categories, accounting for just over half on net sales.</p>
          <p>And we faced difficulties in other categories. Vodka, rum and tequila all performed well, and our beer performance has benefited from our brand range, and strong business platform in Africa. Scotch, gin, liqueurs, and wine faced stronger headwinds and the RTD continued to decline in North America and Europe.</p>
          <p>In this economic climate, this mixed performance is not surprising. Across the brand range that spans a variety of price points and categories, individual categories and segments will fare better than others.</p>
          <p>Within the context of this mixed performance, I'm particularly proud with the performance of Captain Morgan this year. The brand delivered 3% volume growth and 7% net sales growth, primarily as a result of the investment behind proving growth drivers, expansion in new markets and focused innovation build upon the strong brand equity that we enjoy.</p>
          <p>In addition our vodka brands have performed well, driving overall growth of 8% for the category.</p>
          <p>Smirnoff continues to demonstrate its global appeal and C&#xEE;roc is now positioning itself as a leading ultra premium vodka brand. We've also successfully positioned brands such as Popov and Gordon's vodka in the U.S. to capture consumer demand at these lower price points.</p>
          <p>Scotch is our largest category, and therefore performance in scotch is key to Diageo's overall performance. As you know, we have a significant proportion of our scotch sales in Spain, Latin America and Asia. Our customers in these geographies have been impacted by the global credit crunch. We have therefore seen stock of our brands reduce. We estimate that this represents about 40% of the overall decline in scotch.</p>
          <p>In addition, stock levels of scotch at retail have also declined, although it isn't possible to measure this. We have seen consumer weakness in Spain and lower passenger traffic in travel retail, which has also impacted overall performance.</p>
          <p>As Nick mentioned earlier, we have been implementing a strategy to focus on value rather than volume growth. This reduced volume in the year, but it didn't reduce net sales. In addition to our brand range, our broad geographic reach also provided the resilience, which enabled us to deliver growth globally.</p>
          <p>The same varied performance is true across the geographies. So while we have grown in markets accounting for nearly 60% of our net sales, we did face issues in others. As we manage through these challenging times, we are focused on sustaining growth in the short-term and building an even stronger business for the future.</p>
          <p>We are spending strategically in marketing, selectively weighting our investments in the brands, markets and channels that will give us the highest returns. And we are de-prioritizing in others.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to innovate to meet specific market changes and to innovate around our core brands, with scalable and sustainable new products. We're partnering with our customers to build the relationships and sales capabilities that will deliver growth for us both. And finally, we're driving value from the brands that we have added to our range.</p>
          <p>I'll now go through each of these points in turn. We recognize the key role our brands play in our competitive strength. We remain committed to protecting the heritage and growing the consumer appeal. In fiscal '09, we continued to invest heavily and intelligently behind all our brands. But we prioritized our investment behind the brands that offered the most attractive growth such as Captain Morgan, and we pulled back in those segments with more challenging consumer trends, for example RTD.</p>
          <p>Our media campaigns are key to the performance of many of our largest brands. We maximize the effectiveness of our media buying, and we have a specialist media procurement function who are focused on maximizing the benefits of the current level of media rate deflation. We are spending more in those media channels, which are becoming more relevant for today's consumers. Digital media, in particular, is becoming a more efficient way to interact with our consumers.</p>
          <p>With spend &#xA3;1.3 billion this year, we continued to invest behind our brands, but the marketing mix did change. Spend, as I said, was reduced against ready-to-drink as the segment continued to decline in mature markets in Europe, Australia and North America.</p>
          <p>In Africa, we continued to invest strongly behind our beer brands. In the U.S., however, spend was reduced following weakness in the imported beer segment. In Ireland, as the beer category declined spend was refaced to the autumn. Our spirits brands attract a higher proportion of media spend than our beer or wine brands. And therefore we benefited from significant media rate deflation on our spirits spend, which accounts for the majority of the year-on-year reduction.</p>
          <p>The main drivers of the balance of this reduction are in Spain, where rising unemployment and lower consumer confidence led to a decline in demand. And we decided to reduce our investments on spirits brands by 30%. And, in the U.S., where a campaign for Tanqueray planned for the year has been rescheduled into fiscal '10. As a result of these changes, we have maintained or increased our share of voice in many markets. And consequently we have seen improvements in key brand health metrics.</p>
          <p>Many consumers now spend a significant proportion of their time online and we're focusing and increasing amount of our marketing spend on engaging with our consumers in this space. Digital media spend now represents 10% of our total media budget and we're seeing very positive results. For example, with Guinness, digital marketing is fully integrated into the campaign for the brand's 250th celebration, including activity in the social media space to drive awareness.</p>
          <p>On the day of the launch, the site received 1,000 visitors per minute and we've already had over a million visitors to the site. J&amp;B have used online media formats to recruit high value consumers on to their database. This is proved to be three-times more cost effective than recruiting purely through the brand website and we'll now roll this across other brands in the current year.</p>
          <p>Digital media results are being used to help us deliver our commitment to responsible drinking. The much publicized 'Join the Pact' campaign let by Johnnie Walker in Asia as consumers to go online to publicly record their signatures alongside Lewis Hamilton and Mika H&#xE4;kkinen to commit to responsible drinking. Over 600,000 consumers have signed the pact globally.</p>
          <p>Our innovation agenda builds on our core brands while addressing shorter term competitive battles. We have an outstanding range of brands and we can use &#x2013; that we can use as innovation platforms. And we've seen the benefits we drive from innovation on brands such as Captain Morgan 100, Baileys with a hint of coffee and new Smirnoff flavors and on our beer and malt-based brands in Africa.</p>
          <p>In this increasingly competitive environment, we believe new products that directly address key consumer opportunities play a valuable role. <mark type="audio gap" /> (41:21-41:31) Jeremiah Weed Sweet Tea is successfully capitalizing on the recent popularity of sweet tea flavored spirits in the North American market. In Australia, Bundaberg Red has built on the core Bundaberg brand for consumers who choose to drink bourbon more frequently than rum.</p>
          <p>As the consumer shift accelerates from the on-trade to the off-trade ready-to-serve Smirnoff cocktails offer a convenient high-quality affordable option to the consumer. In addition, we've also launched new small pack sizes on a number of our brands to keep them accessible to consumers who have less to spend, but who don't want to trade down to less premium brands.</p>
          <p>We have up-weighted our innovation activity on limited editions and gifting. These products span a variety of price points and occasions from the Johnnie Walker, a blend of exceptionally rare whiskies sold at $3,000 per bottle <mark type="inaudible" /> in Kenya.</p>
          <p>The aspirations of consumers for our branded products continue even if the economic situation has moderated those aspirations. Therefore this year, we have continued to innovate to build our brands with premium offerings.</p>
          <p>Ketel One performed well in North America, as did C&#xEE;roc, indicating there is a growth in super and ultra premium vodka even in these times. Similarly, in some of our Asian markets, super deluxe scotch has proven particularly resilient.</p>
          <p>The current economic environment makes our sales capabilities more important than ever. In the last few years the improvement in our sales capabilities has helped us become more of an important business partner for our customers, moving the already strong relationships that we have to that of preferred vendor. At the heart of this partnership is sharing the point of purchase strategy with the customer and increasing amounts of consumer research is now focused on shopping behavior at the point of purchase.</p>
          <p>This allows us to develop stronger sharper insights that help stimulate demand and category growth for the Diageo and for our customers. The Johnnie Walker Black Label campaign in global travel is a great example of where we've brought our sales capabilities to back quickly to address the needs of both Diageo and our customers.</p>
          <p>The global travel industry has been significantly impacted by the economic downturn with passenger numbers falling. Furthermore, businesses have trimmed travel budgets which affects our core shoppers. We responded quickly tapping into both our marketing expertise and our sales execution capability.</p>
          <p>A new program was designed to drive footfall and visibility. It was linked to our Grand Prix sponsorship and the 100th anniversary of Johnnie Walker Black Label. We supported the in-store executions by working with trade press to provide coverage and publicity for our customers in the major travel retail publications.</p>
          <p>The results were impressive from Dubai duty free where depletions of Black Label are higher than last year despite the decline in passenger numbers to three of the largest North American Airports, JFK, Los Angeles, and San Francisco where depletions are up significantly.</p>
          <p>Over the past year, we have met a number of our strategic objectives by taking a creative approach to identifying and integrating brands into our business. These brands serve a variety of strategic function. They have taken us into new markets and segments. They have augmented our current brand range and we've structured them in a way to maximize value quickly.</p>
          <p>Ketel One is almost a two million case brand in the U.S. now. It has expanded our vodka footprint in the super premium segment. For the first time in the brand's history, it's now supported by a national TV campaign called "Gentlemen, This is vodka".</p>
          <p>In 2007, we made a minority investment in Stirrings, a premium cocktail range which gave us access to this exciting space quickly. The success of the venture led us in June to take 100% ownership. We've invested in the profitable Chinese white spirits market in Asia-Pacific. We anticipate expanding distribution into selective markets in North America and Europe in fiscal '10.</p>
          <p>In addition, its strong brand heritage gives us another platform for innovation. Importantly though this investment will create value beyond distribution and sales by opening procurement and production opportunities in these important emerging markets. So in summary, this has been a challenging year. But we have not seen any structural changes, which we think will have a long-term impact on the sector.</p>
          <p>Our performance in these economic circumstances demonstrates that the strategy, which we've been pursuing for a number of years is the right strategy. The resilience of our performance in the year is the result of the consistent investment we've made in our brands and markets to build depth and breadth.</p>
          <p>I'm proud of the speed at which the organization took on these new realities. We move quickly to restructure, to create a business which is well positioned to manage through these unpredictable times and to reduce cost. In a tough year, we were alert to the impact the economic environment had on our consumers and customers.</p>
          <p>The gradual consumer slowdown in the early part of the fiscal year became much more pronounced from mid-November, but we have managed these difficult times robustly. We were quick to review our marketing activity and innovation agenda to meet those changing consumer demands. We've benefited from our focus on enhancing sales capabilities and we've provided our customers with new growth opportunities in a difficult market. Our performance this year highlights the value we can drive from brand additions.</p>
          <p>Ketel One, Zacapa and Rosenblum Cellars are examples of how we're able to add brands which strengthen our business and add value. Diageo's strengths give me the confidence that while fiscal '10 will be challenging, we do expect to deliver low single-digit organic operating profit growth.</p>

      <speaker id="2">

          <p>We will take our first question from Trevor Stirling, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen; three questions, please. First one relating to International, if I look, if I'm doing my sums right, the net sales, organic net sales growth in the first half was 12%, which slowed down to 2% in the second half. Just wondering if you just give me a bit more color on where this big slowdown came, and is that representative of what we should expect as we enter into the first half of fiscal year '10.</p>
          <p>The second question, talking about the basis of the guidance, you've talked about being sure of low single-digit organic profit growth next year. Is that based on today's economic circumstances or have you already factored in some element of economic uplift? So I guess what I am saying is, if the world economy improves significantly over the next 12 months, is there upside to that guidance?</p>
          <p>And the third question on FX, it's more technical one. Nick talked about 80 million benefit next year. I presume that's the net of translation and transaction, and if I do quick sums based on what Nick said in the call; it looks like about 120 million transactional benefit and about 40 million translational headwind. Is that mass about right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Trevor. I'll ask Stuart to comment on International, and Nick is certainly the best qualified one to talk about the ForEx. But let me say a few words first about the guidance. First of all, we need to reflect the profile of achievement in fiscal '09. We had a very strong first quarter. Really, the slowdown only really started to bite in November. So in the first half, we are still comping some strong numbers, and that obviously influences our thinking. I would say that we see the global economic situation is stabilizing. Some markets are performing better than we thought; others remain somewhat challenging. But overall, we're looking at a stabilized situation.</p>
          <p>I would hope that we can get through the first half comping those difficult numbers from last year and then have a stronger second half. And I think it is the second half of fiscal '10 that will provide the platform for growth as we move into fiscal '11. So, I would characterize it as a stabilized situation, still some uncertainty, but feeling a lot better today than we did several months ago. But we've got some tough numbers to lap in the first half.</p>
          <p>Stuart, can you talk to International, and then Nick straight into ForEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Trevor, as you say, the plus 12 to plus two in the second half, driven by three things really. The global travel passenger reduction really started to hit in December onwards. And therefore, in the second half we saw the vast majority of the decline that we saw across the whole year arising global travel in half two.</p>
          <p>In Africa, we had a very strong first half, and in the second half, we did start to see some impact of the global credit crunch start to impact, particularly in East Africa and the slowdown in the South African economy. And then finally in Latin America, customer and trade channel issues that we experienced really started to impact from about October, November onwards, and therefore disproportionably impacted half two.</p>
          <p>In terms of the point about expecting for F'10, obviously as Paul said, we had a very strong first quarter indeed, very strong first half in International as you'd recall from the results. And therefore, we are expecting the first half results relative to the full year results for International to be lower. So a slower start to half two relative to half one &#x2013; sorry, in F'10 relative to half one last year, but overall expecting a strong year from International again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On FX, easiest question I've ever answered, because your maths are perfect, Trevor. It's 40 million headwind on the translation, as you say, and the benefit really comes through on transactions. So you're absolutely in line with what we see.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question, Simon Hales with Evolution Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Three questions if I can please, just firstly on pricing. I appreciate that pricing's obviously being more difficult into F10, but I assume you will still be able to take some pricing in some of your emerging markets and some of your brands. I wonder if you could just flesh out your general thoughts there and perhaps also remind us where there is still price increases to come in other markets from increases you took in the first half of '09 which you yet to annualize in the base?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on de-stocking, obviously largely through, I think Ivan said on a recent call, that it was largely done in the U.S. Am I to understand from your comments today that in other markets in Russia, in Spain, in Southeast Asia, you would start the New Year with de-stocking fully done in those channels as far as you're aware? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk to those two issues first. De-stocking, certainly has had a huge impact in emerging markets, and what we found ourselves faced with is some distributors of their own volition trying to restrict their inventories and therefore contain their carrying costs. We also saw a situation whereby we were very leery of shipping to certain markets and certain distributors. And, in fact, in certain markets, we actually had product return again that we draw. We went into warehouses to collect some of our product back because we were concerned about debt collection. It's very hard to say that it's over. But stock levels are a function of the lower they go the less likely you are to see further levels of stock reduction.</p>
          <p>So we have seen a huge contraction in inventory in the total supply chain that we would be surprised if we saw anything like that. But is it over? I think the retailers, particularly, will continue to try and become more efficient. But our guidance reflects our caution in that regard, but the vast majority is behind us.</p>
          <p>Regarding pricing, some of our brands in certain markets, we will get roll over pricing from because of increases that we put through in the last fiscal year. In others, I think we have to recognize that the pricing environment will be more muted. But if we start to see real improvement and more growth coming through in the on-premise channel in the second half or even towards the end of the first half then I think you'll start to see some mix improvement also coming through. So those are my views on both pricing and de-stocking. Thanks, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear, Paul, just on that pricing issue, in the first half we should just be expecting some annualization of price increases. I shouldn't be expecting to see any real pricing or mix improvement. I may start to see some at the end of the first half into the second half -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a reasonable assumption, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very clear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We now move to our next question, Francoise Digard with Natixis. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, Francois speaking from Natixis Securities. One quick question on the guidance, if I may. The low-single digit expectation, does that include the benefit of restructuring? And if it does, what would justify the underlying decline that it assumes? Is it due to continuation of erosion of the gross margins or other elements? My second question would be about North America contribution to profit, which was positive in H1 and declined to net investing of slightly negative in H2. Could you elaborate a little bit on that contribution? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll ask Ivan talk to North America in a moment. But regarding our guidance, yes, that's a sort of all-in figure as we look at it. And we see a variety of moving parts. Yes, we will get some of the benefits of the restructuring through. Obviously, as the year progresses, we see more impact and benefit from those efforts.</p>
          <p>We also see the fact that we have said that we are going to restart some of our advertising campaigns in the first half. But the biggest issue that we're facing is what was a pretty strong, certainly first quarter, but also first half. So arithmetically, we have got some very challenging numbers to lap. That said, we're confident that we can be in growth even in the first half, but it's quite a hill, and that is what is conditioning our thoughts around low single digit guidance.</p>
          <p>Ivan, North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. North America, the key factor at work here is, as Paul said, when we looked at the first half, we were tracking along very strongly in depletion and consumer uptick terms till about November. And in our first half results, we had shipped expecting kind of a strong November/December which then turned out to be weaker. And as you recall, we had a distributor stock build, a significant one at the end of the first half, which was reflected in our financial results.</p>
          <p>In the course of the second half, we've effectively de-stocked the distributor level significantly mostly in the third quarter. And I would say as a result you've got look at the year in whole where we slightly grew top line. In our core spirits business, we grew NSV about 4% and the profit leverage through the year was impacted by higher cost of goods which we had in fiscal '09, the price mix moderation, but overall we see coming out of the &#x2013; I mean, the underlying economic strength of the business in North America remains very healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And broadly speaking, the way that I look at the world is, yes, there are signs there that suggest we're seeing stabilization. There are signs of some confidence, but it still pretty uncertain and our guidance reflects that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to a question from Ann Gurkin with Davenport. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of question if I may. First, if you could comment on the outlook for the holiday selling season globally and do you expect to increase your level of promotion for that selling season? And then secondly long-term when we return to a more favorable environment do you still think that the business can generate operating profit growth in the high single-digit range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question first. I do &#x2013; I believe that &#x2013; this is from research that we've done, the fundamental aspirations of the consumer haven't change for all products. Now, maybe some of the more ostentatious luxury goods it will be more muted but we sell affordable indulgence and consumer still aspire for the level of quality and provenance that we offer. They are just somewhat shell shocked and pulling back their horns somewhat and that's no more true in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So we are, long-term, very confident of growth prospects and when you look at the restructuring that we're putting through and the investments that we're continuing to make this business will emerge even stronger from this current economic situation. The first question, Ann?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Regarding the holiday -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The holidays, okay. We are putting a lot of effort behind, obviously, the off premise. And if you look at performance in GB where we have the brand range you are seeing a real share gain and obviously as we move through the holiday periods in every market around the world, we're pursuing that principle. We have a phenomenal range. We're a real force with our retailers. By partnering with our retailers, we can build the presence that no others can. So we're going to leverage that. Clearly, we're working very hard on increased visibility. But I don't believe the sheer level of trade promotion if that's what you're referencing is going to go up in any material way, but certainly we're putting a lot of effort behind winning in the holiday period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning. Erwan Rambourg, HSBC. Three quick questions also if I may. Can you tell us about your thinking in terms of route to market in India. Apparently you've seized discussions with United Spirits. I was just wondering what the alternatives would be for future gains in that market?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of perimeter impact, I was just wondering what your thinking was on Ketel One outside the States? Pernod Ricard seems to think there is an interesting market for vodka in China beyond the cognac and scotch market, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were on that? And linked to that, in China you were mentioning H1 would see a restart in advertising spending. How do you think about advertising spending in China and what are you seeing from your peers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first of all when we say restart, I'm not sure I like that characterization. There are certain campaigns that we have deliberately targeted to run in the second half, because it matches the &#x2013; for example with Guinness 250th anniversary. It just matches the profile of the brand that we're trying to develop.</p>
          <p>India, route to market, let me say a quick word regarding discussions with Vijay, and then Ivan and Gilbert may wish to comment on the specifics of the opportunity we face going forward. We explored with Vijay the strategic opportunities to align quite simply, price and conditions of trade, just didn't seen compatible, so that is not being pursued. But we face other options. We have a great portfolio, and maybe, Ivan, you can comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I would say we remain very optimistic about the prospects in India. Our scotch portfolio is at the core of our strength there. Our route to market strength at the high end with Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff which are the two primary brands. We effectively have a distributor network and distribution reach quite broadly in the country. And we are building our capability to drive that end of the business with a lot of focus and support including building our reserve portfolio in the key cities in the on premise. We also have an existing joint venture with Radico which handles our locally produced both whisky and other spirits.</p>
          <p>So right now, we do have an effective route to market. We are committed to the Indian marketplace. We are optimistic about our prospects, and we will be building our brands with good investment and good sales and distribution execution going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding China, I'm going to ask Andy Fennell, our Chief Marketing Officer to comment specifically on China. But what I would say is that we have an incredibly strong portfolio of vodka brands worldwide. A number of years ago, Smirnoff became the number one spirit in the world. And since then we have developed organically C&#xEE;roc. We have also acquired Ketel One and in the U.S., we've got some sharper price point offerings. There is a very interesting development that we've just put together, which I'll let Andy talk to in a moment, but Andy, regarding the China opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. I think there is an opportunity in China international spirits and it represents 4% of total alcohol there. We see huge opportunities for growth. I think some of that opportunity will be vodka and we're playing strongly with Smirnoff there. But I actually think it will be scotch there. I was there in last week in China in Shanghai, and I think the near term opportunity for scotch is significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But also we have developed this product called Shanghai White which is almost a blend of the local premium baijiu offerings together with our expertise in vodka that gives a slightly different edge, the packaging is gorgeous. And I think it help us migrate consumers from very traditional offerings more into the Western spirit space. So I think we're very well positioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We need to be competitive with our investments, making sure that we have the right relationships with the right bars. As well as building the brands through media and other activities. As I said I was there last week, I think the team down there are getting it right and as the economy bounces back, as I hope it will do at some point soon particularly in the South of China, I think we're well-placed.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning; Melissa Earlam, UBS. I've got three questions please. In your statement, I noticed when you are talking about the U.S. that you write that stock levels at wholesaler level were higher at June '09 versus June '08. And if the retailer stock levels have come down year-on-year, could you just explain that dynamic which is a little counter intuitive?</p>
          <p>Secondly, at the group level how should we think about the advertising and promotion perform profile into 2010? You allude to the fact that we could potentially expect some recovery in certain markets in the on-trade in the second half of fiscal 2010. Will you be up weighting your A&amp;P to catch that potential recovery, so any thoughts on that degree? And then finally a question on net working capital, and you have the 208 million out flow '09 which was a little higher than I expected. And how should we think about that in 2010? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Melissa. I'll ask Ivan to talk to the U.S. stock levels and maybe Nick can cover the working capital point. Regarding A&amp;P, I think you should assume that A&amp;P as a percent of sales in fiscal '10 will be broadly constant, which means that the medium rate deflation that we're going to continue to see and enjoy, including deflation sponsorship costs will provide further activity boost.</p>
          <p>Equally, if we see channel shifts or further opportunities, we have the ability to be very agile with that spend. So I don't believe we need to invest ahead of any anticipated trend. Our brands are so strong that we can simply invest appropriately in the moment as it were. So I don't anticipate investing ahead of any curve, but I would suggest that A&amp;P as a percent of NSV will be broadly flat. Stock levels U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Melissa, to your question, let me just separate the wholesaler and the retailer. Firstly, with our wholesalers, we work very collaboratively and transparently in how we manage the supply chain. And we really &#x2013; it is joint decision making. And what affectively happen this year because of the volatility that hit us post Thanksgiving was, we ended H1 with our depletions over the Christmas period lower than we expected and so the distributor stock levels were higher than we wanted at the end of December.</p>
          <p>And in the course of H2, we brought that number of days down and we have ended in June slightly higher than last year in the number of days, but it's not material. We're working it together, and that piece of the supply chain is indeed very collaboratively managed with our wholesale partners and very transparently.</p>
          <p>Now, at retail level, and this is the interesting dynamic that's happened in the course of this past fiscal year, as the slowdown and the economic shock has happened, retailers have become a whole lot more astute about using their capital much more prudently.</p>
          <p>And as a result, if you take the control states out of the equation, where fundamentally not much has changed in the control state, which is largely a replenishment oriented system. But in the other states, both in independent channels and indeed with the chains, there's been very deliberate levels of destocking that's taking place.</p>
          <p>Now, again, Diageo is well-positioned. We are well-positioned to handle this for a couple of reasons. One is, we have much better information systems flowing through by view of our route to market. So, we're tracking this and watching it, and we know how it's moving and we can respond to it quickly.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I'd say as the de-stocking takes place, inevitably what it leads to is your market-leading brands that are well supported are the ones that are going to take the retailers' cash. And so we do see a rationalization of assortments happening and stronger brands coming out of the stronger.</p>
          <p>And indeed if you look at our premium portfolio and the way Smirnoff and Cuervo and Captain Morgan are performing, and the NSV growth we've got here, those are the areas where retailers are putting a lot more of the emphasis. So, I'd say most of the de-stocking behind us at a retail level that may be we think there will be a little bit more, particularly in the first half when we're still lapping a very robust first half from last year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Melissa, on working capital I think there are probably two parts to the answer, one is maturing stock. I think as you saw there's another number in the release that says we built about 335 million of maturing stock. The truth is we probably could have throttled back and not built quite so much maturing stock, but we chose consciously to do that in support of our long-term projections, particularly in scotch for the business.</p>
          <p>So, if you like reaffirming our underlying long-term view that we will need to be very adequately provided for in maturing stock in the coming years, and we have very much now we think gotten our long-term projections and our maturing stock well in balance. And we see that as a real positive.</p>
          <p>So, it's tempting to say the whole of the 282 has been driven by that maturing stock. In reality though, we also took a decision at the start of this year to be very, I'll say, world-class about our payment to terms. And so we set out to be better than 90% payment to terms. And that in reality actually cost us something in terms of working capital. I would say perhaps some of those payments had drifted a little bit.</p>
          <p>The offsetting factor is a very strong performance in terms of our collections this year. So, I think, the reason why that number may be a bit higher than you had expected is A, the maturing stock build and B, this payment to terms. Clearly, in this coming year, I guess I'm signaling that I wouldn't expect us to need to build so much maturing stock. And the payment to terms issue is a one-time in terms of getting us to this kind of world-class over 90% level. And I think that is how I see things progressing this year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And if I may just follow-up with Paul on his answer regarding the A&amp;P spend. Should we now be thinking of a kind of mid-term sustainable level of A&amp;P to net sales of closer to the 14.5% level than the kind of historic levels we saw in '06, '07 and '08 of more around 15.5% -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's reasonable so long as media rates continue at the current level, or we don't see any new opportunities to really put our foot on the accelerator. But I think as a general statement, yes, but equally we've got to make sure that media inflation rates stay where they are.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen, another three questions, I'm afraid. The first one, it seems to be a bit of reversal on the topline with the global brands now growth slowest and the category brands fastest. Can you just explain what the key drivers are behind that, and whether you think it will be the same for the current year?</p>
          <p>And the second question for Ivan, you mentioned in the statements about share of voice in U.S. Spirits up 4% for the full-year. Can you just give us what that number is for the second half? And then finally, it looks again in Q4 like sales were actually worse than volume for the first time in a little while. Can you just split the difference between mix and inflation please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me handle the first question, and maybe Ivan regarding the U.S. Regarding Q4, I don't have those figures at my fingertips, maybe Nick does. We may have to get back to you. I think regarding global brands, that was clearly where we saw the largest impacts of de-stocking, because if you think as we move into emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia and so on, we are leading with brands such as Johnnie Walker. So as our distributors in those markets contracted stock levels, they were the hardest hit.</p>
          <p>So I don't believe that that trend is going to continue. What I would say, however, is we haven't &#x2013; we have seen more activity at sharper price points. Now that's great for brands like Captain Morgan that plays right in that premium sweet spot, but we've also seen an uptick in the performance of brands such as Popov. I think that's a strength of this company, the fact that we operate in many geographies, many categories and within categories at different price points. It means that we can satisfy the consumers' economic circumstances at any point in time.</p>
          <p>I don't believe that that is going to change. In other words, the premium offerings that we have such as Captain Morgan, I think, will continue to do very, very well. But we do not want to lose the sales opportunity at the sharper price point level. But the biggest driver of GPB and why you get differential performance is that those are the brands that are obviously subject to the biggest de-stock. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On share of voice, the data, James, we track is indeed a full-year. So we don't break it down into quarters or halves. But let me give you a flavor of how the second half for us looks. We've taken a fairly aggressive stance on protecting our spirits marketing investment. So if you just look at the summer period we're just ending, June, July, August, and cable television, outdoor advertising in the U.S. in spirits, you'll see Ketel One heavily supported; you'll see Smirnoff, the cocktails, Tuscan Lemonade, Smirnoff Vodka and Smirnoff RTD supported; you'll see Captain Morgan on the airwaves. And we have Cuervo supported. And I would say our momentum in the summer share of voice terms, before we get the syndicated data, would indicate to me we are being aggressive and strong and really supporting our brands.</p>
          <p>What we've done in our A&amp;P allocation is really been very strategic about where we put our dollars. And so spirits gets disproportionately supported and within that the sweet spot of our premium brands, the Smirnoffs and Cuervos and Captains of the world is where our dollars are growing and we've done a terrific job. Andy Fennell and the marketing team in North America are really scrubbing the non-working dollars and getting all the media efficiencies we've talked about.</p>
          <p>So we're pleased with the share of voice increase and that's very much in line with the strategy we set out when the downturn hit U.S. and really making sure our brands are being supported. And mostly importantly their equity is indeed being enhanced. All our key brands that I talked about, the brand equity as we close the year is stronger.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the question on the difference between volume and sales, and is it more mix or is it pricing, I think the answer although we'll have Catherine get back and confirm. I think the answer is more mix than pricing. I think it's not just by the way brand mix, I think it's also market mix. And when you look at where some of our strongest net sales per cases are, I think we will see in the fourth quarter they were some of the declines that were greatest. So I think the answer is actually mix more than pricing because of that, but I'll have Catherine actually double check that and confirm it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, firstly, dividend policy. A few years back you kept dividend increases at 5%, and clearly we're still running with that in what we reported today. I just wonder whether you could give us some idea of how you look at dividends going forward. And secondly, question &#x2013; really probably one for Paul, you've talked a lot historically around TBA, nothing to be said today, and I just wonder in the light of the current economic environment whether that changes your aspiration to get more involved in TBA in short to medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first of all dividend policy. We did say a number of years ago that we wanted to increase dividend, hold it to about 5%, which I think in today's environment is pretty good, and we have built dividend cover. I'll ask Nick to talk to the specifics of where our dividend cover is and how we see it panning out in the new fiscal year. But we see a further 5% increase in dividend as a sign of confidence in our business. Regarding TBA, I think overall it's just another component that helps the resilience of this firm.</p>
          <p>The fact that we can have maybe in Europe a challenging market because of the beer platform we enjoy in Africa we can offset that. And therefore the breadth of our portfolio &#x2013; either by sector or by category within sector or by price point within category or indeed by geography, we think is all part of the mix that helps us demonstrate the resilience that we've had.</p>
          <p>We continue to grow our beer business organically, but also where we see opportunities for acquisition as we've announced in one of the African markets. We will pursue that equally if we can develop our business through a deepening of an alliance or relationship we will pursue that as well. So we remain committed to TBA, and we think it's part of &#x2013; it's one of the ingredients that gives us the resilience that we have.</p>
          <p>Nick, do you want to speak to the specifics of dividend cover and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, the numbers say, Ian, at the end of last year our dividend cover was about 1.84 times, and we think we'll be very close to two times at the end of this financial year. So pretty much achieved what we set out to do when we instituted the 5% increase policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We &#x2013; sorry, go ahead, Ian.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to clarify that, it sounds like the dividend policy is something that could be looked at but probably in 12 months time rather than in the next 12 months?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Can you just give us an update on how you're seeing the excise duty climate particularly in the U.S. and particularly at the Federal level? Just appreciate an update on how you seeing the landscape?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will ask Ivan to comment specifically on that. Generally, though I would say that we have to be alert to the fact there are many governments in many parts of the world who are hungry to raise cash. And we have to argue our case very, very strongly. I am encouraged by the work that we do to actually persuade governments that there are other ways to maximize revenue from our products, for example, by giving us better access and us selling more. So, overall, I don't think this is a huge wave or issue that we have. We constantly face these challenges. Ivan, specifically in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the federal excise tax threat, we're watching it very closely. I mean right now, it is not in front and center in the deliberations taking place in Washington, alcohol taxes that is. However, as we know the healthcare debate is actually only just beginning in terms of how that's going to play out. So, we're not taking anything for granted. So, there is a threat, but it's not front and center in the deliberations in the Washington right now.</p>
          <p>As an industry, we are working, let's say, very effectively across beers, spirits and wine wholesalers, suppliers and retailers to really bring our point across very strongly to the legislators. The argument is very simple. Increased taxes is a tax on the middle class. They are regressive taxes. And it's going to impact jobs in the hospitality industry. And right now, that's the core of our argument which we are working very proactively both that federal and state level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ivan. We will bring things to a close now. If I can just thank you for your time this morning and, of course, I look forward to meeting many of you in the next few months. Thank you.</p>
