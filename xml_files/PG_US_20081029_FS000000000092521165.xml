          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to Procter &amp; Gamble's first quarter fiscal year 2008 and 2009 conference call. This call is being recorded. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G's most recent 10-K and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.</p>
          <p>As required by Regulation G, P&amp;G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. P&amp;G has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to P&amp;G's Chief Financial Officer, Clayt Daley. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone.  A.G. Lafley, our CEO, and Jon Moeller, our Treasurer and newly appointed CFO, join me this morning. I will begin with a summary of our first quarter results.  Jon will cover business highlights by operating segment.  I will then provide a quick update on Folgers and what we are seeing in credit markets.  Following that, I will briefly cover pricing, market growth rates, and commodities.  Before wrapping up the call with a guidance update, I will also talk about foreign exchange.  Following the call, as usual Jon Moeller, Mark Erceg, John Chevalier, and I will be available to provide additional perspective as needed.</p>
          <p>But before getting into the results, I want to comment briefly on the organization changes announced yesterday.  It has been my plan to retire on or about this timing for several years.  I've been fortunate to be P&amp;G's CFO for the past 10 years and by the time I retire next September, I will have worked for the company for 35 years.  I am proud of what the company and the finance and accounting function have been able to accomplish while I've been part of it.  It has been great experience but I am ready to move on.</p>
          <p>I've been working with A.G. and the Board on a seamless transition plan which ensures strong leadership for years to come.  On January 1, Jon will replace me as CFO.  I've known Jon for most of his 20-year career with P&amp;G and I've worked directly with him for the past 10 years.  Most of you had a chance to meet Jon at investor conferences and on your trips to Cincinnati.  Jon is an excellent business strategist and operates with the highest level of discipline, and he understands the importance of strong corporate governance.</p>
          <p>He has a deep appreciation for the operating principles that have made and kept this company strong for so many years.  Jon also appreciates the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the company and its shareholders.  And I am sure you will find his perspective on the business insightful and helpful.</p>
          <p>Replacing Jon as Treasurer is Teri List.  In her 14 years with P&amp;G, Teri has had a broad range of experiences across P&amp;G's GBU, MDO and corporate accounting operations.  She is currently the finance leader for our Global Operations unit.  Prior to joining P&amp;G, Teri worked in public accounting for nine years.  Teri is a very strong business leader and I am sure you will enjoy working with her in the investor relations responsibilities.  Teri will be attending our analyst meeting scheduled for December 10 and 11 in New York and I encourage you to meet her there.</p>
          <p>Now I didn't plan to announce my retirement during a credit crisis. But the fact that I'm doing so is a testimony to the confidence that I have in the next generation of leaders.  After all, they're going to be managing my money too.  I am sure you will join me in congratulating Jon and Teri on their new appointments.</p>
          <p>Now A.G. would like to make a couple of comments.</p>

          <p>I've known Clayt Daley since the late 1980s when we worked together for Steve Donovan in what's now our Fabric and Home Care business.  We've worked side by side on the transformation of P&amp;G into a more diversified and more global leader in our industry.  Together, we've focused on more robust strategies at the company and business unit level, on more balanced and sustainable growth both organic and from acquired businesses, on more disciplined and reliable operations, and on stronger governance and risk management.  With our colleagues on the Global Leadership Council, we've developed an outstanding cadre of next generation P&amp;G leaders, including Jon Moeller and Teri List.</p>
          <p>I first met Jon when we asked him to move to China in the mid-1990s.  Jon managed the corporate forecast when I became CEO in June 2000.  He is an experienced and talented finance leader who has served in a number of businesses, and more recently as Treasurer with responsibility for Investor Relations and mergers and acquisitions.  As Treasurer, he has established the capital structure and strong balance sheet that will serve us well in the current environment.  He has been working closely with Clayt and with me and with the company's leadership for the last decade.  He is the right leader to succeed Clayt.</p>
          <p>This month, P&amp;G is 171 years old.  Over the last year, we've been putting in place some of the next generation of P&amp;G functional leaders to lead this company for the next decade, Moheet Nagrath in Human Resources, Steve Jemison in Legal, Bruce Brown in R&amp;D,  Marc Pritchard in Marketing, and now Jon Moeller in Finance.</p>
          <p>I want to thank Clayt for his many years of dedicated service to P&amp;G and I congratulate Jon on his appointment as CFO; now back to you, Clayt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, A.G.  Now let's move on to the results on the quarter.  The September quarter was the 25th consecutive quarter in which P&amp;G delivered top line growth at or above the company's target.  We also delivered another quarter of earnings growth consistent without our long-term objectives and generated strong cash flow.  Our portfolio continues to be a strength as does our focus on innovation and productivity.</p>
          <p>Diluted net earnings per share increased 12% to $1.03 per share.  This was $0.03 per share above the high end of our guidance range.  Now $0.02 per share of our over-delivery was due to a shift of Folgers related restructuring spending between quarters, which will have no impact on the year.  The last time we gave guidance, we expected those incremental charges to be about $0.04 in Q1 and Q2 and $0.02 in Q3 and Q4, for a total of $0.12 for the year.  After incurring only $0.02 per share in Q1, we now expect $0.03 in Q2 and Q3 and $0.04 in Q4.  Frankly, our people were simply too optimistic in how fast they could execute these incremental restructuring projects.</p>
          <p>Total sales increased 9% to 22 billion.  Organic sales were up 5%.  Organic volume was up 3% with mid and low tier brands growing organic volume several percentage points higher.  Pricing added 3% to sales as price increases announced during the spring took effect in the quarter.  Foreign exchange contributed five points to sales growth.  Disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier brands resulted in a negative 1% mix impact.</p>
          <p>Gross margin decreased 240 basis points.  This was slightly better than our guidance range of 250 to 300.  SG&amp;A expense was down by 180 basis points.  Operating margin was therefore down 60 basis points including the incremental Folgers related restructuring charges.  Operating profit increased 6% for the quarter to $4.7 billion.  The tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, slightly above guidance.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash, operating cash flow was up 1% versus year ago at 3.3 billion.  Free cash flow was 2.6 billion.  Free cash flow was 76% of earnings, below our 90% productivity target, but consistent with September quarter norms.  We remain on track to deliver our 90% free cash flow productivity target for the year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we continued to repurchase stock at levels consistent with our three-year share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn the call over to Jon for the business segment discussion, I want to remind you of a point we've been making repeatedly since our last call.  As expected, the pricing we have taken to recover commodity and energy costs has caused organic volume and organic sales growth rates to diverge and has resulted in higher levels of market share volatility.  You will see evidence of these dynamics during the individual segment discussions.  But despite this near term volatility and a difficult overall operating environment, we have delivered and expect to continue delivering overall results in line with our long-term objectives.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Jon.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clayt.  Starting with the Beauty segment, the business delivered strong performance across the retail brand portfolio.  Beauty all-in sales grew 12% and organic sales grew 6%.  Retail Hair Care volume grew high single digits behind mid-teens growth of Head &amp; Shoulders and double digit growth of Rejoice.  Head &amp; Shoulders was led by high teens or greater volume growth in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and India.  Rejoice grew mid-teens in China.</p>
          <p>The Pantene brand grew volume mid-single digits, including double digit growth in developing markets and low single digit growth in North America.  Pantene's market leading U.S. all-outlet value share of more than 14% was up sequentially from the June to September quarters, but remained down about a point versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Retail hair color shipments increased low single digits versus prior year as 20% growth on the Nice 'n Easy brand was largely offset by declines on other brands.  Nice 'n Easy all-outlet value share in the U.S. is up nearly four points to 21%, driven by the successful Perfect 10 innovation.</p>
          <p>Unit volumes for Professional Hair declined low single digits versus prior year, due primarily to market softness in both the U.S. and Europe.  Fine Fragrance volume was also down low singles due to slowing market growth and changes in year-on-year initiative timing on major brands.  Despite this, P&amp;G's global value share of fine fragrances increased one full share point to 15.8%.</p>
          <p>Skin Care volume grew low single digits, including over 20% growth on SK-II.  Olay skin care global volume increased low single digits despite high levels of competitive promotional activity in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The cosmetics business had a very strong quarter with double digit volume growth.  The CoverGirl brand grew mid-teens driven by the Lash Blast mascara innovation.  CoverGirl U.S. all-outlet value share was up a point to 20% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the Grooming segment, solid results on premium blades and razor systems were largely offset by soft Braun results.  All-in sales for Grooming were up 6% for the quarter and organic sales were in line with prior year.  Braun sales declined double digits and volume was down mid-teens due to the exits from the North America Home Appliance and Tassimo coffee maker businesses and soft retail markets for male hair removal products.</p>
          <p>Blades and Razors sales grew high single digits, driven mainly by price increases taken earlier this calendar year.  Volume was up low single digits, driven by strong growth in developing markets which benefited from the expansion of Gillette Fusion and Venus and continued growth of Mach3.</p>
          <p>Developed market volume was down slightly due to declines on legacy razor systems and a difficult Gillette Fusion comparison that included base period growth of over 50% in North America and Western Europe.  Importantly, Gillette Fusion all-outlet value share of the U.S. Blades and Razors market continued to increase, growing nearly two points to 20%, and Gillette Fusion's global share of male cartridges increased seven points to 24%.</p>
          <p>In Health Care, all-in sales grew 4% and organic sales were equal to prior year levels.  Good top line growth on the Oral Care and Feminine Care businesses was largely offset by declines in Personal Health Care.  As expected, Personal Health Care results were negatively affected by sharp declines in shipments and sales of Prilosec OTC due to the loss of exclusivity earlier this calendar year.</p>
          <p>Oral Care shipments were up mid-single digits led by the Crest brand.  Crest volume was up mid-singles, including an increase of more than 20% in China.  In the U.S., Crest's market leading all-outlet value share of toothpaste was in line with prior year at 38%.  Oral-B shipments grew low singles for the quarter, including mid-single digit growth in developing markets.  In the U.S., Oral-B's share of tooth brushing was steady at 42%.</p>
          <p>Feminine Care delivered solid volume growth, driven by high single digit growth of the Always brand in developing markets and high teens growth of Naturella.  Always grew behind continued market share growth in China and the Always Ultra initiative across the Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region.  In the U.S., Always all-outlet value share of the pad segment was in line with prior year at 58%, and share of the panty liner segment grew two points to nearly 32%.  For Naturella, continued market expansion in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa drove shipment growth of nearly 30% in that region.</p>
          <p>Sales for the Snacks, Coffee and Pet segment increased 9% and organic sales grew 7%.  Each category delivered strong sales growth with pricing benefiting Coffee and Pet Care and with initiative driven volume growth on Snacks.  The Snacks business delivered mid-single digit volume growth, driven by solid base business growth in North America and the Pringles Stix and Extreme Flavors initiatives.  Pringles all-outlet value share of the U.S. potato chip market is up modestly versus prior year to more than 14%.</p>
          <p>Coffee sales were up double digits and volume grew low single digits, behind the Folgers Roast and Ground restage initiative, the continued growth of the Dunkin' Donuts line, and pricing taken in earlier periods to recover higher coffee bean costs.  P&amp;G's market leading all-outlet value share of U.S. coffee was in line with prior year at about 36%.</p>
          <p>Pet Care sales increased high single digits, driven by pricing to recover higher input costs.  Shipments declined low single digits as growth on the Iams brand driven by the ProActive Health and Premium Protection initiatives was more than offset by declines on Eukanuba.</p>
          <p>Next, top line growth in the Fabric and Home Care segment was driven mainly by very strong global Fabric Care results.  The Fabric, Home, and Battery categories each experienced significant share volatility, driven by price increases implemented during the quarter.  Sales for the segment increased 10% and organic sales grew 6%.  Volume increased 2% and pricing added 4% to organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>Fabric Care shipments increased mid-single digits with solid growth in both developed and developing markets.  In North America, volume for the Gain brand grew low teens behind the Soothing Sensations initiative.  North America Tide was up high single digits, driven by the launch of Tide Total Care.  Pre-buying by retailers ahead of the Fabric Enhancer price increase that went into effect late in the September quarter also drove Fabric Care shipments.  P&amp;G's all-outlet value share of detergents in the U.S. was down about two points as lower shares on Tide were partially offset by increases on the Gain brand.  This near term share volatility is consistent with expectations given the larger price gaps that occurred after pricing was initiated.</p>
          <p>Home Care shipments were down versus prior year, due mainly to a strong base period that included the initiative launch for Febreze Candles and Mr. Clean Wipes.  Volume was also down due to forward buying we mentioned last quarter ahead of the June price increases on Dish Care and Surface Care.  U.S. all-outlet market shares for the Dawn, Swiffer, and Mr. Clean brands were all essentially in line with prior year.</p>
          <p>Battery shipments were in line with prior year as growth in developing markets offset a modest decline in North America.  Duracell's market leading U.S. all-outlet value share of alkaline batteries was down about a point to 49% for the past three months as private label products gained share behind high levels of promotional activity.</p>
          <p>Baby Care and Family Care delivered another very strong quarter with all-in sales growth of 10%.  Organic sales also grew 10% behind organic volume growth of 7% for both Baby Care and Family Care and pricing of 5%.  Pampers diapers global volume grew mid-single digits including low teens growth in developing markets.  Pampers volume in China and Russia was up more than 30% and 20% respectively.  In the U.S., P&amp;G's overall diaper value share was down slightly versus prior year.  Pampers diapers share was down just over a point due to a market shift towards lower price tiers.  This shift benefited the Luvs brand, which grew volume nearly 30%, and increased all-outlet value share by a point to 7% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Bounty and Charmin continued to deliver strong all-outlet value share gains despite price increases to recover higher costs.  Charmin's U.S. all-outlet value share increased more than a point to over 28% behind the Ultra Soft and Ultra Strong innovations.  Bounty U.S. value share grew nearly two points to 46% behind the Best Bounty Ever initiative.</p>
          <p>That concludes the business segment review, and now I'll hand the call back to Clayt.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon.  There are several topics I would like to address today.  I want to give you a quick update on Folgers, the credit markets, pricing, market growth rates, and commodities.  And then I will discuss foreign exchange impacts before providing a guidance update.</p>
          <p>The Folgers exchange offer was commenced on October 8.  On October 16, Smucker's shareholders approved the transaction.  And we think that Smucker's will provide a great home for the Folgers business.  The final exchange ratio will be based on the volume-weighted average price of P&amp;G and Smucker's stock tomorrow, Friday the 31st, and Monday, November 3.  It will be posted at 9 AM on Tuesday, November 4, and the offer will expire at midnight on Wednesday, November 5.</p>
          <p>The actual gain we will book on the transaction is a moving target, so for now we will continue to estimate the gain at about $0.50 a share.  We will provide the actual number in the press release when the deal closes.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we are moving forward with our plans to spend approximately $0.12 a share or $400 million on incremental restructuring in order to eliminate the stranded overheads and offset the dilution caused by this transaction.  These incremental restructuring charges impact operating earnings and will lower operating margin by about 50 basis points on the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the credit markets, P&amp;G has a credit rating in the top 5% of all publicly traded companies.  And as a 171 year old company, we manage the business and the balance sheet for the long term.  This philosophy has built long-term shareholder value and has served us well in the current environment.  We have been accessing the credit markets without issue, and remain comfortable with our cash flow and liquidity.  Our businesses are largely self-funding.  We generate about $1 billion of free cash flow a month with low or no seasonality.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to pricing, for the past three years, we have been pricing recover incremental commodity and energy costs on largely a dollar-for-dollar basis, not to recover margins.  While this put significant pressure on gross and operating margins, we believe this is the right approach long term.  Consumers around the world are under pressure, and we need to ensure that our brands are providing her and her family with a good value.</p>
          <p>Most of the price increases we've previously announced gone into effect over the last six to nine months.  In many cases, P&amp;G was the first to raise prices in these categories, which has exposed our brands in the short term to larger shelf price gaps, which in some cases has negatively impacted our market shares.  Competitors in general are raising prices as well.  They are facing the same cost pressures as we are.  We are confident that our market shares will recover when our price gaps return to more normal levels.</p>
          <p>Now let me briefly comment on market growth rates.  Our categories are growing 3 to 4% on a value basis in North America.  Western Europe is flat overall with some countries actually declining a percent or two.  Developing markets are growing at approximately 6 to 7%.  This means that global market growth on a value basis is in the 3 to 4% range.  Pricing is having some impact on unit volume growth, with volume growing one to two percentage points below value on a global basis. We are seeing continued evidence of modest trade-down, but private label shares in our categories are still only up in aggregate about half a share point excluding the Prilosec impact in Personal Health Care.</p>
          <p>Our tiered portfolio strategy continues to offer consumers a range of choices.  Jon mentioned that Luvs shipments were up nearly 30% and Gain volume increased over 10%, both of which demonstrate the benefit of our tiered portfolio.</p>
          <p>Innovation is still driving trade-up and trade-up is still working in the market.  Gillette Fusion and Venus continue to gain share.  Premium priced Clairol Perfect 10 hair coloring is growing share despite very high levels of competitive activity.  Our patented no-drip applicator eliminates the messiness typically associated with home hair coloring and provides great results in just 10 minutes.</p>
          <p>Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream is the number one facial moisturizing SKU in the category at $25 per unit.  Good Housekeeping rates it more effective than department store products selling for $350.  And Secret and Old Spice Clinical Strength deodorant, which sell for two times the category average, both continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>So while many consumers are under increasing financial pressure, great innovation is still working in the marketplace.  Innovation works because innovation creates value.</p>
          <p>Now let me shift to commodities and currency.  These are two mega-forces which are moving in opposite directions.  Both forces will have a significant impact on our financial results but on different timing.  Let's start with commodities.</p>
          <p>There are three important things to understand here.  First, commodity and energy markets have become increasingly volatile.  Oil moved from $119 a barrel on August 5 to $98 a barrel on September 18, back up to $123 a barrel on September 22 before moving to about $65 a barrel today.</p>
          <p>Second, there is a lag between feedstock market moves and the price P&amp;G pays for its materials and the ultimate impact of these materials on our income statement.  Oil based materials flowing through our cost of goods are still increasing, tracing back to the oil run-up in June, July.  We actually see &#x2013; will see most of the impact of the steep oil price run-up in the June, July period in our December quarter results.</p>
          <p>Third, P&amp;G costs are not directly tied to oil and the spot prices on many materials are still increasing.  For example, phosphate averaged less than $600 a metric ton during fiscal 2007.  Last year, it averaged $1,100 a metric ton and currently is close to $2,000 a metric ton.  Sodium sulfate and soda ash are both up over 50% versus year ago, and both are still going up in price.  LAB [Linear Alkylbenzenes], which is a key surfactant derived from oil, is up 75% versus year ago.</p>
          <p>As such, we expect commodities and energy to increase cost of goods again during the December quarter before moderating in the second half of the year.  This will be a benefit but it's likely to be offset by foreign exchange impacts.</p>
          <p>Now on to foreign exchange, historically we've told you that foreign exchange impacts our top line more than our bottom line, and that the bottom line impacts are largely translational in nature and that these are partially offset by natural hedges within the portfolio such as commodities.  Now while this is still true, we have seen unprecedented volatility in the foreign exchange markets recently, even more than in the commodity and energy markets.</p>
          <p>Since our last earnings call, we have seen almost a three standard deviation move in the euro, pound sterling and Russian ruble.  The Indian rupee, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso have seen currency fluctuations of four, seven and eight standard deviations respectively.</p>
          <p>The devaluation across the emerging markets that we are witnessing is unprecedented in its breadth, depth and speed. It is quite clear that none of the historical volatility numbers are valid in today's market.  We have also seen changes in the relationships between currencies and items that have historically provided us with a natural hedge.  As a result of these volatility dynamics, we will see larger foreign exchange impacts than we have seen previously, particularly in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>I want to explain what's happening in emerging markets in more detail so that you understand how we will be managing this and directionally what the impact is likely to be.  To do this, let me use a hypothetical example.</p>
          <p>Let's assume a business in a developing market has half of their purchased, raw and packing materials denominated in U.S. dollars.  All other costs including SG&amp;A are denominated in local currency.  Now let's assume a 30% currency devaluation takes place relative to the U.S. dollar.  Input costs that are denominated in dollars go up 30% in local currency.  This is the transaction impact of the currency devaluation.  Everyone in the market experiences this transaction impact, regardless of their functional currency.  This includes both multinationals and local manufacturers.  It's effectively an increase in commodity costs, which, like other commodity cost increases, we will plan to recover through pricing as appropriate or through formula cost savings or other cost reduction programs.</p>
          <p>When the earnings in this country are translated back into U.S. dollars, they will then be worth 30% less.  This is the translation impact of the currency devaluation.  Translation impacts are much harder to recover through pricing.  The amount of pricing necessary is usually too much for consumers to absorb, and the translation impacts are not shared equally by everyone competing in a given market.  So we've accepted the fact that most of the translation impact can't be recovered in the current year.</p>
          <p>I realize this is an overly simplistic description because underlying commodity costs are also moving but it helps frame the general dynamics.  Specific circumstances will vary by country, so we need to approach this on a market-by-market basis.  So in general, we expect price to recover transaction impacts but the translation impacts will flow to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about a partial offset in commodities.  The last time we gave guidance, we said that incremental commodity and energy costs would be about $3 billion this fiscal year.  The moves that we've seen since then have lowered this amount by about 300 million, which is not enough to completely offset the translation impact we just discussed.  We are offsetting the balance with our ongoing productivity and cost savings programs.  $300 million, or about 30 basis points, is also not enough to warrant revising our pricing decisions, but we will continue to watch consumer value very closely and make interventions as needed.</p>
          <p>We already knew this was going to be a tough year given the amount of pricing we needed to offset commodity and energy cost increases.  That's why we've been focusing so much effort on improving productivity and managing all elements of cost with discipline.  The timing impacts of foreign exchange and commodities will of course be different.  Currency impacts will begin hitting the income statement immediately in the second quarter, while commodity benefits will show up later in the year.  This is why I said at the Bank of America conference last month that there is going to be some sales and earnings lumpiness on a quarterly basis until the markets settle down.</p>
          <p>With that, let me move on to guidance.  We have historically provided relatively narrow guidance ranges.  This was when volatilities were lower.  With the volatility that we are seeing today in the commodity and foreign exchange markets, we think it is only prudent to widen these ranges.  For fiscal 2009, P&amp;G projects organic sales growth of 4 to 6%, in line with our long-term targets, and unchanged versus our prior guidance.  Within that, price/mix should contribute 2 to 3%.  Foreign exchange is now estimated to have a negative 1 to 2% impact.  Acquisitions and divestitures will reduce sales by about 1 to 2%.</p>
          <p>In total, we expect all-in sales growth of 1 to 3%.  This is four points lower than prior guidance.  All four points on both the top and the bottom end of our sales range are solely due to foreign exchange.  Organic volume is still expected to grow 2 to 3%.  Gross margin, operating margin, and tax guidance is unchanged versus our last call.</p>
          <p>We are widening our fiscal year 2009 EPS guidance to 4.15 to 4.25 per share versus our prior guidance of 4.18 to 4.25 per share.  This maintains the top end of our range but recognizes continued volatility in both commodity and energy markets and foreign exchange.  This range includes the estimated Folgers one-time gain of $0.50 per share and about $0.12 per share in incremental restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Turning to the December quarter, organic sales are expected to grow 4 to 6%.  Within this, price/mix should contribute about 4%.  Foreign exchange is estimated to have a negative impact of 2 to 3%.  Acquisitions and divestitures will reduce sales by about 2%.  So in total, we expect all-in sales to be about flat, ranging from negative 1 to plus 2% for the quarter.  We expect organic volume to be flat to plus 2%.  The credit crisis does appear to be having some impact on trade and pantry inventory that will impact October &#x2013; December volume.</p>
          <p>We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.50 including the $0.50 from the sale of Folgers and the $0.03 a share of additional Folgers related restructuring charges that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Commodity costs will impact the December quarter more than September, but we will see a greater benefit from pricing.  As a result, gross margin should show some improvement versus the September quarter.  Operating margin will be down modestly versus the prior year as productivity savings largely offset reduced gross margin.</p>
          <p>In summary, P&amp;G continues to deliver on our financial commitments.  We are growing organic sales within our long-term target range of 4 to 6% and delivering double digit earnings per share growth.  Our cash flow and our balance sheet are both strong.  The only real change is a prudent widening of guidance ranges reflecting the current marketplace volatility in both commodity and currency markets.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we remain committed to the fundamentals which we know build our business over the long term.  We continue to focus on leading innovation and improving productivity to deliver superior consumer and shareholder value.  This focus on delighting consumers with trusted household and personal care products that consumers purchase weekly and use daily gives me continued confidence that P&amp;G will deliver target growth over the long term even in a very challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>And now, we will take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I firstly just wanted to offer my congrats to Clayt, Jon, and Teri.  On to my question, it's pretty clear from almost every company reporting global staples that emerging market growth had held up in the September quarter, but most investors are really worried about the environment in October and going forward.  Can you just provide some perspective on what you saw after the quarter closed, some of the October trends, if you saw some kind of collapse or if things are still steady state as they were in September? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no collapse.  As you heard, we're projecting volume growth in the October &#x2013; December quarter of flat to up 2%, so we're expecting some moderation in volume growth and that would apply to emerging markets as well.  But we're certainly seeing no dives if you will in the growth rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nik, I just got back from a week in Asia, mostly and a lot of it in China.  GDP growth rates are slowing there but they're still 9%, okay?  While we're seeing some moderation in volume, a fair amount of that is due to the fact that we're leading pricing in developing markets too.  So for instance, in Central and Eastern Europe and Middle East &#x2013; Africa, where we were last month, we expected some moderation in volume, but our net sales trends have stayed strong at double digit in CEMEA.  So I would say based on everything that we see, it's still holding up pretty well and we're counting on emerging markets to continue to be half or more of our growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much.  Clayt, the calls just aren't going to be the same without you; I have to say that.  Quick question on the organic sales growth target for the quarter, as you look at that price/mix number of plus 4%, that's up 2% sequentially.  Is that more the pricing in Q1 rolling through because it sounds like given the commentary about brands like Luvs et cetera, that the mix is going to stay at least as negative as it was this quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct; it's going to be price.  We had a number of price increases that were announced in the spring and summer that have become effective in the October &#x2013; December quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John, if I can just say one other thing too on the mix side, Jon and Clayt in their comments mentioned that we're also creating value in the mid to upper end of a number of our categories with lines like Clinical Strength deodorants, Perfect 10, the new line of Olay that was just announced, and you've got to remember that we don't have one consumer here.  We have a series of consumer segments.  They all have different value equations and we're trying to offer a balance, so affordable entry items like Luvs and Gain, Bounty, and Charmin Basic et cetera at the opening price points; and again items at the higher end which represent a good value versus alternatives that may be sold in different channels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, congratulations to Clayt, Jon, and Teri; a question more digging into the U.S.  Since mid-September when we saw this very steep falloff in consumer confidence, can you just give us a little bit more color where you're seeing the further trade-down to lower tiers, consumers putting off purchases?  You mentioned de-loading the pantry, slower category growth, accelerated channel shift, where exactly it has changed the most on the margin since mid-September?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, I guess the first point that I would make which I think is incredibly important is while categories and markets are slowing in the U.S., they are still definitely growing, okay?  So whether it's on a unit volume basis or whether it's on a net sales basis, we are still looking at growing markets in the U.S., which is a different situation than Western Europe or Japan for example. And I think that's important.</p>
          <p>The second thing I would say is while private labels are clearly growing in 19 or 20 of our top 24 categories, they are not impacting us.  We're either holding or growing.  So there are a few places where we are being impacted.  We mentioned in Jon's comments, we are been impacted in batteries.  This is not unusual in recessions.  Battery, pantry inventories get drawn down and consumers move more of their purchases into private label.  In fact, it's not unusual for consumers to try more private labels during economic downturns.</p>
          <p>We are seeing some move to private label in coffee.  We are holding our share.  We are seeing some move to private label in Fem and Pet.  Although off a very small base, we are holding our share.  Obviously Prilosec, we're getting hurt by the generic in the first year of launch and we've reported that.  But those are pretty much the markets where the private labels are having any impact on us.  Fortunately, in the categories like baby diapers, like Family Care, tissue towel is one that's usually affected in a recession and we are growing share on towels. And we are growing share in bath tissue.</p>
          <p>So I think we've done &#x2013; the thing I like about the way we have gone into this downturn is we have stronger portfolios in place across categories and stronger portfolios in place across leading brands.  And most of the share volatility we've seen, the modest share loss, have been more tied to us leading pricing than they are tied to some move that's being made by a competitor or a move that's being made by private label.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good morning.  I guess a question on &#x2013; in the press release it was mentioned the transaction benefit to SG&amp;A based on inventory levels.  If you can just &#x2013; because Clayt, you gave good detail on the hypothetical example. But can you explain how that works?  Is that something that's one-time in nature, probably doesn't repeat, how big it was as a contributor to SG&amp;A this quarter?</p>

          <p>Lauren, the impact that we talked about in the quarter is simply a balance sheet revaluation impact.  So it is one-time in nature.  The dynamics that Clayt talked about in terms of transaction and translation are ongoing.  And the amount was not something we are going to get into in detail.</p>

          <p>Thanks.  Clayt, we're going to miss your pretty face on CNBC in the morning.  And congratulations to both Jon and Teri.  Can you give us some of your assumptions on currency?  Because I know you guided to negative one to negative two for the fiscal year.  Does that assume current spot prices or do you guys have a forecast?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>If I had a forecast, I'd be at &#x2013; if I thought I knew where this is going, I'd be at a trading desk.  But no, we don't view ourselves at any point in time as any smarter than the forward curves on these currencies.  And that's why I think that through the balance of the year, we're going to probably see this thing move around.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.  A little bit of clarity if you would, please. So it looks like for the year, driven mainly by foreign exchange, your top line comes down by about 4%.  Your commodities come down by $300 million, less than I would have expected.  But your EPS obviously doesn't change nearly as much as I guess I would expect given those two things.  So what other things are you doing to cut costs?  And in particular, I want to go back to this SG&amp;A expense, down 180 basis points this year.  I think you really do need to break that out and try to help us understand how much of it was this one-time, it sounds like foreign transaction gain.  How much of it is other things and how should we think about those elements as you break them out going forward, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll be talking about this in more depth in December.  Recall our conversation that we began at CAGNY in February.  We've been working for now three years on a productivity and growth program.  We have test marketed a number of the initiatives in the businesses and in the geographies and we are now rolling them out.  Some involve organizational, structural simplification and de-duplication.  Some involve work processes that enable us to focus on the fewer things that deliver the most value.</p>
          <p>In Fabric Care for example, they have basically cut about 40% of the initiatives in their initiative portfolio on the small end.  They have focused on the larger side initiatives and they've been generating a lot more incremental sales, profit, and ultimate value.  And we're rolling this system, which of course we have an acronym for, across all the other businesses, so we're driving productivity hard.  Ali, as we said before, this is not a one year program, okay?  We're in the first year when we're beginning to roll it more broadly, but this is a five-year program for us.  And we think it's going to have a meaningful positive structural impact on the company and we hope we'll end up with sustainable competitive advantage when we're done, but it really is attentiveness to productivity.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say is we've been very agile and flexible in the management of our formulation, input materials, and our formulation costs. We have talked about this before.  We can pretty much formulate on the run in all of our formulated Health Care and Personal Care businesses. And then lastly, I mean major initiatives like the move to compaction and concentration have real and significant cost takeout and therefore profit impacts over time for us.  So, it's all part of a program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ali, this is Jon.  Relative to the sustainability of the SG&amp;A decrease, you saw that dynamic each of the last two quarters.  We talked about next quarter continuing to improve SG&amp;A and largely offsetting the gross margin impact.  So you should assume that these productivity efforts are sustainable going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I think we should comment on here is we try to build a financial plan for the fiscal year that assumes everything doesn't go right.  And so last year it was commodities, and this year it's emerging market currencies.  So I think what you're seeing here is you're seeing the impact of a company that tries to make sure it builds a financial plan it can deliver.  Thanks, Ali.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, just following up on that again, so you had FX turn negative.  Commodities got better but not enough to offset.  You have slowing categories.  You need to cut costs more and you haven't changed your organic top line growth rate at all.  I guess more conceptually, do you guys feel a little bit stretched at least in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as I alluded to in the last question, I think it's quite clear in the fact that we've widened the guidance ranges.  I think the plan for this year has tightened up versus where it would have been two months ago, three months ago and frankly our ability to absorb this substantial emerging market currency move that has occurred.  And I think &#x2013; as I said, I think it's also a testimony to the strength of the plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chris, that's what I was going to say.  I mean we're basically on plan.  Recall when we dialogued three months ago and we outlooked 0 to 3% organic volume growth for the quarter just completed and we delivered three, there was a fair amount of feedback that we were being too cautious and too conservative.  But all we were doing was looking at what we were seeing in the markets and trying to be realistic about what we're seeing and that's what we're trying to do in October &#x2013; December.</p>
          <p>As Jon and Clayt pointed out earlier, we do have a little pricing momentum and we do have an initiative program that has some positive mix.  So if you look at our numbers, we're being a little more conservative on the volume side because we think it's going to be a tough quarter, especially for U.S. and Western European consumers, and we think we're going to get a little bit of pickup on the pricing and mix side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I want to conclude and I think this is important.  In the past when we've given a guidance range, everybody seems to assume that we're going to make the top of the range.  That is not the assumption that you should be making in this environment.  Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure, congrats to everyone all around.  Just drilling in a little bit on some of the business unit margins, in thinking about some of the divisions where maybe you have a little bit more commodity exposure like Fabric and Home and Baby and Family, I was struck by the pretty strong margin behavior posting in Baby and Family in contrast to Fabric and Home had a bit tougher quarter.  I was wondering if you can just walk through some of the drivers of each, especially with Fabric and Home having presumably some benefits from compaction flowing through.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think really a lot of this is timing of pricing that the price and mix that occurred in Baby and Family was largely implemented; and therefore that business has managed to do a better job of maintaining the margin.  And frankly, a lot of the Fabric Care pricing did not go into effect until the October &#x2013; December quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning and again congratulations to everyone.  I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the marketing mix.  A.G., in the past you've been talking about really stepping up the in-store communication.  So I was wondering if you can talk or share a little color on how you're measuring that and how that's transpiring in this very difficult U.S. consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think there are two shifts that I would talk about this morning.  The first one is actually a shift in the communication mix, okay?  You will have seen in recent months more what I would call performance/value or value reframing communication from most of our major brands; fairly hard hitting, fairly comparative, very clearly educating, informing, reminding the consumer of the value that's inherent in the performance of our brands, okay?  And there are all kinds, washing up twice as many dishes, getting your baby a good overnight rest for a very modest amount of money.  You can shave for less than a dollar a week with the best performing shaving system in the world, that kind of stuff.  And frankly, I think some of our businesses and brands were a little slow getting to that communication mix, but we're getting there now and you're going to see a lot of it from us and we know it works with consumers, okay?</p>
          <p>The other side of the mix is the one that you referred to.  We clearly are shifting more of our effort into the store.  One, obviously in a more recessionary type of environment, more decisions are made in the store and we have to be competitive in the store.  There are also more &#x2013; we're getting better at measuring the effectiveness of certain in-store communication vehicles.  The other thing we're doing is we're clearly targeting more.  That means for some of our brands that have more teens and younger, target the money shifting to the Internet or shifting to some alternate medium.  So I think you're going to see us &#x2013; hopefully you'll see us continue to market mix model on a regular basis to analyze our marketing return on investment and to shift the dollars where they deliver the most value to the consumers we serve.</p>

          <p>Good morning and also congratulations to everyone.  Another question on currency, the currency impact is actually less than what I was figuring it was going to be.  I am wondering if it has to do with the country mix because there are some countries against which the dollar really hasn't risen including China, Japan, and Venezuela.  So my question is what percentage of sales do those three countries in particular represent of the total?  And secondly, since you don't break out geographically, what percent of sales in total and profit does the U.S. represent?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we've said, the U.S. represents roughly 40% of sales and well over 50% of our profits.  And obviously, during this period having a large, very profitable U.S. business is a huge asset in this environment.  Your assumption is correct.  We have a big and profitable business in China and the Chinese currency has not moved, a similar situation in Venezuela.  We can give you the exact numbers on the phone later in the day or we can get you closer than I can spontaneously here on the call.</p>
          <p>But yes, there is no question about the fact that our business mix is somewhat of a benefit here, the fact that we are overdeveloped in China, the fact that we are overdeveloped in the U.S.  We don't like the fact that we're underdeveloped in Latin America.  And we're frankly working hard to grow our Latin America business.  But in some of the places where the currency moves have been the most severe, they've affected us a little bit less.  Thanks, Connie.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  Being that you're looking for additional ways to improve profitability and reduce costs et cetera, maybe you could touch on a few of those businesses where there is a lot of room for improvement and maybe touch on some of the actions or thoughts you're having about those businesses, specifically maybe Pet Care, Braun and even what's going on with Pantene in some of the Hair Care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll start.  First of all, our Hair Care business is the most profitable hair care business in the world.  So that's not one where we're worried about the profit side.  And they actually had a pretty doggone good quarter.  Our five biggest Hair Care franchises all had pretty good top line growth and we deliver the best margins in the industry by a fairly wide margin.  So I don't worry about profitability and margins there.</p>
          <p>We do have a few tougher businesses.  You mentioned Braun.  You mentioned Pet Care and I would also add Wella.  And on all of those, we've got very active plans in place.  Robert Jongstra is on the Wella business and his job one is to improve the structural attractiveness of that business. And that involves obviously getting after the cost structure and improving the margins.</p>
          <p>Juan Pedro Hern&#xE1;ndez, we just moved to the Braun business and he's got the same goal.  And you see that we're already starting to shut down or move away from parts of the Braun business that are simply not attractive from a structural cost or profitability standpoint.</p>
          <p>Pet, we're actually making progress on.   It's fair to say that we're not at the margin levels of some of our best in class competitors.  But we're making steady progress.  We've got a very good plan there.  And I think if we execute it, which we intend to do over the new few years, we're going to be in pretty good shape.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Now we'll turn to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  My question is on your volume forecast for the year.  You're still holding to 2 to 3% and yet the forecast for the December quarter is 0 to 2%, which seems to imply that you expect a pickup in volume in the March and June quarters.  Can you explain why we should see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we tried to talk about the fact that the October, December quarter is being impacted.  We're seeing it in some trade inventory impacts as customers, not surprisingly in this environment, are trying to preserve cash and reduce their exposure to the credit markets.  And you're right.  We think that the second half will move back more into the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course, we delivered a very strong volume number in the first quarter at three.  So against our guidance of 2 to 3 on the year, that puts us in a very good position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the last thing I'd say is the pricing will be in place.  Looking at what has happened in other categories, usually over three to six months the pricing relationships returned to status quo before.  We know we pick up &#x2013; we're going to pick up a little bit of top line momentum when that happens.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on the price increases, as you look beyond this next quarter, is it a question of when the price increases start to roll back or if they roll back?  And I guess with that in mind, is it retailers that will eventually try to push for the rollback or it will it be price gaps where you need to, and trade down to drive that I guess in light of the current commodity recession we're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all remember that we're not seeing that commodity recession.  You may be seeing it on television but we're not seeing it in the reality in the marketplace because remember, there is a lag in any change in crude oil pricing.  It can take three, six, nine months to move through our materials and frankly the inventories that we carry and the inventories that retailers carry.</p>
          <p>Listen, just so we're crystal clear on this, if commodities really move down in a meaningful way, we'll adjust our pricing.  We've always done that, okay?  And you see what we do in our Family Care or Tissue Towel businesses.  You see what we've done historically in our Coffee businesses.  We're in the business of delivering good consumer value in the store and in the home and staying competitive.  So we'll move if there is a reason to move.</p>
          <p>What we're trying to say is we just don't see it yet, we don't see it.  We see somewhat less commodity cost pressures, 300 million less, and we see an opportunity for commodities to improve in the out year.  But we're still looking at the toughest year in this company's history.  We're still looking at $2.7 billion in higher energy and commodity cost that we have to eat.  Last year was the previously toughest year in this company's history when we had to eat 1.5 billion in incremental cost.  So, we've still got a pretty tough commodity picture out there.  I think the one thing that we would say is we've taken most of the pricing that we have to take except for the pricing we're going to be taking in emerging markets to cover the transaction component of currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're obviously going to watch price spreads very carefully.  We're not going to let our competitors buy our business away from us by undercutting us on price.  So this is the kind of thing where the market will play out during calendar 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember that if we are in an environment in the future sometime when the prices are going down, we would expect some pickup in volume.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you.  Thank you all for joining us today.  This will be my last conference call.  As I thought last night, I think I have done about 50 of these conference calls.  I look forward to seeing you at our analyst meeting that will be held in the Times Center in New York City on December 10 and 11.  You'll receive a formal invitation within the next two weeks that will provide all the details.  All of us will look forward to seeing you there.  And that concludes today's call.  As I said earlier, we'll be around the rest of the day to take follow-up questions on the phone.  Thanks very much.</p>
