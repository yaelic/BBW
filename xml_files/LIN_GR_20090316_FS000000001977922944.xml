        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Also from me a very warm welcome to our annual results conference today here in our new head offices in Munich. 2008 has been another very successful year for the Linde Group. Operational results were again strong and we further optimized our strategic setup with the successful closure of our integration and synergy programs. Nevertheless, the strong economic slowdown since the fourth quarter does, of course, also not leave our business fully unaffected. I would therefore like to take you today through the following agenda points as marked on page four of the presentation.</p>
          <p>I will start with some highlights of our 2008 figures.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] (1:38 &#x2013; 3:32)</p>
          <p>Return on capital employed, adjusted earnings per shares and cash flow. As we'll see in the current environment of a severe economic slowdown, the stable business model that we have established with our strategic setup is now particularly valuable. Nevertheless, visibility remains low. So we are in a scenario-based approach and our management focus is to find the right balance between short-term mitigations and investments in further strengthening our business. We have laid in 2008 the basis to hand over to the next strategic phase of our development. We have accomplished our strategic transformation into a defensive growth setup and have established a strong financial backbone. With the synergies also in place, we can now accelerate our continuous evolution towards a high-performance organization.</p>
          <p>Let's move into some more details of our operational results with a breakdown of group sales. Our Gases Division has posted a sales increase of 9.3%, excluding currency effects, to 9.515 billion. Comparable growth in the Gases Division was 6.8%. Including bolt-on acquisitions, comparable growth stands at 9.5% in 2008. Volume and price trends were both positive over the year despite the severe slowdown in volumes as of mid-November.</p>
          <p>The Engineering Division is successfully executing on its record order book. Sales reached the &#x20AC;3 billion mark for the first time ever with a 9.7% growth to &#x20AC;3.016 billion, so we passed the 3 million threshold. Note that order intake continued to be strong also in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Now with group operating profit of &#x20AC;2.555 billion, profit growth of 10.3%, excluding currency effects, exceeded sales growth. The underlying increase in the group operating margin was as mentioned 15 base &#x2013; 50 basis points. The Gases Division posted a 9.6% currency adjusted growth in operating profit to &#x20AC;2.417 billion. The full-year Gases margin improved by 30 basis points to 25.4%. Note that the contractual pass-through of natural gas price increases has diluted this year-on-year margin improvement by 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>The Engineering Division posted a double-digit operating profit growth of 11.3% to &#x20AC;267 million. The operating margin improved slightly on the already very strong level of 8.7% in 2007. Most importantly, at 8.9% the 2008 margin largely exceeds our internal target of 8%. Our Engineering Division posted a good order intake of &#x20AC;762 million in the fourth quarter driven notably by a big ethylene contract in India. New orders for the full-year 2008 exceeded &#x20AC;3 billion at &#x20AC;3.057 billion.</p>
          <p>With a total backlog of &#x20AC;4.436 billion, we have good visibility for a relatively stable development over the next two years. Even in the weaker scenario with postponements in the awards of new projects, we can stick to our 8% EBITDA margin target. This confidence is also driven by the visibility we have into our existing order backlog. Besides being well diversified between our four major plant types, as you can see on this graph, we could also and would also consider a customer base, including the likes of Shell, ADNOC and the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation as being of high quality. And talking about customer relationship, with this kind of global industry leaders, I would like to underscore here once again today the very important link between our Gases and our Engineering operations.</p>
          <p>With the acquisition of BOC we have indeed not only created one of the world's leading Gases businesses, we have also complemented the existing global setup of our Engineering Division with an equally global presence in the Gases business. And this is of major importance, because if we talk about engineering and the tonnage gases then we can talk about two business models that actually serve exactly the same customer groups, namely major steel, chemicals, and engineering companies. The third-party customer base established by Linde Engineering in decades of business activity hence bears attractive business potential for our Gases Division. This is particularly true for important structural growth drivers for the tonnage business like emerging markets and energy applications. In both cases not only technology experience, but also established customer relationships are key decision criteria for our customers. And we have two concrete examples of engineering customers that developed into tonnage customers over the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>You're aware of the two tonnage contracts we have signed with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi in 2007 and 2008; in the fourth quarter of 2008, we have also signed a first tonnage contract with SAIL, The Steel Authority of India. Here as well the customer had over one decade being a customer of Linde Engineering before deciding to go over the fence with our tonnage Gases business.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the tonnage product area with the update of our pipeline of major new projects. As a reminder, we are taking into account here all projects with an investment size of about &#x20AC;10 million and the date refers to the planned startup of the plant.</p>
          <p>Our current CapEx program foresees 64 major plant startups in the years 2008 to 2011, with 17 projects having been actually commissioned over the course of the last year. Yes, there are some delays occurring on a few projects due to the uncertain demand environment faced by some of our tonnage customer groups. This has shifted the waiting within the pipeline more towards the years 2010 and following. However, overall we are of course very happy to be able to build on such a strong pipeline for the next years. And let me also once again draw your attention to the relative weight of emerging market projects within this pipeline.</p>
          <p>On the next chart, you see the broader picture of our Gases Division with a split of sales along our product areas and their comparable sales growth figures. The healthcare business posted the strongest growth with a 9.8% increase to &#x20AC;995 million. The structural growth drivers in this end market have led to positive effects on prices and volumes, and as I said earlier, we are also actively expanding the reach of our healthcare portfolio in the emerging market countries.</p>
          <p>In the tonnage product area, sales reached &#x20AC;2.375 billion for a comparable growth of 4.9%. Remember that tonnage projects in joint venture structures or under embedded financial lease accounting are not included in these gases and tonnage sales numbers.</p>
          <p>Growth fueled by hydrogen startups and several new pipeline contracts was partly offset by a slowdown in volume take-ups in the fourth quarter. The bulk product area posted a comparable growth of 3.7% to &#x20AC;2.325 billion. Strong pricing and new customer contracts contributed to this year-on-year improvement. However, the full-year figure was held back by volume reductions in industrial customer applications as of mid-November, already the last six weeks of the last year. So with comparable growth of 9.2% to &#x20AC;3.820 billion, the cylinder segment had a very good year in 2008. Besides strong growth in the LPG segment in the southern hemisphere, this growth was in particular driven by a strong demand for specialty gases across all regions.</p>
          <p>One key aspect of the stable business setup we have created by focusing the Linde Group on pure gases and engineering model is the relative stability of the gases end markets driven by the very broad and diversified customer base. As gases are used to drive process efficiencies in nearly all kind of industries, we are not dependent on demand swings in individual customer markets.</p>
          <p>In an environment of nearly full economic standstill in a large number of sectors, this allows of course not to fully cushion any scenario of concerted volume declines. That's why we'd rather prefer to talk about the relative stability driven by our customer base, because having a significant share of business in areas like food and beverage or healthcare and above that in various end customer industries does without doubt stabilize our demand streams. Please do not forget that areas like maintenance applications do also drive relatively stable gases usage within more volatile and end markets like the manufacturing sector.</p>
          <p>Moreover you should take into consideration the contract structures under which these end customer industries are served. We have therefore broken down the overall end market split along our business areas on the next slide. You can see here that the chemistry and energy, as well as the metallurgy and glass sector, two of our biggest customer groups are actually, for a major part, served through our tonnage business area. And it is the standard in tonnage contracts, a take or pay clause protects a major part of our revenues in these important customer segments.</p>
          <p>Focusing now on the non-tonnage product areas, the split is even more heterogeneous between customers of all industries and set sizes. Once more the relative weight of the stable end markets like healthcare and food and beverage, as well as more stable applications like maintenance is of course higher when looking at merchant market revenues only. Another important stabilizer for these merchant market businesses are the local market structures. For example, the distribution of market shares among the local players. You know our world map meanwhile and our statement that we are market leader in 46 of our 70 major countries and the number two player in another 10.</p>
          <p>To visualize what this means for our revenues, we are showing you here the distribution of our gases sales according to our local market share. As you can see, the biggest share of revenue actually comes from the bracket of 60% plus market shares. Going down to a level of 30%, which I would still consider a quite sizable market share from a local market perspective, we actually cover 70% of our total gases revenues. Again, we do not argue that market share alone does allow you to make up for any cyclical swings in our end demand, nevertheless generating 70% of our &#x2013; your revenues from market positions of at least 30% is in local market structures like the gases industry definitely a strong help to cushion unavoidable volume effects with economies of scale and also an adequate pricing policy.</p>
          <p>Next to the strategic transformation into a solid gases and engineering business model, we are of course continuously working on the operational optimization of our setup. When the first phases related to integration and synergies being implemented we are currently handing over to the next step, which is the high-performance organization or HPO program. The target of our HPO is as we said earlier a gross cost reduction of 650 to &#x20AC;800 million over the four years between 2009 and 2012. As we announced in our press conference back in November, we actually started diagnostics and design phases of the program in January 2008 and can therefore assure currently on a seamless transition from our synergy program now into a field. The core objective of the whole HPO concept is finally process standardization. It is therefore important to be well aware of the starting point for this program.</p>
          <p>First, the gases industry as such has a local business structure with production units serving local customers up to a certain distance. Historically, local management teams develop their market with their own methods with of course, let's say, a certain streamlining operated alongside the gradual consolidation in the industry.</p>
          <p>Second, for Linde in particular, the global setup of our gases operations is basically a combination of the local entities of three multi-regional players. AGA, you may remember that we acquired AGA in 2000, then BOC and Linde Gas. So you can imagine that for every single process from IT systems or bulk and cylinder supply chains up to contract management and pricing, there are within our group a multitude of ways to execute one and the same process. So there is a large scope within our HPO program to identify the best way of execution for every single process and to roll it out as far as sensible throughout the organization.</p>
          <p>We have set up the formal program structure and have started to identify and analyze all processes in our value chains and develop pilot solutions for best practices. In the light of the current economic context, I can assure you that we have been accelerating the HPO program and are continuously monitoring all projects to push improvements forward wherever economically sensible.</p>
          <p>Before I finish, let me briefly remind you of some very fundamental growth drivers that even in the current gloomy environment should not be fully forgotten because they will inevitably drive the long-term growth of our industry and by this also of our company. Let me start with the energy and environmental mega trend. And I do not want to go back to all &#x2013; to the details of our technology portfolio, which I hope you are meanwhile very familiar with. I would just like to make the point here that if we look into the context of limited natural resources and stronger environmental protection, the needs for a better use of existing resources, the diversification into alternative energy sources and the general reduction of energy intensity are very simply said structural challenges. We are not serving a luxury or convenience demand here, but a structural challenge that will inevitably bear a significant long-term business potential for our gases and also for our engineering portfolio.</p>
          <p>The same reasoning holds if we look at the healthcare mega trend, by starting our look simply with the demand side on the left of this chart. The global healthcare systems face the combined structural challenges of more patients having higher quality of life expectations while at the same time financial resources are under budget pressures. So here again and independent from any economic cycle and short-term policies and considerations, there is a long-term market potential that we address with our portfolio of healthcare gases and related services. So far for the short reminder about two of our most important long-term growth drivers. Before I move over to our outlook in these current uncertain times, let me briefly summarize how our market environment shapes up today. I think it is not &#x2013; no surprise to any one of you that our Q4 performance in the gases business was impacted by the significant demand slowdown in November and December and Georg Denoke will get into more details of our overall performance in his part of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me just remind you here as well that in the engineering business activity levels were strong in Q4, both in contract execution, as well as in new order intake. What I think is even more important than the Q4 numbers when I look into my outlook is that visibility on our customer behavior still remains low.</p>
          <p>What we know is that our customers were still running at depressed capacity levels in January and February, unsurprisingly in this context signings for new tonnage projects are slowing down. If we look into more general and objective forecasts, macroeconomic expectations are for a decline in global GDP of around 1.4% in 2009. So it is clear that in this environment we have to be prepared for volume declines in our base business. Of course, we can put against it the stabilization coming out of our business model with contract structures like rentals and take or pay with defensive end markets and with a pricing power based on strong market positions. So, how do we run our business and define our budgets in an environment of severe industrial slowdown and still limited visibility like this? First of all, we are incorporating a number of scenarios into our business planning for 2009. For the group, our forecasts for sales and earnings range from slightly above or the same as the prior year figures to a reduction compared to 2008. Please be aware that reaching the positive scenario of the upper end of that range requires an improvement in business trends at least in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>For the Gases Division, we expect sales and earnings in a range between a slight increase and a year-on-year decline. For the Engineering Division, as I have said earlier, our strong order backlog is a good basis for a relatively stable business performance in the next two years. However, in a weaker scenario we assume that new orders will not be sufficient to achieve the same level of sales in 2009 versus 2008. And as explained, our target for the operating margin remains nevertheless at 8%. What we can control and even accelerate are our internal measures. We can therefore definitely confirm the targets of the HPO program, gross savings of 650 to &#x20AC;800 million in the period '09 to 2012. Given the uncertain market environment and the declining global growth, we will be able to reach our targets of 3 billion operating profit and 13% return on capital employed only later than expected.</p>
          <p>Let me just summarize, first of all we have posted a strong operational performance in 2008. Despite adverse currency effects and the year-end slowdown we have reported sales growth, improving profitability and capital returns, as well as an ongoing strong cash flow generation. We are facing an uncertain market environment, but with the relative stability of our gases and engineering business model we have a stable setup to weather these challenges. Nevertheless, we complement our defensive strategic positioning with strong management focus on cash flow and returns as we hand over from the synergy program into now continuous improvement.</p>
          <p>With the acceleration into HPO, we are quickly adapting our cost structure to the market environment and intensify our durable productivity measures. Our long-term commitment remains towards profitable growth and to stay ready for growth we have to manage cost and returns today. So, performance culture is now more important than ever.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now I hand over to Georg Denoke.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Wolfgang and welcome everybody also from my side. As mentioned at the beginning, I will firstly provide some more details on our operational performance with a usual business review of our Gases operating segments. I will then turn our KPIs, our financial position, as well as our financing.</p>
          <p>Let's start the Gases review with the operating segment Western Europe. With sales of &#x20AC;4.133 billion, comparable growth in our operating segment Western Europe was 4.9%. Growth in the region was mainly driven by strong sales momentum in the cylinder product area, in particular specialty gases, as well as solid growth in our healthcare business.</p>
          <p>In the tonnage product area, the impact of our startup in Austria was partly mitigated by the plant shutdown in Italy in June 2008, significant pass-through of energy prices contributed to tonnage sales growth, but also diluted margins. Reported growth of 2.7% in Western Europe was notably influenced by an adverse translational effect from the weakening British pound, especially in the fourth quarter. Reported operating profit improved 2% to &#x20AC;1.119 billion, so that the margin remained about stable at a strong level of 27.1%.</p>
          <p>Let me also give you some figures on our development in the fourth quarter. Sales declined by some 3% on a reported basis driven again mostly by currency effects on the British pound. The comparable growth in the operating segment for the quarter was plus 2%. The operating profit declined somewhat more strongly than sales, as the lower capacity utilization took some toll on our cost structure.</p>
          <p>The operating segment Americas posted an underlying growth of 6.4% to &#x20AC;2.207 billion. Main drivers behind this growth were tonnage ramp-ups and good pricing in our bulk and cylinder businesses. In the tonnage segment, the contribution of new plants started up in the second half of 2007 more than compensated the adverse hurricane impact. In the cylinder gases segment, our specialty gases operation performed particularly well. In South America, we successfully continued to roll out our healthcare portfolio, driving double-digit growth in this product area in all countries.</p>
          <p>The reported declines in sales and operating profit based on reported figures reflect the disposal of cylinder, bulk and the INO healthcare business in the course of the first half of the year 2007, as well as translational effects from the U.S. dollar. The margin increase of 60 basis points despite some negative impacts in quarter four and the dilution from pass-through clauses reflects our improved business structure in the region after the integration of our operations.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, sales development was quite good given the severe slowdown in economic conditions. We posted 8.8% reported growth, comparable sales growth was 5.2% despite lower utilization rates in some of our hydrogen tonnage schemes, as well as volume slowdowns in South America visible mainly in our steel accounts. Operating profit in the Americas also increased albeit at a lower pace than sales. As you know, LyondellBasell is one of our tonnage customers in North America, so we had a negative impact in the fourth quarter. Without this effect, operating profit growth would actually have been stronger than sales growth for the operating segment. LyondellBasell received sufficient debtor in possession financing and continues operations of its plant in LaPorte undisturbed.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Asia and Eastern Europe, reported sales increased by 19.7% to &#x20AC;1.936 billion. Comparable sales growth, which excludes the consolidation effect here especially of our Taiwanese and Malaysian businesses, was also strong at 9.5%. The underlying development was overall strong in all three regions with growth in the base business boosted by strong customer demand, as well as first contributions from new project.</p>
          <p>The bulk product area saw business expansions with new and existing customers in markets like China and India. Just as in South America, we also push forward the expansion of our healthcare portfolio into new territories and services in Asia and Eastern Europe. Operating profit in the region has increased by 20.6% to &#x20AC;563 million in 2008. The underlying margin hence remains stable at a very strong level of now 29.1%.</p>
          <p>As production rates reduce globally during the fourth quarter, we have also seen a sometimes notable slowdown in part of our emerging market portfolio. Reported growth in the fourth quarter for the operating segment was 1.3% with an underlying comparable growth of 1.6%. Our margin nevertheless improved year-on-year, leading to a profit increase of 6.6% on reported basis. We have over the last years established a strong footprint and important industrial clusters in emerging markets. Let me stress here that even if these regions are of course not immune to the current global recession, we expect market like China or India to still keep up relatively well.</p>
          <p>Underlying growth of 9.4% in the operating segment South Pacific and Africa was mainly driven by the cylinder product area and the LPG business. On a reported basis, sales increased by 2% to &#x20AC;1.31 billion. The weakness of the South African rand and the Australian dollar to the euro hence by far outbalanced the positive consolidation effect from the Elgas acquisition that was closed in quarter four 2008.</p>
          <p>In Africa, business trends deteriorated in the second half of the year and even the implemented price increases could not fully compensate for significant cost increases. South Pacific on the other hand proved up to now to be a very stable growth contributor with strong underlying business conditions for the full year, including quarter four.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the region was unchanged at &#x20AC;303 million. The reported margin hence shows a 50% &#x2013; a 50 basis point decline year-on-year to 23.1%. However, one important explanation here is that the newly acquired and former JV, the LPG business Elgas is a reseller business model generating margins below our usual gases margin. Nevertheless, this business complements perfectly our existing setup in the South Pacific region, as we can now address some customer groups with a combined product offer from one platform.</p>
          <p>If we look into quarter four for the entire operating segment, we had a sales increase on reported basis of 1.5% and comparable growth of 1%. The South Pacific region kept a very solid growth momentum in quarter four whereas Africa saw an underlying sales decline. The operating margin in the quarter was down year-on-year, which is as I explained to you to the Elgas acquisition and the cost pressure in Africa.</p>
          <p>I have touched on the quarter four development in our operating segments of the Gases Divisions already, so let's also have a look at the overall development of our group in quarter four. Of course compared to our nine-months development, you see in the quarter an impact from the major change in demand patterns that came across around mid-November.</p>
          <p>If I start with sales, the group figure is down by 2.3% on reported basis to &#x20AC;3.271 billion. However, you should really look into the divisions to understand this slight reduction here.</p>
          <p>First of all, in Engineering, as Dr. Reitzle also mentioned, project execution went ahead nearly unaffected over quarter four. With sales of &#x20AC;953 million, we had as usual a strong fourth quarter and even increased sales by 4.2% on the strong previous year level. In Gases, sales were actually flat year-on-year on reported basis at &#x20AC;2.358 billion. A still sizable negative currency effect in fact roughly canceled out the consolidation effect from Elgas and the slightly positive comparable growth of 1.3%.</p>
          <p>The reduction in group sales in the fourth quarter is hence fully attributable to the other segment where sales indeed reverted from &#x20AC;74 million in quarter four 2007 to minus &#x20AC;39 million in quarter four 2008. You know that the Other segment covers the Gist and FRED BUTLER business, as well as a consolidation between Gases and Engineering. This consolidation had the strongest impact on the Other segment in quarter four with a swing of &#x20AC;100 million compared to quarter four 2007. This reflects the strong investment activity in the Gases Division in quarter four. And we will see the confirmation of the later when we look into detail at our Gases CapEx.</p>
          <p>The Other segment had in quarter four furthermore a negative currency effect on the Gist business due to the weaker British pound. The operating profit saw on the fourth quarter a slight decline of 1.4% on the group level to &#x20AC;645 million, which is also mostly due to the other segment. In Engineering, there's nothing special to mention except that the margin was again strong at 8.8%. In the Gases Division, operating profit would have been up year-on-year in quarter four, if we exclude the extraordinary impact from LyondellBasell. So in the underlying business, our gases margin did not decline despite the growth slowdown and the harsh economic environment in quarter four. So, let's turn back to the full-year view and towards our three major financial KPIs where we made further good progress in 2008.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EPS, which shows the underlying growth delivered to our shareholders cleaned from disposal proceeds and the PPA impact, advanced by 8.8%. This is a figure on reported basis and not corrected for the currency effect, so you should put this in perspective to the reported sales growth of 2.3% to see our operating and financial performance in 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital returns, we have achieved a major improvement of 210 basis points in our adjusted return on capital employed and I will detail this calculation later on. Operating cash flow increased by 7.7% to &#x20AC;1.876 billion. Again, this growth in cash flow should be put in relation to the reported 2.9% sales growth.</p>
          <p>With the operating cash flow we largely cover our long-term investments. If I start with the full year view, you see that with our operating cash flow of &#x20AC;1.876 billion we have financed &#x20AC;1.272 billion of net investments, so that free cash flow generation in 2008 was &#x20AC;604 million before interest and dividends. Of that quarter four only contributed &#x20AC;90 million, but do not get mislead here. The lower free cash flow is entirely due to an exceptionally strong capital outlay in the last quarter of 2008 with high investments in the tonnage pipeline and the payment for the bolt-on acquisition to Australia.</p>
          <p>The operating cash flow generation was strong in quarter four with &#x20AC;575 million and shows hence no impact from the deterioration in the economic environment. Actually you can see that we have improved cash flow generation quarter-by-quarter over the year, which is notably driven by our working capital management.</p>
          <p>You can see the detail of our CapEx and acquisitions spending over 2008 on the next slide. On the left-hand side, you can see the split of the cash flow from investment activities. The net cash outflow in 2008 was &#x20AC;1.272 billion compared to a net cash inflow of &#x20AC;2.086 billion in 2007. However, bear in mind that this 2007 figure included the high proceeds from the antitrust disposals and the disposal of BOC Edwards.</p>
          <p>In 2008, the proceeds include 130 million cash inflow from the disposals of BOC Edwards Pharma, the MAPAG Valves and Engineering business, and Cryogas in Columbia. The amortization of financial receivables from embedded finance leases is also included in the proceeds, which was in both years roughly &#x20AC;80 million. The gross investment, this means CapEx and acquisitions, in 2008 was &#x20AC;1.683 billion compared to &#x20AC;1.611 billion in 2007. Therefore, we spend in the last two years around &#x20AC;3.3 billion, particularly in promising areas.</p>
          <p>CapEx in 2008 totaled &#x20AC;1.47 billion, which is an increase of 42% compared to 2007. As in previous years, most of our CapEx, &#x20AC;1.451 billion, was incurred for the global expansions of our Gases business. Our focus here was once again on the development of our growing on-site business. The investment ratio in our Gases Division was in line with budget as a result of the continuing expansion of the business. It was 15.2%, which was above our average medium-term guidance of 13% of the sales in the Gases Division. Our acquisitions in 2008 were focused on bolt-on additions to our Gases portfolio. The main ones were the acquisitions of the remaining 50% of the Airgas business and the Saudi Arabian gases company SIGAS beside some smaller acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows you the Gases CapEx split by operating segment, Asia and Eastern Europe. So as you would expect, the steepest increase with a 51% rise in allocated capital spending. This reflects our strong pipeline in these growth regions with among other major capital outlays to projects in China, India and the Middle East. However, also the more mature regions, Western Europe and Americas, had a substantial acceleration in investments, with increases of 34% and 38%. Major projects under constructions here include several tonnage contracts in Europe, the U.S. and South America. The South Pacific and Africa operating segment has a stronger proportion of sales under cylinder and bike distribution. The capital allocation is therefore lower, but also increasing.</p>
          <p>As promised, I also want to take you though the details of our return on capital employed calculation to explain the reasons behind our strong improvement of 210 basis points. Our capital employed simply adds up from the balance sheet items as defined by the definition of our KPIs. The year-on-year reduction in the average capital employed figure reflects essentially our quick de-leveraging process over the last two years, as well as the disposal of businesses. At the same time, EBIT before special items and PPA depreciation increased by 7% to &#x20AC;1.703 billion.</p>
          <p>The return on capital employed advanced from 10.3 to 12.4%. That results from a reduction of average capital employed combined with an EBIT increase of 7%. But let me make it clear that currency did not have a positive impact on return on capital employed. The currency effect from a reduction of equity was offset by the negative effect on the adjusted EBIT.</p>
          <p>The next aspect I want to address is the solid financial position within our balance sheet structure. You know that net debt has come down significantly since the peak at close to &#x20AC;13 billion just after the BOC acquisition. Actually as planned, our net debt is roughly unchanged year-over-year at &#x20AC;6.4 billion. Driven by our increase in EBITDA, our net debt to EBITDA ratio has therefore come down further from 2.7 to 2.5 times in the course of 2008. That means that we are well within our target range of two to three times here.</p>
          <p>Our confidence also builds on the stable long-term maturity profile of our debt structure. With the &#x20AC;300 million and the &#x20AC;600 million issued in the last four months of 2008, we have further lengthened our refinancing schedule. Approximately 80% of total financial debt is due beyond 2010. We have furthermore a various mix of financing instrument. Also we have reduced the proportion of direct bank financing in favor of long-term capital market debt financing. Senior and subordinated bonds today cover 75% of our financial debt. Let me repeat once again, that we have ongoing access to the commercial paper market. We know that the credit market still remains very nervous on the liquidity scene, so I prefer to be very clear here on the short end of our maturity profile.</p>
          <p>You see that we had for end of fiscal year 2008, this is on the next slide, short-term maturities due within one year of &#x20AC;1.3 billion spread over bank loans, commercial paper and senior bonds. This amount is fully covered by our cash reserves and our credit facility, which is committed with more than 50 banks and subject to no financial covenants. We have a liquidity reserve of roughly &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Let me add that the total capital market maturities for 2010 for end of 2008 were below &#x20AC;10 million. In a nutshell, we have access to commercial paper and to the bond market and we will be looking to use windows of opportunity to continue our regular refinancing.</p>
          <p>Let's move over to the pensions position. Our net obligation has increased from &#x20AC;339 million to &#x20AC;644 million. Besides the planned service costs, contributions and payments, the defined benefit obligation and the planned assets are heavily impacted by the financial crisis. There are two major market effects to take into consideration. On the one side, higher risk premiums have pushed most discount rates up. As a result, our DBO is in 2008 around &#x20AC;500 million lower than in 2007. On the other side, the negative market performance over 2008 lead to actuarial losses of &#x20AC;947 million on our planned assets. We estimate that we have avoided additional actuarial losses of around &#x20AC;400 million, thanks to our early optimization of the pension portfolio structure of planned assets.</p>
          <p>Compared to year-end 2007, we have indeed strongly increased our exposure to fixed-income securities with equity shares down from 45% to 28% of planned assets. Looking at taxes, we have continued the positive development started since 2006 and have reduced the tax rate further to a level of 22.9% for 2008. This reflects on the one hand that our restructuring measures taken after the BOC acquisition were for the first time fully effective in 2008.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there was a positive impact from tax rate changes mainly in U.K., U.S. and Germany and finally we had in 2008 the benefit of a strong performance of the group in countries with lower tax rates. As we cannot necessarily extrapolate this development, we expect the tax rate for 2009 to be in a range of 25 to 27%. Let me finally have a quick word on the dividends. We will propose to the Annual General Meeting on May 15 to increase our dividend for the fiscal year to &#x20AC;1.80 per share. With an increase of 5.9%, this proposal is fully in line with our dividend policy. Just as with the fiscal year 2007 dividend, the proposed increase for 2008 is in line with our growth of operating profit; so we stick with our dividend policy consistent with our market communication.</p>
          <p>What are the conclusions in a nutshell, we had a solid operating performance in 2008 with underlying growth in all operating segments. In very different market circumstances in the fourth quarter, we saw a strong Engineering business and a relatively stable &#x2013; and a relative stability of our Gases business. Nevertheless, signs of the slowdown could be noticed in most of the geographies.</p>
          <p>In the current conditions, we more than ever focused on cash flows, which is very visible in our quarter four performance. We have also intensified our tight control on cost and CapEx. While conditions on the credit markets remain uncertain, we have a long-term oriented, well-structured financing and the strong liquidity reserve in place. So we cannot influence economic climate, but we can prepare for it. Thank you for your attention. We will be happy to take your questions now altogether. Thank you.</p>

          <p>So with this let us move over to the Q&amp;A part. So, please &#x2013; first question please. Mr. Cornu, right here. Yeah, take the mike, please. It's right in the first row, second row here to my left.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me? Yeah, thank you very much. Matthias Cornu from Exane BNP Paribas. Got two questions, first, in your various scenarios do you consider maybe earnings to grow about sales or maybe to decline less than sales, in other words do you see a scenario where you could experience some pressure on the margin? My second question is, could you talk about your confidence about the pricing in cylinders and notably in an environment where electricity prices seem to decline, how confident you are to be able to stable &#x2013; to have stable prices this year? And my last question is regarding the CapEx, could you provide us with more detail on your CapEx for '09, what do you expect and what is your flexibility there to even reduce more if demand is mainly moving below your worst-case scenario? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's start with the CapEx forecast with your last question. I think you have seen and very strong CapEx development in 2008, driven by our on-site commitment on the existing projects we have in the pipeline. Of course, when you see new projects coming on stream, this will take place in 2009 and for a certain extent in 2010 based on existing contracts. Depending on the development of new contracts and new negotiations, I think you can expect in the current environment that this pipeline is coming down for new prospects. So by this you will see a reduction here for new tonnage projects in 2010 mainly because 2009 is very busy with existing projects. I think from this perspective, the lever to reduce CapEx is from an environment perspective stronger in 2010 than in 2009. Nevertheless, of course we will see from a volume perspective also the potential of reduction in 2009 in the merchant business. So our overall guidance of 13% average CapEx to sales ratio over the mid-term cycle is still true and we always have said that roughly half of that is allocated to on-site and the other half is related to the merchant CapEx equipment and maintenance and repair.</p>
          <p>When we see a pressure on margins, I think this was your first question. Of course overall you see that the development, and this is also included in your second question related to the cylinder business, you'll see first of all and let's say lower price for &#x2013; mainly for natural gas, so this will help the margin, because the margin dilution of 2008 will be not as significant in 2009, I think this is positive from that pass-through perspective. Overall of course electricity pricing I think is more or less, as you know, hedged for more than 80% for the coming years. So this is I would say not a big influence, it's more than for the next year to come when you see the development of electricity pricing, but overall this is deeply included in our setup of the different regions and it's different from the natural gas price development, let's say it that way. So definitely, we will see by volume reductions pressure in our cost of goods sold and then from an volume perspective taking into consideration the SG&amp;A portion of the cost, I think here we have implemented cost measures to counterbalance margins like mentioned in our HPO program and as a result of the synergy program coming through the books in 2009 too. So our intention is as much to compensate as possible with the implemented cost programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So next question, please? So that's Mr. Favre, please. Third row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jean de Watteville from Nomura, sorry. Yes, a couple of questions, first of all, to come back on the CapEx question, just to be more specific. On your slide showing the number of ramp-up of projects in 2009 and 2010 it clearly seems that there is an acceleration in terms of the projects on tonnage. So I would be very interested to have an idea of the CapEx budget for new projects in tonnage alone? Is that ramping up compared to '08 or not? And if we can have any idea on the quantification it will help us to do the math to see the sales impact on the overall business?</p>
          <p>The second question on CapEx is obviously for the remainder, for the non-new projects on tonnage. Obviously we have seen some announce from Linde in the past about non-dedicated liquid plants. Is there any flexibility here? Are you producing these non-dedicated investments right now? And again, any quantification here would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>Then the other question I have is on cost cutting. There is a big difference between U.S. companies and European companies. Obviously we have seen the announcement in Q4 from pricing our products of very substantial job cuts, about five or 6% if my memory is correct. Air Liquide didn't announce anything, you didn't announce anything. You both European companies remained with, what I would call, process improvement productivity programs. So I'm very curious if you are very happy to keep with that kind of long-term process improvement or if the situation remains very difficult in the manufacturing industry, if we should be prepared for a second step that will address the employee base and getting into job cuts?</p>
          <p>And the third question I have is on acquisitions. Obviously the debt maturity of Linde is very comfortable, but the actual leverage is high. In the meantime, probably some of the small players might be under some pressure, so I would really be interested to know what's the room of maneuver you allow to yourself to grabbing the opportunity, let's say, SOL being up for sale in Italy or getting into home care in the United States, just to mention some of the effects could happen? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay let's start, Jean, with your CapEx question. I take the on-site part. I think, Aldo can give little bit more light on the liquid investments we do have and then our flexibility there. So from an on-site perspective, 2009 is, I would say, slightly more heavy than 2008 from a split perspective. And then as I mentioned earlier, 2010, based on what we do have signed up at that stage, is definitely much lighter than 2009, roughly 50% lighter than 2009 under the current planning. So from that perspective, this is from the CapEx guidance we can give to you. And the other part then, as we said, is flexibility. We do have from a volume perspective in the merchant part, which is nevertheless significantly lower anyway. So on the liquidity part, I would like to hand over to Aldo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the liquid part. Yes I can confirm that this flexibility is been used to the maximum extent. We can decide for you whether or not to continue with the same pace on additional liquid capacity we have shelved, as many as four liquid investments already. I don't wish to identify which ones because that's strategic market repercussions, but it is affecting both Asia and Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then I would like to respond to your question cost cutting and the tough programs, our two American competitors took, the measures, severe cost cutting and announcing tough measures and the European approach. And so first of all, you have to see how the whole thing evolved and is still developing. So, October was the best month in our history. And November, December then we saw the decline in our customer base. And it is now, let's say, stabilizing on that level on that minus level in January, February. So, first our response was hiring freeze worldwide that was the first step. Second is now that we watch everything very carefully and accelerate our HPO program. As you may be aware such a program running over a period of four years and finally involving every process executed in our company through their priorities and our core process with a big lever and smaller things, but finally the goal is and it had been defined at the time in January '08 where everything was fine. But fortunately we could use last year to define that complex project and to set up all the teams, so that now we are in the execution mode. But as you know, a project like this is delivering the results, the cost savings, in form of an S-curve naturally. You have to load the program first. You have even to spend some money for a lot of things and then you get with a certain delay. You get then &#x2013; you start to get and see the benefits.</p>
          <p>Now we told you that this program is aiming for around 650 to 800 million cost savings over four years. Now, despite the fact that you would see the ramp-up now it's slower in the first year, I think you will not be wrong by calculating in a trivial way first and say okay, in four years 650 to 800 is in average per year 160 to 200 and normally such a program would not lead to that in the first year because the ramp-up would be &#x2013; you would see that with a delay, but I think you can assume that we will deliver because of the circumstances around us and what we feel and smell and see what's happening in the economy worldwide, and especially in our key customer groups. So, just take around 160 to 200 million as a range where we will deliver cost savings out of that program. We think that is substantial.</p>
          <p>Now, this is our Phase II. Now should we &#x2013; also there it can be that some &#x2013; there is may be employment affected when the process optimization leads to clear productivity improvements then we can run the very same, let's say, operations with fewer people and that will take place around the world. So I can already indicate to you, we saw already some reductions in jobs in U.K. and in U.S., but you know not big numbers but anyway. So you see it is for us, it's not like it was announced by our friends from U.S. that we go after that many people, we go after process optimization and we look at embedded, let's say, potential for improvements, and we define that in good times and now we want to stick to the plan because we think it's a very good plan, but I think the circumstances are leading and advising, we should do that more rigid and faster and so we think that we can deliver out of the program enough to mitigate here.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, should the whole business deteriorates further and not stabilize where we are now, we enter then to Phase III and what Phase III detail is I want leave it open now, but I mean we are prepared for everything, we are planning in scenarios and we address this scenario planning in a certain modular way, so we clearly define savings potentials in certain areas and then we combine certain modules of these scenarios and play it as required, but actually it is not our intention to go first for job cuts this &#x2013; should that be unavoidable we will &#x2013; we have to do it, but we are more focusing on our process optimization and as long as we can deliver what we think would be a very good figure, 160 to 200 million that that would be substantial. So, it is a different, maybe a different approach, but finally if it's required we are prepared to do everything to defend our position.</p>
          <p>Now acquisitions well, yes you are absolutely right, such difficult market environments also create new opportunities. But still we are well aware that yes, we have reduced our debt position fast and you saw that we invested a lot last year in an, let's say, in an offensive game plan for gases yes, we would be prepared to do smaller things. We always observe the market carefully and we are now not only in a defensive mode, we wait and see what's happening and the moment we see that we feel more comfortable with our present position, we can be even more open for some acquisitions. But for the time being, I think we are in these days and weeks and months in a situation, where we only carefully watch and look, but are not in the moment close to any decision. But whatever happens there might be a situation, which we never believed in what is coming around the corner as an opportunity. And yes, Georg showed you on that one graph where we are when it comes to net debt to EBITDA. There would be some room, but we don't want to now, let's say we don't want to be now so bold to announce yes, we are going for bigger acquisition. And actually the small things, which are under the normal radar screen, the 10, 20, 30 million acquisitions, especially in home care businesses, we are doing all permanently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let's move over now to Mr. Favre [Laurent Favre, UBS], right here in the middle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got three questions. First question, I think is on slide 13. You are giving us this split of the different end market exposures by business. I'm just wondering, could you give us some color on tonnage on the variability of the take or pay levels. And I'm, and not only in between the different end markets, but also within the same end markets, the variability of take or pay levels within your portfolio of contracts, i.e., do you have some contracts where the take or pay levels are really well below your average and what's your average in different end markets?</p>
          <p>The second question is coming back to the pricing in bulk and cylinders. Apparently in a press conference this morning you mentioned that says currency was down something like high-single digit, which I assume means that volumes might be down more than that. I'm just wondering how long do you think we can sustain this sort of volume weakness before you get some pressure on your pricing power?</p>
          <p>And then the third question just a clarification on the project of the 64 startups, could you please give us roughly what's the split between what will be fully consolidated and what will be part of the JVs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think Georg, you take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the tonnage variability is of course the take or pay level in these days the $100 question from an average perspective. And when we discussed this earlier and we have discussed this more openly then we see an strong setup and we can also distinguish between an more risk-averse setup in the Linde history, Linde legacy perspective where we do have tonnage setup, which is very conservative. We have a very conservative setup also in Asian JVs and we do have some weaknesses from debt in the U.S. setup based all of contracts, all of the 90s. We would say that the holding line from an average perspective is roughly between, somewhere in between 80 plus percent, so somewhere between 80 plus 90%, that is the percentage which we would keep from that perspective, so this is the variability answer to your tonnage question. I think I hand over to Aldo, the bulk and the pricing question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, definitely you're right. Assuming that the volume decreases larger than what we have stated on in terms of sales, it's clear we have done a lot of good pricing work in 2008. It is continuing, of course, in the current year. We believe that in terms of volume, we have reached a quite stable situation at the moment, so we will spend a lot of efforts in defending the pricing and it's our intention not to let it deteriorate. And as I said, the current volume is enough to sustain this pricing. For the startups JVs, I don't think -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we do not disclose that number. I think you can anticipate that the contribution by JVs comes mainly out of the agent activities and in the future also through our joint venture activity now in the Middle East, let's say, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and you also can assume that there is leverage normally in that company structures and that will take a little bit of time that this is ramped up. But overall, the guidance for the JVs it's that is from the net income perspective, growing, of course, in the future years compared to 2008 and this is a guidance I want to give. It will be a reduction because of the full consolidation now of Elgas, which was also contributing to the joint venture net income line in our EBITDA. So from that perspective, I would guide you to a number which is something between 50 to &#x20AC;60 million from a total perspective in net income in 2009, rather 50 than probably 60 that is what I see today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question please? Jean de Watteville, once more again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, it's me again. I have two questions. One is just to have a view on the start of the year about a little more than a month ago in a meeting in London <mark type="inaudible" /> talked about on their business, volume trend of about down 15%. So I would be very grateful if we can have your view one month later of what you see in terms of volume trends in the industry?</p>
          <p>The second question is coming back on the comment on the outlook in engineering. Obviously Linde has a strong book-to-bill ratio at the start of '09. I think it has been mentioned on the presentation that the order intake be very weak than we should expect lower sales in '09. I am a bit surprised, I thought that basically the timing of the ramp ups of the commissioning of the plants is kind of fixed, and therefore if the order intake would be bad, should we expect a decline later than '09? So if you could just clarify the phasing and how you will deal the engineering business in a scenario where order intake would fall.</p>
          <p>Obviously, if I can just add a third question, if you could share with us your view of where is the discussions with your clients with regard to the order intake in engineering. Is the assumption that order intake will fall also your view, given the economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think we start with the engineering questions, the two and Aldo you take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we come with a answer to your volume perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the meaning of the sentence which you have read in the slides concerning the challenge of maintaining the sales in engineering in 2009 due to the order intake has to be interpreted in a way that we still have, as you correctly pointed out, a backlog, which will deliver sales in 2009, but in engineering you also have some short-term sales, things which we sell today and will become sales still with 2009 &#x2013; with according to percentage of completion. And it is just assumption that this order intake, the pace of this order intake will not match the one of 2008. So it's a portion of the sales of 2009, which was referred to in the slides.</p>
          <p>In terms of discussions with customers, yes, a lot of customers, of course, are very prudent in committing new funds, especially with the energy prices, which we're seeing at the moment, and the hurdle rate, which our customers are adopting for their investment decisions. However, you know that the engineering contractor business is a very opportunistic business and we can luckily go after projects wherever they are and depending on the circumstances. So I'm not very pessimistic and still there is something outside which we can secure also in 2009, in terms of order intake. Dr. Reitzle mentioned all the things. It seems strange maybe to you, but there are olefin projects developing quite nicely.</p>

          <p>On the volume side, I think we are little bit shy to communicate here. It is an, I think, a very diversified picture. It's not one trend across all regions. As I said, it was a development in the fourth quarter. We have different holding lines in different geographies. Of course the general trend is down. From a tonnage perspective, you know what our end customers communicated here with reduction of production of 30% plus, so definitely we see here significant volume reduction. It looks a little bit different when we go into the different bulk products when we look here in LIN, LOX, LAR of course still related, we see this double-digit reduction, in some other areas we see single-digit reduction. Overall, I think it is a little bit too early. When I compare the development quarter four, quarter one, I would say, if you want to see something positive you would say this is an sidewalk now. If you want to see something negative you can pick out some of the geography where the trend is more negative. So I think this is an diversified answer to your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I feel obliged to break into this French hegemony of this call. I have two questions. The first question is coming back to the gases margin. Obviously you have two regions where you have very high margins, Europe and then Asia, Eastern Europe. And of course for us forecasting the relative growth in these divisions drives the mix, the geographical mix. Can you talk through maybe bit on the country level what are you seeing in Scandinavia, U.K., Germany and Eastern Europe, specifically those are the regions that, at least, in my head are Linde regions? And how that is shaping up and whether the business is stabilizing there at the beginning of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is I'd like to use you a bit as a more of a sounding board on the economy. Obviously you are a company that sells into a lot of end markets and we've been hearing that the only thing that can bail us out is the stimulus packages in China and in the U.S. When you talk to your customers about are they cheering up when they hear about this or they say forget about it? It will not help. It will not bail us out. What, on average, are your customers signaling to you in terms of mid-term confidence on the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, you're right that geographies react differently in terms of margins to the challenge. Scandinavia is a very solid market for sure. That's, it's where we can defend our position and also the economy is not that much deteriorated. U.K. is probably the largest challenge we are facing at the moment. When it comes to the stimulus, China is very positive. Whenever we talk to customers they do believe it. They do believe that the money will be made available and it will arrive at the right place. Outside China there is more skepticism.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Hello, yes. My question is also concerning Eastern Europe, could you shed some light how much of the negative currency impact was due to Eastern European currencies, the decay there, first? And second, could you give us an idea how much of your sales you generated in the Eastern European countries? Firstly, and second, maybe you could share with us how many of the projects that have been postponed from 2008 come now in 2009 and 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the currency and I think, when you do make the ranking for us, then of course in these days, dollar, pound, Australia dollar, rand is the ranking. Dollar is looking slightly better in these days, so from a visibility perspective, of course we have some positive since the start of the year with on the dollar side as we explained earlier pound and Australia dollar was deteriorating significantly in the fourth quarter. So this is little bit better but not significantly better and rand is of course most important currency. From Eastern Europe, it is not that dramatic in these days, I mean, of course we see in some of the smaller states like the Baltic states like in Ukraine, but our revenue base in that territory is not that significant at that stage, so it's developing. The more important currencies, of course, are here when you look into Poland, when you look into Czech Republic, when you look into Hungary. Here you see the currency development, isn't deterioration visible? No question about. But from a group's perspective or from Gases divisional perspective, the other four currencies are much more significant than Eastern Europe. Nevertheless there is an deterioration visible.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the postponement, okay. First of all, you have distinguish on the nature and quality of postponements, Jean asked the question about the merchant capacity postponements or I said a few things about that. Then you have, this is more for our own convenience. Then you have on-site customers who at different stages of the project development decided to shelve their own investments and we accordingly postponed the gas operations or hydrogen facilities. And then there were projects at the very, let's say, nascent status which didn't come off the ground. So if I take only the first two categories, which are more known and precise, I would say two hands full of projects in total.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Martin Evans at Cazenove. Just on your take or pay contracts, can you just remind us, I mean there obviously legally, from your perspective legally watertight, but are you sensing any pressure from some of your more troubled customers to possibly renegotiate those contracts more favorably from their perspective? And sort of following on from that, obviously we know about Lyondell and so on, but are you sort of in your budget process assuming that there are a substantial number of bankruptcies and liquidations going forward amongst your more industrial customer base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think this is of course a very important question, but it is as for bail out, this is a general answer, where's the holding line. You can't first of all argue with your customer. I mean it's a very different situation when you talk about in contract, let's say, which is three years old or in contract, which is 12 years old, right? So you definitely have to see what kind of period are you in. Overall, we have invested for the customer and in the tonnage model we give advantage to the customer, because we are using for example additional capacity for the merchant supply in these contracts. So overall perspective is the customer has a more favorable cost position through tonnage contract than on a standalone basis. I think this is a key logic for that perspective and of course from a service guarantee perspective this comes on top, but that is the holding line.</p>
          <p>So when you argue with one customer you can assume that you have to argue with the next customer too, right? So you can't give one customer a solution and then you have a longer discussion with the next customer, you will not hold up the line. So I think from a general perspective, we go along with the contractual terms in whatever scenario. And then we negotiate tough like in the LyondellBasell case. I mean of course there is Chapter 11 financing now. I think this is a good solution. The customer received, I think, roughly eight billion debtor-in-possession financing and is back in operations. And I can tell you, we have negotiated and we have leveraged our supply position. I think without us the plant can't operate. So we are a very critical supplier, and nevertheless we look for solutions with our customers. I mean if there is now an extension for a couple of years and you're, as I said, in years 13 or 14, I think you'll use this to have an, let's say, golden end that is clear. But on the other hand you have to be very clear with your contractual terms and normally you have to explain the customer once again that this was very favorable for him and we have invested for him.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one follow-up and then two quick questions, first follow-up on the guidance you provide on the net income from the joint ventures, could you just give us an idea of what has been the level of net profit in 2008 if we exclude Elgas for the year compared to the 64 you reported? And on the financial costs there is a small step-up in Q4 of about 10 million, is there any specific reason behind that? Should we expect an increase in financial charges for the year '09 compared to '08 assuming your net debt level would probably slightly decrease. And last question is regarding healthcare according to my calculation there is a quite substantial increase in Q4 compared to the trend we had before, could you come back on that? Is there any new, I mean, changes, new product, new contracts and what do you expect for '09 in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll take the first two, on the JVs, I think I have given the guidance I really want to give from the perspective of the expected development of the share of the net income from the joint venture perspective. When we talk about financial, the perspective is that 2009 will be in the range of 2008, I think this is the best guidance I can give to you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the number you gave for comparable growth, based on my calculation it seems that there is a step-up from a high single-digit number to a double-digit number like 12%.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux. Two questions, first on clarification, your best-case scenario that means slight increase in sales and EBITDA, is that based on your &#x2013; on the GDP growth assumption of minus 1.4% we could read on page 20? And then the second question you mentioned that you have done several scenarios, but what is your worst-case scenario and what does it mean explicitly to EBITDA and sales performance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'm &#x2013; I take the best case and Georg takes the worst case. So, the best case would suggest that we already see an improvement in world economy in the second half because as we mentioned since November, December, January, February, we see versus the previous year months a decline. Fortunately, not that much like in other industries, but we see a minus, we just discussed in volumes and finally in revenues. That could turn into, let's say, same level like last year, that's this, or even slightly ahead. That would suggest that first, there is no further deterioration and second, that on that level where we are since now three months that we will see an improvement in the second half.</p>
          <p>Will that not take place, we then can't avoid that we would report a minus versus 2008, especially because in the first three months we had very good &#x2013; until October, I already mentioned that, including October we had very good figures last year and when you report on the previous year, it's obvious the question of the basis you created last year. So the best case is the case that we see an improvement in global economy that all these stimulus packages in are working and that eventually in the financial market you see a stop of further write-offs caused by housing or credit cards and so on that this stabilizes and the whole thing moves slightly into the positive, then we could still see a chance to arrive at the same level like last year.</p>
          <p>Will that be in 2010 and not in 2009, then we can't avoid a minus and then the question is how well are we executing our cost reduction programs in order to defend margins and so on. And yeah, so the positive scenario definitely would suggest an improvement in the economy globally in the second half.</p>
          <p>We don't have yet a real what you would consider a worst-case scenario. I think we told you that we are in a mode where we have a lot of mitigation plans for different areas in place and where we can in a modular way play with our scenarios, but we still think that this will not be something what you would call then a worst-case scenario. It's a weaker case scenario. That's where we are in the moment in that it is a minus in hopefully in the low percentages a minus in revenues, but here you can eventually draw the line for what they expect as a worst case, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you &#x2013; we were discussing the differences and I think we were asked here as we would like to be. I mean take the change of the year. On the 30th of December we got the engineering contract out of India with &#x20AC;350 million and on the first day of the New Year we had LyondellBasell bankruptcy. So take these two opposites then you see how mixed the picture is. So from that perspective of course you can draw an worst-case scenario with more bankruptcies in the customer base. I think this will make the real difference in the end, which can be beyond imagination. I mean if you compare these things you can be very aggressive. Overall nevertheless, I mean the bankruptcy of LyondellBasell itself presented in case, which was negative in the fourth quarter, it was roughly to give you here in two of  $15 million, which was a loss, we took in the first quarter. Nevertheless, when you see the cash flow profile the improved payment terms and the renegotiations, so from that perspective that's compensated here.</p>
          <p>So overall, I think it's not helpful to draw a line from an worst-case scenario, which in the means of the word is really worst. I think we are operating as Wolfgang said scenario based. I mean we have very different mitigation plans from that perspective and let's hope that this is a single-digit deviation. I mean we do have in the customer portfolio some lights from the development of the sectors, no question about that. I mean healthcare is developing very stable, food beverages is in a very stable mood. When you look into the net calculation we discuss this two of the stimulus packages, at one point of time that will help the maintenance and repair business embedded in our businesses. Also on the automotive side we see probably some slight impacts here. So overall, I think we told you what we want to tell you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any questions left? Mr. Spengler?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Peter Spengler, DZ Bank. On your mid-term target, the 3 billion or 13% it has been deferred so, but it has not mentioned when you want to reach this, is there &#x2013; could you give us a new target or kind of range for 2010 or is it a deferment by one year, two years, what do you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean when you ask us when we want that to reach it's as soon as possible. So we are not walking away from that target, but clearly the underlying calculation and basis for that was the steady growth of our industry by &#x2013; in average 7% globally year-over-year. So it was so stable for more than 10 years you saw in our gases industry, a 7% growth and we always said that this is the basis that's what we assume and we want to be a little bit better than this 7% and that would have brought us comfortably to that level, but now we don't see a 7% growth. I think everybody understands that, so the world has changed dramatically and therefore I can't give you a new date, because usually Linde always when we promise something we deliver. But when the world around us is collapsing and the GDP is going southwards and it's now negative, so you can't expect us to deliver that, but the first statement is we will not give up that target. Second is, the statement is we want to reach it as soon as possible, but we don't &#x2013; can't give you now a figure for 2010 because that would suggest that we already know where we are at the end of '09.</p>
          <p>And frankly, every year over the last years when we had been sitting in front of you in March, we in principle knew around 1 to 2% plus/minus already where we would be year-end. We never disclose that, but we I think usually delivered what you expected from us. That was our attitude. And why we even in good times, in predictable times we never gave a precise outlook? It's quite simple because you never know what's happening in this world. There can be a terrorist attack and then something happens and then you have to send out a profit warning, that's nothing what we want to do.</p>
          <p>I think the best way is that you have to &#x2013; to develop a relationship with you that you have confidence that we are delivering what we promised. But frankly the basis for the 3 billion 2010, a year ago we felt very comfortable with that, but nobody could expect what's happening now. And so please understand that for the time being we can't give you a new guidance. We will as soon as we see that all the negative trends found a floor and definitely it has to start with housing prices in U.S. as long as this pipeline of bad news is further filled up with further write-offs. You can't expect that things are really stabilizing, but fortunately, the governments around the world stabilized the banking sector. I think after Lehman it's clear there will be no big bank going really bust and leading to severe knock-on effects, but the question is what kind of well, equity injections by governments or so, what will be necessary for the banks? But I think one good message is out that there will be no big bank, which will go bust.</p>
          <p>On the other hand the question is how many banks will be state-owned in two years from now? I have my own opinion on that. But whatever we see there that will then lead to a huge debt burden for all the relevant countries. That's another issue we have to deal with in the years to come. But now the big question is how does this all impact the industries around the world and where do they find a floor? And I agree with some others here in the room that most likely from all the stimulus packages, the one in China will be most effective I assume because they have a different situation. They only pull ahead their five years plan and invest incredible amount of monies in new infrastructure, which then creates a competitive advantage and a new value. So I think this is something where you see the highest effectiveness.</p>
          <p>And in Europe, yes, there is a different way how to deal with that. It's more in a moment still a little bit a wait and see because I also would hesitate to see a state intervention at industrial corporations. I think if there is some help offered then it should be, it's my opinion done more better through the banks and financial institutions, so via the banks and not directly because when you start here where do you end there. And so this is still something what we will then see over the next several months. I think in two, three months we have a much better feeling for also a worst-case scenario. But in the moment I think there are &#x2013; yes, we are affected, but we are still in a situation where we say we can cope with that. But as Georg rightly mentioned, the unpredictable thing in these days are the bankruptcies of your customers.</p>
          <p>Normally when the &#x2013; your market is down by 5 or 10%, you can deal with that and you can cope with your internal measures, but when you then in addition see some earthquakes, when you have a tsunami, a global tsunami wave plus multiple earthquakes it's a little bit a difficult environment to predict what kind of house is tumbling down in Shanghai and what effect does it have in Chicago. The world is so interlinked and interwoven that what we see today you all know that exactly like we, is really not foreseeable, but on the other hand we can't change the environment. We try to maneuver our boat in the right way and we want to reach the same destination with our boat, but eventually it will take a little longer till we are at that island of 3 billion and 13% ROCE, but you can bet on that one day we will arrive there.</p>
          <p>So, but we can't change that storm and we have to deal with it, and I think what we have today is a better situation than ever before in our corporation. I think I can say we are very agile. Our people are on top of these things. Would we explain to you how our local team had been handling the Lyondell case? I'm really proud of that. So I think even such a disastrous message that your biggest, single biggest customer in U.S. is entering Chapter 11 just on the very first working day of the year that was a certain bell ringing that this most likely will be an interesting year. But now today we are already a little bit more relaxed when we look at Lyondell, but it can happen tomorrow somewhere else. And it's a crazy environment and I think we still have a robust business model. But on the other hand, one thing is also clear, when the sea level is going down everywhere in almost all industries and all countries then also our boat is running on a slightly lower level, so we can't change that. And &#x2013; but I'm quite confident that yes, we take it as a very tough challenge, but I think we have a very alert team. We have a lot of programs in place so that we are confident that we can cope with that.</p>
