          <p>Welcome to the Ericsson Analyst and Media Conference Call for the First Quarter Report. To view visual aids for this call, please log on to www.ericsson.com/press, or www.ericsson.com/investor. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, a replay will be available one hour after today's conference.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gary Pinkham, Vice President, Investor Relations, will now open the call.</p>

          <p>Thank you, operator, and hello everyone, and welcome to our conference call for the first quarter of 2009. With me here in Stockholm is Ericsson's CEO, Carl-Henric Svanberg; and our CFO, Hans Vestberg. We will be making forward-looking statements during the call today and these statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these planning assumptions and the actual results as you know may be different due to a number of factors. And we encourage you to use caution when considering such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>So, with that out of the way, I would like to hand over to Carl-Henric for comments about our results and plans going forward. Carl-Henric?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gary, and I'll be brief because I'm sure that you have seen slides and many of you have listened to the webcast this morning. On Ericsson first, then a quick update.  We had a pretty good start of the year especially in these economic times with 5% growth in constant currencies when adjusting for divested companies and currency exchange rates. That we assume means that we have continued to gain market share, obviously everybody hasn't reported yet but it's our belief we did so.</p>
          <p>We've had posted developments in the business units and Hans will come back and talk more about that in a second. We have made several great deals, which are important for the future, and you are well aware of them.  The 3G rollout in China Unicom, where we have 30% and where some of the invoicing in Q1 is from that project. Verizon Wireless was another very significant project. Most of the invoicing will come in 2010. Both of these customers are new to us and add to our position. We've also had &#x2013; made a managed services contract in U.K., two of them, one for T-Mobile and 3 UK in combination and one for Vodafone UK.</p>
          <p>Our cost reductions are on plan and Hans will talk more in detail about this. But it's interesting to start to see now effects on the costs and on the margins from these ongoing activities. And then of course, fourthly here we have our joint ventures that started with the dramatic drop in the consumer demand. I'll be back in a couple of slides and say few more words.</p>
          <p>If we think about the market update, we have seen some but so far limited effects from the economic recession. It's very much of what we said in Q4 that we hadn't seen so much but we found it unrealistic to believe that we wouldn't see some effect, we are all now seeing that some effect. We are seeing how, for example, how on the fixed side how some operators are postponing longer term payback projects, fiber rollouts.</p>
          <p>We are seeing how operators in markets like, for example, Russia, Ukraine and other markets where we've seen very dramatic declines of currencies, local currencies that are postponing projects and that is despite the fact that also in these countries the traffic patterns are largely unchanged. But we are reminding everyone as we did a quarter ago that it is difficult in this environment to precisely predict how operators will act even should the traffic patterns continue as they do.</p>
          <p>We see a very encouraging strong demand for mobile broadband, accelerated deployments of new technologies, and it's interesting to also see how leading politicians do recognize the importance of communications as a growth driver in its role of developing societies. Obama is &#x2013; part of his package $7 billion is for building broadband in China. The 3G rollout is somewhat supported &#x2013; to some extent supported by the stimulus package. The China Unicom rollout is the largest, the fastest rollout ever and this is Unicom's ambition to use every minute they can to catch up with the market leader.</p>
          <p>We are also in this &#x2013; in this market situation we are seeing an increased focus on managed services. Everyone is obviously looking for cost cutting opportunities, and managed services is one of those. And to the extent that these are discussions that are ongoing there, typically getting accelerated and we have seen a tripling opportunities here in that field. It is also a focus on in that context on cost, on network transformation as networks are being transformed from mobile and fixed networks into converged networks, and that will save cost, and that's why that is even more focused. But the long-term fundamentals are in place, haven't really been changed.</p>
          <p>If you look at the numbers for Q1, and we do it before joint ventures and restructuring, sales is I think known by all of you now, 5% up constant currencies. We are seeing sequential margin trends. The sequential gross margin was actually up 1.1% despite pressure from the initial China Unicom rollout. And the operating income of 4.7 billion is actually up 40% in the quarter, and that we should remember that &#x2013; that hedging here have had &#x2013; means that the increased or the better exchange rates from our point of view, the increased dollar and euro, what have you, is &#x2013; have so far had only limited effects.</p>
          <p>Cash flow was negative 1.7, that minus 1.7, that is again before JVs and restructuring. That minus 1.7 includes a contribution from Ericsson into our own pension trusts of 1.5. So without that we are close to zero there, still that is three billion below last year, and Hans will come back and talk about it. It's &#x2013; some portion is seasonality, some portion is the market environment.</p>
          <p>If we look at our joint ventures, it is &#x2013; everyone understands what happens in the handset market, I guess. In consumer demand we &#x2013; Sony Ericsson were down 35%, more or less in line with where you saw the market dealers decline, that of course puts the company under big pressure and there is tremendous or very extensive cost-reductions going on, 880 million euros on the OpEx side and similar ambitious programs on the cost of sales side. That part is &#x2013; we are satisfied with what we are seeing, what they are doing on the cost cutting side. Still of course it remains to be seen how the market develops and how new products are received.</p>
          <p>On the ST-Ericsson side, this is a new venture that you all are aware of, been in operation since the 1st of February. We have a base for world leadership here created. We are &#x2013; we have leading technologies in 2G, 3G, HSPA, LTE, even TD-SCDMA. We are strong suppliers here towards Nokia, Samsung, LG, Sharp and Sony Ericsson. So we have a good position there. But it's a new merger; they are affected by the same handset decline, and obviously are running at a loss. And we have similar extensive cost reductions going on here, U.S. $480 million both for rightsizing for the new environment but also to leverage for the synergies between our EMP, ST's wireless business, but also NXP.</p>
          <p>We will then go through a couple of regional comments. Western Europe minus 4% year-over-year. So it needs to be adjusted obviously for the merger of EMP with ST and the divestiture of enterprise. If we do so, we are up 5% in comparable units with some differences in the region, U.K., Italy, Germany, was in this quarter better whereas Spain was tougher. We see, as I mentioned, good demand for managed services. We have made the deals that I talked about.</p>
          <p>So with that said, I'll move on to the Central Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Here we were 12% up; this is a region with a lot of growth opportunities but also here big &#x2013; big difference between different parts of the region. As an example, Turkey, sub-Sahara showed strong growth in the quarter, both 2G expansions and 3G rollouts. Meanwhile we have &#x2013; we have slowdowns in countries where we have this large currency drops like Russia, Ukraine. This is also the reason why we are running the millennium villages in Africa, which have created both huge understanding for what communication means even in the poorest of places and it is driving a lot of also I would say goodwill for Ericsson and it's interesting to see that even in the poorest places, it is a business case for the operator and for us.</p>
          <p>If we then look at Asia-Pacific, which was a strong grower in the quarter, 26% up. Here we have large mobile broadband rollouts in both China as I mentioned after the license award there, but also in Japan lots of activities. Also major buildouts in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. As examples, where we are slower in Bangladesh and Pakistan. And as I mentioned, China Unicom's rollout was part of the China invoicing here.</p>
          <p>Latin America, up 5%. Here it's a matter of 2G expansion, still continued more subscribers in the networks. But it's also 3G rollouts. We have now 3G rollouts basically in every country throughout the region. In this quarter, we had good development in Brazil and Mexico there were the other markets with slower development. This is a region for a lot of interest for managed services. Almost in every country we have both contracts and discussions going on.</p>
          <p>If I finish up before I handover to Hans here with North America, North America was 21% up year over year. And obviously if you look at the dollar increase, there are currency impacts here, but even without those, there is an underlying positive development here in U.S. and we should end up with a good year here. There is a lot of focus on mobile broadband, not just among the operators but among consumers in general. And mobile broadband solutions, HSPA solutions are gaining a lot of momentum over more standard Wi-Fi solutions hotspots. Here obviously we had a contract with Verizon Wireless have been of major importance to us. It's a new customer and a lead position in that rollout is important for us in our leadership in LT.</p>
          <p>But with that I will leave over to Hans Vestberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl-Henric. So let me go through the financials a little bit more in detail. First of all I will comment the income figures excluding restructuring charges if I don't state otherwise. Carl-Henric talked about the sales in the quarter up 12%, and then the two large entities that we have moved out from our operation is of course the enterprise business, the PBX business that we sold last year and then the transfer of EMP. If we take that away, we have a growth of 16% and then adjust back the currency development that we have had year-over-year, we are down to 5% organic growth. So that is the organic growth in constant currency.</p>
          <p>If we look at the margin, gross margin sequentially up then from the 35.2 to 36.3. This is mainly due to the business mix, but also our efforts on the cost of sales reductions. And I would say that we also have included here, as Carl-Henric mentioned, the rollouts in China on 3G, which of course are impacting.</p>
          <p>If we then talk about the OpEx, we have seen encouraging signals on the OpEx. It's going down and that's of course is a benefit from the activities that we carried out last year. It's, however on SG&amp;A, a little bit difficult to see as the OpEx is of course exposed to the same currency changes that we have on the sales at least. So that of course gives a little bit of a trend that is going up, but the underlying is going down, it's actually the currency effect that is taking it up.</p>
          <p>All in all, ending up on operating margin of 4.7 billion Swedish kronor's and operating margin on 9.5% before the joint ventures. Here in the quarter we reported also the EMP before it became a joint venture. We had that still in Ericsson, so that's reported in the operating income before joint ventures with a loss of 500 million Swedish kronor's, 0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>If we move on to the share of earnings, where the biggest swing on the P&amp;L is coming is of course loss of 2.2 billion Swedish kronor's from our JVs. The main portion is coming from Sony Ericsson. Then that ends up in income after financial items of 3.3 billion. That is of course impacted over positive financial net of some 800 million Swedish kronor's. That would say &#x2013; I would say that is strong financial net coming from the interest rate development, but also our revaluation of financial investments. So that was a strong quarter of financial net.</p>
          <p>Net income then, including restructuring charges 1.8, and that leads to an earnings per share on 0.54. Then we have an adjusted cash flow, and here it's important that we will have an adjusted cash flow from operation, and cash from operation. The reason why we put in adjusted cash flow is that we will have disbursement over restructuring charges during the year, the cash outlays and we won't exclude that so we'll see it, but we will be very clear on exactly what we take out and we will have both on all year, but we will talk about an adjusted cash flow.</p>
          <p>We're also adjusting for any dividend or impact from joint ventures on that line. So we are also comparing it apples-to-apples. If we do that, we have an adjusted cash flow of minus 1.7 and we had last year 2.8 in positive cash flow. So that's &#x2013; that's our adjusted cash flow.</p>
          <p>If we then look into our gross position, gross cash position over the first quarter, that went down with 11 billion and our net cash went down 12 billion. The main portion of that is of course our investment in the ST-Ericsson joint venture, which is the orange part of this waterfall short, if you look at the short, which is the main portion. If we then talk about the operating cash flow, that was 2.9, then when I talk about the adjusted, we take away the 1.2 billion Swedish kronor's, which was the cash outlays from the restructuring.</p>
          <p>Then we are on 1.7 billion Swedish kronor's in negative cash flow and the main contributor to that negative cash flow is of course 1.5 that was capitalization of our pension trusts. Then the other portion are divided in two changes; one is that the other current liabilities which I would say mainly seasonality has come down, provisions, VAT, accounts payable, et cetera. Then we have the other area, which are receivable side, where the DSO was going up to 124 days.</p>
          <p>There are two reasons for that. I would say one is that we had a strong latter part of the quarter so we came with little bit more than usual sales in the end of the quarter, which of course makes it not collectible. Secondly, we are &#x2013; normally for us we try to sell off longer term of sales &#x2013; of receivables that we have with customers as a normal procedure. This time, or at the current environment, that's very difficult both for pricing and availability of that.</p>
          <p>So, and then, I would say that operators themselves; we are looking much more to the cash flow and seeing how they can optimize between quarters. I still remain with the same ambition on the 70% cash conversion for the year. And looking into one quarter is probably not how we should look into the cash flow, we see it full year. But the focus is definitely there on cash flow.</p>
          <p>If we then talk about the cost reductions and just going back a little bit to 2008 and just rolling it through so we get a feeling for the numbers here. And again, here is some type of a table that I will follow now for a while as we will have quite a lot of restructuring charges and cash layouts for it. So the 2008 program is closed, meaning that the activities are concluding, we made savings of 6.5 billion and charges of 6.7.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, we have still provisions for 3.3 that is the cash outlays that will come through the year and a little bit in 2010. So that &#x2013; that we still have from that program the cash outlays because there is a timing effect in between the two of them. We will follow that number so we know how much we have.</p>
          <p>2009 program, as we announced as we announced in the first &#x2013; when the fourth quarter was announced, targeting at 10 billion Swedish kronor's reduction mid 2010, basically 50/50 OpEx and cost of sales, with an estimated six to seven billion in restructuring charges. There we have initiated the main part of activities and early in the process, we feel that we are on track with that process. That means also we took some restructuring charges in the first quarter from that program of 0.7.</p>
          <p>At the bottom, you see the table where we outline all the restructuring charges taken so far, and then the cash outlays for the quarter as well, how much were taken. There will be a sort of a difference in between them because not all restructuring charges will be cash impacting, as there might be some assets that are not cash impacting that goes away. But we will follow this so you get a feeling for how much we have in cash outlays and restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Third, then if we take a look at the three segments, starting with networks. Networks up 12%, as Carl-Henric mentioned, a good growth and a couple of strategic wins in the quarter. We can see a decreasing level of network rollout services growth. We have typically had a higher growth of network rollout services, we are now down to four, indicating of course that we have a little lower pace on larger projects, but the local deliveries. And they usually lag in between each other.</p>
          <p>If we then talk about the operating margin coming in at 10, an improvement since last years on 9. Main reason of course, the business mix but also the cost adjustments done here, as well as we have FX impacts here. And this is despite the 3G rollout in China, which is &#x2013; I mentioned earlier, a large breaking. And we had sales through China on 3G in the first quarter, even though we got the contract in the quarter as well.</p>
          <p>If we then just look at the market and see what trends and what that means for networks, with the traffic growth that requires transmission, but also the packet data networks upgrades, which we have seen in the quarter increasing our sales of MiniLink and SmartEdge products.</p>
          <p>Moving into services, 28% growth in services. They have a little bit different pattern when they come to currencies because they are strong in Europe. They have a 10% growth in constant currencies, which is of course a strong first quarter. We see managed services and systems integration demand continuing to move up. Managed services grew 34% year-over-year and we announced a couple of very important strategic deals in the U.K. We have now 275 million subscribers in the networks where we run managed services. The operating margin came in at 15%, an improvement. Of course, business mix we did not have many new managers being starting up in the quarter, and secondly the continuously efficiency gains, and cost reduction in services of course are giving some impact as well.</p>
          <p>Finally, ending up with multimedia. And here of course we have the most changes when it comes to comparable units. The PBX business and the EMP business has been transferred to DAV that we have restated here and that means that we have a growth of 25% for comparable units. The main drivers for that growth is the revenue management and IPX, or as we call it multimedia brokering. We have a positive margin of 2% in the quarter, improving from last years minus nine and we have had now for a couple of quarters having improved margins.</p>
          <p>Still, it's important to remind that we have a portion of business here that is investment area and we have a portion, which is healthy growing, and healthy margin business. So we can have some swings here, but we see definitely a positive development. Finally, in the segment we can say that the cable and satellite operators are postponing the TV investment, which is impacting parts of the portfolio of multimedia.</p>
          <p>I'd like to hand back to Carl-Henric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, quick summary. Good start of the year. We are winning strategic deals, we are winning market shares. We have seen some, but still limited effects from the recession. It is difficult to precisely predict how operators will act quarter-by-quarter, but we think our industry will be less affected than most other segments of society. And we have our joint ventures that are affected by the slowdown and the extensive programs are ongoing to get profitability quickly.</p>
          <p>So with that said, I'll hand back to Gary to guide us through questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl-Henric. Operator, we're ready to start the Q&amp;A session now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will now take our first question from Mark Sue with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl-Henric, you are seeing strength where others are not, some who are pointing to down minus 10% trends, can it all be market share gains? If so, is it sustainable or is there some timing element where a lot of the good news is front end loaded this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think everybody has to speak for themselves. We have probably the &#x2013; we have the most extensive position and the most distributor position throughout the world. Everybody else has more limited positions geographically or maybe from a product point of view. I think it's hard to understand exactly where everybody makes their assumptions. It is also clear that we are, I think, positioned with the strongest growing companies and we are &#x2013; we're gaining more market share than our fair share of the large and new brought backs that are old projects that are part of this market. So, I think this is what we see and I think the others have to speak for themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly Carl-Henric, just Nokia Siemens purchasing the Nortel wireless assets, does that change the dynamics at all for Ericsson?  Does that pose further opportunities for market share gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; I think it will be interesting now to follow and see what happens with the Nortel assets. When you think about this grand company that had at the Chapter 11 time some 30,000 people and there may be a handful of 1,000 that would be transferred somewhere, I don't think it really matters so much. It's also taking a lot of time, which means that they don't keep as, the value of them, I guess, deteriorates a bit over time. It's more business that goes into maintenance mode. So I don't think it really matters so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, and good luck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have two. First one is for Hans. Hans, I wonder if you could elaborate on the source of the 4.4 billion hedging loss that you reported in the quarter. Should we be assuming that that's associated with BNET, or is it related to activity in some other business unit? And then, I have one other question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can answer, on the 4.4 billion of hedges losses that mainly is contributed &#x2013; we hedge our transactions when it comes to hardware and software. So of course, that main part is coming into the segment networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then, the second question I've got is for Carl-Henric. I wonder, Carl-Henric, could you just catch us up on your latest disposition towards Sony Ericsson? And, I guess in addition to just discussing how you see the unit now, if you could talk a little bit about how willing you would be to inject more cash there if it were necessary later in the year? I would appreciate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And maybe &#x2013; let me just have one comment on hedges from more principal or &#x2013; point of view first. So we don't want you to do too much of a mathematical exercise here or to easy a mathematical exercise. First of all, currency changes have so far had very little impact on us because of the hedging contract. I think you do appreciate that. But it's also important to remember that we are &#x2013; a lot of our invoicing is in U.S. dollars and we are in competition with worldwide players that are non-U.S. based, which means that currency changes over time will become part of the competitive dynamics in the business. Having said that, a better exchange rate is better for us, but it's not just mathematical additions.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Sony Ericsson, we have to look back to the whole theory of that we've been involved. They have added a great value in &#x2013; for us to understand the consumer and the trends and the requirements on the networks and in providing M2M solutions. And I would say that they had a pretty, both Sony and Sony Ericsson had a pretty important role when we won the Verizon LTE deal because they &#x2013; that we spent a lot of time initially there about the ecosystem and where consumer behavior will go long term before we even got into base stations and megabits per second and what have you. We have made 35 billion in that joint venture, half of it has come to us and 8.5 billion is dividends.</p>
          <p>So it's been a largely a good thing. Of course now they are in big turmoil because of the market decline, and as responsible owners we are working very hard close to them as Sony does in helping them to come back to profitability as soon as possible. And in that timeframe we're not discussing anything about where &#x2013; what our future plans will be. I don't think it's yet clear whether they will need a capital injection or not. But certainly we cannot rule it out. And if they do, as a responsible owner I guess we will stand behind them.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I'm interested to know how you would &#x2013; how you think we should calibrate the deployment in China.

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a couple of questions. One of them is just a follow-up to Carl-Henric. I just want to understand the 4.4 billion negative loss on and currency hedges that have impacted P&amp;L, how one-time in nature are they? Are you saying they are not one-time in nature, are they going to continue or are they not, I just want to have some idea as to whether we should we be thinking what the underlying profitability of Ericsson is? Because it does seems that if that goes away, your earnings at some point are going to double and probably in the next six to nine months. I just want to have some clarity there of what the net P&amp;L impact is of hedges?</p>
          <p>The second thing is, again for Carl-Hendric. Your tone sounds a little bit more conservative than what we've heard over the past three months. I'm just wondering has visibility and infrastructure, do you think, started to deteriorate in terms of the impact of CapEx cuts that we heard about four months ago, and your now beginning to talk about them in the emerging markets, is that beginning to happen do you think?</p>
          <p>Then third and finally for Hans Vestberg, just on the gross margin, what was the positive business mix of gross margin in Q1? Was there any IPR related sales activity that could have helped that or was it just all cost cutting, what was the business mix improvement that you talk about? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First, start with the hedges. And remember now that we hedge for 6 to 12 months. So much of the hedges that we have right now, that are from the beginning or mid from last year. Secondly, we hedge against our transaction. And in the quarter we had had a lot of transactions and also the currency has been volatile in the quarter. We had, for example, nine Swedish kronor's for a dollar in the month of February, so of course, in March, sorry. So that of course impacted somewhat when we do that comparison to the hedges. So one need to have the both in mind, the transaction gains that we have and then the hedge losses, we call them hedge and losses, in the totality. So that's what we are playing with here.</p>
          <p>Of course, if all things are equal over time, we will see a gradual improvement. But remember still we have hedges that now will continue to impact going through Q2 and then a little bit less in Q3 and Q4. Then on the other hand, we will also have different type of transactions coming in there during the year, given what is happening in the marketplace. So you cannot draw the conclusion that that will improve directly the P&amp;L over time. But overall, if the currencies stays where they are right now, that's positive for Ericsson with the exposure that we have to the dollar and SEK, et cetera. So that will give a positive effect at the time when the hedges &#x2013; exchange rate on the hedges are improving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I just to answer on the tone there. It is not intended to be a change of tone. We had said after Q4 that we saw limited effects in our industry, but we also said that it was unrealistic that we wouldn't be affected somewhat. And now we are saying that we are seeing we're somewhat impacted like Ukraine, like Russia, like on the fixed side. So, I think we are just confirming much of what we have expected here. We are also saying that it's difficult to precisely predict how operators will spend, that is a comment from the Q4 report as well. So for us, it's very much as we have expected it and it's not meant to be a change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on the gross margin then, I referred to business mix. And what I meant was of course that we had a little bit lower number of rollouts and we had a higher proportion of professional services, which of course improved the margins somewhat. And then, when it comes to the cost improvements or savings in the cost of sales, remember last year we had a fair amount of cost adjustment going to cost of sales as well, not only OpEx, that's the sort of impact. I would say mainly it is in services where we have done a lot of efficiency gains through the year with centralization, et cetera, which they do all the time, but it is starting to pay-off right now. That was what I meant with the business mix, and the cost improvement.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to be clear, there is not significant IPR impact in Q1 and are you expecting anything in Q2, because there have been a lot of IPR transfers it seems in the market in the past six months?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. In the first quarter you've drawn a bit more than usual on your provisions. So part of that is restructuring but if we exclude restructuring you have utilized 1.8 billion of provision, which is fairly higher than what you've been utilizing over the last four quarters. Could you give us a bit of color on that and what are the operating rationales for this higher utilization of provisions during the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all the reason why they come there somewhere is because we want to utilize them. So I feel it's fine that we utilize them. But you're right, it was with higher utilization on the sort of, if you exclude the restructuring charges but that comes from the commitment and the provisions that are taken earlier for customer commitments or warranties or things like that that came up in the first quarter. So it was nothing unusual, but it was a little bit higher. But it only reflects that the provisions that were made is now getting paid out.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Mike Alexander in for Ed Snyder. On inventories up 10%, is this just the normal build-up before the year, or are you seeing some build-up because customers are slowing down purchases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. This is just a normal inventories to a largest extent is work in progress. Inventories, in fact there is some supply chain &#x2013; are always at the minimum. So this is just normal build up for the growth that is going on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then in multimedia, now that Ericsson mobile platforms has moved out to ST- Ericsson, what should we expect revenue and margin lies for the multimedia segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the &#x2013; we &#x2013; multimedia is what we have said before is of course we are taking out both enterprise and EMP. But multimedia is a mix of several strong growing businesses with good growth and good bottom line. They are also &#x2013; but there is also investments going on in IPT, the solutions and messaging. So it's different parts of it, some of it is long-term R&amp;D and others is good business. And dependent then on the where there &#x2013; that could for that reason be some swings between quarters. But certainly this is an area of good growth, and this quarter was an example of that.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones if I could. I just &#x2013; you've signed a few contracts for the 6000 series base station in the Nordic region. I just wondered &#x2013; you mentioned this morning that Unicom hasn't signed that. I just wonder if could give us some references outside the Nordic region for that particular product? Second one is just on managed services. You are talking about very strong bookings and the outlook looking very strong. Is that coming from traditional operators looking to reduce costs or is it new build outs that are looking to sort of manage cost down that way? And then the final one's just on government financing. There has been a lot of talk recently that you're receiving more government financing, AMX getting some from the Chinese Development Bank. I just wondered whether you feel the Swedish government is still being very supportive, and whether the Chinese banks are being very supportive to Ericsson as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to start off, with RBS 6000, the fact that that is a nature of that business that is determining when RBS 6000 will come in. RBS 6000 is the next-generation base station, so that will be just logically replacing most of business in the next couple of years. We are starting off with RBS 3000, I think RBS 6000 will start off during the autumn somewhere in China. So there is no &#x2013; not any &#x2013; there is no sort of degree of success or anything, it's just the next generation, and it has more capabilities and had a better cost efficiency equation there.</p>
          <p>In terms of managed services, I hand it over to Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding managed services, we can say that it is two types of customers are looking in for it. The more Western European operators has increased their interest in it, especially from taking out cost and in that we can see basic on all major plays are into this right now and doing it. At the same time, we have the emerging markets or the developing markets where many operators are also doing it the same time given that they need confidence and rapid buildup and support. I would say, going back three years, the change is that we have much more of Tier 1s being very entrenched in these discussions and doing this and managed services.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we see more operators number one or number two in emerging markets doing the same. So yes, we're seeing a trend shift a little bit on the interest and the demand and the discussions and we can see it on the deals that we have signed in interest this quarter will of course are rolled up on this Tier 1 operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But yeah, if we talk about our EQM business, the financing support that we get from the Swedish Export Credit authority that is working very good for us. I think they do everything we can expect from them. I don't think that anybody gets any better commercial terms in the world than we get from them. So we have nothing more to ask for there.</p>
          <p>It is true that China provides similar support to their vendors? Occasionally we read reports from guys like yourselves or analysts that are indicating that they're getting support that goes beyond what they are supposed to get, I guess from VTO regulations. I cannot confirm if that is the case. I can just assume it's not. It's an interesting question also. I'm not sure whether you actually said that. But considering that we have been there since 1892 and have as much people in our supply chain and our own employment as any of the others have, I suppose we should get our fair share of the Chinese financing also when we export out of China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I just wanted to ask a bit more about seasonality and visibility. Listening to operators, it does seem to be the case that some are between their reports in February and their first quarter reports in April, May, there has been some kind of late cycle impacts coming through and most operators seem to be lowering guidance for one reason or another and trimming CapEx as they do. Is this something you've seen?</p>
          <p>And I appreciate you've been asked this before, but it would just be helpful to understand whether we should just expect a typical year in terms of seasonality or if something different is happening? And then a very brief follow-up on the ST-Ericsson. Just to double-check, the 500 million crown January loss to DMP before it was put into the joint venture, that's presumably non-recurring. I imagine that the run rates of losses in the joint ventures have now changed very meaningfully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we can just confirm the last comment, so I'll take that first, but that can be confirmed, it's non-recurring. Now, it's our share of ST-Ericsson business that matters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the &#x2013; if there is a change there, we are following the operators very closely and reading all the same documentation as you are. And I think there is a &#x2013; from some of the operators, you can see that they've lowered their CapEx guidance. The important thing is to go beyond general statements and look at what really happens there. You can see at the more explicit AT&amp;T for example, in their reporting that where they &#x2013; where they're saying that they're seeing &#x2013; that they are somewhat affected on the fixed line revenues and therefore they're limiting fixed guidance. But they're moving $1 billion from fixed to mobile investments. And I think if you really read them through, we will see that most of them at least in their strong positions and so on in their big markets, they are not changing their guidance in particular. But there are of course cases when they do, but that is also when we're saying don't forget that there are more larger projects like China, like U.S. and others that are ongoing as well, that's also part of the market. So there will always be some ups and downs, but the totality I think is a little bit of where we try to describe it.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Well, seasonality is &#x2013; I mean, I don't think that we have a &#x2013; every year becomes somewhat unique, of course, but I don't think there is anything in particular that makes us expect a very different seasonality this year than other years. But there will always be reasons why there can be difference in a year or difference for a particular vendor.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for taking my question. It's about DSO, which increased yet again. And you point to some explanation in your release. Where do you see this trending? Ericsson has seen a massive buildup in working capital. And when you look at working capital to sales ratios, it is actually the most capital intensive business in the industry, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said before, yeah, yeah. We have an increase on the DSO and there are several reasons for it as I explained before. We are not happy with it. We are continuously working with it, but we also need to acknowledge that there is market situation out there. And we of course are trying to improve the payment conditions with our customers, which in these circumstances so that's what we're doing. We have &#x2013; if you go back since we have been talking to folks on the cash flow and the DSO, we have constantly improved, but this quarter, we have a setback. But, I wouldn't judge one quarter to be significant or unique, but of course it's a warning signal, and we are working hard with it. I would judge it when the year is over to see that we work it through. But we are working on it. And we still remain with our targets for DSO and for the cash conversion and that's what we are sort of geared our internal organization with and we just need to work with our customers to see that we fix it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up. Of the six to seven billion restructuring, how much of that is going to be cash on your current estimate and what is going to be the timing of the related cash outs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. It's a little bit hard to predict at this moment, but I think that a large portion of it will be cash-out. It depends a little bit how we do our site concentration and how that will impact on certain sites, et cetera. It's a little bit too early to say and just remember that was an estimate of six to seven, we're going to see you at glance. But we will continue to report as we are doing right now, both the restructuring charge and the cash outlays that we have done and the ones that we have on the balance sheet and to try to give you as good visibility of that as possible because we understand that's an important measure for you.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have two. And the first one is again pertaining to working capital. If I understand well, we already have the &#x2013; we heard from you already, by the end of Q4 that the increased activity at the end of the quarter had deteriorated working capital metrics and therefore the operating cash flow, and I'm under the impression we're hearing the same argument again now, so can you explain when we will get some payback on that? How you think it's working to normal? Is this the result of the ongoing credit crisis?</p>
          <p>And the second question is really housekeeping. The parent company does no longer disclose the license revenue, so far as I understand. Are you going to disclose those in another way? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the working capital, you are right. We had a very strong fourth quarter. We also had a very strong end of the Q1. That is not the full explanation that our DSO was going up. That was the other explanation I talked that we have. We are in a situation where operators also optimize their cash flow in seeing how they pay their bills, et cetera. As I said, my ambition is that should be improved over the year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your housekeeping question, as it's written in the report, we are gradually moving our IPRs over to the EAV companies and ABcompany, where we're both especially for operational reasons because we have the costs et cetera there so we can match them. So, yes, you cannot see them today there fully. If we're going to disclose patent revenues over time, that is something that we need to discuss, we have not decided.</p>

          <p>Maybe one should also just say that we have always on your note how we disclose it. One thing is numbers, but we are a little bit cautious there because these are normally confidential agreements as they are written one by one of them. That's the normal case. But secondly, we do comment and have always done if we have more or less IPRs. So, you need to understand &#x2013; that we think you need to understand in modeling the business.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much, good afternoon. I had a question on managed services. Hans, I think this morning you said that the growth rate as that business gets bigger or professional services gets bigger would inevitably decline. And then this of course started with a comment about the potential tripling from managed services so far this year. So I was wondering if you could just give us an overview of where you think we are in the lifecycle of managed services? Are we still at the early stages or do you think we are starting to get closer to maturation which would be implied by your comments around slowing growth in absolute percentage terms?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that if we look from a maturity model internally at Ericsson we are sort of closing to the third stage that we sometimes defined. Still we have some levels to go, meaning that we have now a model that is global. We run managers as efficiently across the globe as one operation. We still have some more centralization to do over time here. So I think that we are getting to quite good-matured on our managers as model, which means that it's very scalable. I think that I try to a little bit support the professional services guys when I said &#x2013; when the question came, if these growth rates that they have of 20, 25, 30% will continue, I use say that remember that that comes from lower level of absolute numbers, so the percentage you shouldn't look for that, but that we should find growth both in managers and in professional services going forward, that will be important. Then of course in managed services, you sort of get the stepwise, you get in the new deal and that is in your recurrent base and is rolling in. So, it could be a quarter, a little bit less, and then it comes one which is going up again and then you're on the way, but overall, we should see a good growth in managed services given the demand that we see out in the marketplace.</p>
