          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning in London. Good evening to our guests in Hong Kong via the satellite. And welcome also to those joining via webcast or conference call.</p>
          <p>Introductions first, in Hong Kong we have our Executive Directors, Vincent Cheng, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Sandy Flockhart; Chief Executive of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, also in Hong Kong, Edgar Ancona, the Chief Financial Officer, and Russell Picot, HSBC Group Chief Accounting Officer</p>
          <p>In London are our other Executive Directors; to my right Mike Geoghegan, Group Chief Executive; to my left Douglas Flint, Group Finance Director and on the end there Stuart Gulliver, Chief Executive of Global Banking and Markets and of HSBC Global Asset Management. And I'm very pleased to welcome in the front row here Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, one of our non-Executive Directors.</p>
          <p>Let me first remind you to take a minute to read the usual forward-looking statements, and the target audience page that you can see on the screens now.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by summarizing the performance of HSBC in 2008. HSBC was, of course, not immune to this extraordinary financial crisis, but it has fared better than most. Our resilient results show the success of a diverse business model, and our trademark financial strength.</p>
          <p>The headlines, profit before tax of $19.9 billion, excluding the one-off impairment of goodwill in the United States, and 9.3 billion on a reported basis. Profit attributable, $5.7 billion or $16.3 billion, excluding the goodwill impairment. Earnings per share $1.36, excluding goodwill impairment; 0.47 net of it. And return on equity 13.3%, excluding the goodwill impairment and 4.7% net of it.</p>
          <p>We've retained our capital strength. Tier 1 capital at 8.3% is within our target range. The uncertain economic outlook has led us to announce today's Rights Issue to further strengthen our capital  base, and more of that later. Dividends paid in respect to 2008 totaled $7.7 billion or &#xA3;4.6 billion, and dividends per share are  $0.64.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over the Mike to take you through the business highlights.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephen. As you all know, 2008 has been an exceptionally challenging year, HSBC's performance has been resilient in difficult times. Thanks to our trademark strengths of diversification, financial strength and self-funding. One of our key strengths is our broadly diversified Group business both by geography and by customer.</p>
          <p>The slide in front of you shows that we've been profitable in three out of our four regions, Asia, Latin America and Europe. These three regions produced pre-tax profits of over $24 billion, a very strong result. The losses in North America and the goodwill impairment charge to North America Personal Financial Services have been a drag on profitability, and I'll talk about that later on as we restructure this business.</p>
          <p>Looking in our figures another way, you can see that we were profitable in all our customer groups with the exceptional Personal Financial Services, because of the weakness in the USA. These strong performances means that HSBC is open for business, we're able to support our customers, when other banks can't.</p>
          <p>We increased lending last year in all regions outside of North America on an underlying basis. We are writing more business and we are growing our margins. We grew customer advances by 9% on an underlying basis.</p>
          <p>Smaller firms, globally, are finding it very difficult to obtain credit and we therefore launched a global $5 billion SME fund to support this most important sector. And obviously, we are focusing on asset quality as we grow in this business.</p>
          <p>Being recognized as a strong and solid Group across the world has led to us attracting significantly more deposits, in fact, they are up 17%. And in a period of very low interest rates, that tells a story in itself. As deposit growth exceeded lending growth, we've improved our already strong advances deposit ratio to 84%. This is one of the best ratios of any major bank in the world.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to ask Douglas to go through the numbers. Douglas.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. This slide shows the results on a reported basis. For the first time, revenues exceeded $80 billion and after loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions, which rose by 45% to $25 billion. We had net operating income of $57 billion, to absorb our expenses and deliver a return to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses, excluding goodwill impairment, consumed around $39 billion broadly in line with last year. And after contributions from our associates and joint ventures, profit before tax excluding goodwill impairment was just under $20 billion.</p>
          <p>For reasons we'll discuss shortly, we have now written-off fully in 2008 all of the goodwill held in relation to our North American Personal Financial Services business. And that takes us down to our reported profit before tax of $9.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to the significant factors within our results. The first three items are all non-cash items. The first point is to remind you that last year benefited from $1.1 billion of dilution gains arising from our inability to take up shares offered by our Mainland Chinese associates.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the major factor in 2008 is clearly the full impairment of North American Personal Financial Services goodwill. And this write-off was necessitated as a result of significant deterioration in the U.S. economy and rising unemployment, which were particularly evident in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>These factors reduced the cash flows foreseeable from the segment. And this together with a higher applicable discount rate and the impact of structural changes to the business in the United States, which Mike is going to discuss later, led to the conclusion that goodwill held in this segment was fully impaired.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, as credit spreads widened generally, we also saw our own credit spread widen. And this led to higher recorded gains on our own debt held at fair value. And clearly, we don't consider these gains as part of managed performance and the benefit of our own credit spread is recorded in other and is not attributed to any of our customer groups. And as we've said before, these gains will also reverse over time. If you strip these non-cash items out of both years, reported pre-tax income was lower by 34%.</p>
          <p>The other items on this slide are broadly self-explanatory and I'll deal with Global Banking and Markets write-downs in a later slide. But there are perhaps two other observations. The equity investments impairments reflect a requirement to write-down equity investments as share prices have fallen materially. And on top of private equity and principal investments, the other significant impairments recognized in 2008 were against strategic investments in Vietnam and India where we remained comfortable with the investments we've made.</p>
          <p>On debt securities impairment, I'll deal with asset backed securities later, but this category also included a number of impairments from assets, which were held as part of the deployment of our own liquidity, and reflected the failure of a number of financial institutions in the United States and Iceland.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2008 against 2007 on an underlying basis and that's simply constant currency and stripping out of both years the impacts of acquisitions and disposals and the dilution gains last year. You can see that the dominant impacts are higher loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions and the goodwill write-off. A positive observation would be that on the underlying basis expenses including -- excluding goodwill were flat and that compares with underlying growth of 10% last year.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the second half of 2008 was weak, driven primarily by higher impairment charges and lower deposit spreads against our businesses. But notwithstanding the latter point we have continued to grow net interest income, benefiting from being positioned in balance sheet management for those lower interest rates. The second half of 2008 also benefited from the credit spread widening on our own debt.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, considerable attention was paid in 2008 to further enhancing the liquidity of the balance sheet. And this slide shows the underlying deposit growth of close to double that of loans to customers, leading to the advance deposit ratio that Mike mentioned of 84% at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>I want to spend quite a bit more time in these results looking at our balance sheet, and how we look at risk within it. Reported total assets are broadly in line with last year at $2.5 trillion. Let's break that down. $228 billion is into bank placements in cash, not much I can add to explain that. Over $900 billion is made up of loans and advances to customers. Mike's going to talk in more detail about the Untied States position, but let me deal now with credit quality trends taking the business as whole.</p>
          <p>Clearly, in Personal Financial Services, North America dominates as it has done for a number of years and Mike will deal with that. Rising loan impairment charges in Latin America reflect growth in unsecured lending in the last couple of years as well as rising delinquencies as economic conditions have deteriorated, and this has taken loan impairment charge in Latin America to slightly above that of Europe where the actions taken in the UK in 2006 to curtail unsecured lending and stand aside from the more exuberant parts of the mortgage markets are now benefiting our credit performance.</p>
          <p>Our credit charge in Asia has risen, but remains modest in the context of the Group charge and largely reflects the build-out of credit card and personal lending portfolios in India and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Turning to Commercial Banking. The charges doubled that of the prior year and this largely reflects the fact for the last couple of years we have been noting exceptionally low charges. Our Commercial Banking business continued to grow profitably.</p>
          <p>And finally in Global Banking and Markets, the impairment charge reflects the financial institution impairments within balance sheet management that I motioned in the significant factors earlier, as well as some $279 million of impairment on asset-backed securities, arising in the available for sale securities portfolios as well as a relatively small number of corporate credit failures during the last year.</p>
          <p>Turning back to the balance sheet again. On derivatives, although total assets are some two and a half times the size of last year, this primarily reflects volatility and movement in yield curves and foreign exchange rates and credit spreads, all of which were particularly acute in the last quarter of last year. The underlying notional values increased by only 8%. And as you are aware, we're required under IFRS to show the gross fair value of derivative assets, taking very little benefit for netting or credit support arrangements.</p>
          <p>Taking into account the benefits of netting and collateral of $495 billion of assets comes down to $112 billion against 66 billion in the prior year. And importantly less than 2% of our derivatives are valued on a model basis where the inputs are unobservable.</p>
          <p>If we turn now to trading assets of $427 billion, more than 65% is represented by government or government agency bonds, settlement accounts and secured lending against collateral. Approximately $80 billion is represented by corporate bonds, of which financial institutions comprised a significant element. Most of the $22 billion of equities are held linked to offsetting derivatives. All of these assets are mark-to-market and again less than 2% of our trading assets are valued on the so-called Level 3 basis, i.e. mark-to-model without observable input.</p>
          <p>Within trading performance, this slide shows the progression of write-downs and legacy credit trading and securitization activity assets as well as updating our exposure to monoline insurers. You can see that in relation to subprime assets our residual exposure has significantly declined during the year. While in relation to our exposure to monolines while we taken on new fresh exposure, the widening of credit spreads has increased the fair value of the protection contractually committed. The notional value of the assets referenced to this monoline exposure is $12.4 billion, which is $3 billion lower than last year.</p>
          <p>The table illustrates the significant write-downs we've made in 2008, particularly against non-investment grade counterparties where that -- the increased exposure there reflects downgrading during 2008 of previously investment grade monolines.</p>
          <p>The slide also tracks the performance of assets reclassified in the second half of 2008 predominantly to loans and advances following revisions to IAS 39. Subsequent impairment was $26 million. Had the transfers not been made, mark-to-market losses, which by definition would not reflect impairment, would have been some $3.5 billion higher. And then finally, financial investments of $300 billion.</p>
          <p>Government's exposure is approximately $90 billion. Product guaranteed by government is another $40 billion. $100 billion is predominantly to banks and other financial institutions which leaves $56 billion of asset-backed securities and this is where the majority of risk in this portfolio lies. So let's turn to that.</p>
          <p>You can see from this slide that asset-backed securities within the available for sale category, account for virtually all of the AFS reverse at December 2008. $20 billion of the portfolio is high quality government agency bonds against which there is very little reserve.</p>
          <p>The structured investment conduits, which we took on board during 2008 to protect the income note holders from a forced liquidation of the underlying assets, have substantially declined in carrying value. And although, they represent $7.2 billion of the AFS reserve, HSBC's position is protected by first loss protection from the equity notes within these vehicles. These amount to in excess of $2 billion, which comfortably exceeds our estimate of the likely losses which will arise as these portfolios mature. That leaves some $21 billion of securities to which are attached a bit under $12 billion of the AFS reserve.</p>
          <p>The slide illustrates the various asset categories for them where the most at risk assets are Alt-A  securities within retail mortgage backed securities and home equity line of credit. These are valued with reference to independently source cumulative default and loss severities statistics as well as our own analysis of the excess spread and cash flow prioritization on each and every bond.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide and to respond in part to the very wide range of estimates that exist in the marketplace, we're providing in our accounts and on the slide, our own sensitivity assessments of this risk. We continually stress this portfolio to assess likely capital consumption from possible impairment.</p>
          <p>We do this by stressing the loss expectation variables I mentioned a moment ago. By way of example in respect of Alt-A, by between 33 and 50%, and we close to double the variables for sub-prime.</p>
          <p>These stress tests indicate a possible risk in the range of 2 to $2.5 billion over the next two to three years with a likely ultimate expected loss of around a third of that figure over the next three to four years. Let me hand you over to Mike for a review of business performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Douglas. This slide shows how we performed against our financial measures. We are showing the figures with and without goodwill and the impairment charge.</p>
          <p>Excluding the goodwill impairment our return on equity in 2008 was 13.3% close to the target range, and whilst the target range is challenging, we do believe over the cycle that we can operate within it. Our cost efficiency ratio was better than the target ex goodwill. We have maintained our capital strengthen, and more on that later and our shareholders return has been above the peer group average.</p>
          <p>In our Asian business,  in our Asian heartland, we generated profits of $11.9 billion which, excluding dilution gains, was slightly down on 2007. This principally reflects the significant reduced turnover in equity markets in Hong Kong during the year and which impacted revenues in Global Banking and Markets, Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. There was also an increase in loan impairment charges in Commercial Banking although from a very low level as the economy slowed. Overall, the credit quality of the book remains sounds.</p>
          <p>Outside of Hong Kong our Asian business continued to perform strongly. They contributed to a 30% growth in profits to a record $4.7 billion. There was notable growth in Korea, Mainland China and India.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East, we grew profits before tax to a record of $1.7 billion, up 34%. This growth was broadly based across all major markets and customer groups with particular strength in Global Banking and Markets. Since early 2007, we have been tightening credit origination, but we are beginning to see some credit deterioration in Personal Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Strong growth in Europe came from Personal Financial Services and Private Banking and was further assisted by disposals and fair value gains. Excluding this growth and with lower profits in Global Banking and Markets arising from write-downs, European profits were down. In the UK our financial brand and the strength helped us build market share as we were able to remain open for business when others couldn't.</p>
          <p>There has been a lot of comment in the U.K. and Hong Kong about whether banks are open for business. HSBC certainly is. This slide shows the growth in the both lending and deposits among our personal and commercial customers in these two very important markets. In Hong Kong, we grew lending to Personal Financial Services and commercial customers by 11% in the 2008. In the UK, lending increased by 12%, partially on the back of the RateMatcher mortgage campaign, which we launched last spring to attract customers facing interest rate resets with other banks. This brought in about &#xA3;5.4 billion of new business. With an average LTV of 59%, these are high quality assets. For 2009 to build on this success, we have also established a &#xA3;15 billion mortgage fund and the quality of the mortgage book overall remains remarkably strong.</p>
          <p>Our commercial lending in the U.K. grew by 9% but it would be fair to say that we are now beginning to see some increases in provisioning but off a low base and with low individual nominal  amounts. In both the U.K. and Hong Kong we attracted higher deposits from customers who sought refuge from their market turmoil.</p>
          <p>Our core businesses are thriving and our financial strength and our funding base, gives us the opportunity to take market share from more constrained competitors.</p>
          <p>We increased revenues in Latin America in 2008 but loan impairment charges in Mexico and Brazil are increasing and increasing operating costs across the region led to a decline in profit before tax of 6%.</p>
          <p>Global Banking and Markets posted tax &#x2013; pre-tax profits of $3.5 billion, after write-downs of $6.1 billion arising from market turmoil and higher loan impairment charges of $1.5 billion. These results underpin the success of our strategy to be emerging markets led and finance focused. Emerging markets now contribute two thirds of the profit before tax up from &#x2013; up from a half in 2006.</p>
          <p>Core businesses including foreign exchange, rates, balance sheet management and financing and equity capital markets, all achieve record revenues.</p>
          <p>HSBC Private Bank held up well in difficult market conditions, in which clients adopted a conservative stance. Net new fund flows were strong, although total client assets decreased mainly because of falling markets.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit was up 4% -- sorry pre-tax profit was down 4% from 2007's record profit. We're please to move up a place in Euromoney's annual ranking and to  be named the world's second best private bank. And I see Chris Mears in the audience. I'm surprised we're not first, Chris.</p>
          <p>Anyway, as we turn to Insurance, premium growth remain resilient in all regions, both Latin America, North America achieved higher profits. Overall, weak equity markets, particularly in Asia caused profits to fall by 19% to $2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Before I start talking about North America, let me summarize the core businesses outside the USA. They are solid and profitable, and we are taking market share in assets and liabilities. Although, credit quality is weakening, it is doing so very slightly and remains remarkably robust at this stage of the economic cycle. So while we do not underestimate the scale of the economic challenges in 2009, we think there's a lot to go for with HSBC now recognized as the number one brand in financial services.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the USA, where all our businesses have struggled. And this is not surprising considering the rapid decline in asset values and the rapid rise in unemployment. In 2008, we made a loss in North America of $15.5 billion, bank and the finance company. The dominant factors were  the loss of $6.8 billion in Personal Financial Services in both the bank and the finance company. This resulted in our decision to write-off the entire goodwill value of $10.6 billion relating to Personal Financial Services. Losses in the bank were primarily due to markdown in non-core assets in Global Banking and Markets, which are reflected in their results.</p>
          <p>As we've announced, we're going to write no new business in consumer lending and it along with Mortgage Services and Vehicle Finance will now be run-off. This slide shows that we now have $147 billion of consumer lending assets, down 12% in 12 months. We have now announced, we are going to split this portfolio between core and non-core businesses and run off the non-core portfolio.</p>
          <p>In this room in March 2007, I said that it would take us three years to fix Mortgage Services and so far after two years the book is down from $47 billion to $28 billion. In summary, we saw the problem before others and have had the benefit of first mover advantage. During 2008 credit quality has deteriorated slightly, but this mature book is now relatively stable. However, it could be impacted by further rises in unemployment.</p>
          <p>The speed of the run-off has slowed due to difficulties of customers finding alternative finance as the industry has rapidly contracted and we wait to see what future initiatives the U.S. administration will announce to stimulate the housing market.</p>
          <p>Turning to Vehicle Finance. This is running off to plan. Although credit quality has deteriorated, it is within our expectations and we still expect this book to run-off over the next five years. The message from this slide is that HSBC, when it focuses on run-offs, is very successful.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Consumer Lending, because basically, there isn't any home equity to support the demand for debt to consolidation finance, there is no longer a viable Consumer Lending product. Therefore, HSBC Finance has announced today that it will cease to write new consumer finance business through the HFC and Beneficial brands in the USA. It will close most its HFC and Beneficial branches and will focus on running off or selling portfolio of real estate secured loans of 46 billion and its unsecured portfolio of 16 billion. We are hopeful that HSBC Finance will be as successful running off the Consumer Lending as it has been with Mortgage Services and Vehicle Finance. But again we do believe that over the next two years provisioning will remain elevated, particularly if unemployment continues to rise.</p>
          <p>In addition to HSBC's U.S. retail bank network, the other remaining sizable Personal Financial Services business in the USA is the Card business, the majority of which is prime and which is now within the bank. We have kept receivables relatively flat and have tightened credit quality quite significantly in the past two years. And whilst there will most likely be losses in the short term as unemployment rises, we do believe that these 36 million active customers do have a significant long-term role to play within our global card base of over 100 million cards.</p>
          <p>As you know, we tell it as it is, and today will be no exception. Therefore, I say that with the benefit of hindsight, the Group wishes that it hadn't made this investment. And that is recognized by the write-off in full of the goodwill arising on this deal. But we are where we are, and we believe that the majority of our shareholders wish us to collect these assets, which are now non-core and then move on.</p>
          <p>To add some perspective to the obvious debate on this investment, from the timely acquisition in 2003 to the end of last year, HSBC finance has been profitable, if only modestly. And the Card business, which we are continuing with, contributed close to $10 billion. In cash terms, taking into accounts dividend paid to the Group and capital injected into HSBC finance, the net position to-date has been an injection of approximately $500 million.</p>
          <p>As the revenues fall from a lower base of assets and impairments remain alleviated, the next two years will be challenging, and further capital will need to be injected. But we are committed to supporting HSBC finance, to allow it to run-off its exit portfolios in a measured way, and meet all its commitments. And we project we can do this from the current Group's financial resources.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Joining Up the company. We continue to make progress in this important initiative. We are now offering our customers a consistently high quality service all over the world by the connectivity of our global systems and services under the One HSBC banner.</p>
          <p>Everybody now knows that, we have an advantage that others do not. And hence, we have the right to win from scale and automation. And you can see that we are winning. We have accelerated implementation of common systems across the Group. And HSBC Premier, our service for international mobile clients, attracted nearly 0.5 million new customer, taking our total customer base to 2.6 million customers.</p>
          <p>Our global links referrals service for commercial clients doubled intra-Group introductions, and result in transactions with an aggregate value of $11 billion. We continued to migrate work to global services centers, which are becoming centers of excellence. We purposely launched Joining Up the Company to better manage our costs and improve our earnings. And whist the reported cost efficiency ratio increased, it did so because of the one-off charge for goodwill. If we excluded this, our costs remain virtually flat and our cost efficiency ratio improved to 47.2%, which is already better than the minimum target of 48% that we set ourselves.</p>
          <p>We cannot provide real quality service from the world's number one brand in financial services, without having a motivated team. And we've really been focusing on this in the last two years. Even in these difficult market conditions, staff engagement within HSBC rose to a new high in 2008. And now exceeds both global and sector norms. At this point, I would like to thank all our 312,000 colleagues across the world in 86 countries, who have done and continue to do a tremendous job in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p>Before I hand back to Stephen let me leave you with some final thoughts. 2008 was an incredibly challenging year. However, we generated capital, while others destroyed it. Some senior management who've been through a crisis or two in their lives focused on protecting the business across the world, while supporting our clients. And in our core businesses, the growth and the quality of the business stands out.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength and stable funding base has allowed us to write new business when others couldn't. We saw a flight to quality with customers choosing to place their deposits with us improving our already strong advance deposit ratio to 84%.</p>
          <p>Our resilient global performance reflects the merits of our diversified nature of our business by geography and by customer group. Our plans to restructure the USA are in place. It will obviously be a challenge in itself, but it's something that we have already proved we can do.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me state the obvious. 2009 will be another challenging year, but we have the spread of core businesses to benefit from it. And I am pleased to report that our business performance in January 2009 has been as strong and ahead of our expectations.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Now back to Stephen.</p>

          <p>Mike, thank you. I'd like now to turn to the Rights Issue proposals. I'm going to talk about the background to them and the reasons for them. Douglas will take you through the dividend and capital impact and then Stuart will talk you through the structure of the deal and its timetable.</p>
          <p>It's hardly necessary to remind you, I think, that the changes in the economic and financial environment over the last 18 months or so have been unprecedented turmoil and there are major uncertainties still ahead.</p>
          <p>The current global economic slowdown combined with extreme volatility in the financial markets, means that the financial system remains under stress. Over the past year, many competitors have increased their capital either through significant government capital injections or by raising capital from shareholders or other investors.</p>
          <p>Added to this, higher regulatory capital requirements and changing market sentiment have raised expectations concerning capital levels. While, HSBC has always maintained strong capital ratios, we are now raising the top of our target range for the Tier 1 ratio, so that it will going forward be from 7.5% to 10%. We're determined in other words that HSBC should maintain its signature financial strength.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to manage capital allocation within HSBC to concentrate on our core emerging markets and other fast growing businesses. We're managing our business with the intent of limiting capital consumption by non-core or volatile businesses. We remain confident that HSBC is well placed in today's environment and that our strength leads to opportunity.</p>
          <p>Our strategy has served us well. We continue to combine our position as the world's leading emerging markets bank with an extensive international network across both developed and faster growing markets.</p>
          <p>At the same time, as the financial system exhibits stress, our competitive position is improving as capacity and capabilities are reduced of financial institution constrained by lack of capital and funding, many of whom are focusing more on their domestic markets going forward.</p>
          <p>Our planned internal capital generation remains strong. This capital raising will enhance our ability to deal with the impact of an uncertain economic environment and to respond to unforeseen events.</p>
          <p>Importantly, it also gives us options with regard to opportunities, which will undoubtedly present themselves to those with superior financial strengthen in the next couple of years or so. These may involve organic investments in the continued taking of market share from more capital constraint competitors. There may also be opportunities to grow through targeted acquisitions by taking advantage of attractive valuations where the opportunities align with HSBC's strategy and where we understand the risks clearly.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Douglas to take you through the dividends and capital proposals. Douglas?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Stephen, thank you. For 2008, the Directors have declared a fourth interim dividend of $0.10 per ordinary share in lieu of a final dividend. Together with the first three interim dividends for 2008 of $0.18 already paid, this makes a total distribution for the year of $0.64. The payments in total represent a decrease of 29% in U.S. dollar terms and 15% in Sterling terms. The total dividend paid in respect of 2008 will be US $7.7 billion or &#xA3;4.6 billion.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we are rebasing the envisaged dividend per share for the first three dividends to reflect the impact of the enlarged ordinary share capital resulting from the Rights Issue, prevailing business conditions and capital requirements. Until the end of 2007 HSBC has grown its dividend per share by 10% or more every year for over 15 years, reflecting strong growth and shareholder returns, which we've delivered.</p>
          <p>For 2009 we've carefully considered our dividend payments in view of our desire to retain an absolute and relative position of capital strength. We intend to continue paying quarterly interim dividends. So with a pattern of three equal interim dividends, with a variable fourth interim dividend and it is envisaged the first three interim dividends for 2009 will be $0.08 per ordinary share.</p>
          <p>The dividend payments envisaged remain substantial and reflect management's long-term confidence in the business. And we will continue to aim to pay progressive dividends in line with the long-term growth of the business.</p>
          <p>HSBC has long maintained strong capital ratios, but we're now raising the top of our target range for Tier 1 capital to 10% as Stephen has already said. As a result of the Rights Issue, HSBC's pro forma Tier 1 capital would have been 9.8% and core equity Tier 1 ratio would have increased also by 150 basis points to 8.5%, again on a pro forma basis at December 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand you over to Stuart who'll talk you through transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Douglas. The Rights Issue aims to raise approximately &#xA3;12.5 billion or US$17.7 billion and it is already fully underwritten. And it is a classic Rights, meaning it will be made on a fully preemptive basis to existing shareholders at a discounted price.</p>
          <p>So we're proposing to offer five new ordinary shares to every 12 existing ordinary shares to qualifying shareholders. This will result in the issue of just over 5 billion new ordinary shares at &#xA3;2.54, a discount of 47.5% to the closing price on Friday and 39% to the theoretical ex-Rights price.</p>
          <p>Issue price for Hong Kong shareholders is HKD28 per new ordinary share, a discount of 50.2% to a closing price in the Hong Kong register on the 27th  of February. The Rights Issue is conditional upon among other things, shareholders' approval of an increase in HSBC's authorized share capital to create sufficient ordinary shares for the Rights Issue and the shareholders granting authority to the Directors to allot and issue the new ordinary shares at the General Meeting to be held on Thursday, the 19th  of March.</p>
          <p>This slide sets out the timetable of the transaction. We'll be sending the circular to shareholders tomorrow. The General Meeting will be held on the 19th  of March at the Excel Centre here in London, and if successful the new shares will start trading on the 6th of April in London and on the 9th  of April in Hong Kong. The results of the Rights Issue will then be announced by the 8th  of April. Steven?</p>

          <p>Stuart, thank you. And thank you for your patience for the longer than usual presentation. Few brief words to conclude, 2008 a resilient performance in a very difficult environment. It shows the success of a diverse business model and our trademark financial strength. We've taken decisive action to restructure our U.S. business in a deteriorating environment.</p>
          <p>The 2009 outlook is a difficult one in our view, but we're maintaining our financial strength, our signature financial strength through strong internal capital generation and through the proposed Rights Issue.</p>
          <p>It's the long-term confidence that we have in the Group's proposition, which gives us the confidence to aim for and to pursue a progressive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. We're very happy to take your questions now. What I'd like to do is to ask you to raise a hand for questions and we'll get a microphone to you. In Hong Kong, Vincent you -- I'll ask you to invite the next question and I'll do the same in London.</p>

To try and avoid any confusion between the two locations. I'll indicate who's going to answer the question and to -- and any follow-ups.</p>

          <p>Cameron Rogers from CICC. Yeah, you mentioned about the stress test on your ABS that if losses were a third to a half or worse depending on vintage. Can you give us an idea of what the basic inputs to those -- your expected loss are in terms of when do you expect the U.S. economy to start to recover? How long do you expect the recession in UK to last? And what would you expect peak unemployment rates to be in those two geographies under your expected loss scenario?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly -- clearly the economies of the U.S. and the UK are certainly weakening. We see unemployment rising in the U.S. and there are various figures been given about by economists; our own in-house view is things are deteriorating. In the UK, certainly for HSBC, we are not seeing that coming through into our impairment lines of the current time and that goes back to what I think I said in my presentation is that we saw things in the U.S. in late 2006 and took steps here in the UK to cut back our unsecured lending and be more conservative on our secured lending and that's clearly helped us. But the economy is slowing, unemployment is rising and will rise further and your guess is good as mine as where this is going to end. I would say is it's the speed where we're all seeing growth both in the U.S. and the UK dropping is -- which is quite concerning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's incredibly granular, it has to be on the basis of a bond-by-bond, taking into account where we sit in the capital structure, and more importantly where we originally sat in the capital structure, which was to the very, very vast majority almost exclusively at the AAA level. It then looks at levels of default &#x2013; loss given default prepayment speeds, all of which derive from triangulated with external fixed income research, the assumptions that are published by the major rating agencies, in terms of how they do stressing or how they do their loss given default, their loss severity tests on individual securitization tranches by vintage.</p>
          <p>We look at the extent to which we've got insurance cover. We look at the excess spread within each of the bonds that we hold. We look at cash prioritization in terms of the waterfall of cash flow on each and every bond basis and then we take all of that into our loss severity intensive stress it  by 30, 40, 50% and that gave us the number of 2 to $2.5 billion on that stress basis taking current market expectations or triangulated expectations of loss severity. And that gave that number which would ultimately flow to an actual loss i.e. the 2 to 2.5 billion would be the reversal from the AFS or what's in it at the moment in relation to those bonds. And we expect about a third of that would actually be cash loss from that stress test. That's what we do.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Alastair at UBS, just one point, so one question and one single thing. When you say you expect to be internally capital generative according to your plan this year, one assumes that's driven by earnings rather than reducing risk assets because it ought to be relatively difficult to cut your risk assets if you're lending in this pro cyclicality, is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So the question is slide 69, as I'm sure you've anticipated you will get this, the rates of deterioration in the consumer lending book in the third and fourth quarters. We obviously had Q3 before Q4 was fairly spectacular and now you say you gave everybody a month off foreclosures in December. So there's an element of that in there, but what's driving that? And is part of your conclusion to put that business into run-off just things have moved so far ahead you really don't feel confident in underwriting it at all, even what limited amount there is to be dealt with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alastair, essentially the answer is, yes. I'll let my colleagues elaborate, but the world has changed a great deal. It is worth noting that even as late as the beginning of last year, 2008, forecasts for '09 for the U.S. were showing over 2% GNP growth. The condition of the U.S. economy has radically deteriorated and rather rapidly in the last few months of last year. It has led us to the conclusion that this business model is no longer viable. Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main product is the debt consolidation product in the U.S. It's  secured by equity in your home. The reality is in the last few months, we're probably doing a tenth of that business that we'd normally do and that's because people haven't got equity in their homes and our scoring of that risk has made them ineligible for finance so we stopped doing it. And obviously there is a deterioration, we try to keep as many people in their homes as possible, we modified 100,000 loans but at the end of day, there is not a product out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be specific and is the deterioration driven by economic conditions or if you'd run these economic conditions through you scorecards, would you got this number? Or have you come to a conclusion that the underwriting just doesn't work so you may as well pack it in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's two things in it, one is the cost of running those loans i.e. the network cost wasn't giving a return and, two, the stress testing of the assets, although actually the asset stress test was better for these newer products, there wasn't enough volume there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, just adding a little bit, I think it was the rapid raise in unemployment in the fourth quarter that led to higher expectation of loss. And if you look at the build up of reserves -- the build up of reserves in consumer lending is well above charge-offs in the third and fourth quarter which is -- was a reaction to the rising unemployment. In fact, the finance companies -- it's very correlated to the unemployment. The question is do we get to a level of unemployment where that relationship breaks down. I don't know. But it was largely employment driven in the fourth quarter jumping unemployment led to a larger expectation of loss than was a contributing factor.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. And the first may be for Douglas, end of Q3 I think the Tier 1 ratio was 8.9. I was wondering could you help us sort of just reconcile the move from the end of Q3 to the full year position in terms of the broad drivers of what -- I think it came down 60 basis points in the final quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want table the other question so that whoever it is can thinking about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, the second one was to push you a bit more on your dividend guidance because if I just take the -- if I take the $0.08 per share for the first three quarters and assume the same sort of relationship in the fourth quarter as you saw in 2007, you're looking at another fairly hefty dividend cut '09 on '08. But I guess if you'd wanted to you could have paid a zero dividend in Q4 '08 and bought the base down that way. So I am just trying to understand what we really should be expecting in terms of full year '09. So that's the second question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Two major factors, fourth quarter we didn't generate capital is one part. And the second point because -- and the second point is that there is a foreign exchange element in it, where there is some sensitivity in the Tier 1 ratio to the dollar against euro and sterling. And the significant strengthening of dollar, we have a slight mismatch between dollar risk weighted assets and sterling that was a few tens of basis points. And the rest was simply performance in the fourth quarter where we were hit with Madoff write-downs in Global Banking and Markets and higher credit reserves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Jon Kirk of Redburn Partners. I have got a question on the cram-down legislation that may or may not occur in the U.S. And particularly, how vulnerable your books i.e. across the ABS portfolios but also within the mortgage lending within Household might be to that? Whether that was included in your stress testing and also the extent to which that could bring the AFS losses of $21 billion or so, which you're currently taking out of capital -- could bring them back into capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't seen any decent proposals in the cram-down. I mean you could take two views in cram-down. You can certainly paint a bad picture in terms of the courts force lenders to take losses on lending that they would otherwise think they would be able to recover in part. Of course, if it's successful in rebooting the securitization market net-net it might be positive for us. But it's very difficult to comment on legislation for which there is no details. And clearly in the securitization market, giving effect to the proposals is one of the reasons, I think very clearly why the legislation hasn't been formulated yet, because it's incredibly difficult to do. As I've said, our stress test took market expectations are -- if you like fixed income research and rating agency expectations of loss severity from the factors that they can see and then stressed and whether that stress includes -- I mean it was -- it was just take -- it was done a number of ways, but it ended up with a 30, 40, 50% severity increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just -- sorry to dwell on it, but is there any way that you -- as I understand it there are certain mortgages and certain securitization structures that have specific protection against cram-down, and there are some that don't. Are you able to quantify what portion of your books are and aren't protected?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Roy Ramos with Goldman Sachs. Two questions if I may. First, on Household. If you could give us a little more color or detail in terms of how you will run it down in terms of modalities, timeframe, accounting implications? Are you going to show this as discontinued operations? And also maybe are you also talking about ring fencing? I'm sure you're not going to comment on this, but also if you have any color on that ultimate loss as you wind it down?</p>
          <p>The second question I have is on the group tax Household. Mike, I think you were going to -- or Stephen you mentioned about the opportunities, you got the liquidity, you got the capital raise, and you've got the foreign banks, competitors -- global banks pulling back. But at same time, assuming my numbers are correct, your credit cost now ex-Household is actually quite a bit higher really than the peak in 1998 during the Asian banking crisis. So my question is, should we expect continued net shrinkage in your loan books? Or would you explicitly be looking to de-risk versus where do you see the opportunity to take market share, take advantage of other foreign banks and peer competitors pulling back? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roy, thank you for that. On the first question, I'm going to get Mike to talk about how we'll run it down. Just let me quickly say from a Group perspective, we are not ring fencing these assets in the sense of not supporting the funding. You've heard us on this before. These are bonds which carry the Group's trust. We've -- you might -- you heard Mike say it earlier, we are clearly committed to supporting it. So we are not in that sense ring fencing it. We are, however, running it down. We are closing it to new business. And Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean basically if you look at the Mortgage Services portfolio, which started off at around 49 billion, you -- what happens is when you close it down for new business, there is some increase in impairments. And then the business matures and basically people pay for their homes and stay in them. And we expect that to happen the same as Mortgage Services and -- sorry -- in Consumer Lending -- and clearly the vast majority of customers are and will continue to pay their mortgages. And it does come down, people do change their style of living, they move, they die, they get divorced, they marry, all the different things that go on in life. And that does have that impact. How many years it will take? A lot depends on what happens in the securitization market. I mean the reality is all of us have being through these downturns before. They will come back. There will then be a surge in property. And so it will be payoffs, sell-offs, all the different things that you expect in any portfolio. But it will be over a period of years.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you. And on the second question on opportunities and what we see in the emerging markets. Well, I mean there are some emerging markets that are clearly facing difficulty. The East Europeans, a number of East European countries, they are not actually countries where we are very exposed. We look at our business in Latin America and Consumer Finance business in Mexico. We've seen that take a strain as the book grew very fast. We've restrained that somewhat. But overall, we're very comfortable with our business in Latin America.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East, clearly there are some areas of activity where credit impairment is on the rise and we have to watch that but again, overall, the business is of good quality. In Asia more generally, the countries where we've got a good base in, I think are in a good position to continue to show some growth, albeit at a lower level than '08 -- '07-'08. But nonetheless, we -- our forecast for China, for example, is of a growth rate of 7 to 8%, we still think that that's good business. And we want to be able to make sure that we can grow our risk weighted assets, where there is good business to be done. And that is one of the key reasons for the capital raising. It will enable us not to be constrained about growing our business, where we want to do so.</p>
          <p>I talked both about organic and inorganic, I don't want to major a great deal on the inorganic. But we want to be in a position where, for example, there may be some foreign banks looking to dispose of what part of their non-core assets as they begin to shrink back into their domestic markets. We are to be able to interested in those propositions where they make sense and where there's a good value. And in order to do that, we want to be extremely well-positioned in capital terms. So it's an overall position of very strong capital strength -- strong capital position. Clearly, there are some countries where you don't want to push the boat out at the moment. I think some of the Eastern European countries are good examples of that. And there are some lines of business where you need to be careful, credit cards and credit -- direct personal lending is a good example of that. But overall, I think there are lots of opportunities we can pursue in the emerging markets, given that they as a group will show relatively sound growth compared with the mature  markets.</p>
          <p>Yeah, please, over there.</p>

          <p>Robert Law, Nomura. I'd like to ask some questions on the exit cost implications of HSBC finance, please? So as it's one area, could I have a number of questions on it?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean first of all, you comment in your presentation that you'd be able to meet the capital requirements for that out of your existing resources. Could I ask you to clarify what that means, please? Will you be within your range? Or is your planning assumption on the exit costs that you'll be within your capital range, say two or three years out from here, without a further capital strengthening?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I haven't got to where the mark-to-market on the loan book is. I think you have given that before. Can you tell us what it is, and how we might think about that versus the credit loss expectations that we might build in for the exit? And then what I'm thinking about here is the fact that you are now closing that to new business might well affect the credit characteristics of the book, because you've got customers who effectively need finance to keep servicing their debt. And once that's shut-off, it might well have an impact on them. Could you comment on that? And how we might think about credit losses at HSBC Finance going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, thank you. I'm going to get Douglas to comment primarily but on that very last point. I think there is a reason to expect that impairment will be higher when there's a closed book than when there's an ongoing book. We factored in some assumptions on that. And of course you get the trade-off of the fact that you save on the cost of the operating network, which is some 700 million. Douglas, do you want to comment on the other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the fair value of the U.S. consumer finance assets is a minus mid-40s billion. What that number means, we could debate for a very long time. I think it's fair as Stephen says that there &#x2013; and indeed was factored into our thinking -- that there will be some impact in relation to collectibility and unsecured credit, potentially in relation to no longer underwriting. But at the same time, the fair value so-called represents what you can sell these loans for in a marketplace that doesn't exist. So our assessment is that it's a hypothetical figure, because our intention is to run them off to maturity, or prepayment, or sale. And that will be a considerably higher value then the price we could sell them for today. That fair value is that exit price, and I don't think it's a particularly meaningful one, because we have the ability to fund the book to any of the exit days and will do so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Mortgage Services book, as I said before, came down from 49 to 28. And clearly we were surprised how many people continued to pay us, even though we weren't going to be brokers to them. I think you get down to the realization, I'm in my home, I need to pay for it and I'm going to pay whoever holds the mortgage, and that's what we're doing with our customers at this time. Clearly, we have as Douglas said, put a projection in for an increase in delinquencies if there are not people around to cut the actual outlets themselves and are open. We are not actually certainty going to close every single outlet. We are going to test this, and see whether we need people out in those communities collecting as well. It's a work in progress.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's John Wadle from UBS. I just wanted to follow-up on the capital. You're raising 17.7 billion and on two -- page 279 of your release and your report, you show that there is a deduction from your Tier 1 capital of about 14 billion, which changed from a surplus of 8 billion last year under Basel I, which reflects exchange differences, and it must be the available for sale losses. So it's a difference of 22 billion. What can you do if anything to try to unwind the deduction of 22 billion from that Tier 1 capital?</p>
          <p>And the second question is your risk weighted assets were flat last year, which looks like a big achievement given that you were growing in some of the businesses. Do you anticipate that local regulators will require more capital in some of your subsidiaries, or that regulators will require the calculation of risk-weighted assets to increase going forward, given that Basel II has proven to be -- too much leverage was kind of artificially built into kind of Basel II requirements? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, thank you. Douglas on the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A big piece of the number you referred to is exchange, and you'll see in the movement in risk-weighted assets that foreign exchange translation impacts are  assessed to have reduced risk-weighted assets by around $80 billion. So, while the capital has been reduced on a translation impact for our sterling and euro net assets, the risk-weighted assets have also come down. And as I said, the risk-weighted assets came down proportionately less than the capital did because there are some mismatch, which is why there was an impact on the ratio. So, broadly speaking, they move in sync, so to the extent that it's translation, it's on both sides of the calculation, and I wouldn't worry too much about it. The second part of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was about the regulatory treatment of capital subsidiaries in relation to risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What a great question. I mean there's a lot of focus on this now and the regulators brought us to, on the one side, clearly too much -- too little capital was allocated to some of the trading operations and there are moves afoot  to change that, to increase the amount of allocated to trading. There is also a growing recognition that in relation to some of the balance sheet allocations particularly those that are based on structure product securitization and are influenced by ratings. And it's one of the reasons why assets held subject to where the calc was  measured against a ratings grid are even more illiquid -- is that the change in rating methodology is leading to enormous volatility and expected downgrade in ratings are leading to capital allocations that are well beyond economic risk.</p>
          <p>So, I think on the one hand you are definitely going to see I think more capital coming through on the trading book. I think there is now some regulatory recognition that there are aspects of the framework in relation to balance sheet risk that need to be looked at, but whether those can be addressed in a relatively short period of time, we don't know. But there is I think a meeting of minds now -- something that deserves a bit more attention. Otherwise, it constrains use of capital for the purposes that the stimulus programs are designed to address.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question from here. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions if that's okay. Firstly, if I look at slide nine, which is the profits -- the significant items that impacted your profits. On my numbers, I think you made about five billion before significant items in the second half of the year compared to about 13.9 billion in the first half. Within that, it looks like UK and Hong Kong have stepped down a hell of a lot. Hong Kong, we know about. UK, just looking, it looks like profits have down across the board in all of the divisions quite sharply. So I was wondering if you could give comment on that. But also, clearly given as you've said the deterioration in the macro was much more Q4 loaded, whether you could give us an idea about the profit split of that in the second half 3Q versus Q4? And if you could just give us some idea of how we've started in the first quarter 2009? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And second question, I think, Mike, you talked about the resilience of the results and the generating capital. I think one of the big reasons why you stand out relative to peers is the accounting that you're required to follow in regard to the fair value in your AFS reserve. So you would have had a $23 billion hit to the P&amp;L, if those AFS unrealized losses had gone through the P&amp;L like a lot of your peers have had. So that's more of a statement. So I guess what I'm trying to get to grips with is how comfortable you are carrying that $21 billion of unrealized losses in the balance sheet? I guess one way you'd answer that is by looking at the stress test that you've come through. But I just want to understand if you -- well, if there's really only 500 million to -- sorry -- 600 to 800 million of losses throughout that portfolio, given your liquidity, why aren't you in the bond market buying a lot of these assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, thank you. On the first set of questions, on performance in the second half, I mean clearly the second half was weaker than the first half, in common with the entire industry. And indeed, and I'll get Douglas to elaborate on this, the fourth quarter was weaker than the third quarter. I mean the fourth quarter has been a very difficult quarter for the industry. On the start of this year as I think it was Douglas who mentioned, we started off with January being actually quite a strong month, better than our expectations. Again, actually consistent with signals one's getting from the industry generally. I guess that's -- just saying all of that is a testament to how volatile the banking market -- the financial markets have been over the last few months, really since September, October of last year. Douglas, do you want to add anything to that in terms of second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. AFS as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you raise a really good question. But I guess that there's &#x2013; there's two or three ways of responding to it. You're absolutely right, if the assets were mark-to-market, you'd come to a different answer, if that went through the P&amp;L account. On the other hand, if there were  held as loans and advances, you'd virtually take no impairment at all. And you wouldn't mark them to market through equity either. You would note that there was a fair value amount, which was entirely driven by liquidity. And these are audited numbers, the calc -- the calculation is subject to audit too. The other thing you could say is if they were held in trading books and you thought that the losses were only 2 or 3% of nominal and you're marks were giving you 30 or 40%. I submit that many people would put that into a model basis and call it level three, because clearly the market would be -- I don't how much is in other people's unobservable models revaluations. All I know is that we've got only 2% of our trading assets on level three and most of that's in leveraged loans and the like. It's not stuff where we can get it priced, so we're being very transparent. Are we comfortable? We're clearly not comfortable with a deficit of 21 billion, but we understand it and we've now set our own assessment of the stresses within it. And they're meaningful, but manageable and certainly on an expected loss basis over a three or four year period, a 600 to $800 million number is very manageable. So you can paint all sorts of pictures. We account the way we account which is very transparent. It goes into the captive calculation and the way it goes into the captive calculation and we monitor in terms of the risk to there being a column capital requirement in the way that I've described and we've set out our sensitivity.</p>
          <p>The second half in Europe is actually still reasonably resilient. In PFS, they were only slightly down in Europe. Second half is always a bit weaker because you've got July, August and December, and you're beginning to see the impact of lower deposit spreads and falling interest rates, that also hit Commercial Banking, and the transactional banking businesses within Global Banking and Markets  and we began to see an increase albeit not very much in dollar terms but it percentage terms higher of loan impairments coming through Commercial Banking and to some extent Global Banking and Markets. The second &#x2013; the second half had an element of write-downs because of the widening of credit spreads in the fourth quarter and we had the Madoff loss in the fourth quarter. And those are the major elements that would contrast first half, second half and I'm looking on an underlying basis, clearly there's a currency impact between first and second half in Europe which is quite marked.</p>

          <p>Hi this is Sunil Garg from JPMorgan. I have just one question, you mentioned you're benefiting from a flight to quality and also deposit spreads are coming down.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The balance sheet management area has been positioned for lower interest rates, so to some extent in 2009 we'll continue to see a strong revenue line in the PSM line which we also saw in 2008, however as you know that book's quite short-term, so if low interest rates persist for 2010 most of those positions will then run-off. At that point in time a low flat yield curve will be very difficult for balance sheet management to make money out of and it will also be very difficult for the PFS business to make money out of a very low and flat yield curve. So for '09 PSM actually should with the positions we have already taken in anticipation of rates going down continue to produce  good revenue but the PFS business already in '09 will suffer some challenges in terms of spread compression with very low rates particularly in Hong Kong. Maybe Sandy might want to add.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Margins on lending in terms of our business in Commercial Banking and also retail lending have increased over this period. But undoubtedly as LIBOR rates have reduced to the levels they are today, the profitability of deposits for the Commercial Banking and the Personal Banking businesses are diminished quite greatly. At the moment we're well positioned for that as Stuart says but a long period will undoubtedly mean that profitability of deposits over that period will be far less, but we have the ability to reprice up on loans.</p>

          <p>Thank you it's Ian Smillie from RBS. Two questions please. Firstly, if I read correctly there's $5 billion of deferred tax assets belong to the U.S., could you color in for us how that  squares with the losses that you're anticipating to come through there in future years from HSBC Finance and perhaps quantify how much new capital injection that supposes that you put into the U.S. please? And the second question is one the reinvestment of the surplus deposits. Could you give us some sense as to how we should think about the revenue generation coming from those deposits? Is there an appetite or an aspiration to perhaps start to move along the yield curve again to pick up some of those high yields, which are available in secondary market assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Douglas first on the deferred tax assets and then Stuart I think on the investment of surplus deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is extraordinary full description of the deferred tax assets and its recoverability in the U.S. filings, which I won't go through in painstaking detail but it's there. Essentially a good &#x2013; the smaller portion of it comes back from carrying back losses from 2009, two years that are open if and &#x2013; if there is legislation change which was proposed and then put away as to further carrybacks that would help that situation. The portion that's not going to be carried back from 2009 is going to be recovered through future profitability from &#x2013; predominantly from the bank not from the finance company. We have a tax group in the United States.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the balance sheet management number, Ian, the BSM activity is meant to keep itself clean as far as possible of credit risk although that's not been the case with Icelandic banks failing and WAMU being crammed down but it tends to take exposure to government and to the interbank market. What you've just described of going out on the yield curve into the secondary market actually means taking credit risk. You're talking about basically buying the secondary assets that have fallen and that's not what the balance sheet management book's about. That's about the liquidity of the group, that's about that powerful AD ratio and being incredibly liquid and never having funding problems. So that isn't the activity in which you would see that, you would probably see it coming through in a mark-to-market basis from some of the trading desks that may indeed choose to invest in assets that we believe are mispriced. But they would be held in mark-to-market and not come through the PSM line but come through probably either rates or credit line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A substantial proportion of the Alt-A market, including the bonds we hold in that category, were subject to downgrade. But there is not a correlation between credit and in debit. We set this out in the accounts as well. There is not a direct correlation between ratings downgrade and expected loss. It depends where we are in the capital structure. So it could well be that a tranche dips into a lower rating or if the rating methodology changes, but our portion of that tranche at the higher levels is still unimpaired because of the prioritization of cash flows that we have. So while it would be a factor that would cause us look with considerable more attention at those assets, i.e. the downgrade, it wouldn't necessarily correlate directly to the recognition of impairment, but it would mean that we'd look much more carefully at the cash flows that were coming from that assets.</p>

          <p>Bill Stacy from AVH]. My simple question is how would you prioritize the acquisition opportunities that might emerge over the next two years and to elaborate a little bit on that. You've said in the past that insurance was an area you wanted to be much a bigger proportion of your business. Is that something that you would still prioritize in the same way? And given that and the look that you might have had at AIG assets, how would that fit with your strategy? And I suppose relating to that given that insurance as well as Household were diversifications probably from your core strategy and strengths, would you have changed your thinking about diversification in terms of acquisition and priorities?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bill, thank you. To be very clear any acquisition that we do has got to fit within the strategy that we've articulated over the last couple or three years. So that is emerging markets or emerging markets related, fast growing markets, so it's not necessarily geographically in them but related to that positioning. We have nothing on the drawing board at the moment, if we had something to talk about we would. But we do see potential opportunities over the next couple of years, as I said before organically as well as inorganically and that you probably -- I'm sure you would appreciate in so many cases, you're better off investing organically rather than inorganically. But nonetheless we see opportunities that may arise. I would say they will  be primarily in banking business. And we have committed ourselves to a target -- for a role for insurance and indeed you'll see that we made good progress in building our insurance business. I think that should be a proposition that depends very much on the fact that we have the client base, such as bank assurance model. I can't tell you whether we would be likely to invest in insurance, certainly wouldn't want to rule that out, you never know. But I would say that the priority, and I think broadly speaking you should expect us to be focusing to a large extent on core banking business. And in terms of geography, well, I think it's self-evident from what I'm saying where you might expect us to do activity. And indeed if you look at what we did in '08, the bank in Taiwan, the bank in Indonesia, the increase of our position in Vietnam, the retail broker in India, these are all propositions that I think are straight down the line of our articulated strategy.</p>
          <p>We've probably got time for one more question each from London and Hong Kong. Let me go to Hong Kong first and then ask. Vincent?</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Merrill. I was wondering if you could perhaps share with us your views on the potential contagion from Central and Eastern Europe on your operations, particularly in Europe and potential knock-on for other EM businesses. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as we're concerned, our exposure to East Europe is pretty small. And of course, as you will be aware, different European countries are in different positions. The ones that are particularly distressed at the moment we have little or no exposure in. Second order effect, if some other bank got itself into distress that's something clear -- we monitor our bank exposures very carefully. And we continue to do so. And we focus on making sure we understand where banks have got themselves particularly exposed to areas that we think are going to come into stress. East Europe would be one. But we -- in terms of direct impact on us it's pretty modest.</p>

          <p>Stephen, John Paul <mark type="inaudible" /> from UBS. Just a broader strategic question, particularly about the U.S. market, because I mean, you are the world's local bank -- as you lay  claim to be. Clearly, the strategy there hasn't worked and you've pretty much <mark type="inaudible" /> to be left with essentially the retail bank and the credit card operation. And clearly, the U.S. landscape has been completely reshaped over the course of the last six months or so. So, I'm just wondering, is that it now for HSBC in the U.S? Is it in the too hard to deal with camp and retrench back to now licking the wounds back the areas of your traditional strength? Or is it still something that -- is a market, or is sensible for you to be in some size and scale longer term? And how do you think that process through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John,I think it's a very well taken question. I want to be very clear about it. We're not turning our backs on the U.S. What we do want to make sure we've got and I think, you can say, we've never really had it in the past but I think there is a good opportunity, is to ensure that we have a business in the U.S. that makes a reasonable contribution to overall Group profits &#x2013; I don't want to put a percentage on that. And it's properly connected with what the Group proposition is. That means focusing on the kinds of customer base that have a clear international connectivity, particularly to areas where we are strong. Just -- Corporates is obvious,  business banking. We should be focusing on business banking customers who have a clear -- let's say an interest in China one way or other, for example. And in the Personal sector, we should be looking at those sectors of the Personal market that have connectivity; Hispanics is an obvious example in our case given our preeminence in Mexico, Central America, South America. So if you look at A; where we are at now; B, where I think it would be reasonable to evolve our business, it's clear from what I've said. We've got some work in progress -- work in hand to do this. But I think the prize is there, what &#x2013; it should also tell you thing we will not do. We will not go out and buy a kind of bank for Middle America because it's looking cheap.</p>
          <p>We need to be sure that the way we build up and we will do this organically or inorganically, but I think a strong emphasis on organic plus incremental rather than some big ticket thing. I don't think there is a kind of big ticket thing that gets in one leap from what where we are now to what I described. But that's the sort of growth path we are looking at for the U.S. But to be very clear, it is important to recognize that doing business in America has its own dynamic, its own cultural dynamic. I think sometimes Europeans including Brits and that have been -- have underestimated the difference between doing business in America and doing it in Europe. And Europeans have underestimated that to their cost. We need to be very alert to that. But, I do think there are opportunities there and no we are not turning back on -- turning our back on the U.S.</p>
          <p> Sandy? Douglas, was telling me you wanted to ask a question--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>This is the last one I'm afraid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Then I won't  ask the AFS question. I just wanted to see if you could -- sorry, Sandy Chen, Panmure Gordon. If you could talk -- talk us through the net derivatives movement, you mentioned that it moved from 66 billion to 112 billion. I mean how did that kind of short in the P&amp;L in terms of gains and or losses that might have been mitigated by the monoline wraps et cetera. And how sustainable would they be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean, let me take in two parts. The increase from 66 to 112 occurs in part for us, because we don't net as much as other institutions. And the reason we don't net as much, is actually because of two things. One is, a lot of our derivatives are in emerging markets were CSAs are not enforceable. So they are not enforceable, we don't put in CSAs and then pretend they might be -- some others might do that. The second thing is most of our derivatives are with corporate and commercial customers. So therefore when they hedge with us, they are not trading with us, meaning that they'll only have one side. Their trades will be directional. Therefore, if we have very big moves in foreign exchange markets, rates market and credit spread that will create enormous bar. If my counterparties were mostly hedge funds, they'd be on both sides. I have a netting agreement, I'd therefore be able to drop the number down. So actually, the underlying notional only went up -- nominal only moved by about 8%. So there is an amplify factor because of the nature and scope of our business. On the monoline question, we have separately and I can take you through this after -- dummy analysis in our monoline book that you did in RBS's. And we think the stress number's about 1.2 billion on equivalent analysis that you did on the RBS but -- and I'm happy to share that with you.</p>

          <p> Sandy, thank you. I think we probably ought to draw to a close at that point. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you here in London and Vincent to your guests in Hong Kong. Thank you for being with us. Thanks very much.</p>
