          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding. We now have your speakers in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the presentation, the floor will be opened for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Alexander. Mr. Alexander, you may begin, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our year-end Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Now, here's the agenda for the call. Mark will begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Tom will follow with his perspective on the results and then discuss our 2010 outlook. We'll finish as usual with Q&amp;A. For those following along on the website, we have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section, which is www.kimberly-clark.com.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated. Please refer to the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. I'd also like to point out that when discussing 2009 results, we will be comparing to adjusted results in 2008, which excluded charges for the strategic cost reduction plan we completed in 2008 and an extraordinary loss.</p>
          <p>Finally, we will also be referring to adjusted results when discussing our 2010 outlook, which excludes an anticipated loss for the remeasurement of the local currency balance sheet in Venezuela as a result of the recent currency devaluation and move to hyperinflationary accounting.</p>
          <p>Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. For additional information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, please see today's news release and additional information on our website.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul, and good morning. I hope you had a chance to review our news release with all the details of our results. I'm going to briefly review the quarter and I'd like to start with a few headlines.</p>
          <p>First, organic sales growth was nearly 3%, including continued double-digit growth for both our International business in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa and for our global Health Care business. Second, earnings per share increased 16%, driven by improved margins. And third, cash provided by operations was up 48% to $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's cover the details of the quarter starting with the top line. Overall sales increased more than 8% to $5 billion, including a five-point benefit from currency and one point of growth from acquisitions. Organic growth of nearly 3% was driven by higher net selling prices of about 2% and an approximate two-point improvement in sales volumes. Meanwhile, product mix lowered sales by 1%.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the top line for each of our segments and I'm going to focus most of my comments on organic sales, setting aside the impact of currency and acquisitions which you can see in our news release. By the way, when I refer to K-C International, I'm referring to our businesses in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, which we'd previously called our Developing and Emerging Markets business.</p>
          <p>In Personal Care, organic sales increased approximately 6%. Sales volumes are up 5% with improved performance in all regions. Net selling prices contributed an additional two points of growth while product mix was off 1%. In North America, organic sales were even with the prior year as higher volumes of 3% were offset by lower net selling prices due to increased promotional activity.</p>
          <p>HUGGIES diapers delivered 6% volume growth and improved market shares by one point compared to a soft year-ago performance. Elsewhere, Feminine Care volumes were up 11% and Adult Care volumes grew 10%, including benefits from innovation on DEPEND underwear.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Personal Care organic sales increased nearly 3%, sales volumes were up about 4% with improved performance in HUGGIES diapers in Poland and our core markets in Western Europe. Overall, product mix was off about a point.</p>
          <p>For K-C International, Personal Care organic sales rose about 15%, net selling prices increased 9% and sales volumes were up 7%. We delivered double-digit organic sales growth in a number of markets including Brazil, China, Russia and Latin America overall.</p>
          <p>Turning to Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 3%, as sales volumes fell 2% and net selling prices were down approximately one point. In North America, organic sales were down about 6%. Net selling prices fell 3%, reflecting an increase in competitive promotional activity, while sales volumes and product mix each lowered sales by more than one point. Kleenex facial tissue volumes were up 7%, however paper towel volumes were down double-digits and continue to be impacted by consumer trade-down.</p>
          <p>Switching to Europe. Consumer Tissue organic sales fell about 5%, driven by a four-point decline in net selling prices and slightly lower sales volumes. For K-C International, Consumer Tissue organic sales increased more than 2%. Our strategies to improve net realized revenue generated higher net selling prices of 6% and favorable product mix of 1%. Meanwhile, volumes were down about 4%.</p>
          <p>Moving to K-C Professional and Other, organic sales were up about 3%; higher net selling prices mostly in North America, North Asia and Latin America generated nearly seven points of growth. However, organic sales volumes were down about 3% and continue to reflect high unemployment levels and a economic environment, particularly in North America and Europe. Organic volumes in these geographies were off at a mid single digit rate.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Health Care organic sales were up 13%, all of which was driven principally by improvements in sales volumes. The I-Flow acquisition, which closed in late November, added another six points of growth in the quarter. Health Care organic volumes were up in several product categories including double-digit growth in exam gloves for the seventh consecutive quarter and strong results in our apparel business. In addition, approximately six points of volume growth in the quarter came from increased global demand for face masks, as a result of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
          <p>Now moving to operating profit, margin and cost savings. Gross margins improved nicely from 31.9% a year ago to 33.4% as we benefited from price realization, cost savings and lower input costs of about $145 million. That's the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year gross margin improvement. Fourth quarter operating profit rose 14%, with an operating margin of 14.4%. Results included increased pension expense of approximately $30 million, higher selling and administrative expenses and some net benefit in other income and expense. Meanwhile, we continue to invest behind our brands with strategic marketing up about $45 million in local currency terms in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to cost savings, we had another strong quarter with total savings of $52 million. That brings our full-year total cost savings to about 240 million, well ahead of our original target for the year of about $150 million. We also realized benefits from our organization optimization initiative as severance and related costs of $6 million were more than offset by savings of about 30 million.</p>
          <p>Now, looking briefly at fourth quarter segment operating margins. Margins improved year-on-year in Personal Care, KCP, and Health Care. Input cost declines benefited all three segments, while higher selling prices also boosted profitability in Personal Care and KCP. Consumer Tissue margins were below prior year as a result of investments in strategic marketing, competitive promotional activity in North America and some softness in K-C International.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to cash flow, we had another excellent performance this quarter. Cash provided by operations increased 48% to just over $1 billion driven by higher cash earnings and further reductions in working capital, partially offset by increased pension plan contributions. We improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by six days compared to the third quarter. That included benefits from payables and a two-day reduction in inventories.</p>
          <p>Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in the fourth quarter totaled $127 million, including $100 million contribution in the U.S. that was incremental to our previous plan. During the quarter, we decided to make an additional contribution as a result of our strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we generated all-time record cash from operations of approximately $3.5 billion. That's up 38%, or roughly $1 billion, compared to 2008's level. That's a terrific accomplishment by our global organization driven by significant working capital improvements.</p>
          <p>That wraps up the financial review. So to recap the quarter, we achieved organic sales growth of nearly 3%. We delivered double-digit bottom line growth fueled by healthy gross margin expansion and cash flow performance was outstanding. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Since you just heard from Mark about the fourth quarter, I'll give you my perspective on our results for the full year and then I'll review our outlook for 2010.</p>
          <p>In short, we delivered solid results in 2009 in a very challenging economic environment. And we've maintained our focus on doing what's right to generate sustainable long-term growth; and that's our plan for 2010 as well. So let me start and recap 2009.</p>
          <p>Our overall performance was strong. On the top line, organic sales were up about 3% and that was driven by higher net selling prices of approximately 4%. That's a pretty solid achievement particularly considering that we faced the worst economic environment any of us have seen in more than 70 years. On the bottom line, earnings of $4.52 per share were up 9% compared to adjusted results in 2008. That's at the high end of our long-term Global Business Plan target and we significantly exceeded our original 2009 plan for earnings of $4 to $4.20 per share.</p>
          <p>We made excellent progress on the four priorities that we established at the beginning of the year. Those priorities were to improve margins, pursue our targeted growth initiatives, strengthen our brands and maximize cash flow. On the margin front, we increased gross margin by 320 basis points and our operating margin by 140 basis points. Our focus on price realization and cost reduction was essential to delivering these improvements. And while our revenue realization strategies impacted our sales volumes in some cases, that was a short-term trade-off we were willing to make to get our profitability moving in the right direction. At the same time, we took additional steps forward with our targeted growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>Overall, our K-C International business grew organic sales by 11% with very strong performances in the high-potential markets of China, Russia and Latin America. We also invested more than $750 million on acquisitions that will further enable our growth initiatives, particularly in higher margin, higher growth opportunities in K-C Professional and Health Care.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to strengthen our brands with innovations such as HUGGIES Pure and Natural, gender-specific DEPEND products, Scott Naturals, LAVENDER Nitrile exam gloves and a number of K-C Professional safety products. And we supported our brands with a significant increase in strategic marketing, and that was up about $140 million in local currency terms.</p>
          <p>And finally in terms of cash flow, we had record-setting performance, as Mark mentioned. Our cash generation has allowed us to fund our growth initiatives and improve our balance sheet while providing additional flexibility as we move into 2010.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we executed our business plans very well and we made great progress against our key priorities for the year. I'm very proud of what Kimberly-Clark's worldwide team accomplished this past year. And our performance gives me confidence that we will continue to execute our Global Business Plan well in the coming year.</p>
          <p>So, now let's turn to our outlook for 2010. In terms of the environment, we're planning for a slow and modest economic recovery overall in 2010. So we expect our organic sales volumes to be up two to 3% in 2010 after being down about 1% in 2009. And our volume growth should be led by our K-C International business as we further expand our presence in these faster-growing geographies. Just as we did this past year, in 2010 we'll strengthen our brands and pursue targeted growth initiatives and reinvest back into our business for our future growth. So we have a healthy pipeline of innovation coming to market in 2010, and there are number of those launches that will start in the first half of the year. And we will support our brands and our growth initiatives around the world with strategic marketing spending that is planned to rise faster than sales. And we'll invest more to improve our research and customer development capabilities.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to focus on reducing our costs and generating strong cash flow. That should help us overcome the expected significant input cost inflation, which we currently estimate to be about 300 to $400 million, and enable our strong reinvestment plans. So all in all, we expect adjusted earnings per share in 2010 will be in the range of $4.80 to $5 per share. That's up six to 11% compared to 2009 earnings per share, and that's in line with or slightly above our long-range target.</p>
          <p>We'll also deploy our cash in shareholder friendly ways. We would expect a high single digit to low double-digit increase in our dividend and that will help us maintain our top-tier payout. Moreover, we're resuming our share repurchase plan and will be entering the market right away in the first quarter. More details about our 2010 planning assumptions are included in this morning's news release and our presentation slides.</p>
          <p>And finally, we've recently completed the review of our Global Business Plan and we've got further sharpening of our strategies and plans to facilitate the delivery of our existing top and bottom line growth objectives through 2015.</p>
          <p>Our annual growth targets remain three to 5% for net sales and mid to high single digits for earnings per share. We'll continue to pursue targeted growth initiatives and further develop the key capability that we need for sustaining our growth. At the same time, financial and cost discipline will be important parts of the plan. We'll share more details around our GBP 2015 at our upcoming Investor Day on March 22.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, we delivered excellent results in 2009 and we expect another solid year in 2010. We continue to invest for our long-term success. We're building a leaner, stronger and faster company and we're confident that we have the right strategies is to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value for many years to come. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'd be happy to begin to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ali.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to just understand a little bit more about the Consumer Tissue margins; it looks like a lot of that had been driven by marketing spend increases. And I'd love to understand a little bit of the ROI on that spend or does it kind of just not matter and you have to spend it anyway because of the competitive atmosphere that's out there and to defend your share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a couple of things going on in the quarter, Ali. There were some increases in trade funding, some of that is getting your price point and matching up with the competition so that you're competitive on promotion and that you've got the right velocity to earn those promotional slots. So that was part of it. We also stepped up our marketing investment behind Kleenex and so obviously we're in the heart of cold and flu season. We saw a 7% volume improvement on Kleenex in the quarter and, obviously, we'd expect to see that that continue as we go into the first half of the year. We've got some innovation coming on on Kleenex as well. So those were two factors.</p>
          <p>In the international markets, you probably also saw a bit more downtime in the quarter as they were a little later in the process of getting their inventory down to target level. So particularly in places like Australia where we've got some decent size tissue businesses, you saw a bit more downtime in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess just to drill down on one of those aspects that you mentioned, both in terms of promotion that hits COG but above the line as well. I still think you have a little bit of a conundrum here going forward in that commodities are increasing, you guys said it yourself, obviously, and you're budgeting for it, but you're not taking pricing. So I guess, in some sense you're seeing the two curves cross, you're not going to be able to offset it, that's one. But two is, if you don't take pricing up, you get hit by commodities. If you don't take pricing down, it feels like this kind of private label and it's sounds more like other competitors -- branded competitors as well. The increased intensity is going to hurt volumes. So, how do you think about that? And why isn't there more, I guess, maybe negative pricing going forward in terms of expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you look at 2010 for tissue, holding margins in Consumer Tissue would be a really good performance in the environment that they're going to be in. And so we're going to have to do some things around innovation to drive mix and some of the marketing spend will help on that front. And we've got a very aggressive cost-savings program for tissue around the world to be focused on that, but I think your point is right on. It's going to be a challenging environment for tissue in 2010. With commodity costs up, it's a difficult pricing environment. And we're going to have to be aggressive on cost and drive mix to be able to hold margin going into that environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're not seeing anything -- well, let me just ask it this way-- can you give us a little more color on the competition out there -- both branded and private label, in terms of pricing in particular or promotions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you go back to the last price increases that were taken in late 2008, those really haven't been fully implemented. In many cases, they've been partially spent back or in some categories even significantly spent back. And so I think, until you get those prices that are in effect and promotion prices starting to move up a bit, you probably are going to see a difficult time, at least in the U.S. market and in list price release.</p>
          <p>We may get some pricing in some other international markets where the dynamics are different, but I think in the U.S. market it will be a challenging price environment. You may see some desheeting that happens, where you've got some innovation that would drive that, so you'll get some price in that form, but I don't think you'll see list price to a great extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess it feels like there's some sort of &#x2013; and maybe this isn't correct but just feels like there's some sort of asymmetry in terms of -- people are giving back the pricing, particularly branded players and not getting back the volume that one would have anticipated. Is that a fair take given the economic situation out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say the categories have been a little soft in some cases. Facial tissue has been soft, it's a bit more discretionary. Paper towels would be the same, the category has generally shifted more to private label than some of the others. So, yeah, the bath tissue category dynamics have been pretty stable. But you've seen more of a mix shift to the lower price tier. So our Scott tissue business had a fantastic year. Our Cottonelle business was -- had more of a challenge. So I think you're seeing that trade-down in tissue probably more than in Personal Care.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for answering all my questions. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I am having some issues or confusion about guidance as well. You've got organic volume growing two to 3%. What do you think will happen with pricing overall, I understand may be down in the U.S., up offshore, and mix? Are those both neutral, maybe as a good starting point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We basically would say price and mix we're calling to be pretty flat versus 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, we've got raw material costs going up and we've got marketing going up. So what do you think will happen with operating margins in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'd say operating margins will be up probably 20 to 30 basis points in that framework where you'd see cost savings and the benefit of the volume growth should help our margin and offset the impact of the higher commodity costs and higher marketing costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And gross margins, do you think that they can be up as well because of cost cutting in volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'll probably see a bit more lift at gross margin because of the impact of the between-the-lines marketing spending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you mean by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in other words gross margins will have to be up higher than operating margin because we are going to be spending back more between the lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So gross margins up 50 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not an unreasonable assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I just had a question about the North American Personal Care, you cited the three parts of the division that were up more than the 3% volume overall. So what was down, Child Care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Child Care was pretty similar year-on-year, Alice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that was flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty similar, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess, I've one final question. Your two to 3% volume growth that you're foreseeing for 2010, how much do you think volume will be up offshore for International?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be up more than that. I mean, obviously we saw a good sequential improvement during the year. The back half of the year had better volume performance than the first half of the year. We've got aggressive plans to continue to grow in the international markets. But we'd also say particularly in Personal Care, we'd expect to see some growth in the U.S. behind some of the innovation that we have coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think volume can be up in Personal Care in the U.S. some?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And actually as a follow-up to that. I think you said organic growth for International in the fourth quarter was 11%. What was it for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was also up 11%, Alice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the year? And how much of that was pricing and how much volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the fourth quarter I think volume was 2% and price was the balance price and mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And that's pretty similar for the year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Similar for the year as well. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.</p>

          <p>Hi, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I just wanted to -- just to make sure I understand this and clarify -- you're saying you think pulp's going to average 850 to 875 or that's what's baked in, right, which means it's &#x2013; you're approaching 900 by the end of the year if not getting there. But you think with pulp getting up to 900, there will be no industry pricing in Consumer Tissue at all? Like private label could sustain that type of pulp prices and survive? I just want to get your color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we would love for that to happen, but I think just based on how tough it has been to get the last price increase established, we'd probably focus more on getting that established and dialing back some of the trade spending. What you typically see in tissue is that the way it plays out is you'll see some of the trade gets pulled out before a list price change. And we're not seeing that happen at this point in time. I mean, promoted price points are still pretty aggressive. And it's a challenging environment to get price. So that isn't to say that we won't try to get it in markets where we think we've absolutely got the opportunity. But, I just think realistically it's going to be a challenge in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, and I understand that now based on where pulp is today,  but if you're talking about pulp going up another 70, 80 bucks over the balance of the year, do you think that would change the dynamic at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It might. So, it could happen, but again, if it happened, the realization this year would probably not be significant because you protect promoted price points for a period of time. And so much of tissue goes on promotion, it's not that it doesn't matter what happens to list price, but you've got to get promoted price points to move up to really get significant realization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks. And I guess just on a different topic, on SG&amp;A. And, I'm just trying to understand, I guess for the quarter, right so SG&amp;A was up about 19% year-on-year right after it had been running flattish to slightly up over the first few quarters. I just want to understand what's driving that increase, and how are you thinking about that line going forward? You think like 19 and change as a percentage of sales is one of the bigger numbers we've seen. So I guess, what change and how are you thinking about it as you move into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. About half of the increase in the quarter was higher marketing spend. So, part of that was just the timing of how that played out this year. And then in the balance the I-Flow acquisition, which has got a very heavy sales component was about a third of the balance. And then the rest of it was a variety of things. You had compensation expense was higher, particularly in the fourth quarter. We had such a strong third quarter that that really -- and you look at our long-term comp is driven by ROIC, and so the big improvement in ROIC and our outlook for the year actually caused three years worth of awards to get ratcheted up and all of that expense fell in the fourth quarter predominantly. So, some of it was just the timing of when the compensation expenses got recorded this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm sorry, hate to be such a pain on this, but I mean, the rest of the -- I guess, marketing spending and strategic spending didn't really go up much more this quarter that it had in the first three quarters. Is that right? I mean, look I'm just trying to understand relative to say last quarter when it was flat, right. If you have the same level of year-on-year increase in marketing spending, that's an extra 19 points of growth that -- you know, it sounds like I guess a piece of it is I-Flow and the comp, but I mean, there's nothing else that's sizeable in there?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say, Chris that the third quarter was maybe a little less than we had expected, the fourth quarter was a little more. We're always -- we always tend to ramp up in the fourth quarter and maybe it was a little bit outsized, but nothing &#x2013; no particular elements stand out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, if you take a look at the flow of below the line spending in 2008, for example, you'll see that the fourth quarter is typically higher than the full-year average. And that's predominantly driven by G&amp;A.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Thanks, guys. I'll just ask a quick question on diapers. Procter has announced a decent sized innovation. I was just wondering what kind of flexibility you guys have to replicate or match that technically if you find that necessary, and how you're thinking about spending plans as they come out with presumably a decent amount of media behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've been aware of the March relaunch of Pampers for a while, because it's been out in the trade for a while. And so, we've seen the product in other markets around the world and we're pretty aware of how it performs, and we feel very good about our HUGGIES plan for 2010. So we know they'll spend money and make a lot of noise, but we also feel like we've got a terrific innovation plan and we'll be &#x2013; we'll come through the year with a strong HUGGIES franchise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How has that product performed and how's it affected your business in other markets where it's been for a longer period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, they haven't launched it broadly anywhere, they've tested it in a bunch of different places. The consumer buzz on their blogs is not all positive. In fact, there's quite a few consumers that are seeing fit issues. But we'll see, I'm sure they'll get it right. I mean, they're a very capable marketing company, they've been in this category a long time. So have we. But, it's &#x2013; if you think about it relative to their current product, it's one millimeter thinner versus our product that's like 1.5 millimeter. So it's not as radically different than you might think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there is anything coming through from the retailers in terms of shelf resets, because I know one of the pitches they're making is that it takes a little bit less space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the big box package, which is the most common, largest volume pack, the pack size is 1% different. So -- on average across their packing, so it's not a huge space differential.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick one for Mark. Why is the tax rate going up next year? I would have thought with more mix presumably coming &#x2013; profit mix coming from overseas, I would have thought maybe the reverse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, couple of things. We're also generating more cash overseas. So we're going to be bringing more cash back to the U.S., which tends to put a little upward pressure on the tax rate. And then there's just a natural upward pressure as we create more income that has a -- more of an upward effect. So ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you wind up getting closer to your statutory rate and so you need that much more tax savings opportunities to hold the rate below the statutory rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really just the growth in the shape of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on kind of that front. Will you guys continue to raise your dividend payout? I mean, you're implying -- increasing your dividend payout ratio this year. Is that something you continue? Is there a target rate you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean, certainly we outperformed this year. So our payout for '09 was actually lower than we expected it would be going into the year. And so, we've said historically we'd try to grow the dividend at least as fast as our earnings growth. And so, I wouldn't expect to see huge shifts in payout upward over time, but I think a modest uptick is probably appropriate in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, guys. Hi. Can we just -- Venezuela, are you done repatriating money from Venezuela, cash wise? I mean, will it stop impacting margins next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's -- everything going to change now that they've gone to hyperinflationary accounting. And so, I think that as we generate excess cash in Venezuela and we can pull that cash out to do other things with it, we'd look to continue to be able to do that. I think at this stage, given the state where the currency controls are, we're not exactly sure what the rules are or how you will even get foreign exchange to pay your bills in foreign currencies at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are diapers deemed essential items or do you have to use the 4.3 rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's three rates now. There is the essential rate -- we're assuming that none of our products are probably in that category. That's probably going to be more food oriented. And so, then there's the non-essential rate of 4.3; then there's the parallel rate of six. And so, I think the question that everybody has at this point, and I don't think anyone knows exactly how it's going to work out, it's going to be some -- either 4.3 or six is where everything will get translated at this year. And so, when you see a range around some of our numbers, it's &#x2013; we're waiting for clarity on how that's going to play out. And so, I think it's likely the SEC is going to weigh in and tell everybody what rate they're supposed to use, and we'll see how that happens in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What's in guidance? Because if you look at the year-over-year comparisons, obviously there was big other expense in the first two quarters. I mean, do you contemplate that continuing or is that going to go away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, some of the big other expense in the first two quarters. If you look at last year, there were some things happening in the sales line and the cost of sales line and the one that was most visible to the Street was what was going on in other expense. As you look in the back half of the year, most of the stuff that was in other expense wound up in cost of sales because of the way the transactions were being done.</p>
          <p>When you shift to hyperinflationary accounting the way -- more of that's going to flow through cost of sales next year, but you're also going to have a much lower sales number, because we were translating sales at the official rate last year of two because that was the rate. This year their sales are going to get translated at either 4.3 or six depending on what the guidance is. So it was 3% of our sales last year, it might be one to 1.5% of our sales in 2010. So there'll be a lot of moving parts for Venezuela in the P&amp;L in 2010 and we'll try to be as transparent about it as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got you. And then on the SG&amp;A line, I think it was 19.5% of sales this quarter. I know you'd answered Chris's question, but is that kind of the run rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That was higher than we'd expect, obviously there was more &#x2013; the fourth quarter accrual effect that Mark talked about and some of the compensation expense catch-up. We had some of the cost of the I-Flow &#x2013; the one-time cost of the I-Flow acquisition were in there. So there was a bunch of things in the fourth quarter. And so, I think if you looked at the full year average, that's probably more reflective of what we'd be aiming at.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. I have a question on the gross margin expansion. I'm having &#x2013; in my model, I'm having trouble getting it to expand because you have cost inflation that won't be fully offset. You have a mix shift towards less, lower-priced products. You've got increased trade promotion. Why will the margin go up next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at a couple of things, I mean, our achieving organic volume growth of two to 3%, that's going to help us from a utilization perspective. We're going to less downtime in 2010 than we had in 2009. Now we won't get all of that back, but we'll get a portion of that, probably half of that will come back in better absorption. We've got a couple hundred million dollars in our FORCE cost savings that we'd expect to come through.</p>
          <p>A lot of the organization optimization costs hit cost of sales and some part of it was in our G&amp;A area, but a good chunk of it was in our manufacturing organization. We'll have lower pension expense in 2010, and a good chunk of that goes through cost of sales. And then some of the currency transaction costs that hurt us, that were in cost of sales for all the purchased materials, those should be better with the better FX environment in 2010. So it's a lot of other pieces that are hard to find, but we think that on balance those thing should help us offset the cost environment and still deliver on margin improvement.</p>

          <p>The one-time costs of the I-Flow acquisition were a big part of that. So, as you know, we had that acquisition-related cost that you have expense. And then some of the profit step up in their inventory flowed through the cost of sales in the fourth quarter. We'll have more of that in the first part of 2010. So you'll probably see a little bit of pressure on Health Care margins in 2010 related to that.</p>

          <p>Okay. So year-over-year in 2010, Health Care margins should be down from 2009 and ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...stabilize. What's I-Flows, what's a good assumption for I-Flows normalized margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, from an operating margins standpoint, they've been running around breakeven, very high gross margins historically. But, obviously, we'll have to flush that profit aspect of inventory through as we do the purchase accounting. But -- and then, we obviously believe that it can be accretive to us by 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I have some questions on Venezuela too. At the non-essential rate, are there restrictions to your access to get money at that rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the honest answer, Connie, is that we don't really know yet. This is all relatively new where we're still trying to figure out how the Venezuelan government is actually going to make exchange available to companies to allow them to pay for the cost of imported raw materials, and in some cases imported finished product. And so, I think it's -- if you look at how things played out in 2009, there were some programs that were available to get exchange at the official rate. But most of our business went at the parallel rate, which -- and so I think we're not sure exactly how that's going to play out in 2010. If the sufficient funding will be available at the non-essential rate, that'd be great, that'd be one scenario, but it's perhaps more likely that we'll be dealing in the parallel rate as we were this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also, I just want to make sure that I'm understanding, I want to have an apple-to-apples comparison, you know, excluding the one-time stuff with Venezuela. And it seemed to me in last year's first quarter, you had two impacts from Venezuela running through. One was the transaction costs, but also didn't you have a loss to reduce your cash balances in the first quarter and shouldn't we exclude that from our adjusted base in 2009? So that it's a straight comparison to 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we'll be probably pulling some cash out again in 2010. So I'm not sure that I'd back that out completely. I mean, the loss that we're going to be treating as an unusual item is really just the impact of going to hyperinflationary accounting, which happened on January 1. To put it in perspective, if the devaluation had happened in December of 2009, all of that one-time charge would have flowed through UTA and not gone through the income statement at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that's &#x2013; but doesn't the cash that you generate, doesn't that also get remeasured in the remeasurement of the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the bolivar cash and bolivar receivables will generate exchange losses as the exchange rate &#x2013; exchange gains or losses as the exchange rate fluctuates in 2010. And net of your bolivar-payable position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Did you record transaction losses in Venezuela in each of the four quarters of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But in some cases, the hit was in cost of sales and others it was in income and expense. It really was &#x2013; it depended on the type of transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, year-over-year because it's already in the 2009 base, it doesn't get precipitously worse in 2010. So the only thing we really need to think about is the translation impact and the one-time balance sheet effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. I mean, at the bottom line, based on what we know of the exchange rates, Venezuela should be pretty similar in 2010 versus 2009. Now that assumes things stay as they are. Sales will be a lot lower, but the operating earnings net income shouldn't be materially different because the parallel rate is projected to be broadly similar to where it was in 2009. So the one-time transaction cost related to remeasuring the balance sheet is the big hit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could ask just one last question, I'm sorry. How should we think about the first quarter, what are the big -- what are the big influences on the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, again, we've got quite a bit of innovation launching in the early part of the year. So you'll probably see stepped up marketing spending. Commodity costs are moving sequentially higher in some areas. You're seeing oil up a bit and so polymer costs will be higher, pulp costs will be higher than the fourth quarter. The G&amp;A cost will likely be lower as some of the impact of the accruals that were taken in the fourth quarter reverse. So you'll see lower G&amp;A spending. Broadly, I'd say those are some of the major impacts you'd looked for. I don't know, Mark, if you've got anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you -- if you think about our business in two halves. I mean, our cost savings programs tend to kind of ramp up toward the end of the year, which tends to benefit the second half. The benefits of the innovation that will come in the first half will tend to flow through in the second half. So it's likely -- first half comps will be better just because our earnings were lower in '09. But progressively, we'll earn more in the back half than the first half.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>

          <p>Hi, Wendy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of follow-up questions on the tissue business. First of all, I know, you've talked a little bit over the last year about maybe some distribution losses for the Scott brand. Has that actually played out -- or what's your expectation now for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, you're seeing retailers everywhere are more disciplined on the brands that they carry and the SKUs that they carry. And I think that's true with every retailer I talk to, that they want to have a more impactful, more efficient line-up. Broadly, we would say that we have the distribution we need to achieve our objectives. The distribution has shifted around; we've gained in some areas, we've lost in other areas. But overall, we feel like we've done a pretty good job and brought the retailers what they need to give them the efficient line-ups that they're looking for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of pressure on your business, do you think this is just an ongoing thing or has the last year seen particularly whatever more of a shift to private label? Any disproportionate pressure on your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think retailers are continuing to push. They want innovation, they want to make room for innovation and so they're going to be pushing manufacturers to make sure that their product line-up is performing. So everyone of our brand teams is making sure that we've got the right things on the shelf, and the right packings for each retail channel and that we're the relevant offering that they want to put on the shelf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And given the sort of continued downtrading to private label, particularly on the towel side, does it change your philosophy or your willingness to do more private label manufacturing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at this point. I mean, I think, we are a branded business, and that's where we focus. We do have some private label contracts that are important to us with strategic retail partners. But, I wouldn't say that &#x2013; wouldn't say we're going to go chase private label broadly as a key strategy. I mean, we've got some excellent programming behind Viva, which is a super premium differentiated product. We continue to make sure that Scott towels provides the value that consumers are looking for. And we think that both of those brands are -- have got a role to play in the category going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then, my last question is just -- and I may have my facts totally wrong here. But isn't it in the spring of 2010, that the brands that SCA brought from Procter in Western Europe have to go away as a part of that licensing agreement? So, I'm wondering if my facts are right, if that's actually still in the cards, and whether that affects you at all? In other words, is that a unique opportunity to capture branded share against what now looks like just a private label dominated market or is that just an immaterial thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that shares were pretty small to begin with and the share growth in Europe is mostly occurring in private label broadly. And so, we've managed to hold share and down just a tick in a couple of categories. But I'd say, we're watching private label more carefully in Europe than we are some of the other branded players.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Morning, Lauren.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing was just on strategic marketing. I think it'd be really helpful if you guys could give us a ballpark idea of what percent of your general expense you consider to be strategic marketing? Because in the conversation about how much it increased year-over-year local currency versus as reported. When I look back at what you said last quarter, it was up 50 million, this quarter it's up 45, and that's different than what Mark has just suggested. So I'm just having trouble, then also I've been figuring out what up faster than sales means for next year or this year now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm not sure, what question would you like us answer in that list, Lauren?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, let's just start with the what's the base &#x2013; what percentage roughly even is "strategic" marketing of your general expense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Lauren, this is Paul. We consider advertising and consumer promotion between the lines as strategic marketing. Advertising we'll report in the 10-K, but roughly speaking it's about 3% of sales. The consumer promotion piece is a meaningful number, but it's less than the advertising number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So, it's less than advertising. That's perfect. Thank you. Okay. Then, since at least year-over-year, even adjusting for currency, strategic marketing was up significantly in '09 versus '08. So, in your plans for 2010 to increase strategic marketing faster than sales, what's really changing outside of the dollar number? Where is it being allocated or how is it being allocated differently, that you think it will have a positive impact on volumes and brand equity versus what you may or may not have seen this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, as you look at our Global Business Plan that we've talked about, the categories that are targeted -- the categories and countries that are targeted for significant growth are going to be where we invest disproportionately. So, if you looked at our Personal Care businesses pretty much around the world, you'd expect to see higher A&amp;P spending. If you looked at our Kleenex business and some of the things that we're going to do behind that you'd expect to see higher marketing spending. Our Andrex business in the UK, we're going through a major relaunch really as we speak. You look at our Viva business and our Cottonelle businesses in the U.S. where you've got high margin differentiated products, where we'd be wanting to spend more behind those. So those would be the focal points where we seen we've got innovation, we've got the strategic growth platform where we'd want to spend more behind those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then, specifically your Consumer Tissue, I know that the Nielsen data is less and less useful especially now with Target not included in it. But the numbers in tracked channels for Scott in both bath and in paper towels were down -- have been down double-digits. So just getting back to Wendy's question about distribution, is the performance very, very different in untracked channels for Scott?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Scott bath overall had a terrific year. So significantly outperformed the category from a growth rate standpoint. So yes, there's no issue on Scott bath. I mean, there it's really more making sure we can manage the supply chain and stay in good customer service because if you look even at the fourth quarter, we significantly outperformed our expectations on Scott bath. Scott towels did lose share, but if you looked at our total towel share versus the prior quarter, I think it was down two tenths of a point and that was probably pretty evenly split across Scott and Viva.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, on margins in tissue. I understand that broadly when you talked about the G&amp;A spending up year-over-year some of it was accruals and sort of one-time or timing issues. But when I look at the reported operating margin for tissue as you highlighted, they're down really significantly year-over-year. And I just -- wondering to what degree is that or the downtime tied to the fact that volume has now been negative for two years? I mean, and you sort of focus on revenue realization, improving margins, it got back to a level that I'm wondering if maybe you say okay, mid-teens margins was fine and now we're going to spend again, but we're sort of back where we started in terms of margins and top line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'd say I'd look at the average margin for the year and say, tissue margins for the full year were up, probably like a couple of hundred basis points, 11.5 versus 8.9. So -- and yes, we slipped back in the fourth quarter, but I'd still say looking at that full year average is really what we're aiming at in 2010. And there was a lot of things that happened in the fourth quarter and some of that was one-time and some of it was downtime related, which we will have more of. But a good chunk of that was in the international businesses, where margins were off quite a bit and part of that was downtime related.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Hi. My first question is, just to clarify on the diaper changes that Procter has put out there. You mentioned that it's a pretty minimal, shelf space issue. But are there any plans at Kimberly that -- not that you would share the details, but to somehow respond to that with innovations of your own?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I mean, as you know, we're always improving HUGGIES, and have got aggressive product plans going into every year. In fact, we've got multi-year product plans. And so, yeah, we feel like we will have a competitive -- and in most cases superior preferred product in HUGGIES throughout 2010. So we're very confident in the innovation plan that we have. We know Procter's a great marketing company, they'll come in and make a lot of noise about their product improvement. But I think what they're doing, if you really take it all apart is more of a cost savings program than a significant step change in product performance.</p>

          <p>When you look at the average -- at least looking at the BSK price for '09, it was 718, and it's supposed to go to 880 in February which if it just did, I'm not saying it will or won't, and stayed for the rest of the year not higher or lower, that would mean you have about $160 a ton change and that would add up to be almost your full $400 million cost increase you're building in. And I know -- I believe you buy about a million tons, give or take, of wastepaper and that's already about $100 a ton above the '09 average. So that would go through there. Are there offsets to this, where you see a raw materials or other costs going down, input costs going down, that would keep you in that three to $400 million range. Or are you expecting pulp to roll down or how can we reconcile those?</p>

          <p>Well, I mean, in some parts of the tissue business in the UK for example, energy costs are probably going to be a little lower in 2010 versus 2009 and so that's part of it. And there are other areas where we've got some pretty significant manufacturing cost improvements part of which we started now with our organization optimization program that will roll forward into 2010. And, obviously, we are watching the fiber prices as you are and when you look at the currency swings that are going on, that's driving it in part, as well as Chinese demand has been extraordinarily high, and we'll see how long that plays out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I noted in the capital spending, which you of course are saying is within your planned long-term range. It's still up about 25, 30% from where it was in '09. Obviously, we all entered '09 with a lot of conservatism, but are there any specific projects you can point to or maybe just segments you can point to as to where the increases are taking place like for example, are there new tissue machines in there or what would account for the increase in spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, we pulled back '09 from our normal run rate just reflecting the challenging environment and we wanted to make sure we conserved cash flow and strengthened our balance sheet going into this tough economic environment. We also felt like if the categories weren't going to be growing rapidly, we shouldn't need to spend as much on capital. But if you look at the 2010 plan, you'd see some capacity expansion in Personal Care around the world particularly diapers and fem care. You'd see more spending on cost savings programs and so supporting a lot of the cost savings plans that we have. We're going to spend a bit more our capital in that vein. We've got some good cost savings projects that we'll be driving to help make sure we deliver on that front. There's no major tissue capacity expansions that are in the plan that are significant to talk about at this stage. And so, I mean, we think in tissue through productivity growth we've got the capacity to support our growth.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a few questions to start on the away-from-home tissue business. There is a price increase in the market, have you announced anything and just in general it's one of your economically sensitive businesses, with macro indicators kind of starting to point up, are you starting to see anything change in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say that if you look at the sequential volume comparisons in KCP, it looked like it got a little better, but I'd say the comparison got easier. Because last year's fourth quarter you saw a pretty big inventory pull back and bigger volume declines and so -- I would say, we're going to kind of follow the unemployment rate, and you're not really seeing a lot of job creation or seeing the unemployment rate decline. And until you start to see that, you're going to see the KCP business kind of go sideways, I'd guess.</p>
          <p>From a -- the comparisons get easier in 2010, but I don't think, you're going to see real volume improvement until you see the economy start to turn more positively. If you look at a lot of industries, there's still significant excess capacity and until that starts to get filled up, you're not going to see huge swings in volume improvement in K-C Professional. There is a general industry price increase that's rolling around. We'd look for opportunities where we get the chance to improve our net realized revenue. Whether we do that through list or we do that through increasing contract prices, we're still evaluating the response to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, just going back to private label. I guess, you mentioned that private label is gaining share in Europe and there was, I guess, some talking around it in some of the other markets. But can you talk about what you're seeing in some of your key, I guess, North American markets in terms of private label of share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, private label has been gaining share in Europe for like 50 years. And so if you look at a long trend, it's continued to move upward generally and it's driven by the European retailers. If you look at private label shares in our major U.S. markets, if you looked at it in -- just versus the prior quarter, private label shares are actually down in about half of our categories, so -- and maybe flat in the rest. So it's down seven tenths of a point in Infant Care, pretty flat in Child Care, down a couple points in baby wipes, down a tick in Fem Care, down seven tenths in Adult Care, down a couple of points in facial tissue, up six tenths in bath, and up a tenth in paper towel.</p>
          <p>So versus sequentially, you'd say private label shares got a little weaker. Now there was more branded spending on marketing money and trade promotion, which probably narrowed some of those price gaps. If you looked full year '09 versus '08, you'd say, private label was up about a half a point or more in five of our categories and flat in about three. So you'd see the biggest moves in Adult Care private label is up a couple of points, it was up a couple of points in paper towels, and it was up about a point in facial tissue. Most of the other Personal Care categories, private label shares were within a half a point of where they were in '08, so not a huge swing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Thank you. And I guess just last question. Looking at the International volume trend at low single digits in 2009, I mean was that mainly kind of inventory destocking, price elasticity and would you envision being able to get that kind of back to the double-digit rate over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we saw double-digit organic growth, but probably more price and some of that is going to come as we drive innovation in some of the higher margin segments. But I also think, in large parts of the emerging market as their economies start to improve, we'll see category penetration improve. So we would expect organic volume growth in the emerging markets to, probably, not get back to the double-digit range broadly, because we've got a lot of markets over there that are pretty well developed like Australia and Korea that are a big part of our mix. But we've still got aggressive growth plans in China and Russia and we're seeing good volume growth in those areas as well as big parts of Latin America.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I'm going to ask you a -- sort of a different way to look at the number for next year aside from just margins, which is if I take a look at the reversal of charges, the benefits from the workforce reduction, the incremental and the incremental benefit from FORCE, to me that all adds up roughly to where your cost of goods sold inflation number is for the year, the 300 to 400. And then if I take a look at the lack of curtailment and the lower pension year-over-year and if I add that to your 2009 base, that kind of gets me to the mid-point of your guidance range.</p>
          <p>And then I'm looking at this and saying, okay, you've got a $1 billion in revenue growth, that has to be dropping at a relatively lower margin number, because you don't seem to be getting much profit benefit from the growth. So I guess is there something I'm missing there? Obviously, you talked about the higher marketing spend. But just a normalized margin on the $1 billion in incremental growth would get you a couple of hundred million dollars. So I guess, the question there is what am I missing on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think couple of things I'd -- without seeing the analysis entirely, I'd say the overhead absorption. I'd probably only maybe bring half of that back, because we'll still have some downtime in 2010. So that's part of it. We'll have strategic marketing spending that will be faster than sales. So that will be a part of it. We'll spend a bit more in R&amp;D and customer development, so that will be another part of it. You know, wage rate inflation -- we didn't do a lot in salary increases in '09. We'll likely have a normal wage increase in 2010, so that'll be in the probably 25 to 50 million range. We have some product improvement costs as we're improving the product, we're going to put some value back in so that's a chunk that's not in there. I think those are probably the other pieces that maybe weren't in the analysis that you laid out that would account for the differences that you're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, nothing major, just taking advantage of maybe a little bit of flex to have to work on a bunch of different things, is kind of the way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say just, it's more the normal things that happen in the business. I mean you have product improvement costs every year, you have wage increases every year, you have investments in marketing that you're trying to increase at a faster rate than sales and you've got cost savings programs to pay for it all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our categories, we're pretty high turn already. So we take up a lot of space in the warehouse and the retailers really want to flow our product to the store as quickly as they can. And so, we haven't seen huge swings at this point in time. I'd say, going into 2009, you saw everybody be really lean on inventory. I wouldn't say they've rebuilt that dramatically, and every customer would tell you they are trying to run with a leaner more efficient supply chain and so, we play a part in that. But we're already at the top end of their performance from an inventory turn standpoint in most cases.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question about the two to three volume. I mean, what are you assuming for market category growth maybe Consumer Tissue, Personal Care. I know, you did talk about the slow and modest recovery. So I'm just trying to figure out what you're implying in terms of market share gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, in the U.S., we'd expect the categories to be pretty flat. The birthrate has been a little down in the U.S. and so that will play out in our categories for the next couple of years. And so, we'd expect to see the diaper category pretty flat. On tissue, bath tissue, generally follows population growth. So that's going to be flat to up slightly. Household towel, the category was pretty weak this year, so was facial tissue. So as the economy recovers, you could start to see those categories grow a bit at a faster pace. Globally, we'd still look for probably mid single digit category growth in diapers and some of the Personal Care spaces. You know, Fem Care may be a little slower than that because it's more penetrated in most markets. So, I'd say if you look at our two to 3% target, not huge share gains, here, it's really more category penetration with perhaps, some of our innovation in selected markets where we'd see some modest share improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just on the next point, just in Personal Care in Europe, can you just comment about, the Simply Dry rollout from Proctor? Clearly this quarter, HUGGIES showed some strength and the price investment actually improved for you guys this period versus the last couple of quarters. So I was just wondering how that competitive landscape is looking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so far the Simply Dry has mostly cannibalized P&amp;G's existing share. So we've defended reasonably well and, obviously, we're watching it closely as they roll it out to more markets. But so far we're feeling like we're doing the right things with the HUGGIES franchise in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a last question. With the face masks up, I guess, they're adding 6% to the growth in the fourth quarter, how &#x2013; what assumptions are you making for 2010? Are you assuming that there's going to be some reversal as this pushes out from H1N1? You know, I guess can you put some color around that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, that's a good question. Mark and I were just with our Health Care team a week or so ago having this exact same discussion. And I think we're basically assuming that we still have a little bit of H1N1 benefit in the first quarter. And then it really winds down and goes back to more of a pre-H1N1 level. So you'd actually see some volume decline on face masks in 2010, and that's built into our plan.</p>
          <p>One of the questions we've been debating is, a lot of this was governments and hospitals building a stockpile. And we don't &#x2013; it's difficult to get visibility as to whether the stockpile was actually used and pulled down and do they need to replenish or where are they in their own inventory levels at the end user level. And so, that's something we're still trying to get better visibility of. I think there's talk of another H1N1 bloom in the spring, we'll see how that transpires at this stage. But our planning assumptions are that we've got a bit left in the first quarter and then we revert more to where we were before the pandemic began.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a little bit of an update on the most recent head count reduction program and tell us how much in cost savings that were in the quarter? And then I guess, costs related to that were only 6 million in the quarter pre-tax, I thought it would be more like 12. Are you still going to have more cost going forward? Or are the costs over and then just the benefit? And I'm also modeling about 80 million of benefit in the first half of 2010 from that, is that about right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's all right, Linda. This is, Paul. The costs are done, they came in at about 128 million for the year, it's in the news release. The savings in the fourth quarter were 30 million, and that brought the full year to about 55 million and that leaves about 80 million for 2010. And the head count, we completed the program, we reduced head count by about 1,600 positions as we said at the beginning that we'd do. So, on track and complete.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then, can you just touch on the operating margins in K-C Professional and Health Care, and why they came down so much sequentially. Is that just the sequential increase in material cost inputs or something else, because the pricing in professional was actually pretty good? So can you explain that a little bit more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. K-C Professional, secondary fiber was part of it. They also had some significantly higher distribution expense, which was -- part of that was related to a new order entry system that we put in. So we should start to see some improvement in that area in 2010 as we get that established. We also took a little bit more downtime from an inventory standpoint globally on K-C Professional. So that's sort of that story.</p>
          <p>On Health Care, the input cost and polymer was a part of it, but probably a bigger part was the impact of the I-Flow one-time costs, and some of the inventory step-up that flowed through those numbers.</p>
