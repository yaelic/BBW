        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to this presentation of the BBVA Group's results for the third quarter of 2010. Just to start things off, yesterday when we were presenting these results to the board of directors, a member of the board said to me that all we're seeing are more news about the financial sector, which always look like complicated news.</p>
          <p>I think it's rather same here, because we started this quarter talking about the main issues that we were going to be seeing in it. And it's the same issues that we saw in the previous quarter and a couple of other issues as well.</p>
          <p>We were talking about uncertainty in the second quarter and here in the third quarter, there is only one thing which has really changed. The liquidity situation to some of our competitors has improved. There is greater discrimination, we think. But all the other issues are there on the table.</p>
          <p>The deleveraging that we're seeing in all businesses, which began in 2009 and went on in 2010, the deterioration of the quality of assets, above all, here in Spain. The level of competition as well that we are seeing in the domestic market here in Spain. Everybody is trying to raise customer funds and that's meant, of course, that the cost has gone up during 2010. Sovereign risk as well is another issue with a very volatile spread which has gone up and down all the time throughout the year. And all of this has meant that wholesale finance has become more expensive in general.</p>
          <p>And what new factors have come out this quarter? Well, we thought that we were seeing the light at the end of tunnel with the recovery of the biggest economies in the world, but now there is a degree of uncertainty about sustainability of the recovery worldwide.</p>
          <p>And to that, we have to add the volatility that we've been seeing in the currency markets, as some economies try to protect their trade in this environment. And again, this goes back to what we were saying in the second quarter, that this quarter too for BBVA has clearly been a quarter in which we've outperformed our competitors.</p>
          <p>We not only outperformed our competitors as a group, because the group is really the adding together all the different franchises, but franchises have been showing superior performance to their peers in their businesses.</p>
          <p>So in Spain and Portugal, if we look at business volumes, we've got a bigger market share in lending and our CFO will talk about deposits and customer funds as well, where we've outperformed our peers. With management, which has shown itself to be able to adapt to the changes in the cost of funds and that has improved our operating income figures with good revenues coming in. And we've done excellent cost management as well.</p>
          <p>We should also add in this quarter, we've seen our risk quality indices improving, as we said they would, to the market. And Manuel will be talking about this later. But they are pretty well flat in the third quarter with an excellent NPA ratio, excellent coverage and a good cost of risk.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, as we said last quarter, well, throughout 2010, we've seen things speed up, business volumes growing very strongly, over 10% in lending and in customer funds, it's growing close to 7% and gaining market share as well in most of our products.</p>
          <p>What does that mean? It means that gradually, we are seeing the different margins improve in our attributable profit, for each of the quarters in 2010 has gone up and up and up. And we can confirm for the third quarter running that the cost of risk, as we expected at the beginning of the year, has performed better than we were expecting.</p>
          <p>Then in South America, it looks very positive there. Excellent business volumes, going up 14% in lending. Customer funds growing more than 10%. If you look at the quarterly performance of all the items on the P&amp;L, they're all gaining cruising speed and the cost of risk is helping us to boost our accounts every quarter. NPA is going down, coverage going up. So for the year as a whole, we think we are seeing excellent performance there.</p>
          <p>United States. There, we are seeing a progressive consolidation of the franchise. We are seeing that our business model is being applied more and better. You know that's very much customer focused, so that we have a distribution network to originate our banking business.</p>
          <p>We are gaining traction and we're bringing in far more new production than we have done in the past, especially in mortgages for individuals and as well in corporate business. We are thus improving the mix in our lending portfolio, which means that we are seeing growth in earnings in the United States franchise. We can also confirm this quarter that the risk indicators are very well under control, as we see in other franchises as well.</p>
          <p>In wholesale banking, well, the advantage we have in this franchise is that we are talking about a business that's very customer focused, which means that the earnings are growing on a very stable basis, much more stable than the earnings that are competitors in this business who don't have that customer franchise, perhaps. So our attributable profit is looking very good and also, our business from Asia is becoming an increasingly important part of our total business, over 20% of the earnings in this unit. So that means that we can have P&amp;L for the group as a whole which is far more resistant to whatever's going on around this than our competitors have. So it's a much more stable P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>If we look at the risk indicators quarter-on-quarter, we see that what we said at the end of last year was true. It's been confirmed, there was a peak at the end of last year. And ever since then, each quarter, we've seen the gradual fall in the NPA ratios as our coverage ratios go up.</p>
          <p>We've generated 20 basis points in organic capital as well this quarter, which has offset the ForEx impact or the exchange rate impact as well. And at the same time, during the quarter, we have strengthened our funding structure. So we have a much stronger balance sheet, and we'll be talking about this a bit more later.</p>
          <p>Consequently, we can say that we are looking at a business, BBVA's business, which is based on retail business. It's based on our customer franchise, and that means that we are able to be much more resistant to uncertainty in the environment and the composition of our businesses in different geographical areas means that we have excellent diversification, which gives us much more stable earnings.</p>
          <p>So if we look at all the different lines, net interest income first, that's going down slightly &#x2013; well, it went up &#x2013; well, sorry, no, it went down 1.1% year-on-year. Later on, we will see some of the reasons for this. But nonetheless, we are still far away from our competitors, those who have given their presentations of results this year at least aren't doing nearly as well. So what are the issues that have impacted this net interest income in the first nine months or in the third quarter?</p>
          <p>The first reason was that there was an increase in the cost of wholesale funding, because of the fierce competition in the Spanish domestic market and that's had an impact. And then, the cost of wholesale funding throughout the world, because of the cost of sovereign debt going up.</p>
          <p>But, because of the diversification of our businesses, we have been able to offset that negative impact, so that we are getting about 1%. So, we are not just standing on the sidelines as we watch our net interest income slide down. No, we are focusing very clearly on what's happening to make sure that we can take action, so that the decline of 1.1% will stop. So, above all, we are working to protect our zero cost deposits. Again, our customer focus helps there.</p>
          <p>We're trying to contain the costs that we have on interest bearing deposits with the plan here in Spain based on customer insight, which makes it possible to make individualized offers or offerings to our customers, which is tailor made for their need and that's why we're doing better than our competitors. And we've been very active in reprising our front books and the re-pricing as well of the back books. That's really the stock of lending that we already have.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to gain market share in lending in the first nine months of the year or even year-on-year, we've increased our lending share by 30 basis points, a little bit less for lending as a whole. Although in some items and especially in developer loans, there, we're trying to shrink our market share on purpose. And it's important as well to see that all the new production, all the new business that we are writing, is showing a very positive spread. So, those are the drivers that we're working on with very active management to ensure that over the next quarters, we have some good news to give you on net interest income.</p>
          <p>What about net fee income? That's going up 4.1% and here again, we can clearly see how the composition that we have in the group means that we can offset the sluggishness of certain geographical areas, such as Spain, for example. And we're seeing this growth then, over 4% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Gross income is growing 3.8% and here, that is especially good for us, because we are improving the revenue mix between the emerging and the developed economies each quarter with one percentage point gain in the mix towards the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And then in operating income, which incorporates costs, of course; well, costs have grown at 6.8% in constant exchange rates <mark type="audio gap" /> (13:46 &#x2013; 14:10). &#x20AC;5 million there. Moreover, we are able to confirm a second interim dividend in cash of $0.09 a share. That's the same as we did with the first interim dividend and our return on equity is amazingly high compared to those of our peers, 17.2%, and our return on assets is very close to 1%. That's something that our peers could hardly even dream of.</p>
          <p>So in the income statement, we can see that for the first nine months, we've got &#x20AC;3.66 billion in attributable profit. It is going down, that's true. One thing we've tried to do this year is to have more stable quarter-on-quarter growth throughout the year in order to get greater stability between the beginning and the end of the year. So operating income, despite all the uncertainty in the environment, is growing at half a percentage point, which means that we can increase our provisioning for covering NPAs.</p>
          <p>If we look at the risk indicators now, there are couple of concepts which are absolutely vital to understand that we are stabilizing our NPAs. At the end of the quarter, we've got to &#x20AC;15.6 billion and that's about 500 million less than the previous quarter, which has meant that it was possible to get improvement in the NPA ratio, in the cost of risk and in the coverage ratios as well.</p>
          <p>Something that's important to look at is what's happened to net additions in 2010. If you look, 924 million is the quarterly average in 2010, which compares against 2.196 million last year. What did we do. Well, you'll have to look at the gross additions, which have gone down on average more than 500 million and with improved in recoveries, 700 million above what we did last year. So that's why the net additions to NPAs are behaving so well, which means that we've reduced NPAs in &#x20AC;500 million. And once again, we are seeing a drop in the total NPA ratios down to 4.1%. And in a very natural way, with all the franchises contributing, and all the geographical areas contributing.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk, 1.33. This is influenced by the generic provisions that we've endowed this quarter using the capital gains on the sale of branch offices, generating 233 million, which we put completely into endowing our generic provisions.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we've also seen the impact of the new Bank of Spain circular. &#x20AC;198 million was the impact, of which 120 were generic and the rest just went down on to the bottom line. And as I said before, the capital gains coming from the sale of our real estate have been used for our generic provisions. So if you included all in one package, we've stabilized the cost of risk through out the year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of our capital ratios, earlier on, I said that we've been generating 20 basis points of organic capital in the year which meant that we've offset the impact of the exchange rate, which means a 0.1% improvement in core capital compared against what we see saw in the second quarter of the year. So at 8.2% core capital at the end of the quarter. That's 9.2% in Tier 1 and 12.8% in our BIS ratio.</p>
          <p>So we've got an <mark type="audio gap" /> improvement in the structure of the balance sheet. In the group, we've raised capital worth more than &#x20AC;16 billion, of which more than 12 billion came to us in Spain from our customers in Spain, and that's meant we've been able to get a significant change in the weighting of retail financing to our total funding, with an improvement of five points in this mix.</p>
          <p>We've been able to issue more than &#x20AC;6.5 billion in the markets, this quarter. We've been one of the biggest issuers in the market, so to September, we've issued over 16 billion which is comfortably more than our average annual maturities for the next three years of 10 billion.</p>
          <p>Another thing that you know about us is that we are doing very well &#x2013; we're bringing in funding which is the cheaper rate than the funding that's maturing. And at the same time, the available collateral after discounting what we have with the European Central Bank is &#x20AC;75 billion. That's more than the 68 billion figure that we saw at the end of the first quarter, when we hadn't seen such tight liquidity coming in the market, so there is an improvement there, which is very relevant for us.</p>
          <p>And finally &#x2013; and here, I think I'll hand the floor to Manuel Cid, who's our CFO. I think he is the person who can best talk about what's happened in each of our different business areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>As we heard from our COO in his presentation, the quarterly results are very sound and they are recurring earnings that come from our different businesses and it shows the strength of our franchise in all geographies.</p>
          <p>So let's look at the leading &#x2013; the highlights in each of these. As &#xC1;ngel Cano said at the beginning, these are the headlines that we'd like to get across to you. To keep this presentation as brief as possible, we are going to go to the main points of each of our business areas.</p>
          <p>In Spain and Portugal, I think the headline should be that our performance is superior and this increases and improves each quarter. If we compare this with our peers in Spain, which are the seven largest banks in Spain, the complexity of the environment is associated with this, apart from the economic environment and the lack of credit, which is associated with the liability margins. If we look at both the financial molding and the NPA ratios and the needs for provisions, then I think you can see that our performance is way above our peers.</p>
          <p>If we look at Mexico now, the good news in Mexico is the upturn in business that we're been talking about since the beginning of the year. And this -- we're now seeing this and it's accelerating, as we will see later on. And this enables us not just to galvanize the P&amp;L this year within attributable profit in absorbing the tax hikes there, but also the forecasts for 2011 are also bright. And this upturn in business in Mexico is exactly the same but even greater in South America, where we are seeing that business is very active, especially if we look at the margins in the P&amp;L and this is clearly generalized all over the different geographies in Latin America.</p>
          <p>If we turn to United States now, there is interesting news this quarter as well. I think it's showing how our franchise is consolidating. Our business model is consolidating in the U.S. and starting to give us highly positive results, as &#xC1;ngel Cano said at the beginning of his presentation.</p>
          <p>And finally, wholesale banking and asset management, and here, we will see that the quality of revenues and the increase in contribution of Asia will grow the attributable profit for the group and far more so than the results we're seeing from other wholesale and investment banks.</p>
          <p>So if we start with Spain now, as the COO said at the beginning of his presentation, we are growing very fast in our net interest income, especially with the lack of lending in the market at the moment with the current environment, and the liability margins are very negative. We're growing importantly both in lending and in deposits and in market share. In customer funds and in lending, we're talking about the P&amp;L where we're also gaining market share both in the net interest income and in the operating income in comparison with our seven main financial institutions that operate in Spain. At the moment BBVA and its business in Spain is absorbing 30.6% of the operating income of the whole industry.</p>
          <p>So, we are coming to the end of the reporting and what we're doing for those that haven't reported their earnings is to extrapolate it. We have 30.6 of all the operating income generated by the banking sector is ours, it belongs to BBVA. If we look at other important elements in the current environment, such as expenses and asset qualities, if we look at spending, first of all, at the beginning of the crisis, if we start out at a base line of 100 and we look at the performance in our expenses within the peer group and we will see how expenses have grown 11%, i.e. we are now spending 11% more than we did at the beginning of the crisis. That's as a sector as a whole. But we are spending 4% less than we did at the beginning of the crisis. So the spread between ours and the rest of the industry has improved by 15%, because we anticipated what was going to happen in the crisis here, so we've reduced our spending notably.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the NPA ratio now, unlike what we're seeing in our case with the stabilizing of our NPA ratio in Spain, what we're seeing our peers is that the NPA ratio has dropped by 10, 11 basis points, whereas all our peer group, the seven main banking institutions, are showing systematic growth in their NPA ratios.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we continue to think that our NPA ratio has reached its peak, despite what we hear from many institutions here in Spain, where they are talking about continued impairments of assets well into 2011. So in short, this is the P&amp;L for Spain and Portugal. There is a slip, obviously, but this has had a minimum impact if we compare this with the current environment and there are some positive notes here that show that our strategy is protecting the value of our customer franchise here in the mid-term in such a fierce environment. So I would say that these earnings are great for Spain, in relation to the environment and what we're seeing from our peers.</p>
          <p>If we look at Mexico here, the news here, as I said, was the upturn in business with the growth throughout the year that we've been talking about since the end of 2009. And we can see here, how lending that had practically stopped at the end of 2009 is currently growing 10.4%. And customer numbers &#x2013; customer funds are going up by 7% now. So this is a major systematic change. Quarter after quarter, we're seeing an improvement in business. And this improvement is due to domestic demand improving in Mexico.</p>
          <p>And this is great news, because Bancomer has continued to gain market share despite its position in all different lending, in consumer and cards, in mortgages. In consumer lends and cards, we're starting to see the first signs, especially in consumer, of a reactivation of demand and a growth in lending. And we're just talking about high single-digit growth in consumer credit in year-on-year terms, which is very important from a point of view of future margins for Mexico.</p>
          <p>If we now look at the results, even though they are absorbing the increased taxes quarter-by-quarter, we're seeing how earnings in Mexico are improving. We're increasing &#x20AC;100 million in constant euros quarter-by-quarter. And on the right, we can see at the same time, as we forecast, the cost of risk continues to fall. We are now at 344 and systematically, this is dropping down with an NPA ratio which is also systematically improving, and the coverage is now 150%. So the trends are excellent in Mexico, which suggests sustainable improvements in the future for 2011 too.</p>
          <p>South America now. The same as we're seeing in Mexico, we are seeing in South America, but it is going even faster. Lending is increasing by 15% at the moment and customer resources are increasing by 11%. And this is not just the growth that we are seeing in these markets, which are spectacular. In some countries, we're seeing growth that's equivalent to Asia with market share gains both in lending, in customer funds.</p>
          <p>These are generalized all over South America, which makes it possible to grow the attributable profit to 13.4% to September, with forecast to improve the lower part in the P&amp;L account in the future and forge an NPA ratios of 2.4% and increase of coverage of 139%. So the results are very positive, very strong results from South America, and the trends are very promising.</p>
          <p>Okay, with regard to the contribution to the P&amp;L for the fourth quarter next year, if we look at the U.S. now, I think there are some interesting signs coming out of the U.S. that suggest a progressive consolidation of our franchise in the U.S. and our business model with a major presence in Texas, which is one of the most interesting states for &#x2013; with regard to the future of the U.S. We are seeing how the new production, new lending is really taking off in segments such as business, consumers, which we're interested in focusing on.</p>
          <p>And as our COO said, we're starting to see a change in the mix which is described in the leaflet in some detail, a significant change in the mix, the different weights of the different, headings of lending, which has taken enormous management effort. So there is not an enormous growth, but we are changing the mix, which shows major growth in businesses, individual consumers and significant falls, especially in developers, both in residential real estate and also in commercial real estate.</p>
          <p>And in a very different environment from the environment here in Spain, with positive margins, this is giving us growth, the net trading income 9% and growth in earnings of 18% and stability with the risk indicators and clear signs of a stabilization in the deterioration of the quality of assets.</p>
          <p>And finally, in our wholesale banking and asset management, as I said at the beginning of my part that we have a wholesale banking franchise that has grown 9.2% in this environment in the attributable profit, in a quarter where it's obviously not been a good quarter for a wholesale banking in general. But even so for corporate and investment banking has grown their net interest income by 9.7%, and 16% and this has happened in an environment of very little growth or even a drop in lendings in major corporates.</p>
          <p>What I would like to emphasize is the management effort and re-pricing effort behind the figures. With regard to global markets, we are growing 18.7% our business with customers. So we got enormous margin for growth here. To give &#x2013; offer products to our customers and our customer base which gives it future value to our wholesale business especially in this environment, so a significant advancement in Asia.</p>
          <p>Asia now accounts for 20% of revenues from Wholesale Banking, both with regard to CITIC, our share on the Chinese mainland, which is growing by more than 40% in earnings, but also with regards to the performance we're seeing in the domestic business. So it's been a complex quarter for all the wholesale units, but I think they've done an excellent job and we're still showing growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, well, now we can finish, so that we can let you ask your questions. I just wanted to say that really, it's not an easy time to be in the financial industry and it won't be for the next few quarters either. For us though, fortunately, we are still showing some very resistant results to the market. And that's not just the outcome of chance, it's the outcome of our business model, based on a very strong resale franchise which is highly customer-focused.</p>
          <p>And that along with the geographical diversification that we have in the group means that we are able to report these very stable results in a quarter that's been very difficult, which are very much in line with the results we've been reporting for the last few quarters, whilst we improve our credit quality in all of the different franchises, generating capital organically and continuing to strengthen the structure of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So I think the conclusion here can be that the results are still very positive. The distance between us and our peers is getting wider and wider and I think our business model is the main reason for that spread.</p>
          <p>So maybe we can now turn to the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay then, yes, as I was saying, I'll try to classify all the questions under different headings. First of all, credit quality, NPAs and provisions. We've got various questions here, from Joseph Dickerson, David Vaamonde, Francisco Riquel, Lape Kolvos and others. And they are talking about other financial institutions expecting to see a peak in NPA ratios for the middle of 2011, whereas our peak came at the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010. So why is BBVA so different from everyone else, they ask?</p>
          <p>And where do we see the peak in the United States ratios? And how would we be impacted by the new regulations from the Bank of Spain on provisions and NPAs? And how we meant to ensure coverage of NPAs and they also ask if we can give an outlook regarding any peak in the NPA ratio in 2011. So I think that's all of the questions for this block.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It has been no surprise to you to-date that we maintained our NPA ratio stable. When we did a prudent exercise at the end of last year, what we were aiming to do is to get what we've gotten here, to clear the horizons and that's exactly what we've seen each quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>If we go over the different franchises one by one, as Manuel said, Spain, we've dropped over 10 basis points over the year as a whole, and there is still a fall in net additions dropping notably and an increase in recoveries, all of which means that we can continue to confirm that the peak in NPA ratios was at the end of last year, and in the coming quarters, I don't think we're going to see any increases in NPAs in Spain.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in this year, we've sold over &#x20AC;600 million with an average yield of over 10% and that indicates that the provisions that we have for these assets is right or we were being highly conservative, because don't forget, the coverage that we have of 33.5% that we have in assets of this kind. And obviously, this will help us in this process to reduce our retail real estate assets. Mexico now, quarter-after-quarter, we are seeing three effects, a reduction of NPAs, a drop in the NPA ratio and an increase in coverage. And this trend is what we are going to see in the future.</p>
          <p>South America, maybe South America, the expectations for provisions is even more positive. We were suggesting around 12% and I think we've done even better than that or will have done by the end of the year. So there is improvement in the NPA ratios, improvement in coverage ratios in the different franchises in South America.</p>
          <p>And in the U.S., your question was when are we going to see a peak in the NPA ratios. There has been a certain volatility in this, that these have been transient, but the NPA ratio is stable. We are not seeing any raising trend in the U.S. in NPA ratios. It's certainly under control. The effects of the environment in the U.S. enable us to feel very comfortable in wholesale banking and there is nothing worth mentioning here.</p>
          <p>And all of this means that we can confirm that the trend that we expect to see for the group as a whole is a trend of stability with a clear fall quarter after quarter. So from the point of view of credit quality, we are very, very comfortable.</p>
          <p>Why are we different from our peers? I think one of the reasons for this is the fact that we anticipated this at the beginning of last year. If you remember the &#x20AC;2.8 billion one-off that we moved to NPAs or that we were up-to-date on payments or they hadn't matured, funnily, yesterday I was asked about the current figure of the 1.8 billion, that 1.2 billion are paid up-to-date. So none of these have been passed over to outstanding debts.</p>
          <p>So I think the trend we are going to see &#x2013; we are not going to see these outstanding debts raise. So quite honestly, we are quite comfortable with what we are seeing now. And I think the same is true for the next few quarters to come. I don't know if you want to add something about provisions, Manuel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, the new Bank of Spain regulations, basically what it does is to count the guarantees and the collateral provided for loans, which gives us quick provisions for 12 months, so the part of NPAs that is not supported by the updated value of the guarantee. So we are benefited by these new regulations, because we have less exposition to developers &#x2013; exposure, sorry, than our peer group and we have better quality collateral than our peer group, which means that regulations in a stable environment with a drop in NPA ratios will generate less needs for specific provisions. And I think this is a very positive point.</p>
          <p>Obviously, with these regulations increase in NPAs will generate very fast impacts and systematic impacts in the need for specific provisions. So I think these regulations will just increase or improve our position with regard to retail. On Page 26 of the leaflet, you see a graph at the top of the page with a cover of provisions and collateral, where we distribute all our NPA figures without unsecured loans and secured loans. And I think this is important in this context of the regulations from the Bank of Spain.</p>
          <p>If you look at this graph, we have 6.6 billion in NPAs in secured loans and we have 9.6 billions in coverage. So we have an extra 3 billion in provisions over and above what we need for the &#x2013; to cover the NPAs with unsecured loans. So we have 8.9 billions with secured loans in NPAs. So if we take away the 3 billion and use these to cover the NPAs with secured loans, we have a net figure of 5.9 billion. And on the other side, we have current guarantees of 16 billion. So we have guarantees that will cover three times the amount of the NPAs that we have with secured loans. I can't establish the impairment of this, but obviously, we have a sound provisions and collateral structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the second block of questions, all going in the same direction. That is the current impact of the draft Basel III agreement on BBVA capital. We've got questions from Daragh Quinn, Carlos Peixoto, Sergio Gamez from Merrill Lynch and Britta Schmidt from Autonomous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first thing that we should say is that right now, the BBVA Group is in full compliance with Basel III. We are already complying with the new standards. Maybe one of the most important impacts is the kind of business model we have. It's very retail, customer-focused with a high proportion of retail to investment banking activities, which means that the impact on us isn't as great as it is on our peers. Apart from that, each quarter, we are generating capital organically and that really helps us to have very sound capital ratios quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.</p>
          <p>And therefore, the impact of the Basel standards isn't so great, because we are complying with them and we are generating capital organically anyway, about 20 basis points a quarter. So we can absorb any new impact from them. With a business model like ours, that means that we're not so hit or badly hit as other more wholesale-oriented banks. Manuel, do you have anything to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I should just add that one of the biggest impacts that a lot of the banks have received has to do with the hybrids in their capital structures with the new definition we've got in Basel III. And as the COO said, we've only got 18% of those kinds of hybrid products in our capital structure. So our capital ratios are top quality. And that means that our situation then is much better vis-&#xE0;-vis the new Basel III standards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then the third block has to do with the net interest income. And there, I'd say that the common denominator is what's happened quarter-on-quarter to our net interest income, above all in Spain. And people want to know how we're expecting things to happen in the rest of 2010, yes, 2010 and in 2011 as a whole.</p>
          <p>What was the reason behind this drop in net interest income in corporate activities? And that comes back to the same question. And we've got questions from various different analysts about this. We've got eight analysts focusing almost exclusively on these two matters. So what are we expecting to happen to our net interest income and our corporate business in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have mentioned this or most of this in the presentation. I think there are three main effects. One is the exchange rate per quarter. If you remember, we've been seeing, in general terms, a ratio that's closer to 20s in the first &#x2013; in the early year the dollar to the euro. And now we're talking about 140s rather than 120s. So the effect will be negative for this quarter. But despite all of this, if we look at the three quarters as a whole, the effect has been a positive one, even with regard to giving a net attributable profit of over &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>The second effect in the quarter is the cost, as I said before, of wholesale funding. Manuel will address this in greater detail, but this affects the trend in corporate activities. And third is the effect of the greater competition in the Spanish domestic market, which increases retail funding and this has increased in this quarter. So our decision here has been to protect our customers.</p>
          <p>And to do this, what you want to do is, if you want to protect your franchise with the competition in the domestic market, this obviously comes at a cost. But we have been able to meet this cost. Our performance has been better than our peers because of the fact that we have information. We have individual customer insight, which enable us to make customized offers to each and every one of our customers. So depending on the kind of relations we have with our customers, we can offer them the best prices for our products.</p>
          <p>In the course of this quarter, using this defense of our customer franchise, we've raised over &#x20AC;12 billion this quarter or attracted this. And I think this shows the capacity that our branch network has. Looking forward now, what we are seeing, I think is that in the short-term, interest rates are creeping up, which means that liabilities will pick up on this effect in the short-term of this increase in interest rates and we won't see the effect on our assets until maybe halfway through next year.</p>
          <p>So I think over the next two or three quarters, what we're going to see is we're going to see this sort of level of the effect of the net interest income, although it is going to slow down, and I think we're going to see this maybe until halfway through 2011. And by that time, I think we should start to see more positive growth.</p>
          <p>What I also mentioned in my presentation was that the steps that we've been working on intensely, pricing of new production, the pricing of our portfolios in order to increase the spreads in the portfolio and especially to adapt them to the new market prices. Protecting our customer, our zero cost customer deposits. And new business has to be profitable, and this includes both funding and lending.</p>
          <p>But above all, we have to continue to be ready, as we have been in recent quarters, with highly customer-focused plans, and we need to be able to face restructuring that hasn't really fully started with regard to the financial sector in Spain, and as I said before, we expect a lot from this. I think we can harness this situation. And just to finish off one final important point, having said all of this and thanks to the diversification that I mentioned in my presentation, the net interest income for the group has only slipped by 1%, and in this environment, I think that is a very significant point. And I think we're going to continue to offset this in the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add to that, with regard to the corporate assets that have been explained by &#xC1;ngel, as you can see, if we look at the third quarter in comparison with the second quarter, it drops by about 150 million quarter-on-quarter. And this can be explained by two basic factors. First of all, the increase in costs of all kinds of wholesale funding, both in short, mid and long-term, which accounts for a 90 million drop in our margin and about 60% of this is associated with the greater cost of mid to long-term issues. And about 40% is associated to the increase in short-term interest rates, as the LIBOR has increased by 30 to 40 basis points and this has passed on very quickly to the cost of our funding. And it takes a little bit longer to come to the lending. So this will offset the increase in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>The other impact, see the other 60 million to bring us up to 150 million, which is a lower average balance in asset management, because as you know, we reorganized our portfolio at the end of 2009, because we foresaw a volatility in interest rates in the mid and long-term with regard to sovereign debt in Europe. So we protected the underlying capital gains that we had already made, but this meant that up until June approximately, our portfolio balances were increases to the average balance than we have at the moment, because the portfolio that we bought back to maintain the contribution to the margin and portfolio that we sold forward at the same time.</p>
          <p>So that's part of the 50 million. And the other part, the lower average balance in the euro balance of asset management and the other effect of this 50 million is also the increase in short-term interest rates, which increases the funding cost for the portfolio, and therefore reduces its contribution in margins. And these two effects explain the &#x20AC;150 million impact.</p>
          <p>Coming on with the net interest income and funding, two questions, one from UBS, he is delighted to see the reduction by &#x20AC;10 billion quarter-by-quarter in our exposure to financial markets and the use of the interbank funds. So the question is, can we project this forward over the coming quarters, this reduction in our exposure?</p>
          <p>Creelan-Sandford asks about the causes for the fall in return from customer loans quarter to &#x2013; compared with quarter. And he asked about the possibility that we can see a maybe repricing &#x2013; doing a repricing in the coming months or coming quarters, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to this reduction, you talk about in customer funds and the returns we get. And that's not just to do with what's happening on the interbank market. There are a whole lot of other businesses that come into play here.</p>
          <p>We do a lot of things with different central banks. And there are whole of lot of other matters which aren't directly associated to the interbank market. But as our COO said in the presentation, this quarter, we've seen improvement in the structure of our balance sheet, growing strongly in deposits throughout the group, with an increase mid to long-term issues in the group as a whole. We've also had very interesting issues made in America through our subsidiaries there.</p>
          <p>And so that's generating an improvement in the structure of our balance sheet funding. I think is very likely that we will continue to see further improvement, because you know what's happening in the deposits in our franchise, in our different franchisees, definitely getting better. We've got excellent credit rating. We are one of the four only banks with AA rating at the moment from Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
          <p>And in general, we can expect to continue things to move along in this way, but the structure of the balance sheet that we have in the bank with the weighting of deposits and the long-term wholesale funding that we have, means that our capital situation in the group is enviable than most of our peers. So there is not much that we can do to improve something that's already very well structured.</p>
          <p>And then the return on customers loans, that has gone down, you say. I presume you are talking about Spain, where it has, yes. And in Spain, we shouldn't forget, we're seeing the repricing of our back book up to current levels, so in the mortgages are being repriced and so that's hiding the performance that we're getting in our loan book as a whole, which is improving in loans that aren't mortgages, in SMEs and in institutional customers as well, and so the process that we're seeing meant that &#x2013; let's see.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2008 to the beginning of 2009, we had rates at about 4.5% something and now, the APRs would be more like 150. So a lot of the re-pricing has taken place and our floors are coming into effect. So at the moment, the average return is 275.</p>
          <p>On the mortgage book and it has gone down, because we haven't seen repricing there and the spread with the new to the old business is about 100 basis points and that's pretty good. But we haven't seen such intense repricing in mortgages as we have in other kinds of lending. So the total return on assets has gone down, despite the fact that spreads on our loan book as a whole have improved. I mean, actually, mortgages as well, we're originating now at 80, 85 basis points in the past, which is now coming out of maybe 100 basis points on the new mortgage business. But when we're talking about wholesale banking, we've got questions about our strategy in terms of expanding our wholesale banking business.</p>
          <p>In the press, we've seen some news concerning this as they are not very accurate. We have a wholesale franchise that is not going to &#x2013; our approach is not going to change. This is levered on customers. This means we are not going to increase either the economic capital that we are consuming at the moment and we are going to continue to work on our customer franchises that we have in the group. We are going to develop simpler products and more transparent products for customers with less capital consumption that we'll have will be less levered on trading and this will have the effect that you know. We are talking about a staff of about 3,000 people who work in wholesale banking of the 105,000 that we have in the group as a whole.</p>
          <p>In the coming years we are going to, in order to operate in places where we don't have a large footprint, we are going to take on more people. We haven't increased our activity in the United States, when we have a franchise, the one we have. So obviously, we need to increase our footprint there to be as on a par with our franchise there. As an example, the kind of activity, the kind of products, will be the kind that we have developed in Europe and I repeat, this will be based very heavily on the fact that there will be a successive creep from trading to even a greater customer franchise than we have seen in the past.</p>
          <p>And as Manuel said before, this quarter or the year-to-date, we've seen an increase of over 3% in the revenues from customer franchises. And I think this is the focus that we are going to continue to follow. So, we are not going to take on any greater risk. We're not going to consume any greater &#x2013; any more capital, especially with the new Bar regulations that we are going to see. Would you like to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. I think the message here is focused. Our wholesale business is focused entirely on the customer, as &#xC1;ngel has said. And what we intend to do, our strategy is to develop new products to meet the demands of our customers, but we are not talking about ambitions in wholesale banking and investment banking of any other kind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next block of questions with regard to dividends. There are three questions here asked by Stanislav Rigoy from BNP Paribas, Daragh Quinn from Nomura, and Martha Sanchez, concerning the expectations for a payout of dividends through 2010 in the light of the earnings for the nine first months. Is there a risk of not paying out a dividend for 2010? Maybe could we think about paying out dividends in shares and the guidance for what the payout could be for 2011 and 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we did say last quarter that we had already reached the floor in the payout of the $0.22 &#x2013; sorry, the $0.42 figure that we had and we'll continue to see that over the next few quarters with the next interim dividends that we will be paying. And that means that we don't have any expectations of reducing the payout or the figure that we have for the dividend for 2010 as a whole.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to next year, well, there, we don't want to give you any guidance. As you know, we don't give you guidance on this, because we're focusing on what we're doing. We want to maintain the $0.42 dividend and it's possible that it might go up in 2011. That's possible. And we might use shares to pay the dividend. We haven't said we wouldn't, but we haven't said we would.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, another block has to do with strategy and M&amp;A. There are four or five questions here from four different &#x2013; no, five analysts but they have a common denominator. Under what condition would we invest in this Turkish bank? And would we need to issue any further capital? Or would it be possible to sell off perhaps the Telef&#xF3;nica shares that we have on the balance sheet? What kind of return would be expected from this investment and under what conditions would you accept this bank? Would you demand a certain level of control? And how much capital would be consumed if this investment were to be made in this Turkish bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not going to talk about things that haven't happened yet, or about things that we don't know whether they are going to happen or not. So the first thing I would like to refer to is the important events that we reported last year, which is as we &#x2013; last week, filing an important event for the potential purchase of a stake in this bank, and we left it there.</p>
          <p>What I would like to add to that in answer to some other questions that have been put. What we're looking for in the case of an investment, I'm talking about any investment, I am not referring specifically to this one. We don't want to dilute the earnings &#x2013; the shares for the shareholders and we want to look at the return has to be greater than the capital cost and three, I would repeat what we have said in previous quarters that we would need to follow a path so that we can control any bank we get into. So these are the three things we would &#x2013; steps we would follow.</p>
          <p>Retail business is going to be critical in the future and we need to see potential for growth in the country, above average growth. But I would repeat, that's all I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Future prospects, I have three questions here from Andrea Filtri, Mediobanca and for Eventis relating to the restructuring and how do we consider the restructuring of savings banks in the short-term? The fall in net interest income could accelerate. Do you think this is going to accelerate the restructuring of the savings banks? Do you think the profit is going to inject more funds into the savings bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've had news about the restructuring that's been going on amongst the savings banks mainly up to June and at the end of October, we are presenting our quarterly results and we don't see that many changes in the savings banks. So if we can say anything, it's that maybe things aren't going as fast as we might have liked, insofar as we can see and what does that mean?</p>
          <p>Well, that means that we can expect there to be certain competitive pressure on the market over the next few quarters. What do we expect? We expect that before the end of the year the reorganization should be done throughout the industry, so that we can see a real impact in efficiency. So that in 2011, we will have a much more competitive and level playing field in the domestic market, with things becoming more normalized. But they will have to put into practice what they're been saying that they're going to do for a long time, as soon as possible as well.</p>
          <p>And meanwhile, the gain in market share that we were talking about today in the presentation, in the new level playing field could be expected to improve. So if we look at the percentage points that we're expecting to gain over the next few months or years, it should start to materialize and we hope as soon as possible and definitely by the beginning of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there are three final questions. Alejandro Ruyra from Kepler asks about if we're expecting extraordinary provisions to be made in the last quarter of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've seen the earnings or the situation for the 10 months with three quarters plus October, which we're practically at the end of October now. So, we know exactly where we are. We know what the situation is. So, I think we can clearly say that between now and the end of the year, as I said before, when I was asking your question about the future performance of credit quality ratios, we are &#x2013; we know exactly what's going on with the NPA ratio, and the provisions that we're going to make between now and the end of the year. So, there not can be any extraordinarily provisioning between now and the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jaime Becerril from Redburn. As with regard to the recent sentence from the court in Seville with regard to mortgage flows, and the question is, what impact would you expect in 2010, 2011, or do you think there is not going to be any impact? And maybe the mortgage and lending figures has bottomed out in BBVA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we should perhaps make certain things clear. We're talking about legal matters and we're talking about abusive pricing and floor. And what we want to make very clear is that our average floor on our mortgages is 2.75%, and if this is an abusive condition, if you look at the cost of funding that we have in the market, including the funding from public institutions, in that case, I think you have to say that they're using the wrong wording in the ruling. It's the feel anyway before a higher instance and the Bank of Spain went to the Senate for a special hearing and gave a report which shows that really this clause is not abusive and it's absolutely legal.  And so we are not expecting to have negative impact on our business. Manuel, I don't know if you want to say anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I just wanted to add since it was part of the question that at the moment, we've got 70% of our mortgage book with floors and 74% of these floors are activated at the end of the third quarter. I just wanted to say that's exactly what's happening because we are very transparent here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question has -- comes from <mark type="inaudible" /> and it has to do with recent news on foreclosures in the United States. Could that have an impact on us? As we see more foreclosures in the United States, what's the situation for the group at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the assets that have been adjudicated in the United States is a very low figure. Second, as I said in my presentation, we produced our banking business in lending and third, we have not outsourced the management or administration our foreclosures due to not failure to pay. So we are not covered by any of the conditions that we are seeing in some of the major banks in the United States. So the impact will be minimum or inexistent in our case.</p>
          <p>As I said, we do have some more numerical questions, more specific ones which we'll get back to you on, Investor Relations will answer for you. So that is the end of the presentation of the results. So I would just like to thank you for following the presentation of the results for the first nine months of 2010. Thank you very much to everybody. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
