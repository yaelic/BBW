        <plist>
          <p>I think I'll just do the introductions while waiting for our colleagues from Hong Kong to join us. We have here with us our Chairman, Koh Boon Hwee and our CFO Chng Sok Hui this afternoon and welcome again friends from the media to our DBS Second Quarter Results Announcement. We'll be joined shortly by Amy Yip, our CEO of DBS Hong Kong Limited, as well as Chris Cho the CFO there. But I think while waiting for them, we will probably have our Chairman to start off first by saying a few words. So without further ado before we go for a long weekend, I'll kind of get our Chairman Koh Boon Hwee to say a few words here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, welcome and good afternoon. As always, it's a great pleasure to see all of you and this is standing between us and the long weekend. For those of you who are wondering, and I'm sure that many of you are, I want to tell you that our CEO search is progressing well, but for now, you're stuck with me.</p>
          <p>Today we review DBS Group's Q2 2009 results. I will begin the session with the highlights of our performance and then hand you over to Sok Hui, who will walk you through the financials. I basically want to leave you with three key messages. First, Q2 2009 was our best ever quarter in revenue terms. The DBS Group has had an outstanding second quarter, delivering record high quarterly operating revenue of 1.79 billion in spite of the continuing challenges in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Second, and really important for us, the performance was broad based across the various businesses. We used our strong balance sheet to deepen and broaden relationships with our existing customers. On the interest income side, we benefited from improved credit spreads and reduced funding costs. On the fee side there was higher contribution from capital markets related activities and both trading income and investment income also registered increases.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, we are especially pleased with how POSB continues to reach out to the community and re-affirm its position as the people's bank. Together with staff, customers and our business partners, POSB has raised about $350,000 for underprivileged children, and as you know the focus of DBS's activities in charity is on children. POSB has also launched numerous new products and services, including MyHome Fund just this Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Third, we remain disciplined and we remain focused in managing our cost and risks. The actions that we have taken to improve cost efficiency are showing results. Our cost-income ratio for this quarter is down at 35%. Our loan book remained strong and we are seeing an improving trend in NPLs in our core markets. However, our NPLs have risen from 2% to 2.8% as challenges remain in certain sectors like shipping and in the Middle East. On the back of our strong operating performance, we have taken the decision to increase provisions and strengthen our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>I want to close by emphasizing that DBS is a resilient and prudent organization. Although the economic environment has improved, the jury is still out as to the rate and pace of the recovery. We have come through the first half of 2009 with our best ever quarterly revenue, underpinned by broad-based growth across the businesses. Our loan pipeline is healthy and the momentum remains strong. We will remain disciplined and focused in managing our costs and risk.</p>
          <p>And I would like to hand you over now to Sok Hui to walk through the details.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. We reported net profit of 552 million for the second quarter, a 21% increase from the previous quarter. The performance was underpinned by record quarterly revenues and cost discipline which resulted in earnings before allowances reaching a new high of 1.16 billion.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth was broad based. Net interest income benefited from an improvement in net interest margins. Fee income rose from higher capital market activities, while trading and investment income also increased. Continued cost discipline reduced expenses from the previous quarter, bringing the cost-income ratio to 35%, the best level in several years.</p>
          <p>Allowances rose 13% from the previous quarter. This quarter's allowances included 183 million of general allowances to further reinforce the balance sheet. The increase in non-performing loans from 2% in the previous quarter to 2.8% was largely due to corporate exposures, which I will talk about in the later slide. The pace of new NPL formation was otherwise lower than the previous quarter as credit market and general economic pressures eased in our core markets.</p>
          <p>Net interest income rose 3% from the previous quarter to 1.11 billion. This was due to higher average asset volumes and a two-basis point improvement in net interest margins to 2.01%. The improvement was the result of better credit spreads and reduced funding costs, which more than offset the impact of lower yields on interbank assets as market interest rates remained soft.</p>
          <p>We maintained loan volumes during the quarter. However, due to currency translation effects, reported loan volumes fell 2%. There was a moderate underlying increase in consumer loans that was offset by a decline in corporate loans.</p>
          <p>Underlying deposits rose 1%, but were flat after currency translation effects. We continue to gather Singapore and Hong Kong dollars savings and current accounts which was partially offset by a decline in fixed deposits.</p>
          <p>Net fee income rose 13% from the previous quarter to 358 million, mainly as revenues from stockbroking, investment banking and wealth management benefited from stronger capital market activities. Non-markets related fees were maintained. Higher credit card and loan syndication fees were offset by decline in trade and remittances which have posted strong first quarter growth.</p>
          <p>Other non-interest income increased from 269 million in a previous quarter to 322 million.</p>
          <p>Trading income improved 15% from the previous quarter to 172 million from interest rate and foreign exchange activity and from better valuations for the trading portfolio. Investment gains amounted to 138 million compared to 106 million in the pervious quarter.</p>
          <p>Expenses fell 1% from the previous quarter to 631 million as ongoing efforts to improve productivity yielded savings. We continue to manage expenses in core markets and invest prudently in growth markets and in technology improvements.</p>
          <p>Turning to Hong Kong, the figures on the slide incorporate an appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Hong Kong dollar of 4% from the previous quarter and a depreciation of 8% from a year ago. Earnings rose 5% from the previous quarter to the 99 million as an improved credit environment resulted in lower allowances. In local currency terms, earnings were up by 12%. Profit before allowances was stable in local currency terms, but fell by 5% after currency effects.</p>
          <p>In local currency terms, net interest income rose 5%. Interest margins improved three basis points to 1.94% from better prime-HIBOR spreads and loan pricing, partially offset by lower returns on HIBOR linked assets.</p>
          <p>Loans grew 2% in local currency terms from housing loans while deposits rose 3% as we continue to gather savings and current accounts deposits. Non-interest income fell 2% in local currency terms due to a decline in trading gains. This was partially offset by higher fee incomes across most activities including investment banking, stockbroking and wealth management.</p>
          <p>Expenses were 5% higher than the previous quarter in local currency terms with increase due to non-staff costs. Allowances fell 17% from the previous quarter in local currency terms due to lower charges for private banking and corporate customers. NPLs fell from 2.6% in the previous quarter to 2.4% with a better credit environment.</p>
          <p>Non-performing loans rose 25% from the previous quarter to 4.1 billion with NPL ratio increasing from 2% to 2.8%. Most of the NPL increase during the quarter was due to exposures to shipping and Middle East corporates and institutions. Excluding these exposures, new NPL formation was lower than the previous quarter as the economic environment stabilized, with a notable improvement in Hong Kong and China.</p>
          <p>Our classification of NPLs continue to be conservative. The proportion of non-performing assets still current in principal and interest was 38% compared to 34% in the previous quarter. The cumulative allowances we have set aside, which amount to 81% of non-performing assets and 119%, if collateral is considered, are prudent and in excess of expected losses. We have also been conservative in setting aside high general allowances in recent quarters.</p>
          <p>We continue to be well-capitalized with Tier 1 of 12.6% little change from the previous quarter. Total capital adequacy ratio fell slightly to 16.2% as Tier 2 declined with amortization of some sub-debt instruments.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining our dividend at $0.14 per share this quarter. We'll continue to pay sustainable dividends in line with our long-term growth. Based on yesterday's closing share price, DBS shares give investors an annualized dividend yield of 4.2%.</p>
          <p>The strong first half operating performance we achieved against the backdrop of an uncertain economic environment reflects the strength of our franchise and the debt of our customer relationships. It is also the result of assets to manage costs and improve productivity. For the coming quarters, we will continue to focus on customers, cost discipline and risk management.</p>
          <p>While performing loans increase this quarter, there are signs that credit pressures are moderating, with improving economic conditions and business confidence in our core markets. We have built up ample allowances to ensure against further risk ahead. With a strong balance sheet, and the depth of our franchise, we remain well position to capture growth opportunities for weathering uncertainties. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sok Hui. We will now commence the Q&amp;A portion of our results briefing. As always please state your name and the publication that you represent before you ask your question. Could you have the first question please? Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the question on everyone's mind of course is the issue of CEO succession. I wonder if you could describe for me the program that you've put in place to look for a permanent CEO. And I also wanted to ask if there's a possibility that &#x2013; Chairman Koh that you would take the role? And when would these decisions be announced? I'd like to understand sort of a timeline and a process? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have indicated when we started that the timeline for a global search, which is what we are doing, is approximately three to six months to the identification of a candidate. So having started the process in April, we are actually very much on track.</p>
          <p>The second question that you asked was asked before and I have the same response, why would you want to be CEO when you can be the Chairman?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you employing &#x2013; what type of methods are you looking for the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a search going on that is being conducted globally. Obviously it starts with a wide scan of candidates, we narrow the list down and then there is a whole process of interviews being conducted by the search committee, reference checks after that and we will eventually narrow it to a single person.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you using agencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I had another question. I wondered if you could sort of give some light, shed some light on the consumer banking climate where you see softness in the market and what the medium-term forecast for the consumer industry is.</p>
          <p>I also had a second question, which is related to your cost of income. It seems to have come down quite considerably. I wonder what you would attribute that to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, consumer banking is still a very important business to us. In the last quarter and continuing till right now, the mortgage market is quite strong, and we are aggressively growing our loan books in that area. Having said that, generally speaking rates are down and people are little bit more conservative, but I think with the economy recovering it's actually looking pretty good.</p>
          <p>And in terms of our cost-income ratio it is a function of managing our costs. When I use the word cost I really mean it across the Board. We have made savings in technology and operations. We have made savings in real estate. We have also made savings in managing our head count cost. And I think the entire team has done a superb job of looking at our costs across the Board.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We realize that in the last few months the housing market has been relatively strong, but from the nature of the buyers there are mostly people who actually intend to live in it. And the segment that is particularly strong, or what we would probably consider the upgrading market. So because it's going to be owner occupied, we are not particularly concern that it is a grossly overhitting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Conrad I think you had a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Conrad from the Business Times. Could you tell us, have you found a CEO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, if we have found him, we would have told you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question sir. What's the average loan-to-value ratio for your housing loans at the moment across your housing loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rajan you want to take the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty much what we had said last time; it is still remaining to be determined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Gula I think you had a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Yes I have one &#x2013; couple of questions. First one is in the last quarter you said you took market share in loan market, but you didn't say that this round. Did you take market share in 2Q? That's one question? And if so what is your market share?</p>
          <p>And also could you give us an idea of the trend of the net interest margins? Some analysts have been saying that it could come under pressure in the second half. Just wondered if it's &#x2013; if that's what you're experiencing?</p>
          <p>And yes, the last question is, are you looking internally for a CEO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the last question and have Sok Hui take the first two. When we do a global search, we look across the board. Actually we've said all this before, somehow today it doesn't seem as though you believe me.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>That doesn't even make it to our list of criteria. We are in &#x2013; completely impartial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Any questions from this side of the room?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So your question on the loan...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Loan market share...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's actually registered in I guess the without taking into account currency effect, it was flat. But I can tell you in Sing dollar terms, we actually grew quite strongly. Sing dollar loans if you look at our performance summary, there's been strong growth. 21%.</p>
          <p>Net interest margins, I think we usually communicate there are really two variables that drive the NIM. One is of course credit spread which we have seen some stability. I think the low interbank environment, if it continues to the next quarter would mean that we would end the NIM roughly around this quarter's level. But if &#x2013; should there be sort of an upturn in interest rates then I think we expect to see an improvement in them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sai you had a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my question is on the non-performing loan ratio. The NPL rate, it's gone up faster than the other two banks. You've described obviously you're taking some general provision and stuff. Could you just give color on why it has gone up so sharply compared to the other banks?</p>
          <p>And secondly, what's the outlook for the NPL rate? When do you think it will peak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This quarter's NPL ratio went up from 2% to 2.8%. And we've communicated in our release that it's actually due to exposures to the shipping sector as well as to Middle East market. So this is exceptional and at the &#x2013; underlying performance in our core markets have actually seen an improvement in terms of NPLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are signs that the credit pressures have actually eased. So we are actually comfortable in our exposures to the core markets.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, I'm James from CNBC, Asia. I would just like to ask, can you specify what proportion of your business actually comes from Asia? How do you see the Asian business environment in the coming quarters? And what's your strategy for expanding this part of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, almost all of our business comes from Asia. I would say that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, let me be clear. I understand that most of your &#x2013; 90% of your earnings come from Singapore and Hong Kong. I'm talking outside Singapore, Hong Kong, China and the rest of Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think in Singapore and Hong Kong together accounts for approximately 80%? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>80 plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 80-plus% and the rest comes from &#x2013; the bulk of the rest comes from Asia.</p>
          <p>As far as we are concerned, I think Asia is in better shape economically than the rest of the world. The recovery actually has been a little bit more rapid than we originally anticipated. For most of our customers, I would say that liquidity and access to financing is probably not a concern today. As a matter of fact with the improving economy, there is some competition beginning to appear in terms of loans, accessibility to loans. So I guess, I can't tell you that life is back to normal but it certainly is very different from three to six months ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Again from a Hong Kong point of view we've really been looking at growing our franchise by refocusing on the basics which is looking at savings, looking at mortgages in Taiwan, which is something that we had acquired recently. Last year we've again started to focus our effort in growing again savings and mortgages, which is something that we've have done. In Indonesia we continue to grow on our treasures and our affluent market segment. So across Asia, you are actually seeing us starting to become more penetrated into the markets that we are looking at. The two bigger markets of India and China, these will take longer for us to develop, but plans are well in place.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Francis from <mark type="inaudible" />. Do you agree with the general consensus that the worst just might be over and we might be seeing an upturn coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've actually already seen that, the upturn. I guess, we are cautious about the continuing pace, but I think for most of the countries in Asia the worst may probably be over.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patricia, Dow Jones. When you talk about the NPLs you mentioned the core markets, things are improving. The Middle East, do you see more risk coming from there or other markets that you guys have that could push drag the ratio higher short-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the NPL situation we have always been prudent in early identification of NPLs. So you'll find that in our NPL, what we count as NPL, a large amount is still actually performing. They're current in terms of their principal as well as interest repayment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In fact I think it was covered in Sok Hui's presentation that 38% of what we consider NPLs are still current.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have an early identification process. We put aside an appropriate amount of specific provisions that we assess to be adequate. So we'll continue with that process. There has been no change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you see that these things are going to deteriorate, that's why you look forward &#x2013; you you look ahead, right? So you expect Middle East situation to deteriorate <mark type="inaudible" /> some corporate lending there should see some  troubles in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This quarter's NPL to the Middle East is to a few exposures. So we can't generalize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's already in that. That accounted for the 2% to 2.8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think as Sok Hui mentioned, it is to very selected exposures, so I think it's not fair to generalize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What industries in the Middle East? Is there a specific industry that's showing more problems there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>My question is there was this interesting speech last night by Dr. Tony Dang saying that now there is an opportunity for Asian banks to basically build their presence and grow more exponentially. I was thinking apart from &#x2013; you've taken loan share from your competitors looking at the data. Any other initiative you have in mind to expand your presence across Asia in the coming months as the upturn is coming?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The upturn is coming. We feel that we still have a tremendous amount of opportunities in our core markets of Singapore and Hong Kong and we have tremendous opportunity in our emerging markets of China, India, Taiwan and Indonesia. I think the upturn can only help us to grow more rapidly in those areas. Do we ever shut out possible opportunities to grow even faster? The answer is no. We will look at it as and when it comes up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it's a variation on see. You took four billion from your investors in December, was it December? Yeah. What have you done with that money?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We keep trying to grow our loan books. We are becoming a lot more aggressive in the consumer banking space as Rajan has indicated, and as I just indicated, we will look at opportunities as they come up. I'm beginning to sound like a broken record.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because you are the only local bank that actually raised such a large amount, I mean that actually raised cash this year &#x2013; end of last year &#x2013; this year. So I just wondered -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is true.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you like me to throw it away? No I'm quite certain that we will &#x2013; I am quite confident that we will put it to good use but we are under no time pressure to do so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd like you to use it more efficiently I think is what she's trying to say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James here again from CNBC Asia. I like to steer away from earnings for just a while. I like to ask in the aftermath of the misselling of structured products, are you confident that there's enough regulatory oversight in place to ensure that this will not happen again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly as a result of the sale of structured products, I think everybody across the entire world has learnt a tremendous amount of lesson. On our part we have internally revamped a lot of our processes. From improving our processes to know our customers better to better match product suitability to customers; to making sure that we communicated appropriately in terms of our summary sheets, in terms of the training of our relationship managers, in terms of introducing a cooling off period, when we have a chance to do so. Clearly all of us have learnt a lesson on this. Can we ever say in any business that nothing will ever happen again? The answer is no, I would not be so bold. But would I do everything in our power to avoid a similar situation? The answer is an absolute yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're saying there's <mark type="inaudible" /> Chairman and CEO; will the new CEO commit to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I doubt if there will be any bank CEO in the world who will not commit to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Perhaps the last one or two questions, anyone? Conrad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple more questions. You mentioned that, you are trying to grow your loan book aggressively in consumer banking. That's actually &#x2013; maybe if you could tell us a bit more about what you are doing with &#x2013; loans growth quarter-on-quarter was flat in Sing dollar terms. But given what you've said about the improving trends in NPLs and all that, is this something that you're going to be more aggressive in, in the coming months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, I think the last couple of quarters you also have to take into account the general mood of the economy, when businesses were being more conservative. The loan demand was actually down in many places, but I think with the change in economic environment, with the change in sentiment, I suspect that the environment will be better. You see that already I suppose across not just Singapore, but in Hong Kong as well in the housing market. We hope that it continues at a measured pace. But that's just one example. Businesses too, I think are moving away from the gloom and doom scenario of not knowing what to produce to more consistent production levels. So I think that's optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just have one more question, one conspicuous absence in your geographical footprint in Asia is Malaysia. Can you tell us how you view that as a banking market given the liberalization measures that were announced earlier this year by the government?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We follow it with a great deal of interest, because Malaysia is a market that is very important to us. We are in Malaysia in the investment banking side, in terms of our joint venture with the Hwang-DBS. Of course, if it is possible for us to enter Malaysia in commercial banking we will love nothing better. So we watch the changes in regulations as carefully as you do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. I think on that note, thank you very much for coming this afternoon. And we will now adjourn. Thank you everybody.</p>
