          <p>I would like to welcome you all to the Telephone Conference. I will start our presentation, a lot by Fred Rystedt and Carl-Johan Granvik. And I will then talk with &#x2013; some comments on our strategy in growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>First of all, on the slides you can see in front of you, we have a snapshot of the results, you already saw it.  I like this slide -- income up, expenses down, losses down, operating profit up, risk-adjusted profit up, and return on equity up. It's a good starter and a favorite slide I have these days.</p>
          <p>The next one underlines the fact that we have an extremely stable development during the period. Income is up and loan losses are up but, in general, the income increase a compensated word, which also means that we have one of the lowest volatilities in our operating profit over those three years of more or less any bank that we have seen.  It means that we, its possible for us to continue to deliver under long-term targets.</p>
          <p>We still have the risk-adjusted profit ahead of the long-term target of doubling in seven years and which you can see on the slide where we are just ahead of the target. It was a message to what we met the target that we are doing that it was meant to be over full cycle, securing the cycle we could be below, but over the full period we would be able to generate sufficient growth with low risk in order to be, to meet the target, and that is actually where we are.</p>
          <p>As always, we're strong and we're one of the two banks and that has generated positive total return during the full period. This means that we can repeat more or less our outlook and we still expect the microeconomic recovery to continue in this world in that way.  It is somewhat fashioned and some uncertainties but you think it has been strengthened and the uncertainties are still out there. We see some of them actually sending out right now on the severance that issue that we think that recoveries be strong.</p>
          <p>After all, it is going to be brought in line with last year including the tax from our initiatives. And then, as we've said it three months ago, the risk adjusted profit is expected to be lower mainly due to lower income in Treasury growth and equities developments and position taking and in Markets which has an exceptionally strong year last year.</p>
          <p>We're now saying that loan losses are likely to be lower in 2010 than 2009 and the main reason is, of course, that the credit quality continues to stabilize in line and with the macroeconomic recovery previously.</p>
          <p>I will now turnover to Fredrik who will go through the numbers <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. You can see our income statement on slide eight.  And as you can see, we increased the total income by 7%, total expenses by minus 5% and operating profit was up 48%. One important measure for us is also risk-adjusted profit increasing 27% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Of course, there has been impact relating to currencies, primarily the Swedish and Norwegian krona, and you can see on slide nine the effect from that. And if you look at the reported 7% operating income, excluding currency for incomparable currencies, the increase is 4% and the operating expense is minus 7 instead of the reporting minus 5.</p>
          <p>The underlying report &#x2013; underlying expenses excluding also restructuring in minus 2% in the quarter. I go into the different details of the income statement, according to slide 10, we can see that the net interest income is down by 5% from the high levels we had and there are a couple reasons for this.</p>
          <p>Primarily, the first and foremost, it has to do, of course, with the low interest rate levels making the cost of income very, very low. There is also the other two components, a smaller component from the day count impact but also, as expected, a decrease in net interest income from Group Treasury coming both from the average higher funding cost, but more so from lower return from the liquidity buffer, both of them expected. I will come back to it.</p>
          <p>The total lending was positive and so were also margins. We increased in the Nordic arena margins from the corporate side on all markets and on the household side it's stable or slightly increasing. So the good margin story also in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, just turn the volume, you will see that on slide 11. You can see that the trend that was initiated in primarily December of 2009, corporate lending has continued to grow on the Nordic market. We have a slight decline in the European markets, mainly related to Russia and Poland. Again, some very high levels in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the household lending continues to grow throughout the Group, although at a slightly slower pace than previously. Deposit base is increasing on the household side and a slight decrease of high levels in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 12, you can see a little bit the impact here and clearly the positive volume indication from the &#x2013; both the corporates and the household lending volumes amount to a total of about &#x20AC;12 million. We also have a positive impact &#x2013; a net positive impact now from margin, which is the first time in quite some time that lending margin is actually contributing more than the loss we have on the deposit margin. So a healthy upturn on the corporate margins and also household lending margins.</p>
          <p>We have negative impact from lower return on allocated capital in the Nordic business, contributing to a slight decline for Nordic banking of 48 million and, as I already talked about, we also have a negative impact in Group Treasury. We have received many questions relating to the interest rate sensitivity, of course, given the fact that the expectancy over &#x2013; in the foreseeable future is of course the interest rate will rise, and we have made an attempt to show that on slide 13.</p>
          <p>And, of course, previously we have reported only the static structure interest income risk. Given certain assumptions as what would happen to margins for transactional and savings account, one could also estimate an approximate impact on the net interest income also taking those margin shifts into account. And you will see that, on the table on slide 13, that we estimate that impact with those assumptions that we have to approximately 450 million.</p>
          <p>Of course, we also have some negative impact in the net results from items at fair value. Those will shift depending on the actual position that the bank currently holds. But an approximate situation or a static &#x2013; static point of time is approximately a negative 100, bringing the 100 points upside to approximately &#x20AC;350 million, again using the assumptions that we have made.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14 and the net fee and commission income and you can see that is up by 3% from an already very strong quarter Q4 last year.  And asset management commissions is up by 6%, lending commissions by 8 and payment commissions up by 7%.</p>
          <p>If you turn to the next slide, you can see that a substantial portion of this increase naturally already comes from continued increase in assets under management now reaching its highest level ever, at 169 billion, up by 7% in the quarter. We have, as we also had in Q4, Q3, and Q2, very, very strong inflow numbers at 3.1 billion and one key thing for us, of course, is that we have continued to take market share in assets under management.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 16 and the risk management part, we've had a good quarter with the total result, license at fair value at 548 million.  That, of course, compares to the much better to the level in the fourth quarter. You must remember &#x2013; you may remember that we had a weak performance in Q4 in Treasury and this is now become a strong performance in Q1, and a large part of that shift is relating to Treasury. But it is also fair to say that the underlying corporate demand for fixed income and our fixed product is stabilizing and it's also on a generally high level.</p>
          <p>And there is a high demand for credit bonds from institutional clients; and, of course, we have taken a big share of that market. Life &amp; Pension products also continued to perform very well.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses, the underlying expenses as I mentioned initially are down by 2%. If I adjust the restructuring charges and, of course, also the exchange rate, and the underlying staff costs are up by about 1% in the quarter. Cost income ratio has improved from 56 to 51% in the quarter, and the number of employees is up 130 people in the quarter, in line with our growth initiatives that we launched early in the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to risk weighted assets, the increase is 4.5%, mainly driven by corporate lending growth. Some increase in markets and operational risks. We have some FX effects in risk weighted assets. But one thing that, Carl-Johan will talk about some more in just few minutes, the rate in migration is clearly slowing down bringing about 1% to the risk weighted assets in the quarter and the risk weights are largely unchanged.</p>
          <p>The capital ratios are, as expected, level to the core Tier 1 ratio at 10.1%, significantly about our capital policy, and that also goes for the Tier 1 ratio; it's 11.2%. You can see on the slide of the bottom table on slide 19, where the main impacts are and, of course, it is important to note that this FX impact that we see there on the growth impact of approximately 0.15 each of them.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to just touch upon a few words on the funding and liquidity position. As you can see, we have kept a high pace in our long-term funding operation, and we have done a significant number of deals at very attractive levels throughout the quarter. And one of the consequences of this is that that we have expanded our long-term portion of wholesale funding further, now reaching 69% of the total funding.</p>
          <p>We have also increased the maturity profile of the entire portfolio and extended the average maturity. And as you can see, the liquidity box still remains at high level of close to $50 billion.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I leave over to Carl-Johan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. Fredrik already commented on the lending growth, regarding the compositional lending book, there was change in the quarter. We still have the same 55% including the public sector in the corporate part leaving 45 for household area, the majority of that being mortgage loans.</p>
          <p>Also in industrial taxes, no change, and commercial real estate is the biggest taxer there by 7% of total group, shipping and offshore some 4%, and the Baltic countries a bit short of 3%, as we have learned before.</p>
          <p>The next &#x2013; page 23, we look at the current situation which has improved. You see that we have a deduction in both net and gross loan provisions for the quarter lending &#x2013; ending at 37 basis points, down from 52 in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>And also that 11 basis points are actually still collected provisions in money terms &#x20AC;80 million. Also significantly down in the Baltic countries from 338 basis points to 166 at half on the level.</p>
          <p>And other areas that we sold over lower attritions for in their market were Sweden, and there were no charges for the Danish guarantee scheme in the quarter.  Obviously, somewhat helping taking down the over 11.</p>
          <p>Still the same trend number or smaller companies where we had provisions, no large single exposures. Impaired loans continue to increase, but still at a quarter-by-quarter lower in pace, now 4% taking the exchange rate into account.  53% of our impaired loans are still performing, which indicates early provisioning for potential problems. And we also have a big part of our provisioning in collective allowances, 38% or almost 1.921 billion to be exact.</p>
          <p>Those &#x2013; we chose to still increase those even if you can see an overall improvement in the book because this was still some rate immigration which we will comment on soon. In the Baltic countries, we continue with proactive risk management, net losses came down as I told you.  Gross impaired loans though was slightly up.  The main reason for that was technical impairment of two single exposures where we have none or very small actual provisions, but where the actual performance for the company was not up to standard.</p>
          <p>When we compare our own position with the market, you still see the same difference in the quarter that we have roughly half of the market, past due lending also in Q1 which were in the figures are missing both for the comparison.</p>
          <p>And one of the reasons for that is that we have higher proportion of lower risk areas like state municipalities, Nordics and large corporates, which still are performing, I would say, on a Nordic level.</p>
          <p>Finally, the rate migration as predicted alluded to, we can still see more down-rated customers than up-rated, but the situation is leveled out and the impact on Nordea was only 1% in this quarter. I think it's fair to expect that till Q2, we'll have a down-rated excess trend.  The reason being that a lot of the smaller companies who report figures that are still not showing a full recovery from the macroeconomic problems.</p>
          <p>So I leave my comments there and back to Christian.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>I will give a few comments on the status of the growth strategy and just a few slides to remind you of the message three months ago. We had the profitable organic growth strategy since December 2006. During 2009, we went to middle of road, because of the uncertainties.  And now, we have resumed the growth.  We call it prudent growth because we carefully want to navigate between the risks and the opportunities out there.</p>
          <p>We have economic recovery, but it is fragile and <mark type="inaudible" />.  So we go to the next level of strategy.  Our vision is same, but it's the better, more precise strategy, and it's based on our much stronger position, and then it's the next generation of initiatives.  And we launched the nine initiatives; six of them are growth initiative, three are efficiency and foundation initiatives. The main reason for doing this is, of course that they will drive us toward achieving our long-term growth of doubling the initiatives across the coming several years.</p>
          <p>A few comments as to the progress now we're started, on track, it looks good.  The future distribution activity, which is the biggest one, is well underway. We have some conformed 10 branches to the new branch format, and we are running another 60 branches in new pilot to make sure that the details of the operations are optimized. And we already now see that we increased the number of advisory meetings in new format, which was the target, and we also increased the time spent on customers so everything looks like this would able to achieve a target. We can also see the number of new customers which keeps being a very steady inflow slow, around 37,000 Gold and Private Banking customers.</p>
          <p>Growth in Finland is on track.  We are recruiting advisors and specialist and we see the income going up and we clearly see signs that we are on track here as well.</p>
          <p>Corporate Merchant Banking Sweden is clearly on track. We see increased share of wallet on the biggest corporates.  We also won cash management mandates, and we have increased revenues and we're ending with that.</p>
          <p>Growth in Poland is preparing well and we're ready to open, and we will open between 40 and 50 braches towards the end of the year, and then resume the pace of opening we did previously with approximately one new branch per week which is the target, which gradually generate a position in Poland which looks very favorably with strong underlining market and with very low risk because we are targeting the other segments.</p>
          <p>And on the efficiency areas, it's worth mentioning that we have renewed the IT contract with IBM in completely new shape and form, much more flexibility and much more efficient, and we will able to carve out more efficiency gains from that contract and secure a stronger foundation.  And the lean IT purchase is also proceeding exactly as we planned.  So, putting it altogether, I would say we are clearly on track, and we will stay very focused on actually delivering on these, but it will, of course, be over the next few years if that would happen.</p>
          <p>So the key message is today:  income up, expenses down, loan loads down and operating up, risk-adjusted profit is up, and we are track.  And this very positive trend on the customer side, we have more customer meetings, we do more business with our customers, and we see volumes up.  We get more new customers and thereby the underling development in the business is positive.  And we stay focused on executing on the growth initiatives.</p>

          <p>We will now move to our first question which comes from Chintan Joshi from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I have got a few questions.  Firstly, on NII, if on slide number 12, you could breakdown the 70 million number that is there, which highlights the drop in NII because of lower return of allocated capital FX effects and others. If you could just tell us the various components and what's happening there? Then on NII on the SIIR that you've disclosed, I would like to ask you if this representative of what would happen actually. As in, do you see this as fairly representative of how Nordea's NII would increase for the next year?</p>
          <p>The other question I had was on your outlook statement has turned positive now on credit outlook.</p>
          <p>Back in February, you were little bit more cautious, and I wanted to know what changes you are seeing between February and today. If remember correctly on the capital markets day also there was no update of the outlook statement. I just want to know how your thinking has changed.</p>
          <p>Another detailed question around impaired loans, if on slide 24, you could break down the impaired loans by geography that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And finally, a topical question, if you could just give us your exposure both to public and private sector in Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with the first question, the FX effects on net interest income is approximately 40 roughly 40 million. The lower return on allocated capital approximately 40 million as well that we have some positive issues. If you go to the interest rate sensitivity, your question was how we have calculated that, was that the understanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to know if it is representative number, as in if we should be thinking that this your real sensitivity or is it a statistical number that, I mean, that reports our MIS produces?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's our ambition to show something that we believe is a representative number, of course, one lead I think if one could one is, of course, that we have lost about 1 billion or 1.1 billion, in that order of magnitude on the downside when interest rates have fallen. So, of course, if you look at the magnitude of the fall and you take this 450 million you will get to a similar number. But of course, these numbers are approximate or a estimate, I should say, because we are making assumptions here as to the level of margin we are actually able to maintain as interest rates increase.</p>
          <p>So let me take a couple of examples, if you take a statement accounts for an individual, the margin on those savings are, savings accounts now are very, very low. So, of course, naturally as interest rates increase, we would seek to increase our margin and, of course, that becomes very easy for the first 50 or 100 basis points and, of course, tougher thereafter. So that's one assumption we're making that we are able to keep a fairly significant portion of the retail savings.</p>
          <p>Another assumption we're making in terms of the retail transaction is we're able to keep most of the margin. While on the corporate side, it's probably difficult to maintain that kind of share. So there are assumptions around it. We're just trying to here give our best estimate on the impact on net interest income and, of course, it's just that estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The outlook on the loan office?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we said early part of the year that recovery still looks fragile and certainly nobody can give any guarantee for the speed of recovery, but there have been positive signs throughout the quarter. We can also see clearly in our own books.  The first quarter came in with significantly lower losses than for the full year and, therefore, we say it is likely that for the full year as well we will have lower losses for this year than for last year and that is the constant in that.</p>
          <p>Regarding impaired loans, I think you &#x2013; I simply refer you to our cost book and page 79 that we had divided it in country and in industry. You can see from there that regarding the table on Denmark, number one; Finland, number two; and the rest is pretty well spread between the other countries. So you'll find the full picture there.</p>
          <p>And regarding Greece, we don't comment on the individual exposure to any counterparties.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question, which comes from Nick Davey from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I've got two quick questions, if I may. First, on the funding, if I could look at slide 20, just take you back there, could you flush out, please, your strategy here? &#x20AC;7.4 billion of long-term funding issued in the first quarter. Could you quantify that relative perhaps to how much long-term funding is maturing this year, and what your aspirations are for the rest of the year broadly speaking?</p>
          <p>And the second also on corporate credit demand. I'm sure there are some FX impact in that, but it does look like there is some corporate credit growth in some of your markets. Could you just flush out for us perhaps in any kind of local currency like-for-like comparable basis, what &#x2013; how you view corporate credit growth in each of your Nordic markets and where credit demand is returning? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If I start with funding, of course we are not exposing our funding strategy for the year, of course, for fairly obvious reasons but you can clearly conclude from the increase in the rate of long &#x2013; or the portion of long-term funding that we had very little maturities in the first quarter and generally we have on the long-term end not that much maturities also for this year. So we have extended the long term portion.</p>
          <p>Let me say a couple of words generally on the strategy. First of all, we have strived to maintain a high portion of long-term funding.  We've done that for quite some time, also a reasonably long maturity on the average funding portfolio.  And there are many reasons for doing this, one of the reasons, of course, you always want to maintain flexibility as to the timing of when we are in the markets and, of course, we also believe that it is prudent to actually maintain a solid funding position with a high portion of long-term funding. Now, we have expanded it and, of course, the likely scenario as we go forward in the regulatory environment is that generally long-term funding will increase as a portion of the total funding portfolio.</p>
          <p>Whether it's this much or if it's lower or higher amounts, it's extremely difficult to forecast as you will appreciate given the uncertainty in the regulatory environment, but clearly we've had little redemptions or we have little maturities in Q1. We have a good position for the rest of 2010. So we have here extended our maturity on the long-term portion.  Another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the corporate lending, overall one can say that what we see now is a pick up in demand for working capital still very low in investment level as we can &#x2013; or actually have been forecasting because there is still unutilized capacity in most industries.</p>
          <p>We've seen growth in all the markets but may be strongest in Sweden also helped of course with &#x2013; by the exchange rate but also Finland and Norway had a good growth in corporate. It's well spread, there are utilization of existing lines but there are also new lending coming through and if you add to that the fact that we have been helping a lot of companies to the bond market, meaning that we have been contributing to raising more capital that can been seen on our balance sheet. So from that respect, we are happy to see increasing demand which is good for the economy going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And now we move to our next question from Geoff Dawes from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. Geoff Dawes here from Macquarie. Two questions from myself. The first is that you obviously keep your guidance that risk-adjusted profits at the Group will be down in 2010 due to Treasury and Markets. Can you just give us an idea of whether you are confident of any regions or business areas where you could actually see that going up to offset some of the pressure from Treasury and Markets, so any kind of material movement upwards in pre-provision profits for any areas?</p>
          <p>The second question is, in your release you talk about Danish deposit composition. First of all could you quantify what kind of impact that had on net interest income for the Danish operations? And the second of all, the background behind that competition and whether you see any signs of it lightening up. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me try and answer the first question, I will start with that. And of course, there were many areas that we estimate that will do well. Generally, of course, we don't comment on individual area -- or give forecast or outlooks for any specific area or region or line. But, of course, we are estimating that the underlying customer operation will do fine, and you have actually seen that happening also in Q1. So largely what you are seeing here is -- in the outlook its related to the very significant profit level that saw in Markets throughout last year and particularly in the first three quarters and, of course, the very high contribution on both net interest income and Treasury and also net gain from Treasury last year, and we just anticipate that would be lower.</p>
          <p>Other areas that are improving, of course, is just the rest of the banking operations. So there were many pros so to speak underlying our outlook in general. The second question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Danish deposits composition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually the main portion of our deposit base rests within Finland and the Swedish banking operation, and Denmark is relatively smaller. So one could say that there is on varying degree pressure in all countries, you can say. There is price, of course, price pressure on all countries. So one of the reasons could, of course, be basically the hunt for funding, long-term funding.  And deposit is, of course, key to and perhaps the replacement for long-term funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe it's worth mentioning that the Danish market is unique. We have these 100 smaller banks, and the smaller banks, of course experience that their funding source is dried out 100%. Nobody would fund small banks in the middle of the crisis.  The only alternative was to build up the deposits, so that is, of course, impacted the market somewhat. But I think as it is across the board we see competition but particular in that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Just to clarify, so see overall net interest income down about 10% quarter on quarter in Denmark.  Would it be fair to say that if it was just deposit NII that we're looking at, it would be down more than 10% and you had some sort of offsetting from the lending book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that's correct. I think that the Danish NII is also hit across the fact that the liquidity buffers yield much less. Denmark is rich on deposits and liquidity so it is typically hurt a bit more than some of the other countries. So it is not entirely correct.</p>
          <p>The main issue &#x2013; the separate issues that I think the main impact really if you look at beyond years is mainly the liquidity buffer return and then what &#x2013; how we allocate internally through the capital benefit rate, we allocate return on capital as well, which we have lowered &#x2013; cut at the lower rate. So on our &#x2013; we allocate less on the surplus liquidity on the capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. All very clear. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question, which comes from Per Gronborg from Danske Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning its &#x2013; or good afternoon, its Per Gronborg from Danske. Couple of questions.  The first one also related to the Danish business, you stated the belief but you have not made any additional provisions for the Danish guarantee issue. Can you confirm whether the amount you have provisioned onto now is the 5.8 to paid out from states at year-end and that you haven't taken into account the market value of 7 billion with the bailout fund announced in the March was the expected bail currently to the sector when the scheme running out.</p>
          <p>My second question is related to your Finnish operations and the overall profitability in this is basically the NII. We see NII continuing down in Finland. You're seeing deposit margins being under strong operation. My read from what you're saying is that the first margin will not improve before interest rates are coming up. Your mortgage margins continuing to trend downwards. I assume that too for the contract and the fixed margins they are very difficult to revise.</p>
          <p>How much more are you therefore &#x2013; is it therefore needed that you get your corporate margins up together to return to what I assume would be a longer target for the profitability of the Finnish operations. That was my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can not completely follow your question on the Danish currency scheme in this room.  I have to say that we have provided for the Danish currency and according to what the stability &#x2013; the financial stability part of the side that is up and provided for what was needed and I think more or less banks across the board are doing that. So I don't quite get what should be missing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We're just seeing that a number of the other Danish banks have <mark type="inaudible" /> until now in the first quarter have increased their provision from a base of 5.8 billion to 7 billion, which is latest market value figure coming out this stability front. But you're still provision based on the 5.8.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had made no extra provisions. We have been following the guidelines from the stability front as Christian was saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I got one obvious reason for that is that we don't know what will happen in the next two quarters until the expiration of it in the end of third quarter. So we're not in a position to do anything else we believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question on Finland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Finland, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was a little paused by your question because corporate lending margins have increased and household mortgage lending is a fairly flat margin and a much smaller consumer lending is slightly down.  Of course, yes, corporate deposit margins are low, but of course &#x2013; your question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much more do you need to raise corporate mar &#x2013; or how much more higher do you indicate corporate margins are in Finland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the corporate margins are, of course, increasing in the quarter and they were also increasing Q4 in comparison to Q3. If your questions related to deposits, of course, it is very much linked to the interest rate level and, of course, the euro interest rates remain exceptionally low.  It's a much lower than the actual 1% rates set by division as you know. So, of course, it will be dependant very much on the interest rate development as we go forward during this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And more looking forward, what you have in the pipeline of additional margin increase for the corporate plans in Finland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think, generally speaking, we have talked about this a couple of quarters or many quarters before that &#x2013; and you have seen that happening that Danish margins have increased quarter-by-quarter actually for now seven, I think -- six or seven consecutive quarters. And the two countries which is slowest to adapt is Finland and Sweden in that order, but Denmark and Norway typically are bit quicker in terms of contractual ability to actually reprise. So as we have previously talked about, we expect corporate lending margins to react more positively in Finland than in the other jurisdiction. You can actually see that also in this quarter. So we hope to be able to retain these margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And we have the next question from Fridtjof Berents from Arctic Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. The shipping provisions were up slightly in the quarter, and I wonder if there were any group provision write-backs in the period?  And my second question is related to risk-weighted &#x2013; the average risk-weight, if you can give an indication of how this is divided between the different countries?  I see you had a 61% corporate risk-weight and I wonder how that is spelled in &#x2013; similar in Sweden, Denmark and Norway per country. And my third question is related to the long-term funding, and stating 69% long-term funding, up from 61% in Q4.  And if I look at notes 51 in the annual report, I'm just struggling to see the connections there, but maybe Rodney could get back on this question if this is looking slightly beyond what was meant for this conference call. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the shipping provisions, 90 million for the quarter is slightly lower than we had in the previous quarters or average for the year. And during this quarter, we did not have the collective provisions, while we did have some collective provisions during the quarters in 2009. So because the specific ones have been more or less stable, while we saw no need for increasing the collective provisions at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me try and answer your other questions, the risk-weighted asset distribution. I don't have that in front of me exactly, so I suggest that you get in touch with Rodney. He will be able to provide you with some of the &#x2013; some of those answers. As relates to long-term funding, that's a very good question you have there because it is a matter of definition. And the way we have actually defined the proportion of long-term funding is basically outstanding and netting out any sort of owned possession of our own bonds that we hold in custody so to speak or our own ownership. So the actually underlying issued amount is significantly bigger than the 69%, and we may at any point of time hold our own bond. And what we have basically done in the 69% is we have eliminated our own bonds that we held at a specific time to get to that 69. So that's where the difference is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's the ratio. You said breakdown in &#x2013; sorry, can I just ask what kind of sense do you want it broken down?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On page 18 you give reference to several factors as to the increase in risk-weighted assets, corporate lending growth, market and operational risk, specifically FX effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Could you give some breakdown there because, obviously, a bit disconcerting that you haven't made a better than consensus profit.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your risk, on the risk adjusted basis, its actually detrimental to your core Tier 1 ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you could say, if I just may, yes, as you broadly suggested on page 19, of course, you see the various component impact on the core Tier 1 ratio.  And I said the growth component there is 0.13.  The absolute dominant portion of that 0.13 comes from growth in the corporate lending books, so that's where that comes from. The FX effect is of course, across all or maybe not across all, sorry, the Swedish and of course, Norwegian risk-weighted assets operational but we are using the standardized method so that's actually increasing automatically at year-end and, of course, market risk is a direct consequence of the increased balances, than you have the profit component. On page 35 of the report you will see, of course, all the details relating to amounts, et cetera.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi good afternoon. Sorry, I came a bit late. If my question is answered,  I apologize.  Anyway, its regarding the &#x2013; you said that you have increased the share of long-term funding during the quarter and also in Q4, on which line on page number 12 or slide number 12 would we see this. Is it on the lower return on allocated capital or is it other including group Treasury?</p>
          <p>And the second question is actually regarding your investment strategy for the liquidity buffers. Could you give us an update, what are yours plans regarding that and could we see some changes regarding the investment strategy going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You will see the impact on the line Other, including Group Treasuries, so almost at the bottom. We have, of course, an internal transfer pricing model which is based on &#x2013; and that's also how we calculate margin on relevant reference rate for the short-term interest rate fixing, then, of course, for specific long-term lending for fixed interest rates, we use the actual maturity.  So basically all of it you would find in the Others, including Group Treasury.</p>
          <p>Then if you look at the investment buffer slide, it is naturally that the investment should be in high liquid eligible papers, so bonds or cash, and there are no plans to change that at this time. Of course, there is extremely important events happening with the regulatory aspects coming on screen including current cover bond rules, et cetera that may change that investment strategy over time. So again, it's too premature but we have not really changed that investment strategy at all at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you at the moment, do you have some kind of maturity restriction there or is there no such thing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of course, by definition, liquidity buffer should typically be short in its nature.  But, of course, we have, you can say longer maturities as well, but also in highly tradeable papers that could be sort of sold, generally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry if I still may, what would be the average maturity, just kind of average roughly?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
