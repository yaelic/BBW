          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, September 25th, 2012.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer with Carnival Corporation. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andre, and good morning, everyone. Let me just first comment that Micky Arison and Beth Roberts are in London at the moment so they are joining the call from London. David Bernstein and I are here in Miami.</p>
          <p>I'm going to turn it over to David and let him start with some of the color on the third quarter and talk a little bit about the costs going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this conference call will be forward looking. I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Also, all of my references to revenue and cost metrics will be in local currency unless otherwise noted, as this is the most useful measure of our business trends.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $1.53. The third quarter came in $0.09 above the midpoint of our June guidance. The improvement was driven by better-than-expected pricing on close-in bookings worth $0.07 and lower net cruise costs excluding fuel worth $0.05, both of which were partially offset by changes in fuel and currency, costing a combined $0.03.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at our third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased almost 3%. The North American brands were up 3.4%, while the Europe, Australia and Asian brands &#x2013; or as we call them, our EAA brands &#x2013; were up 2.1%. Our total net revenue yields decreased 5% in the third quarter, of which 3 percentage points were driven by Costa. Excluding Costa, total net revenue yields decreased only 2%, driven by a 4% decline in net ticket revenue yields, offset by a 5% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.</p>
          <p>With respect to the net ticket yields, the North American brands were down 4.8%, driven by declines in Europe and Alaska, while the Caribbean yields held up very well during the quarter. Excluding Costa, our EAA brand net ticket yields were down only 1.8%. For net onboard and other yields, again excluding Costa, the increase was 5%. For net onboard yields alone, the increase was over 3% on both sides of the Atlantic. The rest of the increase was driven by other revenue yields which resulted from a small change in accounting for our Alaskan tour business.</p>
          <p>On the costs side, net cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel, were down 3% versus the prior year. This decline in net cruise cost per ALBD was greater than we expected in our June guidance; however, part of the lower net cruise costs in the third quarter relates to the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarter and not a reduction in expenses for the year. As I said in the past, it is very difficult to estimate the timing for many of our expenses by quarter, and therefore, the best measure of net cruise cost performance is on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>As a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, our consumption per ALBD declined 5.7% this quarter, thus continuing a multiple-year savings trend. Fuel prices in the quarter were down almost 4% versus the prior year, which saved us $0.03; however, this was partially offset by realized losses on fuel derivatives in June and July, which cost us $0.02 per share. Currency rates this quarter versus the prior year cost us $0.09 per share as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>In summary, the third quarter non-GAAP EPS was down $0.16 versus $1.69 per share last year, driven by the lower earnings at Costa. Excluding Costa, our non-GAAP net income would have been up slightly. Excluded from our non-GAAP EPS, but included in our GAAP EPS, were unrealized gains on fuel derivatives of $136 million or $0.17 per share, resulting from marking to market our portfolio of fuel derivatives. These gains almost completely offset the unrealized losses we recorded in the second quarter. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, the mark-to-market balance sheet position on our fuel derivatives was an unrealized gain of $13 million. As we first discussed on last December's call, we believe it is more meaningful to evaluate our earnings performance by excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives until the gains and losses are realized. This appropriately lines up the economic impact of the fuel derivatives with the underlying fuel price risk that it is intended to mitigate.</p>
          <p>In June, we entered into additional zero cost collars for 2014, 2015, and 2016. We now have zero cost collars in place that cover approximately 38% of 2013's consumption, 29% of 2014's consumption, 24% of 2015's consumption, and 15% of 2016's consumption. As I mentioned on the June call, we are comfortable with the level of protection we have through the end of 2013 but we will look to opportunistically increase the other percentages over time.</p>
          <p>Before turning to our 2012 outlook, I wanted to update you on our stock repurchase program. On the last call, I indicated we had restarted the repurchase program. Through the third quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for $67 million. Currently, there is $265 million remaining under the repurchase authorization.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our 2012 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yield outlook as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the costs side, the full-year net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD are forecasted to be down 1% versus the prior year, which is consistent with our June cost guidance. On a final note, I wanted to give you a preliminary view of costs for 2013. As you know, we have had an excellent record of cost control. In fact, over the last four years, from 2008 through 2012, despite inflation we have managed to reduce our net cruise costs, excluding fuel, on a unit basis by about 2.5%.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, our operating companies will continue to do an excellent job, finding ways to reduce costs for 2013. However, there are a few unique factors in 2013 that will be difficult to totally overcome, which will push our unit costs higher. To begin with, we are expecting that Costa will fill their ships in 2013, which will lead to higher food and other unit costs associated with this higher occupancy. This will simply be a reversal of the occupancy-driven unit cost reduction in 2012. In addition, as I have previously indicated, our insurance costs will be higher in 2013. Furthermore, we are anticipating charges relating to a closed multiemployer pension plan for certain British officers and crew. The multiemployer pension plan accounting rules require us to expense our contribution to unplanned deficits when the invoices are received.</p>
          <p>Finally, our increasing emerging market deployment for Japan by Princess, for China by Costa, and for Australia by Carnival Cruise Lines will also increase our costs. These unique factors alone will drive our unit costs up 1.5% to 2%. Therefore, I am expecting overall unit costs, excluding fuel, to be higher in 2013 compared to 2012. Over the next few weeks, we will be visiting each of our operating companies to review their 2013 annual plans. We'll have a much clearer picture on costs for 2013 after those meetings and it will provide detailed guidance on the December call.</p>
          <p>At this point, I will turn the call over to Howard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David, and again, good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover fourth quarter of 2012 and give you some highlights of how 2013 is shaping up, at least for the first half of the year, from a revenue yield standpoint. As we indicated in the press release, on a fleet-wide basis, excluding Costa, at the present time advanced bookings over the next three quarters are behind last year, at slightly lower prices. However, booking patterns have recently strengthened, and the occupancy gap has closed considerably, still not early fully closed but it's closing.</p>
          <p>My comments this morning will focus on booking and pricing patterns for the next three quarters through the first half of 2013. Unless otherwise indicated, my comments on 2013 bookings and pricing will be inclusive of Costa. Not surprisingly, two different pictures are emerging for our North America and EAA markets over the next three quarters. For North American brands, advanced bookings for the next three quarters are about at the same level as last year, at slightly lower ticket prices. I will focus my comments on bookings on first half of 2013 and provide separate color on fourth quarter of 2012 advance bookings later in my comments.</p>
          <p>For the first half of 2013, North American brand pricing is slightly lower than a year ago; however, pricing for the 2012 first half at this time was significantly higher over the prior year, so this year's pricing comparisons are a bit tougher. What is encouraging for North American brands is that in the last six weeks bookings and pricing for the first half of 2013 are running higher year-over-year. So, during the last six weeks, we are catching up on bookings at higher price points, a very positive sign.</p>
          <p>Turning to EAA, as you might expect, the picture for EAA brands on a combined basis is quite different. At this time advanced bookings for the next three quarters, excluding Costa, are at lower levels versus last year and at slightly lower local currency ticket pricing. All my comments about EAA pricing are on a local currency basis. I will also focus my comments on bookings for the first half of 2013 and provide separate color on the fourth quarter advanced bookings for EAA later in my comments.</p>
          <p>For the first half of 2013, the lower year-over-year EAA occupancies are more significant for the Continental European brands, Costa, AIDA, and Ibero, which were more affected by the events of this past January. However, when we fully cycle through January of 2013, we expect to see occupancy comparisons improve. Having said that, we are forecasting that EAA pricing for the first half of 2013 will continue to experience a gradual decline as we build occupancies. Of course, EAA booking patterns are also feeling the effects of the sluggish European economies and we expect that to continue in 2013. A very positive sign is that during the last six weeks EAA bookings have been running significantly higher for the fourth quarter of 2012. So, we are seeing strength in EAA bookings, with the bookings trending to closer in dates.</p>
          <p>On a fleet-wide basis, for the first half of 2013, we are forecasting lower revenue yields in the first quarter and higher yields in the second quarter. The anticipated increase in second quarter yields results from an increase in ticket yields for both our North American and European brands against the easier comparisons to last year's second quarter. As a reminder, until we cycle through January of 2013, the revenue yield picture will be challenging.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that extrapolating the current booking trends, especially for the European brands, is far more challenging this year given the very different booking pattern we are experiencing versus last year. So, take these forecasts as our best estimates of the revenue yield picture for the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>Let me make a few separate comments about Costa. While our business planning for 2013 is still a work in progress, we are expecting that Costa Cruises will swing back to solid profitability in 2013 after a very challenging 2012. Based on consumer research, the brand perception in each of Costa's major markets is gradually improving. So, we are greatly encouraged by the resiliency of the brand. Beginning in the second quarter of 2013, we expect Costa's revenue yields to nicely increase year-over-year against these easier comparisons for the last year's second quarter. We are very pleased with the progress that Costa has made, and our expectation is that Costa's financial performance will continue to improve as we move through 2013.</p>
          <p>In 2013, we have two ships scheduled for delivery, the AIDAstella, or AIDA brand in Germany will be delivered in March of 2013. The very successful AIDA brand is one of our best performing cruise brands in the company, and we congratulate Michael Thamm and Michael Ungerer for the great job they have done in building this very successful franchise in Germany.</p>
          <p>In late May, we take delivery of the Royal Princess, the first new ship for the Princess brand since the Ruby Princess was delivered in late 2008. The new generation Royal Princess has 3,600 plus lower berths with a potential capacity of 4,100 plus passengers. The ship has many innovative new features including a dramatic over-water sea walk, private poolside cabanas and balconies on all of its outside staterooms. Bookings for the Royal Princess, which begins sailing next summer, have been very strong.</p>
          <p>Fleet-wide capacity for 2013 is expected to increase by 3.4%: 4.1% in Q1, 3.2% in the second quarter, 3.8% in Q3, and 2.4% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>North American brands will be up 3.3% and Europe brands are up 2.8%. The Europe brands' growth is in the German market with the addition of the AIDAstella. Capacity for other brands in Continental Europe and the U.K. is actually down slightly in <mark type="ph" /> 2000 (16:19). Australia and Asia capacity is up 8.5% as we continue to drive capacity growth toward emerging cruise markets with the addition of the Costa Atlantica to Costa's Asian fleet in the spring of 2013 and Princess's opening of a new beachhead in the Japanese market with the Sun Princess later in 2013.</p>
          <p>Apart from AIDA, which is our strongest performing brand in Europe, we have slowed our capacity increases for our North American and European brands. Of the seven ships in our current order book, three are for AIDA, two for Princess, one for Costa and one for P&amp;O. The strategy adopted by the company several years ago was to limit capacity growth to two to three ships per year to our fleet, with the addition of new ships to our brands being done on a more selective basis going forward.</p>
          <p>As a result, the Royal Princess delivered in 2013 will be the first ship added to the Princess fleet in five years. And the new P&amp;O ship in the U.K. to be delivered in 2015 is five years after P&amp;O's Azura was delivered in 2010. The strategy is to build ships for those brands with stronger ROIs and which have been successful in taking on additional capacity in their markets without compromising pricing with the existing ships in their fleet.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings guidance for 2012, our guidance for the full year EPS is unchanged with a midpoint of $1.85 and a range of $1.83 to $1.87. Stronger-than-expected revenue yields together with lower costs and expenses is expected to be offset by an increase in fuel costs in the fourth quarter, which is higher than previously &#x2013; we previously forecasted.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the fourth quarter. Fleet-wide capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.2% higher than last year. 3.9% for North America brands, 1.3% for EAA brands. Fleet-wide pricing, and this excludes Costa, is lower than a year ago on slightly lower occupancies. There is very little inventory left to sell in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>North American brands are 43% in the Caribbean, slightly higher than a year ago; 14% in Europe, the same as last year with the balance in a variety of other itineraries. North American brand pricing is lower than last year with similar year-over-year occupancies. Caribbean pricing is flat versus a year ago, and Europe itinerary pricing is lower versus last year. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together is slightly ahead of a year ago.</p>
          <p>EAA pricing in the fourth quarter is lower versus last year at slightly lower occupancies. This excludes Costa. Pricing for Europe cruises, which represent 61% of EAA itineraries, is lower and for all other itineraries taken together, pricing is flat. Costa's occupancies across all itineraries have caught up with last year but at lower prices. We do expect, however, that Costa's year-over-year revenue yield performance in the fourth quarter to improve from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter 2012 earnings guidance is forecasted to come in between $0.07 and $0.11 a share for a midpoint of $0.09. The $0.19 per share swing from the $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 is comprised of lower pricing of $0.22 a share and negative changes in fuel and currency costing $0.08 a share, and that $0.30 a share is offset by lower costs than we previously forecasted to get to the 20 &#x2013; $0.19 downswing.</p>
          <p>For the &#x2013; now, turning to the first quarter of 2013, for the first and second quarter of 2013, my comments include Costa's data for both years. Fleet-wide capacity for the fourth quarter of 2013 is expected to be higher by 4.1%, 3.5% in North America and 5.1% in EAA. At the present time, fleet-wide occupancies are lower than a year ago with pricing slightly lower versus last year.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter for North American brands, they are 65% in the Caribbean, about the same as last year at 13.5%; and Asia-Pacific, up about 2.5 points from last year, and the balance is in various other itineraries. North America brands taken together, occupancies and pricing are slightly lower year-over-year. As reported in our last call, pricing is higher for all but one of the North American brands, but slightly lower in total probably due to itinerary changes and mix for that one brand.</p>
          <p>As previously mentioned, revenue yield comparisons for first quarter 2013 versus first quarter 2012 will be tougher given our strong first quarter North American yield performance in 2012. Caribbean pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, Asia-Pacific pricing is lower. Pricing for all other itineraries taken together is lower. As to EAA brands in the first quarter, EAA is 24% in Europe itineraries versus 19% the prior year, 18% in the Caribbean, down from 22% in the prior year, 24% in Asia-Pacific versus 21% in the prior year, and 18% in South America, which is about the same as last year.</p>
          <p>On a fleet-wide basis, EAA brand occupancies are behind last year, with slightly higher pricing excluding Costa and slightly lower pricing when Costa is included. Although pricing and occupancy for Costa's bookings in Q1 are lower on a year-over-year basis, the year-over-year price differences from the third and fourth quarters of 2012 are narrowing. Caribbean and South America pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, and Europe and Asia-Pacific pricing is lower. On a fleet-wide basis, we are currently expecting that by the time the first quarter closes, revenue yields will come in lower than the strong first quarter of 2012 primarily as the result of the lower EAA brand pricing.</p>
          <p>Turning to the second quarter of 2013, fleet-wide capacity for the second quarter is up 3.2%, 2.3% for North America, 4.5% for EAA brands. At the present time on a fleet-wide basis, local currency pricing is slightly lower than a year ago with occupancies running behind last year. Similar to the first quarter, the second quarter comparisons are against the prior year, which at this time had stronger pricing. Because of the fall-off in bookings beginning last January, we expect second quarter occupancies and pricing to show gradual year-over-year improvement as we fully cycle through January of 2012 &#x2013; I'm sorry, January 2013. However, I should also caution that it is still early in the booking cycle, and you should not read too much into the second quarter booking picture at this time.</p>
          <p>For North American brands, they are 53% in the Caribbean versus 56% last year, 13% in Asia-Pacific versus 10% last year, with the balance in various other itineraries. For North American brands taken together, occupancies and pricing are slightly lower, Caribbean pricing is slightly higher than a year ago, Asia-Pacific pricing is lower than a year ago, prices for all other brand and itineraries taken together are lower than a year ago. EAA brands are 59% in Europe, up from 53% last year with the balance in various other trades. EAA brand pricing for Europe cruises is lower than last year and pricing for all other EAA brand itineraries taken together is flat versus a year ago at lower occupancies.</p>
          <p>Although occupancies and pricing for the second quarter are lower than a year ago, we do expect to see a catch-up when we fully cycle last January's incident. And while it's still early in the second quarter booking cycle, as I mentioned earlier, because of easier comparisons we do expect to see an improvement in revenue yields beginning in the second quarter for both North America and EAA brands by the time the second quarter <mark type="ph" /> closes (24:30).</p>
          <p>So that's how we see the 2000 &#x2013; first half of 2013 shaping up from a revenue standpoint as well as from a cost standpoint, as David pointed out.</p>
          <p>With that, we will turn it back to you, Andre, for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning and good afternoon to Beth and Micky. First question is, Howard, I wonder if you could just touch on for a moment the promotional environment? We know it's been heavy throughout this year but as you are looking towards the first half of 2013, just wondering if you could tell us what that looks like, are you seeing a declining need to stimulate demand through promotions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is &#x2013; Felicia, that's &#x2013; it's a question that covers a number of different brands. But broadly speaking, I think it's fair to say that in order to keep demand going, we have been and will continue to have a fairly heavy spend in promotions and sales. That seems to be driving the business. And if we do it smart and we do it selectively, I think that's fine for us, I think. And that's been &#x2013; but that's been going on for quite some time. It really hasn't changed. Now, look, that will vary by brand. Some brands experiencing more demand right now, other brands a little bit slack demand depending on the markets that they're in. But they're pretty smart guys and if they see any kind of revenue fall off or booking fall offs, they're out there with their promotions in order to stimulate the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, helpful. And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I can answer the question any better than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's actually helpful and gets to the crux of it. I appreciate that. And then just in terms of visibility, obviously you've said second &#x2013; we all know when you look out that far, it's &#x2013; but has your visibility improved at all? I guess what I'm really asking is, what does the booking curve look like? Is the nature of the business still very close-in? And I'm, again, not so concerned about the rest of this year, but as we look to early 2013, is it still very close-in or is that &#x2013; it's getting &#x2013; is the booking curve getting extended a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For certain brands it's still pretty &#x2013; it's still close-in. You're starting to see some evidence of it pushing out more recently because of the recent increase in bookings over the last quarter. But it's still closer-in than it has been historically. So we're starting to &#x2013; and that's been the pattern. It's more so the pattern in the European brands. We're seeing it more in the European brands, but we're also seeing a little bit of it, but not quite as much, in the American brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wanted to clarify one thing you said Howard and then I have a question. Just looking at kind of the incremental rather than the cumulative booking, you made a comment about the last six weeks that the first half of 2013 was higher. Was that in volume or in price, or was that both? I don't know if I completely caught the specifics of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me go back and check, but I think certainly it wasn't volume and I think it would depend on the market. David, would you...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We did comment in the press release, it was up 9% for the last six weeks excluding Costa and prices were in line with last year's level. And over the same period for Costa, we said 9% increases at lower prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just looking at Costa and what's happened this year, obviously it looks like your full-year yield guidance didn't change that much for Costa, right? And for the non-Costa brands that's gotten a little better and Costa yields maybe still being down at about 15% to 20% for the year. Can you quantify how much of that you expect to be occupancy decline for the Costa brand this year versus price? Because just thinking about recovery in 2013, that the occupancy &#x2013; it's easier to see that coming back without having to even think about raising prices, just kind of thinking about that part of the recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think and David is looking up the occupancy declines year-over-year. But when we look at and when we go beyond into the second quarter and third quarters and fourth quarters, a good &#x2013; we're not &#x2013; a good piece &#x2013; I think we're looking for both price and occupancy increases. Clearly, we expect occupancies to get back to more normal levels for the Costa brand. But I think we're also expecting increase in pricing because of the easier comparisons. But a good chunk of what we lost was in 2012, a good part of what we lost was occupancy because we stopped &#x2013; we lost all the bookings during wave season once it started for Costa and they didn't really get back into the market in any significant way until later on in the spring and then still not in a very significant way. So it was a tough year for marketing for Costa. So, it has been a struggle. But we're starting to see the turnaround, but we won't start to really see it in the numbers until the second quarter of 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Howard, the occupancy drop was 5% for the year, but it was over 11% and almost 6% for the second and third quarters. So it was very significant occupancy hits in the second and third quarters and third quarter obviously would be most important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and as I mentioned, in the fourth quarter we actually were back with the same occupancies year-over-year. So you can see that that's the biggest hit, was in that second and third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. Harry, we had said back, I think it was on the March call, that we had expected a decline in about $500 million <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:17) we expect them to lose $100 million.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No, that's okay. Back on the March call, we had indicated that we were reducing our earnings as a result of Costa by about $500 million.

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question I had relates to just changes in deployment. If you move a ship from the European or Mediterranean market to Asia, should that generate higher or lower pricing at this point and what impact does that have on your EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just mention to you that the Costa ship in Asia this year, which was a single ship of &#x2013; the first time we've had a 2,000 passenger vessel, had enjoyed actually because it was very positive revenues and actually stronger revenues than we had for the rest of the Costa brand but of course the Costa brand was affected by the events of last January. We're also from a &#x2013; and the reason for moving a second ship to Asia is Costa was the first company to really to start deployments in Asia for the Asian market in China. And for many, many years, we made an investment in terms of taking up some losses. We had first a smaller ship, then two small ships, and then we moved to the Costa Victoria, which is a larger ship. We had the Classica there for a while as well. So now we're going to show a small profit on the one ship in Asia and that's &#x2013; at good prices. So we're going to move the second ship over, it's not just China, it's all the other Asian markets as well for Costa. So we expect it to be profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what sort of pricing &#x2013; incremental pricing are you &#x2013; do you expect to see over the course of the next 6 to 12 months in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't have that in front of me. And I &#x2013; to be honest with you, I haven't &#x2013; we're just in the process of starting to review operating plans and I haven't even looked at the Costa operating plan. We start that next week and one of the reasons Micky and Beth are already over in London is we are flying over &#x2013; David and I are flying over on Thursday and we start our planning and budgeting reviews of each of the brands in Europe next week &#x2013; later on this week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although, Harry, I can tell you, if you look back the ship in Asia did better than the average of the Costa fleet in 2000 and &#x2013; or expected to do in 2012, albeit, keep in mind that those are depressed yields for Costa in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You also have to keep in mind you're talking about one ship on a 100-ship fleet, so increased profitability or not on the margin is small compared to the 100-ship fleet.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, guys. First of all, I guess, the onboard spend was a lot stronger, not a lot stronger but a good bit stronger than what we were looking for. Can you just kind of comment, was that across the board and maybe what you've seen in terms of the European brands and how onboard has trended over the last couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, onboards have been strong all year. When &#x2013; first of all, if you break out just onboards from onboard and other because the other was impacted to some degree as I mentioned by the accounting change we had for the Alaskan tour operations. But onboard was up a little bit over 3%, excluding Costa on both sides of the Atlantic, in the third quarter. It was up in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% in the first two quarters and we are expecting &#x2013; we're forecasting about 2% in the third quarter on a normalized basis. I'd say on a normalized basis because we had a couple of credits last year from guarantee payments in the fourth quarter of last year, so if you actually look at the as-reported numbers we included in our forecasts onboards would look more flattish to down, but we have had steady increases all year long and we've been very pleased with that and it's essentially across all of the major categories. We've seen increases in bar, we've seen casino, shore ex and shops and those four categories make up about 80% of our onboard, so we are very pleased.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then the second question, I guess you guys just made a recent change in terms of your commission structure to &#x2013; for just the Carnival brand. Is that something you will essentially try to push out to the rest of the brands? And then kind of the second question to that is, has there been much pushback from your Asian community?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we didn't make any change in the commission structure. All we did &#x2013; all Carnival Cruise Lines did was play some catch-up on override targets. Virtually all our other brands and most of our competitive brands adjust their override targets based on capacity increases. And do it either every year or every other year, but do it on a relatively regular basis. Carnival Cruise Lines hadn't done it in 10 years. And so basically, that was a catch-up of capacity increases, which over those 10 years was 50% and adjusting, and also simplifying the override goals. That's all it was.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit more about the capital allocation plans? You did return some cash to shareholders through the $67 million stock buyback this quarter but you have capacity for much more. Could you just talk about how you are thinking about that especially versus dividend? And also, David, in the past has talked about essentially a variable dividend where you would true-up some kind of dividend payout based on your earnings or your cash flow. How is the Board starting to think about these issues over the next six to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Steve, you got to keep in mind that our excess free cash flow for this year based off of our September guidance is almost about $400 million. So we have returned in total &#x2013; I think it's $69 million through the share buyback program this year, so there's not a huge amount of excess free cash flow for 2012. But we will continue to opportunistically buyback shares. As I mentioned, we still have $265 million remaining under the repurchase authorization. Hopefully, that excess free cash flow will continue to increase and then as it increases, we've got to talk to the Board about the variety of alternatives we have that we've gone through in the past, including a formulaic annual dividend as one option. But at the moment, these are things we're thinking about for the future when the excess free cash flow grows.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Two questions. First one, as you look across the different big European markets, over the last month, two months, three months, is any one market either gotten a lot better or a lot worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that U.K. and Germany has held up better than we expected in the last two conference calls I would say a little bit, while Italy, France and Spain struggled. Well, I'd say France did okay, Italy and Spain continue, especially Spain to be very difficult. And actually &#x2013; surprisingly, Costa, despite having a difficult time pricing-wise, maintained its market share in these markets. They either maintained or even increased market share in these markets. So I thought that was an interesting stat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. That's helpful. And also just with the volatility in the Middle East, has there been any impact to what you're seeing from your either North American or European sourced business over the last week or so. I know the last six weeks have been pretty good. But, last week, have you seen some volatility around the recent events?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had some itinerary port cancellations. We only have, I think if you look at 2013, about less than 10% of our capacity calling in those kinds of ports and most of it is behind us for 2012. The peak of it is generally in the third quarter. So it hasn't been much of an issue today. We do have one ship that Costa has, a small ship, operating next year in the beginning of the year in the Red Sea and that could be an issue if this continues much longer.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. My first question is with regards to your expectations about wave season 2013. We have a very strong start to wave 2012 and so one would think that unless we have exogenous events we should probably expect a pretty decent wave 2013. Has the changes in the European economies made you think that it may be less robust than what we saw a year ago? Or early this year rather?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at this point, Assia, it's difficult to say. I think that Europe has been soft for a while. Throughout this year, even last &#x2013; throughout 2012 and even 2011 and we're seeing a continuation of it. So the comparisons may not be all that difficult for us in Europe, as far as wave season is concerned. We lost a lot of the wave last year after January, so all the brands were impacted last year's wave. So relatively speaking, it came on strong, but then it weakened considerably in 2012. This year, we expect that it will be a more sustainable wave, but we'll have a better picture of it later on in the year when we can see &#x2013; because we haven't really &#x2013; a lot of the more marketing starts later in the fourth quarter so we'll have a better sense of it from a demand standpoint. Later in the fourth quarter, we'll see how things go but I think we're feeling pretty positive about the situation.</p>
          <p>But Europe is challenging, but we're there for the long-term. It is a strategy that we think will work. We like the European demographics. We like the market. We think we're still &#x2013; the market is still considerably underpenetrated relative to other developed markets, so we like our investments in Europe from a long-term standpoint and once we get through this quiet &#x2013; this difficult economic challenges that we're experiencing, especially in Southern Europe as Micky indicated, and I think we'll start to see some stabilization and some very positive results for the company longer-term.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>We're not in a position at this point to give specific guidance on Costa for 2013 but we do expect Costa to do better next year and it will continue to improve. We'll see more improvement obviously in 2014 as well. And so, we'll give you more color on that in December.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon &#x2013; and good morning, sorry. And just, firstly, on Q4 yield, I'm just trying to square the circle on your guidance of minus 5% to minus 6% which is similar to where Q3 actually came in. But then in Q3, you said part of, three percentage points of the 5% were down to Costa and in Q4 the occupancy goes back to flat versus, I think it was minus 6% in Q3. So I'm just trying to understand where the weakness, the incremental weakness comes from? Is it Costa pricing or pricing on brands outside of Costa in Q4 that you're expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the things you've got to keep in mind is when you look at the fourth quarter, the onboard and other yields are down considerably from the third quarter because of all of the fourth quarter items that we had last year that I mentioned before in onboard and other. The net passenger revenue is more flattish with the third quarter when you compare the &#x2013; when you look at the total company, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think what we've said is that Costa's &#x2013; on a year-over-year basis, their pricing will come down from the third quarter because the fourth quarter is typically a challenging quarter notwithstanding because it's out of season, as the demand factors are lower. So &#x2013; but we are seeing a narrowing on a year-over-year basis, meaning an improvement in Costa's pricing when you look at it and we expect that to continue into Q1 as well. So it is getting better but right now as we sell &#x2013; we caught up on occupancies, we're selling at lower prices to do that. That's what I said. I'm not sure if I answered your question, but...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...the fourth quarter, for Costa yields were slightly better, but it was more pricing than occupancy. And for the rest of the company, outside of Costa, we are expecting yields to not show the same level of close-in demand that we enjoyed in the summer season, because it's seasonally a little bit weaker in the fourth quarter than you normally would see it &#x2013; for close-in demand during the summer.</p>

          <p>I mean, there's a lot &#x2013; as we go through the next &#x2013; this past few years and the next several years going forward, there's a lot of retrofitting of equipment on to the ships to reduce consumption &#x2013; power consumption. Just more sophisticated controls, fan systems and so on. And also, where the opportunity comes up, we can change around itineraries a little bit to get some reduction in fuel cost.

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. There was something in the press release that said, due to the timing of certain expenses. Can you refresh our memories on what those expenses might be and if that's a permanent change going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was just the timing between the third and fourth quarter, and that was part of the reason why our costs were better than we had guided for the third quarter versus the June guidance. The largest item was an adjustment to one of our insurance reserves. We expected the actuary to deliver the report in September and they delivered it the last week in August. So, we wound up making a journal entry. There were some other changes in advertising, professional fees, hotel maintenance, et cetera. And it's really just a timing difference between the third and fourth quarter and not a permanent difference for the year or on an ongoing basis.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Two questions. One follow-up on the fuel conservation question. This &#x2013; the 6% number is maybe twice what you guys have realized previously in any quarter. Can you talk about how much was itinerary and how much was on-board efficiency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, we don't have the detail between the technology versus itineraries. It's a tremendous amount of detail we'd have to go through to try to split that out. We did actually forecast about a 4.5% increase within the third quarter. We did better than we had expected. I mean I think I've said this in the past. Typically, our maritime guys are a bit conservative. Hopefully, they've been conservative for the fourth quarter as well and will do better than what we're expecting there. But I don't have the detail to break that out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. The follow-up question, just kind of looking at the numbers you cited on Costa. If we think about a $500 million swing and perhaps $100 million being removed due to capacity adjustments, should we think about your normalized level of profitability for Costa as $300 million?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, well, as a broad number, you could say that. I mean, but a lot &#x2013; see a lot of the ships that went out &#x2013; the capacity that left were the two smaller ships in addition to Concordia. So, they were never very profitable ships to begin with. So, there's a devil in details here. So, I'd rather not commit to anything like that. But then certainly, they're going to try to get back to as much profitability as they can. It may &#x2013; but to climb back to where they were before will probably take another year or two beyond 2013.</p>

          <p>Hi. I apologize, my phone has been going in and out during this call; so, David, if you already talked about this, my apologies.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, the largest is the deployment change. They're all fairly similar in size, but the deployment change is the largest. The MNOPF or the multiemployer pension plan is worth about $25 million next year. And you know, the Costa occupancy is slightly smaller than that on a unit cost basis. And those are &#x2013; that's the relative magnitude of those items.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Hi. A couple of questions for you. The first one is, the language you used to describe the outlook in the Q3 statement is almost the same as you used in the Q2, so I was just slightly puzzled as to what you think has changed materially for the better in that period? And sort of leading on from that, what would you view as a good result for 2013 net revenue yield increase? What would you be happy with as a management team? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first part. The language in the press release is similar with regard to booking volumes. Booking volumes were strong both in the period leading up to June and the period leading up to September. In this current outlook pricing has improved, so we're generating the same level of booking volumes with less price action.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, is &#x2013; is there any validity, I guess, thinking back to the guidance that you gave in December on a group-wide basis, the guidance excluding Costa now is probably sort of a couple of points worse than that guidance. Does that provide a decent steer or is there just too many other things that have occurred subsequently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, when the time we gave the December guidance, we were comfortable with that guidance. You can do the math. But a lot of things other than the events of January, as Howard said, has happened. But I think, clearly, right up until January 13, we were very, very comfortable with that guidance was good or even conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if you look at our guidance back last December, which was midpoint of $2.70 a share, if you take out fuel and currency changes, which affected us by about $0.30 a share, and just the Costa swing in profit is about $0.64 a share, that more than makes up for the &#x2013; for where our guidance is of $1.85 today, that $0.90, $0.95.</p>
          <p>So, in all other respects, I think we performed as expected, and we gave up a little bit in yield on the outside of Costa with the other brands, but we've also saved quite a bit on the cost side. So &#x2013; and in fact, I think those two elements, if you take them together probably would have taken us down even further than $1.85. So, we've improved from the operating line, if you take fuel and currency and Costa out. I'm talking about now all the other brands to give you a global picture. In terms &#x2013; and also &#x2013; it's also how we see it too. So, even with all that noise out there, we did....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...okay. The other brands did just fine actually if you take out the fuel part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And, then a completely different question if I can, just in relation to the fact that you have recommenced some share repurchases recently. Is it &#x2013; whilst you're not going to be drawn on how you will return funds to shareholders, is it logical, given that you did some share repurchasing last year and you did a little bit more recently, that we should be looking at your overall leverage structure maybe on a debt-to-EBITDA basis this year and then last year's end and thinking about that as a level with which the management team is comfortable with and, therefore, going forward, to the extent that you've got excess free cash flow, one way or another, whether that's dividend, special dividend, share buybacks, you'd look to keep that kind of leverage structure in place? Is that a logical way to think about how you think about that issue?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes, we can hear you fine, Tim, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I apologize. Just a follow-up on one of the previous questions; Costa getting back to roughly a $300 million normalized run rate, would it be reasonable &#x2013; again, just to clarify a previous answer, you're saying 2014 or 2015 you'd feel more comfortable in that area, without honestly really knowing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They get the capacity back at the end of 2014, so that would give them the opportunity really of getting back fully in 2015, but it's going to take some steps as Howard said. It's going to take two or three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, we're going to make a very positive step. We're going to make a &#x2013; we believe we're going to make a very positive step in the first year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, I apologize if I missed this, but just any color on dealing with the increased emissions requirements going forward and some of the things that have been coming out regarding credits and so forth, and again, I apologize if you made any commentary on that earlier in the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we didn't comment on the call. We continue to work with EPA to try to come up with an arrangement at least for the next several years to see if we can do something called averaging, weighted averaging. We haven't been successful but we're &#x2013; we've got that also from a legislative agenda standpoint in Washington. We're also pushing for a legislative fix to allow us a period of time to demonstrate what we can do on a weighted averaging basis. And, I &#x2013; but I would also say that when it comes to this issue that there is a number of new technologies that are going on in the R&amp;D area &#x2013; in the research area that we are very hopeful on that could help us in this respect as well. So, we continue to work so that by the time 2015 comes around when these ECAs get spread across the globe, we can mitigate the increased fuel costs. But, there is a lot between now and then &#x2013; a lot of time between now and then; we're hopeful we can get it done one &#x2013; in one form or another.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, again, also the $180-million guidance that you've given previously on that, that was on a static fleet at that point in time of guidance, and clearly you've made additional progress since then. So, even more opportunity beyond now, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we'll take a look and update those numbers in our 10-K.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Just two quick ones on cost please. Has your underlying cost guidance changed? And, I see the one-offs you mentioned but are you still looking for net unit costs of flat to half inflation or are you finding more pressures as your capacity growth slows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I was trying to indicate is we have these unique items that are going to affect our costs next year, which would be probably on top of flat to half of inflation, is a good way of thinking about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the 1.5% to 2% excludes the flat to half inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It excludes the flat to half of inflation and &#x2013; but I'll throw in one other point to think about is that this year we did have some unique items relating to ship incidences, which will go away, which will benefit us to the tune of about a half a point. So, net, you're probably looking at 1 to 1.5 points on top of flat to half of inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And, then the other one is just on your bunker guidance for Q4, 739, it's about 20% above the guidance a quarter ago, but wholesale price is up about a half that or less. Is there anything else in that number? It looks very high to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you've got to keep in mind that there is also some additional ECA requirements in the fourth quarter that weren't in the third because on August 1st is when the ECA requirements started and so that will affect the comparisons that you are looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the impact for 2013 then on that basis for the remaining nine quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, on an annualized basis you're probably looking at an ECA impact of, let's just say, $50 million to $55 million and probably a third or 40% of that was in this year. So, you've probably got an incremental of $30-odd-million next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi. Thanks. Just quickly, Beth, if you could just give us your second, third and fourth quarter deployment in the Med and I think Micky said that you have about 10% in Eastern Med, just wanted to confirm that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, for the second, third, and fourth &#x2013; you're asking for 2013? I'm just trying to figure out....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, 2013 in the Med, we have 6% in the first quarter, 17% in the second quarter, 25% in the third quarter, 28% in the fourth quarter, and 19% of the full year and that's both East and West. So, of the 19%, roughly half of it is the Eastern portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, how much was Eastern this year, in 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about the same; it was less than 10%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about 30 &#x2013; well, through the nine months, about $30 million and so &#x2013; that's pretty much it for the year. There may be another $1 million or something, not much.</p>
