          <p>Greetings, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call and Research and Development Pipeline Update. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, sir. You may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining Monsanto's first quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; as well as Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me are Manny Cruz, Bryan Corkal and Ashley Wissmann, my colleagues in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com, including slides for our annual R&amp;D update today. The replay will also be available at that address. We're providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis, where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures we reconcile to GAAP in the slide and in the press release, both of which are posted to our website. This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.</p>
          <p>So today is an extended conference call that features the annual review of the R&amp;D pipeline results with Rob, but before we cover that, Hugh will begin with the first quarter strategic review including our guidance update today and the early look at our Latin American and U.S. seasons. From there, Pierre will walk through the translation to our financial outlook.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand the time over to Hugh to start us with the overview on the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everyone on the line, and let me wish you the very best in this new year. The first quarter is an important milestone, it's the first data point that informs the outlook and the year and it's the annual data point on our R&amp;D progress. And I can underscore this sets the tone for our confidence in our long-term outlook.</p>
          <p>On the business side, this first quarter came in even stronger than we initially expected. It's strength that comes from across our business portfolio, so the key areas that we're looking to drive our performance are firing on all cylinders. It reinforces the strong fundamental environment in agriculture. Equally important, it continues to reflect that we've the right growth strategy in place, the discipline to execute against it and that's creating momentum. Practically, that comes together on slide 5 to give us the confidence even at this early point to raise our guidance today to $4.30 to $4.40 of ongoing EPS and $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow for the full year.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, raising our full year guidance at this early stage isn't our typical practice. However, with the combination of the compelling results we've delivered from key businesses in the quarter and the strong outlook that we see in an early moving U.S. season, we've a better line of sight than a typical year, putting us in a unique position to increase our guidance even before the North American season ramps up.</p>
          <p>In any given year, the variables come together differently in execution than they're drawn up during planning. Our portfolio sat well to manage the puts and takes that happen every year in agriculture. It's an advantage that we've realized as we've grown our business. I'd highlight how that portfolio effect comes together in our early confidence and our increased full year outlook.</p>
          <p>First, one of the most obvious areas of first quarter strength is in our corn performance. One of the most important drivers there is Latin America. Importantly, the Latin America opportunity is tracking very well, setting up the full year growth that we expect from this important element of our 2013 strategy. As we expected, the initial corn acres in Brazil's summer season were lower than last year, but the market is set for one of the largest ever second season safrinha crops, keeping total acres on par with last year. And even with some early rain delays in Argentina, the corn crop is on target with our planning projections.</p>
          <p>More importantly, both Argentina and Brazil are in full swing on the cotton trait adoption cycle that is driving our immediate opportunity. On slide 6, you see that in Brazil, the key to this year is the upgrade to the first true double-stack called VT PRO 2. With our sales in hand, it's the second highest volume trait in Brazil's corn portfolio, expecting almost one-third of our total volume sold there in 2013. Likewise, in Argentina on slide 7, the upgrade is to the triple-stack and is on track to be more than 40% of our total Argentine corn portfolio in just our second year of sales. Both of these upgrades are important because they create a margin upgrade that layers on top of our normal mix upgrade in the germplasm.</p>
          <p>The second indicator comes from the early insight that Q1 provides for our U.S. seed business as shown on slide 8. A portion of the uptick in earnings in the quarter captures the fact that we shipped more corn and soy volume in Q1 than we did last year. If you pair that with a strong quarterly cash flow and customer prepays, we're off to a very solid start in the U.S. With the historic drought as a backdrop, we're coming out of a harvest where our products really distinguished themselves despite an extremely difficult growing season. And that shows in the first look at the order book.</p>
          <p>At the end of our first quarter, the order pace for the U.S. portfolio is ahead of the same point last year and tracking very well against our overall 2013 targets. We're coming off two strong years for the U.S. business and in a good position to grow again in 2013. We're seeing that strength in volume growth, germplasm upgrades and our trait mix as we're on target for the step-ups in our Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform in soybeans and the Genuity reduced refuge family in corn. As backed by our cash flow and customer prepays, both of which are up year-over-year and they provide a good indicator that there are solid commitments behind the order book. So if you take these together, the bottom line is our order book is strong and that speaks our opportunity to turn our early confidence into growth in the U.S. as we start to see the expected acres planted this coming spring.</p>
          <p>Next, perhaps the best other example of our portfolio performance this year is Ag Productivity. Ag Productivity in the Roundup business in particular has emerged nicely from our strategy reset a few years ago. Within that, we are staying laser-focused on our strategy. Within Roundup, we'll prioritize optimizing volume while holding a small brand premium over the generics. The generic prices have been tracking upwards for the past few months, creating some positive pricing opportunity that shows in the Q1 numbers. Over time, we expect this positive generic environment cycles back to a more steady-state environment, so we're maintaining our discipline and there's no structural change in our approach. But it is a nice positive from the portfolio that layers into our improved outlook for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio also has the strength to manage practical variability. Last year, we managed through variation in vegetables and in cotton. This year, the paddler revolves around the uncertainty surrounding the complexity and timing of the ongoing legal process for Roundup Ready soybeans in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In addition to the evolving legal landscape and consistent with our deliberate approach to focus on business solutions, we're also engaged in advanced discussions with some of the leading grower associations in Brazil, which could provide an option for full clarity for all parties. If completed, an agreement may include some near-term trade-offs but would set the stage as Monsanto and these grower organizations focus on a successful Intacta launch that maintains the integrity of a collection system and has all growers fairly paying for the use of Intacta. We think that there's a path here well worth exploring.</p>
          <p>Given the uncertainty and timing on the legal system and the opportunity for an alternate business solution, we've decided the best way to address the potential unpredictability and provide clarity for the business and outlook is to exclude any contribution from the Brazil Roundup Ready 1 trait from our current earnings and cash flow guidance. If included, that would reflect a historical range of roughly $0.20 to $0.25 of full year EPS contribution.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the various developments, the legal challenges relate to the patent term timing for Roundup Ready soybeans, not IP generally and not Intacta. So as I step back and I look at Brazil, what's ultimately going to determine our growth path will be the expansion of our corn business and the introduction of Intacta. So we're intent on creating the clarity and the focus to deliver on those two drivers.</p>
          <p>So, that underlines the early validation point, while compensating for the uncertainty around Brazilian soybeans, our confidence to increase guidance today speaks clearly to the strength in the overall portfolio, and why we see momentum driving our third consecutive year of strong growth in fiscal year 2013.</p>
          <p>And finally, as good as I feel about this year, I feel equally good about our long-term opportunity and at the heart of that opportunity is our R&amp;D pipeline. This year, there's a record number of advancements in the pipeline. I see this as the industry's only integrated yield pipeline. So we're talking about more platforms and more ways to create yield value than ever before. Over the next decade, we're the company in the best position to unlock the next wave of innovation that drives yield for our customers, sustainable productivity on the land and creates incremental value in our business.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me have Pierre walk through the financials before we open an extended conversation this morning with Rob Fraley on the pipeline. Pierre?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everybody on the line. Hugh covered the business drivers that influenced our full year guidance. So I will now concentrate on a focused review of how that translates into the financials. But before I go into the details, let me highlight on slide 9 how I see where we stand as a result of the strong first quarter.</p>
          <p>First, we are of course very pleased with our first quarter results. It's a quarter that stands out because we grew ongoing EPS by $0.39 year-over-year. While that's a very significant step-up for Q1, the quarter still represents only about 15% of our total earnings for the year and only a part of our anticipated growth. So while we performed ahead of plan, I think it's right to look at Q1 prudently as a good first step toward our full year opportunity.</p>
          <p>Second, within the quarter, I see growth from multiple elements. As we've grown, we are getting more balanced contributions across geographies, across crops and across business segments. It is that balance that allows us to manage through some things like the Brazil soybean uncertainty and still have the confidence to raise our full year guidance.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I believe in a prudent approach to updating guidance. With the strong results we've seen for the quarter and the momentum we see in the U.S., we have better early visibility than a typical year. That is what gives me the confidence to raise our full year earnings and free cash outlook even though we are still at a very early point in the year. With the U.S. season developing in the second quarter, we'll begin to see these early trends translate into earnings. So I like the position we're in to deliver another strong year of growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now walk through how those trends show up in the financials. With $0.39 of year-over-year growth, our total ongoing EPS for the quarter was $0.62. The step-up for the quarter is roughly split between both our seeds business and our Ag Productivity segment. So I'll focus mainly on the items that really drive our full year outlook.</p>
          <p>As expected, the largest contributor to the first quarter was Seeds and Genomics. And within that, the most important driver was corn, seeds and traits. A key portion of that growth relates to Latin America. With the expected business strength in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, the trait upgrade in Brazil and Argentina drives a mix benefit that shows up in the quarter and we're expecting it to continue with the second growing season in Brazil.</p>
          <p>The other portion in this quarter is some positive timing associated with our U.S. corn business. As our volume grows, we managed the logistics around getting seed into the distribution channel sooner and more seed moves into the first quarter. Together, the corn contribution drives the quarter and the full year as we continue to expect double-digit gross profit growth in the corn business to drive our overall Seeds and Genomics outlook.</p>
          <p>Although Q1 is a small quarter related to Brazil soybeans, we saw some effect on the soybean line as we suspended collection of royalty payments during a portion of the quarter. As Hugh indicated, the historical annual contribution for Brazil soybeans would be in the range of $0.20 to $0.25 and we made the decision to exclude it in our EPS Seeds and Genomics GP and cash flow guidance.</p>
          <p>The other piece of our portfolio that represents an upside and offset the variability in this year's portfolio is the Ag Productivity business. In the first quarter, the segment gross profit was nearly $200 million higher than prior year.</p>
          <p>The upside is primarily driven by glyphosate pricing as a result of recent increases in generic prices, and we were in a good position to capture some of the near-term benefits. However, from an operational perspective, we continue to focus on our 300 million gallons of production. And within that, we will continue to drive our sales mix towards branded Roundup sales.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is clear. As we've said, we will be disciplined and maintain a level of premium over generics since we believe this cycle will ebb. With that discipline, we're in a good place as we expect the industry will ease back to a less elevated price band and we will come back to a more steady state Ag Productivity GP range.</p>
          <p>In the short-term, we expect the first quarter upside to largely carry through the year and we project our full year GP for the segment to be approximately $200 million to $300 million higher than our original target of approximately $1 billion. Put in context, the first quarter Ag Productivity GP growth effectively offset the entire annual Brazil soybean's GP contribution.</p>
          <p>If you take Seeds and Genomics and Ag Productivity together, our increased guidance today reflects a step-up in combined full year gross profit now in the range of $7.65 billion and that is a key element in building towards our confidence in our full year outlook.</p>
          <p>Moving now below the line for the quarter, the run rate for operating expenses keeps us in line for our full year SG&amp;A and R&amp;D targets, so we continue to expect to see leverage as our spending grows at the slower rate than our top-line. Importantly, the strength of the first quarter also shows up through our free cash flow results. Quarterly free cash flow was $1.47 billion compared with $856 million last year. As Hugh indicated in his order book review, that significant step-up reflects strong first customer prepays in front of the U.S. seasons. These prepays are a good early indicator of the U.S. purchase patterns and this reinforces my confidence in our overall U.S. outlook. And while a large portion of the increase in Q1 free cash flow reflects the positive timing of prepays, there is no doubt that the performance in the business is also translating into a better full year cash flow outlook. As a result of that early step-up, I am confident as we raise our full year free cash flow guidance to $1.8 billion to $2 billion.</p>
          <p>Given the first &#x2013; the strong first quarter, let me briefly cover how I see the earnings cycle for the remainder of the year on slide 10. We've seen a good portion of our growth in the first quarter. With our emphasis on growth from international regions like Latin America, this is a logical and a good indicator of the effectiveness of our strategy. Our most significant quarters will still be the second and third quarters. And while there may be movement between the two quarters, we expect the combined Q2 and Q3 will also grow year-to-year as we're confident in the additional growth coming from the U.S. in ag productivity.</p>
          <p>As I wrap up, I'll leave you with two key thoughts on how I see the strong first quarter in forming our full year opportunity. First, I am particularly pleased with the consistency that's come together as a result of our portfolio. Very simply, we've been able to manage the variability in Brazil soybeans very much like we managed the variability in vegetables last year. We have strength in other parts of the portfolio that not just allow us to address those downside variable, but also delivers upside that improve our full year outlook.</p>
          <p>Second, it's still very early, but the first quarter is a strong start. This is a quarter that gives me confidence in our ability to deliver another year of growth. And even with roughly 85% of the business still in front of us, I like the position we're in to realize that fiscal year 2013 growth.</p>
          <p>With that, let me give the remainder of the time to Rob for our pipeline update. Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everybody on the line. I'm going to jump right into the R&amp;D pipeline update starting with slide 4, but these are the headlines. So first, this is a record year with more phase advancements across crops and technology platforms than we've ever realized in our history. And if you take a look at slides 5 through 8, you'll see we've advanced 18 projects plus three additional projects moving into our Ground Breakers program.</p>
          <p>Second, if you look at the progress this year, I believe that our R&amp;D advantage is extending and in important new ways. We've just introduced major new platforms in Integrated Farming Systems or IFS and our BioDirect research area. And in addition, on slide 9, you see the geographic multiplier as we're moving technology from the original launch countries into successive new commercial markets faster than ever.</p>
          <p>The last point is that we are positioned to launch a major new technology effectively every year through the end of this decade. If you step back from the project-by-project detail, our R&amp;D pipeline is more than the sum of its parts. It's the industry's first integrated yield pipeline. In the next decade, we plan to refresh every major platform, creating incremental value and even better weed control, greater insect control, and more opportunity to increase yield for our farmer customers. The companies that are successful in the next decade will need to have more than one or two component technologies. The leaders will bring multiple technologies together in the seed, in the plant, and in the field, and no one is better positioned to do that than Monsanto.</p>
          <p>So given all the advancements, I don't have time to go project-by-project, so I'll concentrate on highlights among some key themes. And the first theme is that breeding is a cornerstone capability that differentiates us competitively and sets the tone for our emphasis on yield. And nowhere is that success more evident than in the annual U.S. performance results shown on slide 10.</p>
          <p>In corn, DEKALB's yield advantage is as strong as ever. In fact, the lower U.S. yields from the tough drought conditions magnified our relative performance. 2012 was no exception with more than an eight bushel per acre yield advantage, rolling up to a three-year average of 10 bushels per acre. There's no doubt that yield difference was visible to farmers in their fields, and now shows up in the order book that Hugh just described.</p>
          <p>Our performance advantage was even stronger in soybeans, where Roundup Ready 2 Yield demonstrated a record-setting yield advantage of nearly five bushels per acre. To put that in perspective, that advantage is comparable to about 10 years of soybean breeding gains. Farmers see this performance advantage better than anyone else, and that's reflected in the strength of our soybean early order book and confirms that Roundup Ready 2 Yield is our clear soybean platform.</p>
          <p>The additional data today is new data from our cotton results shown on slide 11. Like corn and soybeans, the new cotton varieties we've launched are consistently out-yielding the competitors. You can see this geography-by-geography on the slide, and when you take a weighted average total, the Deltapine Land advantage is more than 6%. That's nearly 80 more pounds per acre, or nearly $60 an acre advantage for Deltapine Land cotton over competitors' seeds.</p>
          <p>Our breeding capability does more than drive an annual portfolio upgrade. It's also created completely new tools allowing breeders to unlock specific targeted breeding opportunities, making the capabilities of modern breeding much more like how we've thought about biotechnology. The case study is our disease-resistance breeding program shown on slide 12. We've completely revolutionized disease breeding using high-throughput screening and markers to identify, select and deploy disease resistance genes.</p>
          <p>Whether it's our efforts on enhanced Goss's Wilt tolerance for corn on slide 13, or the advances we've made on phytophthora resistance in soybeans on slide 14, the impact throughout our row crops is powerful. And those same breeding tools are being deployed in vegetable breeding. We're on the leading edge of launching a steady wave of new innovative products starting to reach commercialization. These range from new disease-resistant cucumbers to one of this year's advancements with our performance series broccoli highlighted on slide 15.</p>
          <p>We've only scratched the surface on the capability and opportunity with breeding. And in fact, I'd make the strong case that our technical lead is as important, and may be even more pronounced in breeding as it is in biotech because the reach goes into every crop and every market we participate in.</p>
          <p>The next theme I'd like to emphasize is that we're using our Ground Breakers on-farm testing program to set up successful commercial introductions for our next wave of seed product upgrades. This year, we have the most ever Ground Breaker programs in place, with Intacta in Brazil and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend and IFS, FieldScripts in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Let me start with Ground Breakers on slide 16. Last year, our data demonstrated a clear yield advantage of nearly five bushels per acre. These are on-farm results from the Brazil growers who will be our first customers when we launch following regulatory milestones. So it's a very important first-hand view.</p>
          <p>This year, we're expanding the testing into more geographic regions and more growers, giving us an even stronger base of experience as we prepare for the expected launch in fiscal 2014. And that catapults us into an expanding opportunity as we officially include Argentina in our planning and gear up for Ground Breakers there in fiscal 2014. So with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, Intacta is the first of the two new platforms coming in soybeans with an opportunity of more than 100 million acres. We're really &#x2013; what's really exciting is that the pipeline behind Intacta is deep, and it just got even deeper. Last year, we advanced the second-generation version of Intacta. And this year, we already have the third generation coming into phase 1 behind that.</p>
          <p>The second of the 100 million acre platforms is the Roundup Ready Xtend soybean system shown on slides 17 and 18, which is entering Ground Breakers this year. So this soy product stacks dicamba tolerance on top of our Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform. The novel biotech trait is already in phase 4 and the complementary chemistry also just advanced on a parallel path to phase 4 making it a prime example of the system approach that we've been emphasizing.</p>
          <p>The formulation piece is key. As our testing of the new, low volatility dicamba/glyphosate premix is showing strong efficacy and residual activity. Pair that with large-scale tests that indicate our new formulation shows excellent results managing drip, and effectively we're building an improved weed control system. We'll use the upcoming Ground Breakers testing to get on-farm feedback as this becomes the next layer of value that we expect will drive our U.S. soybean opportunity in the near-term before expanding internationally.</p>
          <p>So the last Ground Breakers highlight is DroughtGard on slide 19. Within DroughtGard, there are three significant firsts this year. It's the first yield and stress system to ever launch. It's the first ever Ground Breakers product in corn. And it's the first of the truly integrated breeding biotech and agronomic systems. And this means DroughtGard will move into commercial sales in 2013. So you remember the initial opportunity for this product is focused on the Western Corn Belt where dry conditions are expected in most years on the approximate 10 million acres from the Dakotas to Kansas. However, this provides an important validation point, as along with BASF we're launching the first product out of our yield and stress collaboration.</p>
          <p>The progress from DroughtGard actually informs how we're looking at a couple of the other projects in yield and stress shown on slide 20. The first is higher yielding corn. This project advanced last year, and we are on track with our phase 3 field testing. Now, there's no doubt that yield and stress is complex, and we're leveraging our collaboration with BASF to discover and advance more leads. We've also seen promising results in corn stacking multiple yield genes into a combined package, and I think this multi-gene approach to increasing yield is likely to become more prominent in the corn and soybean pipelines in the future.</p>
          <p>To that end in soybeans, we've also combined our work from our first-generation higher yielding soybean project with that of our second-generation leads into a combined next-generation higher-yielding soybean project that's in phase 2. Based on our early work in this area, we see a multi-gene approach as an additional path we want to explore for broad-acre application in soybean.</p>
          <p>The last theme to highlight today comes from the new additions to the pipeline. Within our existing platforms, we've added four new projects shown on slides 21 to 24. These projects really reflect our technology leadership in action. As we are focused on third and fourth generation products, while most in the industry are still pursuing first-generation technologies. The four products include the third generation Intacta soybeans I mentioned a bit earlier; two new insect traits in corn and a fourth-generation Bollgard IV product for cotton. Let me focus on the two in corn where we've added new next-generation traits for above and below ground insect control.</p>
          <p>If you focus on our next-generation above ground insect control shown on slide 21, we are increasing the control and durability against key caterpillar pests by developing Bt genes with completely new modes of action. Importantly, these new genes will enhance above ground insect control across our North and South American corn product lines.</p>
          <p>Finally, I am really thrilled by our progress in discovering new corn rootworm genes based on RNAi technology. As you know, last year, we advanced our corn rootworm III product, which is in phase 3. This year, we have added another novel RNAi based product, corn rootworm IV in phase 1 and shown in slide 22. We now have multiple modes of action beyond the traditional Bt genes and that's incredibly important since it solidifies the durability of our corn platforms and adds incremental new value. And that gives farmers more choices to use the technology that best meets their needs while upgrading our systems with unique proprietary modes of action.</p>
          <p>So saving the best for last, we've also used our core genomics knowledge to add two new R&amp;D platforms this year: biologicals and IFS. I'll start with our biologicals platform on slides 25 through 27. Here, our lead technology is BioDirect, and this is a milestone because we've officially brought BioDirect into our pipeline in the form of three project areas in early phase work.</p>
          <p>So as you know, by understanding the genes in plants and pests, we're able to take advantage of the advances in RNAi technology and naturally occurring processes to create topical applications from natures found &#x2013; from molecules found in nature. These can precisely target pests and can result in many of the same benefits we've seen with biotechnology traits. So while it's still in early stages, I have to emphasize that for me this is a really exciting advance and it reminds me of when I first saw the Roundup Ready technology in the late 1980s. And when you look at the products coming out of our BioDirect technology, I believe that these can facilitate expedited regulatory approvals, lower cost product development and ability to benefit markets where biotech traits aren't allowed today.</p>
          <p>We see a lot of broad applicability and we've taken our first step towards advancing these products with our first application of BioDirect technology for glyphosate-resistant weed control moving into phase 1. Right behind that are projects for insect and virus control that officially entered the discovery phase of the pipeline. So given these are early stage, there's still work to do. But as you can see from the photos on these slides, the results are extremely exciting. So we'll continue the development work but this is definitely a breakthrough technology advance that can create significant value in the next decade.</p>
          <p>The same breakthrough platform potential applies to IFS, which is our last highlight on slide 28. It's the first of our new platforms to move into Ground Breakers and this year there's been a tremendous amount of R&amp;D progress. You know I spent a lot of time with growers and inevitably the conversation gets down to the heart of IFS and how they can get incremental yield out of their seeds and fields more consistently. Given our investment in genomics, we're now able to correlate genetics to different field, soil and geographical compositions, giving us the ability to position hybrids with a higher degree of probability that has ever occurred in the industry. And this allows us to prescribe the optimum hybrid that best fits any field backed by a sophisticated planting density algorithm, which we call FieldScripts to drive incremental yield.</p>
          <p>Here's why we believe in the opportunity and the value of IFS. In a drought year like this one, we knew if we could differentiate our prescription, we'd have something special. And that's exactly what we saw. We realized between a 5 and 10-bushel yield increase with our FieldScript prescription versus the best practices of some of the most accomplished growers in the U.S. and that's really key. 5 to 10 bushels for a corn grower is significant and that creates opportunity for value creation and value sharing between ourselves and the grower. And that allows us to move into Ground Breakers this year and sets up for commercial launch of FieldScripts in our DEKALB brand in 2014.</p>
          <p>So I know we've covered a lot. Let me bring everything together for a quick summary on slide 29. So first, we are the technology leader. The bottom-line in this industry is all about creating yield sustainably and our focus and investment in producing yield is what makes our R&amp;D pipeline as unique and successful as it is. And when you look at our pipeline, I think what's impressive isn't necessarily the pure number of projects or advancements. What really matters is that you can see a steady stream of upgrades that means more yield and value for farmers and that drives the business opportunity for Monsanto.</p>
          <p>Second, we're unlocking yield gains via totally new technology platforms. You know the ability to combine genomics, biology and data management capability is driving yield in spectacular new ways. We're on the leading edge of that. And as the first-mover in this space, we will roll out platforms like IFS and BioDirect that I think are game-changing opportunities for farmers and our industry.</p>
          <p>And finally, we don't take our technology leadership for granted and we're looking to accelerate and extend our R&amp;D lead. Our investment and integration leads to big breakthroughs, consistent upgrades, and entirely new platforms reflecting that there's greater breadth and depth in our pipeline than ever before. And to this point, we expect to bring out a major new technology effectively every year through the end of this decade.</p>
          <p>I'll tell you, I'm as excited as I've ever been with our R&amp;D pipeline and that translates to our confidence and tremendous long-term outlook for farmers and our business. So thanks for your time.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Bryan for the Q&amp;A. Thanks.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Caller, please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. My question relates to soybeans in Brazil and specifically the nexus between your Intacta launch and the pending litigation on POD or value capture system. And so I'm wondering if we think about that issue, does it relate strictly to the Roundup Ready 1 soybean technology? That is to say, is there any scenario under which you would be unable to capture value on the back-end for Intacta as you proceed with the launch of that product in coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin, good morning and thanks for the first question. The dispute focuses exclusively on Roundup Ready 1. And within Roundup Ready 1, it focuses on patent life. So our belief is that patent, like the U.S., expires in 2014. There's &#x2013; some of the groups in Brazil believe that it's expired already and that's the nexus of the argument. If you kind of kick it up a step, the philosophy that I've applied to this is the same principle as before, if we can reach a business solution then that would be far more preferable. And the overarching principle in this is maintaining the freedom to operate so that we get Intacta launched on time and that we maintain our collection system in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So it's a fight that focuses exclusively on 1. But the value in Brazil going forward is two things. The value in Brazil going forward is the incremental yield that Intacta will unlock, number one. And number two is the amazing cotton performance that we're seeing down there. So we'd like to clear the decks and get Intacta launched, then keep driving our cotton business forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then as a quick follow-up, if I may, on Argentina, is the establishment of a value capture system for biotech soybeans in Argentina dependent on resolving the Brazil situation? Perhaps you could update us briefly on prospects there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they're not linked. We're making good progress. In fact, compared to the last 10 years, I'm very encouraged with the progress that we're making in Argentina. And as growers have seen, this four-bushel or four-bushel plus yield increment, the &#x2013; there's a lot of appetite for it. So I think we've seen more movement in Argentina in the last 6 to 12 months than we saw in the last decade, but it isn't linked to anything that's happening in Brazil today.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I'm thinking back to what you said, Hugh, about vegetables becoming the number three part of your portfolio over the next couple of years. And as we look at this pipeline, we see vegetables come up multiple times. Should we think about the vegetable opportunity as a series of discrete, big product opportunities like broccoli or like tomatoes? Or should we think of it more as taking the whole Seminis line and upgrading it in more of an evolutionary sense?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's more the latter than the former, Mark. I think it's &#x2013; there's half a dozen crop species in there that we're really putting the pedal to the metal with. But I don't think it's blockbusters as much as it's discrete breeding improvements across that half a dozen species. But compared to how we started, you go back a year and you look at how we started last year, and this year, I feel a lot better about the trajectory on vegetables this year than I did a year ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone. Actually I kind of have the same question for you this year that I had a year ago, which is about your deferred revenue, which again is miraculously up more than 40%. And I guess could you just talk to us a little bit about what's driving that increase? How much of it is seeds and traits versus what's happening? And I know you gave chemical guidance on gross profit for the year, but what is getting that number up so high? You'd also talked last quarter about there being some pull-forward out of 2Q into 1Q in the U.S. business, so maybe you could just sort of help us dimensionalize this $2.8 billion number? I mean it's really up $800 million year-over-year is pretty impressive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Vincent. Maybe I remember it from a year ago. I'll maybe ask Pierre just to do the recap and put a little bit of context into the quarters and also the deferred revenue as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, Vincent, definitely the increase in prepays is linked to the seeds business and mostly &#x2013; I mean most of it is linked to the seeds business in the U.S. So that's definitely what it is. And we read that as a very positive indicator supporting our order book. I mean that's certainly a very strong signal there. However, I mean as we said last year and I think the rationale is still the same. I mean it &#x2013; I think what it demonstrates is that the interest of farmers towards our product, their willingness to commit, their ability to deliver us with cash, which is a great thing because there's a lot of cash in the ag sector right now, but as long as there's not been anything planted in the U.S. at this point in time, I mean we don't want to read too much in this indicator.</p>
          <p>So it's certainly a very strong signal and we feel very good about it and it's been one of the reasons we felt, even at this early stage, we could raise our guidance, but we don't want to read more into this high number than what we &#x2013; I just said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could just ask a quick follow-up, it would be when you talked about the guidance as it relates to seeds and traits, I kind of got the sense from your comments that you were really just raising the seed and traits portion of the guidance based on your performance in Latin America, not based on the U.S. Did I hear that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. What I just said was because we see a strong order book in the U.S., we feel comfortable with our planning assumptions there. We're not seeing significant upsides there versus our guidance. And remember, Vincent, the way we look at the guidance is we look at the guidance as a whole. And what we do every time is we look at all the indicators around the globe, and we feel as an aggregate that we are in a good place, and obviously feeling good about the U.S. at this point in the year is an important element. But it's not driven by that.</p>

          <p>Hi. In the United States, you were planning to increase your penetration of your Genuity product line in corn by about 10 million acres, and that divides into Doubles and SmartStax and VT Triples. Where are the larger incremental acres coming from of those three? That is, is the fastest growth in SmartStax or in Doubles? And sort of, what's the faster-growing product line? What's the slower-growing product line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, thanks for your question. So we are &#x2013; it's kind of interesting and it's one of the penalties that comes with increasing guidance in the first quarter. So we're 15% in the year, we're still looking at putting seeds in the ground in several months' time. But if you look at the order book and you look at which is tracking well with our projections, across that family we see good growth or increased growth in SmartStax, probably followed by Doubles, you know a nice lift. Doubles is becoming a very important product for us. And the taper down, the decrease intentionally is in the Triples platform. So answer to your question, I'd say SmartStax up, Doubles up close behind it, and Triples phasing down in the overall mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that &#x2013; that's very helpful. And then quickly for Pierre, the tax rate in the first quarter is usually in the mid-30s, and this year it's in the mid-20s. Sort of why is that and have you changed your tax rate guidance for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've not &#x2013; this is linked to one discrete item related to some entity restructuring we did in Asia. This is a one-off discrete item that's driving the tax rate down for this quarter. And being a small quarter, it doesn't have an impact on the full year and was part of our planning assumptions. So it definitely shows up in the first quarter, but it's not something that's going to be material for the full year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Question on your guidance. You bumped up your gross profit guidance, Pierre, by $100 million, but ag productivity is up $200 million to $300 million. So where is the reduction in seed and genomics? Is it all in the Brazilian soy royalty collections? And of that $0.20 to $0.25 full year hit on Brazil, how much did you take in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, definitely, Don, the difference that &#x2013; I mean you pretty much answered the question. The difference in the guidance is definitely coming from Brazil soybeans at $0.20 to $0.25. And as far as the first quarter is concerned and soybeans are concerned, a fairly large part of the year-to-year reduction we are saying &#x2013; seeing in the first quarter is linked to Brazil and the soybean business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you're increasing ag productivity, is that all U.S.-branded price, or is there a mix benefit there too? And/or is there some volume growth that you're anticipating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's a combination of everything. So we've got more volumes in the first quarter than we had last year, for some small &#x2013; more volume. And we've got &#x2013; I mean price benefits all around the globe including, as you mentioned, mix benefits.</p>

          <p>If you thought about it, Don, on our price bands of $8 to $10 a gallon, we're probably broke through in the $10 to $12 range now, Pierre, I would guess?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for your question. So as you mentioned in your question, we need the final sign-off in China before we start planting in the U.S. here. So China's gone through &#x2013; before we start to plant in Brazil &#x2013; China's gone through change in leadership. Chinese New Year is coming up. So we've never forecast regulatory events. But as we sit here today, we're still feeling comfortable on the timelines that would get seed planted in Brazil in the fall of this year. So if you think about it, you know they're counter-seasonal, so their spring is our fall. So as we look out from now that seed will be moved to farm the back end of 2013 and given that, we feel &#x2013; we still feel good that we're in line given the changes in China, we're in line for the regulatory event to occur.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Great. And then have you guys given any sort of detail or color more recently in terms of your pricing for Intacta and how that might compare with what you charged for the old Roundup products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's &#x2013; we haven't. We've been &#x2013; and that's been one of the benefits to this Ground Breaker program. We've been consistently demonstrating four bushels or more of incremental yield, which creates about $80-something of new value if you take the machinery use, the spraying time and just the pure yield, that's the $80 that the Brazilian growers never seen before versus Roundup Ready 1. So the value proposition versus 1 is significantly higher and the appetite in the grower community also runs very high. So it's against that $80-plus of value that we'll be pricing the new Intacta, but we haven't declared yet.</p>

Hey, following up on the little bump you're getting on the Roundup side with generics staying at a little bit of an elevated level here, when you &#x2013; and how long do you anticipate that lasting? When would you anticipate that to cycle back down to more normal levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I &#x2013; Frank, I think defining what the new normal is, is difficult but I think this is a cyclical business. We do compete, we're kind of 50/50 and we compete against Chinese producers. The elevates &#x2013; so here's the difference versus the last time, which is maybe where you're going with this. We've stripped out a lot of cost in this business. We've collapsed SKUs and we've changed our business model completely. So I think we're a lot more agile, nimble and ready for that downturn when it occurs. And the premium that we're charging versus the Chinese is still very moderate.</p>
          <p>So I think the key in this, given the unknown of when the cycle will change, the key is stay realistic in your pricing and watch very carefully what that Chinese material is priced at. So I don't know what the cycle time is, but we're &#x2013; we've been very diligent and disciplined in how we track them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. So it's continuing for the near-term. There's no change. And then, Hugh, you're at a record net cash position right now. What do you plan on doing with all that money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a great problem to have, Frank, and I think our overall approach remains the same. I'll maybe ask Pierre to say a few words on repatriation but we're only in ag. This is our space. This is the only thing we do. So reinvesting that cash, shareholders' cash in this space is kind of job one for us. Absent M&amp;A and absent those reinvestment opportunities then we will be more aggressive in repatriation and returning it to owners. And, Pierre, maybe a few words on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're obviously considering our options at this point in time but as Hugh mentioned, I think our goal number one is obviously to grow our business internally or externally. And then the next step obviously is to return cash to our owners because we are very happy with our balance sheet, our balance sheet gives us a lot of flexibility versus the downturn and to grow our business as well. So now I mean we are focusing on returning cash to our owners. Over the last two years, we've returned about $2.2 billion and we are definitely committed to returning cash, and as I mentioned, we are considering all our options right now.</p>

          <p>Hugh, on the strong U.S. order book, any sense if any competitor or supply constraints helped the U.S. early orders? And looking into the full year, does this strength increase your confidence in gaining even more share in U.S. corn seed in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, so thanks for the question. In terms of competitive dynamics, it was a season that started early. It was an open fall. So the pace of the season, in many ways it resembled the year before, because farmers go harvest on early because of the drought. There was a lot of focus on securing their first pick on seeds. So I think for Monsanto and competitors, it was a high velocity back into the year.</p>
          <p>We did something a little bit different this year compared to what we've done in years gone by. We &#x2013; our estimate or our projection for the coming season is 96 million acres, which is pretty bold. But as I look today at the order book, our assumption would be that with the insight that the order book gives us, which is that early look, we feel pretty good with 96 million acres. And we feel very good about our ability to supply against the market of around that size. But it's funny, because we're speculating on what the heck happens next spring, and as you know, so much of what happens next spring is really determined by climatic conditions. So I think we've nailed the flag on 96 million acres, and we &#x2013; with everything that we've sold and look at the order book, we feel good against that number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, on Brazil, I hate to keep beating that one, but I guess a $0.25 dividend merits a little more inspection. You guys have mentioned an opportunity to collect royalties there and put them in escrow. Does the approach you're taking now for some sort of moderated agreement preclude you or change your strategy there? And where does that cash show up if you do take those &#x2013; that escrow account, if you build that escrow account? And lastly, can you help us on that $0.25 cadence through the year? Is most of it at the back-ended harvest? Is it distributed throughout the year? What should we expect in terms of subtracting out $0.25 for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say it's all on the table at this stage, Bob. We are &#x2013; as I mentioned in my comments, we are in advanced discussions. So we're &#x2013; I think we're well down the track with some of the grower groups in Brazil. And we'll &#x2013; so while we're in those discussions, it's hard to answer your question, but we're looking at business solution of this that gives us increased certainty on getting Intacta launched, and increased certainty on maintaining our collection system. And those are real &#x2013; that's what's really been driving the negotiations in Brazil. And frankly that's a two-way street between us and those grower groups.</p>
          <p>At &#x2013; here's the last piece of this and maybe this helps. There's no such thing as a soybean grower. So the guys that are growing soybeans are the same ones are buying and planting our corn. So getting this resolved in a business-friendly manner and driving the record adoption of our corn hybrids would be the definition of a good day, I think, for both us and the growers. So that's how I'm trying to thread the needle on this at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Hugh, if I can just follow up, I mean it still sounds a bit cryptic to me that if Intacta is as strong as you say it is, there should be no problem getting paid. And it's not an IP issue. It sounds like you're saying you need to keep the way you get paid seamless through the Intacta launch. So does that mean just getting some modest income in order to ensure that system is still running smoothly? Or what do you mean by making sure the Intacta goes smoothly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just &#x2013; no, let me &#x2013; I didn't mean to be cryptic, it's just &#x2013; it's hard to have a discussion on the line when we're also discussing this with our grower groups in Brazil. The opportunity in Intacta is significantly greater than any opportunity we've seen in Roundup Ready 1, because it creates much more yield. And with the insect control that it delivers, it's a revolutionary new product. So as we look at the Roundup Ready 1 problem, we've tried our best to find a solution of Roundup Ready 1 that guarantees our commercial delivery and our success on Intacta and on maintaining the collection system in Brazil. And those have been touch points in these negotiations. And the reception of that conversation has been very good in the Brazilian grower groups as well. So that's been the principle we've applied to this.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question is for Rob. Rob, with IFS, you've got the 2013 Ground Breakers trial. Can you talk about how do you price for this FieldScripts, is this an annual buy? And the reason I am asking is a typical grower feels that he knows his farm better than Monsanto. So how do you convince that grower? And do you need additional marketing dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great question, and happy New Year. On the overall, we're &#x2013; so we're still looking at the pricing and delivery options. I mean I think while we've generally heard back from growers as we've done our pilot studies and grower group focused sessions is up, they want to see the technology priced incrementally to the seeds so they know exactly the cost. We've been thinking about it as a one-year pricing and we'll clearly be sharing as we typically do the value created with the technology. I mean I view IFS just like I would any other yield trait. I mean it creates this incremental yield and we'll &#x2013; and if a grower can see a 5 to 10 bushel per acre boost with this technology, they'll certainly reward us with our fair share and they'll be happy with their incremental gain.</p>
          <p>I think the other important thing that we're seeing is &#x2013; and again to the heart of your question is, there's a lot of interest with growers because they've played around with various forms of precision farming, they've looked at maps, but none of them have worked and been easy. And I think the beauty of our system is it's worked and it's been demonstrated on the farm, in the hands of some of the best growers in the country and that's really exciting. I think the last point I'd make on IFS is we see it as a business that renews itself annually because environmental conditions change, farmers switch fields, there's different histories of moisture and fertilizer and disease. And so we're quite excited. And as I said in my talks, the fact that in a tough drought year, we were able to see that incremental value is really exciting and I think farmers interest in using best practices to take their data and optimize it and optimize their yields is right on target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And quickly on Latin America, your price lift in corn in Argentina seems much lower than Brazil. So what can you do to raise profitability in Argentina and do you need the POD system in place there to improve the profitability? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; I'll let Pierre say some &#x2013; I don't think there's a difference, P.J., I think what you're looking at is doubles versus triples, so it's product lineups or a platform play. But the general approach on pricing I think is pretty synonymous between the countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the logic is very similar. The rationale is very similar as well. And as Hugh mentioned, it's just &#x2013; the step of evolution in the build of the portfolio that's different in Brazil and Argentina. But going forward, we're very confident that, that they're going to still go on and track together in terms of the logic of our pricing. So I don't see that as a difference actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are you saying that doubles in Argentina and doubles in Brazil are similar and then triples in Argentina are higher than doubles in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the way we build our pricing and the way we build our pricing increases is similar. Remember, it all depends obviously on the agronomic conditions, on the benefit of the trait in the given region. But the logic of how we price and how we raise price is very similar when we introduce a new trait. So depending on the benefit of the trait in a given geography, we'll eventually price it differently but we always have the same philosophy of pricing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bryan. I can maybe add a little bit of clarity there in terms of the evolutionary stage. In Argentina, we're making the step-up from the Double to the Triple. In Brazil, you're making the initial step-up either from no traits to double stacks and then moving on to triples. You're just in a fast &#x2013; you're in a faster phase of ramp-up or a bigger magnitude of ramp-up in terms of where you are in Brazil versus the increment that you're doing just doubles to triples in Argentina. But it's exactly the same pattern and it's exactly the same pricing philosophy that Pierre outlined. It's just a different point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Another question on Ag Productivity. You mentioned that you expect a more steady-state environment at some point that you're just uncertain as to the timing. But I'm wondering what your thoughts are in terms of how a supplier response may come? Do you think it may come from the smaller players who exited the business in the last industry shakeout? Or will it come from the larger players given that it seems that there's more stringent environmental standards that are being adopted in China in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, thank you. It's hard to call, but our guess would be &#x2013; or our assumption is that it would come from the small players who go off stream and then come back on stream. So there's a lot of vessels lie empty, or there are multi-partners vessels that are switched on and off or are used for other things. When you get into that oversupply, you see prices slumping. And we've been watching imported material and being very vigilant on tracking those prices. But I think to your question, as some of the smaller producers, the larger ones are taking a lot more care now in environmental waste treatment and their environmental practices, and that's impacting their costs, as it should.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. My question is on the &#x2013; it may be a bit conceptual, but the Argentinian adoption of triple stacks of 40% in year two, could you perhaps maybe frame up your expectations of how you'd see Intacta playing out in Argentina, given that strong adoption that you've seen just over the past couple of years in corn traits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a great question. I think our assumption is the adoption of Intacta in Argentina and Brazil will be two of the fastest curves that we've seen in the last 15 years. And the reason for that is large farms, number one. Number two, they were rehearsing for a long time, so they've been waiting on this technology. So I can't under &#x2013; I can't emphasize enough the anticipation for getting this into the fields. Number three, it's a yield boost in beans that's never been seen in Argentina or in Brazil at a time when beans are premium priced.</p>
          <p>So we expect that the curve in both of these countries will be very aggressive, and that's why &#x2013; and it kind of comes to a few other questions today, that's why solid resolution on this Roundup Ready 1 dispute and clearing the path for Intacta and ensuring that we maintain our collection system is so incredibly important. If you look at Roundup Ready 1 beans today, it's about 3% of our gross profit. If you look forward and the value that's created by corn in Brazil and Argentina and the value that will be created by the Intacta launch given the velocity of those curves, that's a big piece of the future of this business. So thanks for the question.</p>

There's no doubt that the first quarter was a very strong quarter for us, and as Pierre made the point, it gives us the data points that reinforces our 2013 opportunity. In the near-term, and it's still early days, but in the near-term, we're seeing momentum from the growing Latin American opportunity as well as our core business and the order book in the U.S. And that's reflected in our confidence in raising guidance at this early point in the year. Beyond this year, we've increased our focus on being the yield company and delivering valuable yields to our customers. That's what they expect of us, and that shows in our strategy, it shows in our products, and it shows in the pipeline that Rob shared with you today. What matters to the grower is yield. And I tell you today that I believe we're in the best position to deliver that yield. We're expanding our competitive fleet, and that's what drives our opportunity in the long-term.</p>
          <p>So again, all the very best to you and yours as we start the new year. Thank you very much.</p>
