        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our nine months results.</p>
          <p>The break-even result is certainly not what we aspired to in the quarter, but I think still a very big achievement in light of the stress we have seen in the financial system. But I'd better leave the explanation and judgment to our CFO, J&#xF6;rg Schneider.</p>
          <p>We've also invited Torsten Jeworrek, CEO of the Reinsurance division, to update us on developments and trends in the reinsurance market. With that, over to J&#xF6;rg.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sascha. Welcome, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>We came through this difficult environment in relatively good shape. The figures overall are not pleasing, but without major surprises and, in my view, they clearly demonstrate the financial strength of the Group.</p>
          <p>Let me lead you through the main numbers. I'll start on page three with a summary. Net profit for nine months, 1.4 billion, and only plus 12 million for the third quarter on a stand-alone basis. Contrary to our indication in August, our earnings for 2008 will most likely be below 2 billion, because we saw a further sharp decline in stock markets and markets are still extremely volatile. But, the numbers demonstrate a solid financial strength with a stable shareholders' equity in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>What we did in risk management is currently paying off, and we do not reduce our ambition. We confirm our Changing Gear earnings per share target of at least &#x20AC;18 for 2010. And we will propose to our Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting a high dividend, which is unchanged against the preceding year of &#x20AC;5.50 and, we continue with our share buyback program as promised.</p>
          <p>Why are we so optimistic? The challenging environment has visible impact on insurance market, but reinsurance gains significance in financial crisis, especially for those who still are standing in a very strong manner. Clients benefit from the financial stability of Munich Re, which is well positioned to benefit from the hardening of the reinsurance cycle, hence to accomplish our strategic ambitions in primary insurance.</p>
          <p>And allow me a preliminary remark before we enter into the numbers. As you know, the IASB and the EU Commission have made some changes to accounting rules to facilitate reclassification of fixed interest financial instruments. As we already recognize our investments according to relatively conservative standards, and as we do not require any relief, thanks to our well-balanced investment policy and our solid capitalization, we will stick to our existing approach in the interest of transparency and continuity.</p>
          <p>Let's start with capitalization, which is in our view by far the most important topic at the moment. Our shareholders' equity remains stable compared to the preceding quarter, and the book value per share is &#x20AC;105.</p>
          <p>According to our internal risk model metrics, our available financial resources declined, but so did the required economic risk capital due to lower market risks involved now on this de-risk portfolio. Therefore, our available financial resources by far outweigh the required risk capital.</p>
          <p>And also for rating and regulation, we are very adequately and comfortably capitalized with a solvency ratio of roughly 270%, and an excess capital measured against our AA target level, which I cannot precisely define, but where I would guess it's roughly a mid-single-digit billion amount.</p>
          <p>This solidity has also been acknowledged by the market with a CDS spread of roughly 70 basis points only, which evidences the good financial security. And also two more indicators are quite strong. That is a 20.4% debt leverage, which reflects our secure financial strength and just &#x2013; or 9.5 times interest coverage, which is also at a comfortable level. So this financial strength supports the exploitation of our business opportunities.</p>
          <p>Development of shareholders' equity is shown on slide six. I would like to point your attention to the right hand side of that slide, where the change in the third quarter is shown, because the change up to then has already been explained in our August conference.</p>
          <p>The net unrealized gains were down by only &#x20AC;263 million. We had currency gains, especially due to the strong U.S. dollar in the third quarter, and we continued our share buybacks, which reduced the capital by &#x20AC;415 million; overall, equity declined by only &#x20AC;8 million.</p>
          <p>Next slide shows the development on a per share basis, which is for the last three months even a bit more favorable, with a slight increase due to the share buybacks. For the full year, it's 11.5% reduction following changes in unrealized gains and losses.</p>
          <p>One reason for this good development &#x2013; relatively good development, I have to say, is the constant active reduction in equity exposure. On slide eight, there is the asset allocation shown here, with the development since end of 2004. The first line expressed in percentage terms and the last line expressed in absolute euro numbers. Let us have a closer look at the development of these asset classes, and I'll start with the fixed interest securities, which are shown here with &#x20AC;96 billion.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, number nine, we show on the left hand side the development to a number of 94.7, this is without those held for trading, so the vast majority of these securities is booked as available for sale. This remains more or less flat. The negative changes in unrealized gains and losses were compensated by the changes in the amortized costs, which is the development from phase-three investments, write-ups, and write-downs.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, you can see the development of our equity portfolio, from 24 billion to 16 billion, minus eight billion. 3.7 out of these eight are due to a change in unrealized gains and losses, and 4.3 due to a change in amortized costs. You can find more on that on the following slides.</p>
          <p>With the next two slides, 10 and 11, we want to demonstrate that the actual developments in our portfolio are consistent with those of the market. First, slide 10, with regard to the change in interest rates and their impact on our fixed interest security portfolio.</p>
          <p>It's a portfolio together with the loans of &#x20AC;135 billion, whereof about &#x20AC;63 billion are held in government bonds and another 71 billion in risk-carrying bonds, like corporate bonds, Pfandbriefe, and so on.</p>
          <p>In the next column, you see the yield change. Interest free rates minus 20 basis points, and an increase in risk spreads. This is the weighted average between our corporate bonds and Pfandbriefe of plus 92 basis points. If we multiply these changes with the modified duration, we come up with a change in market value &#x2013; an expected change in market value, of an increase of 700 million for the government bonds, and the decline of 2.9 billion for the corporate bonds and the Pfandbriefe, and altogether, a balance of minus 2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Now we compare that to the actual movement in our portfolio on the right hand side. And as you can see, this is one minus 1.9 billion only, but this difference is easily explained by the development &#x2013; by the losses we put in the P&amp;L due to the write-downs, for example, for our Lehman exposure. So, to summarize, the market development of &#x2013; explained the value movements of our fixed interest security portfolio pretty well.</p>
          <p>The same applies, on the next page, for our equity portfolio and after hedges, this was a number of &#x20AC;17.6 billion at the beginning of the year. The decline of the euro stocks was 31%. If I multiply the two, I end up with a minus 5.5 billion, which is roughly in line with the development in the income statement, the net impact in our shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize, the developments in our portfolio fit quite well to the movement of the market; no surprises here.</p>
          <p>On page 12, you can see the development of our equity-backing ratio over the year, starting from 13.8% before hedges, 10.8 after hedges and down at the end of September to 9.3 before and 4.6 after hedges, which demonstrates that on one hand the market did the job. On the other hand, we increased our hedge ratio actively and our exposure actively, and this is the reason why we could mitigate some of the losses we would have experienced if we had stayed with our original portfolio in an unchanged way.</p>
          <p>And I may add the development in October, we are further down, especially with our hedging activities, we now come up with an un-hedged equity-backing ratio between two and 3% only.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we show some sensitivities to further market movements beginning with end of September. First, on the left-hand side, left upper side, sensitivity to change in risk-free rates. On the lower &#x2013; left low side, the sensitivity to spreads, starting from the current spread on our risk exposed portfolio of 212 basis points. As you can see, the impact from the spreads is much lower than the impact from the risk free-rate, which can easily explained by relatively low level of risk exposure we take &#x2013; we still take with credit risk.</p>
          <p>I must add here a disclaimer, which is also shown on the bottom of this page. This is not a precise calculation, because all the relations are not linear and it's not so easy to calculate the impact. But more or less, as a rule of thumb this should give you a very good indication for what is actually happening in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, this is more familiar to you, the equity gearing; this is the ratio of our actual equity exposure after hedges and policyholder participation to the shareholders' capital. With a ratio of only 22%, our portfolio should be pretty resilient to further stresses from the equity market.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, there is the investment return on the upper hand for the third quarter on a stand-alone basis with a return on investment of 1.6% and for the full year of 3.1%. These are absolutely rather poor numbers, but satisfactory in light of the circumstances and compared also to some others. What were the main drivers of the deterioration? This you can see on the bottom of this page with the two shaded lines and also on the next two slides.</p>
          <p>Let me first start with the development of the write-downs and write-ups of our investments. As you can see on slide 15, our available for sale non-fixed investment write-downs were almost &#x20AC;4 billion, 3.8 more than in the preceding year. And this was to some extent compensated by write-ups in our derivatives portfolio, which were 2.5 billion higher than in the preceding year.</p>
          <p>On the bottom of that page, you can find a breakdown of the reasons of our impairments. 4 billion overall impairments, partially due to hedge accounting to the once impaired always impaired rule and to the 20% or six-month rule. I would like to underline here that we very rigidly and rigorously stick to these rules and, therefore, the unrealized losses in our portfolio are very limited.</p>
          <p>The second driver is shown on slide 16. These are &#x2013; this is a strong reduction in the gains from disposal in comparison to last year. Last year was an exceptional good year with very high gains from selling stocks and from selling real estate. And like we stressed last year, this could not be sustainable and this year is definitely below our long-term expectation here.</p>
          <p>So, these losses hurt us but they could have been higher if we had not de-risked our portfolio consistently during the last couple of years. And this is also demonstrated by the low beta of the Munich Re stock, which is shown on slide 17. It has somewhat increased with the market, but clearly stays below one and compared to the industry, the gap has widened.</p>
          <p>So much for the aspects of the financial market, now an overview of the results on slide 18. Gross premiums written there were flat, combined ratio in property-casualty went up by 2.2 percentage points. In primary insurance, it went down by 2.7 percentage points. Investment results almost half to &#x20AC;3.9 billion; operating results minus 39% to &#x20AC;2.4 billion, and the consolidated result, as you saw, &#x20AC;1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>To the investment results on the next slide, 19, the &#x2013; so all segments were &#x2013; came in lower with their operating result and their consolidated result, but the reduction in reinsurance was mitigated by the dividend paid by ERGO to Munich Re parent company, which belongs to the reinsurance segment. And this dividend has to be consolidated, so this was a measure of capital management within the Group without any impact to the net earnings of the Group.</p>
          <p>All these numbers speak for themselves, now a few more figures from the segment, starting with reinsurance on slide 21. Gross premiums written are &#x20AC;16.1 billion, more on that later; investment result, almost 3 billion, including the ERGO dividend; and operating result, also including ERGO dividend, &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The premium development is shown on slide 22. We had, you can see that at the first glance, foreign-exchange effects of minus 1.3%, which were &#x2013; which happened in the first two quarters. This was partially compensated by the effects of the acquisition of Midland and Sterling.</p>
          <p>In life, we had very special developments. We cancelled in an orderly way four very large accounts, which contributed almost minus or more than minus 600 million premium income and had similar impacts on almost all other profit and loss items. And apart from this, we had a very nice organic increase in some areas and some new business in property-casualty.</p>
          <p>The combined ratio on the next slide needs to have some explanation with regard to the Q3 number. It came in lower than many expected in view of the fact that we had this high losses from the Hurricanes Ike and Gustav of almost &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, and as you perhaps remember, we had very high losses from Australia in the first quarter, which were estimated at that time with &#x20AC;200 million. And, well, it turned out meanwhile that our original estimation was too high and we could reduce these losses by some 70 million and this made up for &#x2013; or this contributed positively with two percentage points on the combined ratio of this quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, on a nine-month basis, this is a clean combined ratio with ups and downs from various sources, but no change in confidence level for our results.</p>
          <p>So much for reinsurance, now a quick look to primary insurance before I hand over to Torsten, who will give you more flesh on reinsurance. On slide 25, the key numbers of primary insurance segment; gross premiums written, up 4%; investment results significantly down with 2.1 billion, property-casualty combined ratio, 90.2%; and operating result &#x2013; this good underwriting results could partially balance the lower investment results, so only down to &#x20AC;674 million.</p>
          <p>Organic growth was very satisfactory overall with plus &#x20AC;160 million. I'm on slide 26. Meanwhile, in addition, this growth came especially from Eastern Europe and Turkey. And organic growth came from health business also with new business abroad and some increase in premiums at DKV. And in addition, we had the acquisition of DAUM Direct. This is a Korean Company, a direct selling insurer.</p>
          <p>On the lower part of this graph, you see the breakdown by segment with property-casualty increasing by 5.2%, due to the acquisition of DAUM and the organic growth in Turkey and the CE countries.</p>
          <p>Just a quick word on life, as you can see on the right, lower right-hand side overall life statutory premiums were flat; IFRS premiums minus 2.3%; investment oriented products plus 10.7%. And this leads me to the next slide where we show the new business statutory premiums for our ERGO subsidiary.</p>
          <p>In Germany, the new premiums are up 2.2% and on an APE basis, 7.1%, but this increase in regular premiums is mainly due to the fourth Riester stage. These are the investments oriented product, which I referred to before, and which are the explanation for the strong increase here.</p>
          <p>With the other sales, we are not fully satisfied. The insurance contract law had some negative impact on new business sales. International, we are very pleased with the development with excellent growth in Poland and Baltic states and good unit-linked business from Austria.</p>
          <p>Combined ratio, this is &#x2013; we have pleasure to stop with it here; an overall, very favorable development with normal fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. The decline in the combined ratio for the first nine months by more than 2% is partially due to the reduced administrative expenses, and also due to some luck and lower natural catastrophe claims. But this is a great performance, which we see here.</p>
          <p>And with that, to Torsten who will talk about reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to give you our latest view on the current market environment at the beginning of January 1 renewals in property and casualty. And as you may remember, we gave you a first projection and our expectation in Monte Carlo early September.</p>
          <p>And I would like to cover basically the questions, what has changed since then? What are the early indications for the renewals? And to underline or to explain our projection that we would like to cover the development of the capital base of our industry, give an indication of retention levels and demand for reinsurance, and discuss increasing flight to quality in reinsurance.</p>
          <p>And on slide 31, that is an update here of our Monte Carlo slide of an internal analysis. We have shown in this analysis in Monte Carlo our own projection for the capital base in the reinsurance industry, an estimate for the year-end 2008 and at that time, end of August, early September, we estimated a potential reduction in the capital base of the reinsurance industry of about 8% at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>We now updated this projection, so a revised analysis. And as a consequence of the capital markets you see here, that we now project minus 13% in worldwide reinsurance.</p>
          <p>In addition to our own projections, there are now in the meantime external sources available. I would like to mention Towers Perrin and VJ Dowling. They made analysis of projections for the U.S. P&amp;C insurance market and came up with potential reductions in the capital base in the order of 80 to $100 billion and that would mean that particularly in the U.S. market all the excess capital would disappear.</p>
          <p>What are other developments? Well, we go into lower interest environment, which means that there will be a very natural upward pressure on rates and insurance and reinsurance. There is no alternative to that. And we see us confronted and our industry confronted with higher capital costs due to the change in volatility.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of these developments in the capital market, we do see early signs &#x2013; first signs of recalculations of the technical rates, with upward pressure. We do certainly contribute to that development. First time since years we see now discussions about reductions in retentions and an increase in the session &#x2013; reinsurance sessions, and we see at the same time extraordinary demands for requests of larger quota share treaties, both in life and in non-life as a substitute for capital of companies who are in a more difficult position now.</p>
          <p>Flight of quality does increase, I will cover that later and I would like to mention, you might have seen that or read that about one week ago, the reinsurance broker, Benfield, published an own study about market environment, which is fully in line with our expectation meaning, as to their &#x2013; we can expect an increase in reinsurance rates in the coming year.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we have shown here the CDS spreads of Munich Re and some of our peers. Security of the Munich Re, it's an issue. Security of reinsurance is an issue and we have noted that even our clients use this CDS spreads to get an indication or feeling about market perception of security, and if you look at the slide here, the Munich Re is considered by the financial market as the safe haven in our industry, because more and more clients use us basically as an additional instrument to ratings and their own analysis, which we &#x2013; what we appreciate, of course, no doubt.</p>
          <p>We see us in a very reasonable position, also to justify better prices and higher prices for the Munich Re reinsurance product, which is the better one, particularly in the current environment. We use it although to argue for differential terms.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, 33, I would like to highlight our pricing policy. Let me assure you, nothing has changed since September, since Monte Carlo in our various press releases. Munich Re is fully committed to our pricing policy, which we want and we will increase prices in the coming renewals for &#x2013; in 2009, and we improve conditions wherever necessary.</p>
          <p>Of course, and that is not new and should not be surprised, we take into account client specific considerations according to current profitability from the specific treaties, but that is not in contradiction that we go for higher prices. Our capacity will remain unchanged, that means we will provide our full capacity for our clients if pricing targets can be met, otherwise we move it into other areas and segments, or even withdraw if necessary.</p>
          <p>Further consideration, you might have read and seen the update or the projections for the retro capacity; in difference to our own retrocession policy, some of our peers do depend more on retrocession to provide their growth capacity and retro capacity does shrink.</p>
          <p>For various reasons, investment into site cost came down. Traditional retro capacity is tight. CAT bonds are more difficult available today, because of at least a temporary change in investors' risk appetite. And all these things together lead to a, sort of shrinkage in capacity in retro, so that I would personally expect that gross capacity in some cases where reinsurers depend on retro capacity comes under pressure as well.</p>
          <p>We think that the current market environment is the best time for the Munich Re to reinforce our differential pricing and terms policy. And we think it's not only to the advantage of Munich Re where, as I explained, Munich Re provides better than more secure product. It's always to the advantage of our clients. Why should the client pay the same price for different security?</p>
          <p>So, we see ourselves well positioned in the current market environment, you can be sure pricing is a must for us, we will also take advantage of the new opportunities during the course of 2009, which are a consequence of capital market frictions. And we think, bottom line, we will be the one reinsurer who will definitely benefit from the current crisis. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Torsten. And what Torsten said is exactly the reason, why we confirm our mid-term targets. On slide 35, you see an overview of our guidance or lack of guidance perhaps for the extraordinary year 2008.</p>
          <p>The consolidated result will be probably below &#x20AC;2 billion due to the ongoing adverse capital markets. But nevertheless, we are sticking to our dividends for 2008 of &#x20AC;5.5 per share.</p>
          <p>Some slight changes in gross premiums written. Combined ratio in reinsurance of 98, it's quite obvious, this is only achievable if major claims are clearly below statistical expectations for the last couple of weeks of this year. I cannot exclude it, but it's highly unlikely.</p>
          <p>Combined ratio in primary insurance states clearly below 95, in line with what we experienced in the preceding quarter. The return on investment targets of 4.5% will not be reached. It will be substantially below 4% in 2008 due to the current highly uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>Our mid-term targets are to spend. We will be adhering to these targets for earnings per share, share buybacks and dividends. And the only long-term target, which is our overall guidance, that is the return on risk adjusted capital of at least 15% over the cycle. This looked extremely modest some two years ago, when we first mentioned the target. Today, it looks much more ambitious and I think it's something, which is at least reasonable. And we try to go for it.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and back to Sascha.</p>

          <p>We shall take our first question now from Michael Huttner of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. And I had two questions. What &#x2013; in terms of your excess capital relative to the S&amp;P model, a figure which was about five billion in May, two to three billion in June. Where's that figure now? And can you explain the moving parts, because I read somewhere, or maybe I heard from one of your IR team that the S&amp;P model had been changed or relaxed in some way and I wanted to know what the sensitivity was there.</p>
          <p>And the other question I had, you mentioned the increased support that Seatons may be looking for in terms of quota share treaties and stuff. And I just wondered whether you could be a little bit more precise, I mean which countries, or which kinds of business, or what size of quota share, just to give an indication of how big an extra demand boost we might see. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. First excess capital with S&amp;P; it was always true what I said, I think it that you don't doubt it. And it was pretty high at the beginning of the year, because our capitalization, our shareholders' equity was more &#x2013; somewhat stronger than today. Then it declined.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, the model was revised and some risk mitigation elements were acknowledged in the model as we had always expected and this gave us additional room. And at the moment, as I said before, the mid-single-digit number again, like at the beginning of the year. Torsten, with regard to the increased support for client.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of course, difficult to give detailed information without mentioning the client now. Basically, it's whole account quota shares both on the life side or on the non-life side; regions in general Asia, some in Europe, premium volumes in the order of 100 million plus premium, sometimes much more. That is what I can give now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And two things please; firstly, in terms of pricing, how confident are you &#x2013; or how likely do you think it is that you can achieve price rises in excess of the change in technical price? Said other words, can you get a wider margin even taking into account lower reinvestment rates?</p>
          <p>And the second thing is just on impairments. I'm wondering if you can give us any guidance into what the impairments might look like in Q4 with the market at these levels. I am guessing probably most equities are verging on being impaired now. So can we just take the total change in markets and apply that to the net equity exposure you've got? Or is that too simplistic? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with the prices, Torsten here. I give you, let's say, examples where we have early indications or where we have already indications, because that's single risk business where we get cases already on our desk. In terms of treaty, I cannot comment now, it's too early. Renewable be finished only in December according to my expectation.</p>
          <p>But let's come to the &#x2013; go to the single risk business. Single risk, I give you five examples where we definitely think we will get price increases, which are higher than technical, let's say, than compensation of lower interest environment or so.</p>
          <p>This is the fire industrial business, which is in uncertainty now, with price increase, sometimes even price reductions; for our portfolio definitely price increases; aviation business has began to move upward; energy business &#x2013; offshore energy business particular and the facultative business in Australia; in addition, the space.</p>
          <p>So that is all, so to speak, more than compensation for interest reduction. We have one class of business where we're still calculating what will be necessary. That is credit. In credit business, we see, of course, sharp and very dramatic price increases, particularly in the exposed markets like UK, Spain and the U.S.</p>
          <p>And here, of course, we have to take into account that we have to catch up with a very sharp increase in the expected loss ratio in a recession scenario. Yes, so credit is certainly driven by higher exposures like D&amp;O by the way. But in the other mentioned lines of business, we go higher than reduction and interest environment.</p>
          <p>That's what I can give now. Treaty as mentioned is too early, but also here, our expectation is higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the further impairment, what I can more or less safely say is that if markets recover to the level they had at the end of June with &#x2013; at the end of September, which was roughly Euro Stocks 50 at 3,000, then we would only have a high double-digit number of further impairment.</p>
          <p>If they stay at the current level, it's difficult to say from day-to-day, I would roughly say some billion, but with a very high hedge on it. Yes, so the overall impact is so much mitigated that I have given up to be reported numbers on a daily basis.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I've got two questions. Obviously, you're giving some pretty bullish outlook for your P&amp;C business. I guess where it's slightly less clear is on the outlook for the two life businesses you have. Looking at the &#x2013; some of the premiums on the single premium side in Germany, you are showing declines of, I think, 6.4% the slide said.</p>
          <p>And I guess in this economic environment, could you possibly give a little bit of an outlook on where you see new premiums going? And also, given falling yields, how you see the profitability of this business going forward? And then secondly, on the life reinsurance business; I mean, you did mention that you are seeing some demand for some quota share contracts out there. And I guess there must be some kind of financing demand. But then again, you and a number of your competitors are showing worse results at the moment. This is quite an opaque area and it is not intuitive how the kind of core term assurance business, at least, is going to be fairing up well in this economic environment, which presumably isn't going to be great for life reinsurance either.</p>
          <p>In this current economic environment, not assuming some kind of recovery, but in this environment, what can we realistically expect in terms of the run rate for these businesses into next year? And to what extent is that going to be a drag on the opportunities that you obviously see in the P&amp;C side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at first on the primary insurance, and, yes, our expectation in the short term is perhaps somewhat moderate, I would say. People seem to be somewhat irritated about the economic environment and it's too early to say how that &#x2013; or how much of an impact that will have on their buying behavior here.</p>
          <p>At the moment they shy away from entering into any long-term contract. That's our observation at least. Mid-term, we expect guarantee products to be of specific interest because people have rediscovered the value of security. And also, we regard our relative position on the market as being relatively favorable here.</p>
          <p>So, I can only give you here a very cautious outlook, because it is much too early for us to judge what the economic impact of this crisis will be and how people will react with regard to their old-age provision. In the long run, we are still optimistic here.</p>
          <p>With regard to life re, first on the accounting effects you observe here. As I said before, we lost &#x2013; or we cancelled together with the client, some pretty big contracts, and they had an enormous impact on almost all P&amp;L items. And therefore, it's very difficult to sort it out here at the moment. We didn't have any negative experience from mortality in the third quarter and also in the full year. We had it a little bit earlier, I think, than our competitors. Last year, we also had some negative developments here, but this year, touch wood, looks very stable. And on the expectation for life re business, Torsten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one additional comment, you mentioned mortality, not an issue. So also our results are not affected by that. In a, let's say, recessionary type scenario there may be some impact on the disability side where larger losses are transferred into the private insurance systems that is a potential threat, not a sizeable or probably.</p>
          <p>Questions of new deals &#x2013; new demand, not financial reinsurance treaties with a limited risk transfer; we basically have two different requests, or demands, on our table. One is, so to speak, treaties with pre-financing function, so where we pay in cash and the pure normal risk transfer quota shares. Pre-financing treaties are approached with very limited risk appetite. We would not completely exclude it, but we would like to keep the liquidity on board in the current environment. Normal risk transfer treaties are very welcome, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to give two additional informations; one is the decline in single premium business comes from our banking corporations and this is, in my view, not a surprise under the current circumstances. And second, I said before that we would have additional impairments, some billion or so. I didn't want to express a couple of billion. It's roughly one billion. I want to correct that because it's really important, it's not so severe. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, J&#xF6;rg. Hi there, Torsten. Just two questions; one is just on the man-made losses. We've seen &#x2013; I think, the first three quarters to reflect the experience in the reinsurance business that you had in the full-year '07. And if my memory serves me right, that is &#x2013; both those numbers are sort of higher than your expected run rate on man-made &#x2013; large man-made losses.</p>
          <p>Just wondering what your thoughts are on that experience, whether it's just a couple of coincidentally large years? And also, what your view is on the sort of recessionary impact potentially on those sorts of numbers? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, just &#x2013; interestingly you pointed that down. You had a flurry of activity over the last 12 months on the sort of acquisition of primary businesses. So, there's two parts to this. Just if you could give us a quick runthrough on the pipeline, given your potentially favorable capital spend relative to your competitors?</p>
          <p>And also just, if you're seeing or being able to pull out any benefits from holding these sort of primary businesses, globally transferring knowledge and experience between those, or whether you're holding them purely as sort of arms length businesses that you're sort of consolidating, but not operationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking of primary insurance within reinsurance? I didn't catch that; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right, yes. Where you've acquired the primary businesses and effectively I think they run through your insurance business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, and &#x2013; please, Andrew, if you could help us again, is your first question was about capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about the man-made losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, man-made losses, that is clear; but then, about the M&amp;A activities, capital requirement very low for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just in terms of your &#x2013; the pipeline, what you have in the pipeline on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Yes. Yes, so let me start with the pipeline. Yes, we have already said that we are interested in some assets of the AIG Group and the process is ongoing. I cannot give any guess how probable it is whether we will be successful here. But you can rely on the fact that we do any analysis here in a very thorough way; that we do not hurry; that we do our due diligences, and that we try to preserve this risk aware stance, which we had during the last couple of years. Torsten, on the large losses and man-made especially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your question is very understandable. I mean, it's difficult to answer. I tend to say that the increased frequency of losses is still random. So it's, at least for our portfolio, not outside the fluctuating or the range of fluctuation. One can, of course, not completely exclude that at the end of a very strong market environment, all production runs with 100% that you have some delay, the certain increase in loss frequency. We know that, but we cannot prove yet that this is outside the normal fluctuation yet. That is the best answer I can give now; so probably normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Fine. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from James Quin of Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, good afternoon. My first question is on investment income and this is just the regular investment income. So nothing to do with realised gains and losses. If you take the total investment income less investment expenses for the first nine months and exclude the primary life business, and you compare that to the investment income in the first nine months of 2007. There's about a 15% decline and that's obviously on a &#x2013; not allowing for the fact that you've had some acquisitions in there, which would have given you some investment income.</p>
          <p>I just wonder if, J&#xF6;rg, you could give us some sign of what is driving that, and whether you would see any extraneous factors in there, which we shouldn't extrapolate, or effectively whether we should use the nine-month level as the base going forward. And then the second question is just on M&amp;A again. I wonder if you could give us a bit more insight into what it is you're thinking? Is it big deals, small deals? Are you thinking life or non-life? Are you thinking Europe or Asia? And is it reinsurance or primary insurance? So if you could give us a bit more of a steer there that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And my third question is then on &#x2013; just on the equity. You've obviously hedged most of your equity exposures now, but I mean why bother owning equities if you're going to hold such a small level? Why not just sell them and be done with it, and that way we wouldn't need to be even thinking about this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, James. Your first question is about the lower level of regular investment income. This is due to the cancellation of the major life treaties, which also mean that our deposits held as a reinsurer went down quite dramatically. If you have a look at our consolidated balance sheet, you can also see that on page 24 of our quarterly report, that it went down from 8.2 to &#x20AC;6 billion and that has an impact. Second reason, and this impact is sustainable. But also there's a corresponding development on the expenses side. So the margin we lose is very, very, very, very low. And the second effect is currency. So currency was weak over the year 2008. It's going to be harder now, so this is not sustainable. With M&amp;A...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, J&#xF6;rg, there must be something else, because if I just look at the P&amp;C reinsurance, the P&amp;C reinsurance stand-alone is down 17% year-to-date. So I mean it looks like you're getting &#x2013; obviously, a lot of your bond portfolio maturing and reinvesting at lower rate, or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That has also to do with an artificial split we do on the investment returns of the Munich Re AG, which is the basic carrier of, I think, almost 80% of our reinsurance business. And therefore, there is some mixing up of the effects. We regret that but it's unavoidable, because we use constant keys over a certain period. So this is going to level out. And the currency, the currency is severe here.</p>
          <p>And on M&amp;A, first of all, we have a strategy and up to now we are convinced that this strategy is the right one for a Group like ours. Therefore, we don't forget the strategy when talking about M&amp;A. That does not mean that we follow overpriced opportunities just because they fit to our strategy, but even at the current time whatever we do is quite in line with what we had defined.</p>
          <p>That is, for the primary insurance business an expansion abroad, especially into CE countries, also very selectively into Asia and South and Eastern Europe. And life and non-life, both interesting to us. For reinsurance, this is the further expansion of our reinsurance &#x2013; primary insurance activities out of reinsurance. Wherever we think that this is a niche market where our expertise &#x2013; our risk expertise can bring value also to a potential target, there we are interested, like in the case of Midland.</p>
          <p>And this holds true also for some assets of the AIG Group, and especially &#x2013; and at the moment, I must say that I see a rather low probability for something big to happen very soon, yes, because we haven't seen the pricing coming down to the level which we would regard as being sustainably profitable for us. But let's see, perhaps the market circumstances will change that.</p>
          <p>And low level of equities, this is very difficult to predict. At the beginning of the year when we were at high single-digit percentage equity-backing ratio, we felt quite comfortable and we felt that this is adequate for our business.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we are very grateful that we brought the exposure down so dramatically. I dare to think that we will increase it again but never to the levels, at least not in my term as the CFO of this company to the levels we had a couple of years ago. So I would guess it will be something between low single-digit and high single-digit percentage. But this is not something, which we want to discuss in the laboratory. At the moment, we are between two and 3% exposure, and we think that this is adequate for this very difficult market phase.</p>
          <p>Does it answer your questions, James?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, I guess on the M&amp;A front, I mean, we've just done a canter through pretty much the whole of the world insurance markets. I mean it doesn't seem like there's very much which you're not looking at. I mean I don't want to be facetious about this, but there's an awful lots of areas where you could be acquiring. Is that a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes. We are somewhat opportunistic too at the moment, yes but we can't do all at the same time. So we concentrate our forces here, and especially our expertise in a small number of due diligences. We cannot afford more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had two questions, please. First of all, on primary life insurance, can you just tell us where you stand with the yield you're achieving and the guarantees you have to pay? If you'd even just set out what is the average guarantee on the back book? And has the balance sheet been run down to the extent that we should expect life insurance segment earnings really to stay low now for some time even if markets snap back up?</p>
          <p>The second question then, maybe this is the same question, James was asking; just on the running yield, you're 4.6%, running yield achieved in the third quarter, can you comment on the direction we should expect that to take? I'm assuming down, given how government bond yields have come down, but if you'd just comment on that, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian, this is true. Second question, direction down. The direction of the risk-free yields is somewhat mitigated by the increasing spreads, but we are not so courageous that we will make enormous use of these opportunities.</p>
          <p>Your first question, our average yield on the reserves, which require a yield, is 3.5%. Sorry, the guarantee, the guarantee which is required on the &#x2013; just on the reserves, which require this guarantee. And this guarantee is slowly moving down over time, because as you know new business has sold at 2.25%. And this is all based on local GAAP and, therefore, it's difficult to translate the IFRS numbers into the actual impact at the moment.</p>
          <p>So, at the moment, we don't worry. And in addition, I would like to mention that we have insured ourselves with options against Japanese interest rate scenario. This is very important. Therefore the very, very bad downside has been protected here.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. First of all, on the life reinsurance business, at the recent Investor Day, you flagged a normalized technical result of about &#x20AC;300 million per year, that would be about 75 a quarter or 225 in the first nine months. With reference to that could you just give an indication, if you can't even give an exact number of what the third quarter and nine month technical results for life re might have looked like? And again, if you can't be exact, if you can just say where you are relative to that normal result?</p>
          <p>And then secondly please, on slide six, I'm just interested, in that roll forward of shareholders' funds, if you could give an indication of the benefit that you were receiving from all this different hedging that you've been doing. And if possible sort of breaking it down between that benefit and the profit line and the unrealized gain roll forward line. And then finally, if you can, on slide 53, you give a great breakdown of your unrealized gains. I was wondering, again, if you know what those numbers are by the end of October, please? I guess for the three or four big, not the real estate, but the other three big lines in that slide 53. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>William, starting with your last question, we don't disclose on a monthly basis, I beg your pardon, please. But it's absolutely not dramatic, due to the speed of our write-down from quarter-to-quarter. Your first question was about life reinsurance. The technical underwriting results per quarter in the order of 70 million or so in this quarter here. So the result was basically impacted by the investment losses. That was it; nothing else. Last &#x2013; or the middle question was how much we benefit from our hedging activities? Could you explain a bit what you would expect here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Again, I'm trying to make what I know is a complex question very, very easy, but I'm just saying on slide six, you had the impact of earnings in the roll forward of your shareholders' funds and then you had the impact of the unrealized gain movement on the shareholders' funds.</p>
          <p>So, I guess, I'm asking what that 12 and that minus 263. Now presumably, if you hadn't been hedging, both of those numbers could have been, let's say, considerably worse. And I'm just wondering, again, I know you've given us lots of numbers somewhere, but if you could just say how those two numbers in that roll forward of shareholders' funds benefited from your hedging activities?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Not spontaneously. So, the unrealized gains as shown here are unrealized on the available for sale portfolio, whereas the hedging, the derivatives are mark-to-market directly through the P&amp;L. So, you would see it as a consolidated result if we had other hedging activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So pretty much all of the hedging is going straight through the income...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, absolutely. That is true, yes. Sorry for having misunderstood your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, J&#xF6;rg. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Roland Pf&#xE4;nder of Commerzbank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three questions, if I may. Firstly, the expense ratio went up by 2.4% year-over-year in the quarter in P-C reinsurance, is there any specific reason for this? Secondly, coming to M&amp;A, what do you think would be a possible budget for doing a larger acquisition before you would come to the capital market for further funds? And thirdly, could you give us an indication of spread widening in your corporate portfolio and covered bonds? And maybe fourth question, do you do any hedging in the covered bond portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first. The increase in expenses is, as far as I remember, not administrative expenses. This is basically commissions going up, and then &#x2013; but I look it up in the next break here. Second, you ask about the M&amp;A budget, there is not such a budget. We know exactly what we could invest. This has to do with rating. This has to do with liquidity. This has to do in the long run also with another bottleneck that is our revenue reserve in the Munich Re AG. Yes, this is not directly affected if you do an acquisition, but you shouldn't have a lot of write-down challenges here.</p>
          <p>So therefore, we won't be too courageous. There is room for, let's say, a low to mid-single digit number, a billion number, which we could safely finance without going to the capital market. Then the next question about spread widening, there is no hedging or very small corporate &#x2013; very small hedging activities for the corporate. And what was the question about the spread widening, could you repeat that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any figure for the average spread widening in October?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I don't have it at hand, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Kevin Ryan of ING. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'd just like to ask about the 2010 target which, from where we're sitting now looks some &#x2013; and even sort of six months ago, to be honest, looked very ambitious. Could you just say if it is a hard target or more of an ambition? And also, in trying to achieve that target, whether you see the mix of investment and underwriting being similar to what we experienced before? Or just try and give us some feel for how you see your business rolling forward, because I have to say, from where we're now sitting, it looks a wonderful dream, but a dream nonetheless? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, interesting question, yes. It is a target and it is ambitious, so in a way both. It's very difficult to see now where the world will move, especially with regard to the capital market.</p>
          <p>Let's imagine a scenario where they found the bottom and from that we could have another moderate increase in stock markets, we will very soon &#x2013; we would in such a case, very soon have unrealized gains and we would very soon have the potential to realize part of these gains, and to have an active asset management policy here.</p>
          <p>On the underwriting side, there are some challenges from the economical development. We see these. Torsten has mentioned just some of that, but it's very difficult to judge now what will be the impact on it. Let's say, two months ago, we would have been less bullish than we are at the moment. So we really expect some additional profitability to come from the underwriting side, just because circumstances have changed and because the relative strength of Munich Re has become obvious to everybody. And therefore, we are still optimistic that this ambitious target is not unrealistic.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Fabrizio Croce of Kepler. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have also two one, but short one. First of all, in terms of target, the two billion &#x2013; below two billion target, which you actually shared with us, actually could also mean a negative figure. So the question is; if you could give some sense in terms of where you see the floor for this figure?</p>
          <p>The second one is terms of structured product. I saw some headlines about your structured products portfolio increasing. But on slide 50, it is pretty much in line with what you shared with us in the half year. So the question is if there is some more hidden somewhere, or if this is all?</p>
          <p>And the third question is about the price expansion that you see of around plus 10%. This is on the price side, but given that your two main competitors are pretty much in trouble, there should be also a tremendous volume expansion, which comes through, and so the question is if you see it the same way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with this new outlook, or missing outlook for 2008. This is just because the volatility is so high. Therefore, we don't dare to give you any guidance here. One could just give a schedule with all the Euro Stoxx numbers and spreads and so on, and I think this gets less meaningful. I stressed, always, in the press release that I said gain, what will be the gain for 2008? So, I would be not only surprised, I can practically exclude that it is a loss, unless we have the mega event here. Also, please take the sign of the dividend as being an important signal here. We would not promise such a dividend at that time of the year if we would expect ourselves to fall into nowhere. Structured portfolio, yes, unchanged. We bought some in the first half, but not in the third quarter. Price expansion, Torsten.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You basically asked for the volume expansion, if I understood you correctly, which is associated or linked to the price expansion. Yes, you are right, I support your assumption &#x2013; or we support your assumption. How much volume increase? Difficult to answer; very much depends on one sector.</p>
          <p>If we, let's say, do not realize or write one of &#x2013; one or some of the offered larger additional quota shares, then we would certainly benefit also in terms of volume from our price increases. We did not plan that. We have not planned that. On top of that, some of the quota shares will materialize. Then, of course, some very extraordinary volume could be available in the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but we do not plan volume, so it's not in our interest. We very much, let's say, let the volume be a function of available prices at the end.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question now from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, two questions. Just a follow-up &#x2013; following one on the previous question regarding what type of business you're targeting for next year. I mean and also depending of pricing opportunities, do you see more opportunities arising on the quota share side, or on the excess of flows? And what would be your business appetite indeed to respective segments?</p>
          <p>The other question will be related to the share buyback. Obviously this morning you are confirming that your intention to return cash to shareholders. Could you also confirm that obviously you're sticking to the timing for that? I've got in mind one billion for the share buyback per annum.</p>
          <p>And more generally speaking on the share buyback, could you tell us how you're thinking of change or not change recently on doing -- on carrying on share buyback, especially obviously we've seen that the cost of equity for insurance and for obviously financial services has increased quite significantly, and obviously could be also a strong reason at the timing for suspending any share buybacks and keeping capital in the balance sheet? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start &#x2013; Torsten here -- let me start with portfolio questions, portfolio composition or impact of the price development on our portfolio. I would make the two alternatives again. In case we don't write some of the offered larger quota shares, we will certainly have &#x2013; in a tendency a move into the single risk and excess of loss business because we have here the pricing in our own hand, and can really exercise our price requirement.</p>
          <p>When we on top of that can realize or can write one or more of the quota share treaties then, of course, you have immediately a large premium contribution on the proportional business. So under such a scenario or such a case, the proportional weight would increase in our book of business next year. So it basically depends on the question, is some of the larger business finally in the book or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thomas, from my side about the share buyback, we will now continue our current program and we'll finalize it until April next year, our AGM. I expect it to be finalized earlier, but we will see. Then between April 2009 and April 2010 another billion, and another billion between 2010 and 2011, so we stick to that.</p>
          <p>Your question about cost of capital is absolutely valid, and we also discuss it internally quite often. On one hand, you're right, that equity has become extremely valuable and so did liquidity. But this high cost of equity also has an impact on all the alternatives to a share buyback. And therefore, we stick to our policy here.</p>
          <p>Also, because we regard us being reliable, as being very important, and the price of the stock is also cheaper in &#x2013; at times when you have higher cost of capital. So it's a plus and minus, and we value all options here against each other. Also, when it comes to M&amp;A, this is a very demanding alternative use of capital, the share buyback. And I find it extremely valuable for the company to preserve its discipline. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Bob Yates of Fox Pitt. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, J&#xF6;rg. I was just going to ask you about the hedging and we had a cost of that program given by one of your competitors the other day. Admittedly, their use of it is rather different. But I wonder if you had an annualized cost figure for that program, and whether that program can be ceased at any point if you reduce your cash position in equities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, I mean the situation is different, because we do not hedge credit risks here. We hedge our equity portfolio. And it's some of it is done with put options, other with forward sales, then we have colors of put and call options, so it's done in a way where the cost does not play such a role here. And therefore, I don't have a figure at hand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's relatively minor, is what you're saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not serious. That is true. And we might also move to a policy of more sales instead of hedging. I see early signals for such a tendency. Not due to cost, but the volatility is so high and, therefore, there are costs involved. That is true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that is great. Thank you very much, J&#xF6;rg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Thank you, Bob.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to you, sir, for any additional or closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me make some remarks here. Let me close this conference by something personal. This is, unfortunately, time to say goodbye. This is time to say goodbye to Sascha Bibert. He came in 2005, three years ago. He did a great job, together with his team here. And I can assure you, we did not have to go on road shows to be seriously challenged.</p>
          <p>He has contributed a lot in our internal strategic discussion, and made us never forget whom we are working for, and that is you, our shareholders. So it is really with great regret that I see him leaving today. Thus, Sascha, all the best for you and thank you very much from me and all our colleagues here in Munich Re.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, I'm pleased to welcome Christian Becker-Hussong today. He will succeed Sascha as of Monday as Head of Investor Relations and Rating Agency Relations. Christian has about 16 years of valuable experience in banking industry, and perhaps it's also good for us to have here some fresh ideas from a totally different world, as you could all see it is a totally different world in the recent past.</p>
          <p>He will need some patience, and I kindly ask you to bear with him for his first phase, and work with him as excellently as you always did and do with Sascha, our team and with myself.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand back to Sascha for his closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, sir. Thank you, J&#xF6;rg, that's very kind. Let me also say three big thank yous. First, thank you goes to my team, they have really worked hard in the past couple years to increase transparency and make the Munich Re story, hopefully, a bit more convincing. Next big thank you to other colleagues within Munich Re; the management team of Munich Re, I think most notable, J&#xF6;rg and Nikolaus, also Torsten and others, who have given us the space and the backing at all times to follow our project.</p>
          <p>And finally, obviously, a big thank you to our investors and analysts, who have, over the years, continuously provided us with very constructive feedback. And I think that the journey is not over; but the company is really in pretty good shape. So that concludes our third quarter conference call. Thank you very much.</p>
