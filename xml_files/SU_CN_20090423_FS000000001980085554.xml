          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Suncor Energy, Inc. First Quarter Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Rogers, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Rogers, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thanks for listening in to our first quarter 2009 conference call. I have the usual suspects with us today, Rick George, your President and CEO; Ken Alley, our CFO; Maureen Cormier, Vice President and Controller; and Tim Roth from the Controller's Department.</p>
          <p>We'll follow the usual schedule: Rick will give you a bit of an update in terms of his view of the quarter, Ken will give you a short discussion of our financial situation, and then we'll launch into questions. So Rick, why don't you start us off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone and welcome. It's obviously been a very eventful last three months for us, and before I speak to some of the bigger events there, we probably should just focus on the quarter for a few minutes and talk about it. I would say, first of all, operationally we're feeling very good. It was a very solid quarter for us, and on the financial side &#x2013; and I know the estimates, the Street estimates, were all over the map &#x2013; but are probably consistent; our results financially are probably consistent with what you can expect in this economic environment.</p>
          <p>Four things I can say: I'm really very proud of our operations group and the results that they have been achieving lately, and even up to today in April; all of the production numbers look very solid. And what I really feel like is that the hard work and dedication and perseverance that the group has undertaken to get to our operational excellence rolls over the last two years are really paying off. Just think about it: production levels have been in that 300,000 barrel-a-day range since mid-January &#x2013; and that's up to the moment. Our cash costs are trending towards the low end of guidance, and we actually think there's more room to go on that as we go forward through the year and into 2010. A number of environmental exceedances we have are down.</p>
          <p>And of special note this quarter is how well our refinery and retail operation performed in the quarter; it was actually a spectacular quarter for them, given the conditions we were in. I think some of that is certainly logistical, in the sense that you're a little better off to have inland refineries in this kind of situation than ones that are on the coast. But I'm very proud of what they've done operationally. And the first quarter tends to be our toughest quarter operationally in the refineries and at oil sands. So I really do think that we've made ground there.</p>
          <p>And the natural gas business on volumes did well. These gas prices, which are going to be at this level, I think, for quite a while, certainly make that business much more of a challenge. So I think we're feeling very good about that.</p>
          <p>The other note I would say is Firebag volumes. And you wouldn't necessarily have seen this in the quarter, but the volumes are coming along. We're getting a lot of our issues behind us there. The well performance is very solid, the reservoir looks very good, and we continue to work through some issues here, but we've had a lot of days over 50,000 barrels a day, and you can expect that to see that continue to climb through the year. So well along on our way there as well.</p>
          <p>So feel like, listen, it's not time to declare victory, and it's also not a time to relax; but I think it is a time for me to acknowledge our operating groups and the fact that they really have shown real signs of improvement, and we'll look forward to continuous improvement as we head into this year and next, and on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>The other thing in the quarter is we did get our projects, major projects construction work, into safe mode. That's not a small undertaking from the path we were on in the third and fourth quarter of last year. I feel very good about where those are in terms of the equipment we ordered and have on site that have been protected. We've got the sites pretty much shut down, except for a small amount of continuing work, and feel very good about where those projects sit. And a lot of the costs that we were accruing through the end of last year have really come through in the first quarter, which is what we expected. Ken, I think, will talk more about that.</p>
          <p>We are currently reviewing Firebag 3. The question I often get is, when are you going to start back on that? What I would say about this is we are discussing with our suppliers and the contractors what they can do on costs. That will go a long ways to determine when we restart that project. Would expect it later this year, but what I wanted is to be very cautious, that we do get lined back out on reducing costs of these projects going forward before we get too far along. So that's where we are on the construction project side.</p>
          <p>Many of you will have noted that we did release the senior management team of the new company, the new Suncor, once the vote of the shareholders is in and we are able to close the transaction that we announced with Petro-Canada. I feel very good about how that selection has gone. It's a very experienced group of leaders that will help us position the company well into the future.</p>
          <p>And things are really moving along on the Petro-Canada front in terms of the Petro-Canada merger. First of all, we expect the proxy to be out the first week of May. The shareholder vote is set for both companies on June 4; and the competition review, which is probably the big and last hurdle of the sequence, is ongoing. I do have to quickly say we're very restricted on what we can say about the Competition Bureau. They are doing their work, we are cooperating. And what we can say is that we're on track as far as where we would expect to be at this moment.</p>
          <p>So we still have a lot of work ahead of us. We're doing a lot of planning and a lot of &#x2013; the head office work here is really dealing with how do we put these two great companies together, and how do we do that in the most effective and efficient way to get the synergies we talked about &#x2013; both the cash operating cost type synergies and expenses, but also the capital synergies that we announced at the time that we announced the merger.</p>
          <p>Certainly, I'm very encouraged, very excited about this opportunity. I think it really is the right position for these two companies at this time in the marketplace. I think it's a real chance to move us in some different direction with better downstream integration opportunities, a stronger natural gas position &#x2013; although we definitely have to work on the cost side of that equation and reposition that business &#x2013; a much lower cost entity through the combined synergies, and a company that's got a financial balance sheet that's in excellent shape to help us grow through the cycle.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I'm really looking forward to, and I think it will take some time to show you this, but is a company that's got a very different profile in terms of growth and steadiness than many of the other western-based oil companies in this part of the world. With that, certainly looking forward to the challenge. We've got a lot of work ahead of us, and I can just tell you we're up for the challenge.</p>
          <p>Thank you, John. That's all I was going to say and I think I'll turn it over to Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. I thought maybe I'd just give you a little bit of a perspective on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. As Rick said, no surprise to anyone, low commodity prices were the story here, and that's clearly reflected in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So debt levels did go up but we were prepared for this period of lower commodity prices. We have a significant hedge position in place to protect ourselves and, as you know, we've had a very conservative capital spending program set up for 2009. So really, debt went up to 8.6 billion; no surprises there. That's very much in line with our expectations. As Rick says, our capital spending on both ongoing projects and the safe mode for Voyageur and Firebag was front-end loaded, so we expected to spend most of our capital in the first half of the year and really a lot of it in the first quarter, so no surprises with those debt levels.</p>
          <p>We have ample liquidity going forward. We have about $2.3 billion with cash and undrawn credit facilities, so we feel very comfortable with our liquidity position as we look through the rest of the year. So really, no surprises, and the balance sheet, considering the economic environment, is in reasonable shape.</p>
          <p>So John, I think I'll pass it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. This is the point in time normally in the conference call that I update the outlook. I can tell you that we are very happy that we do not have to update the outlook at this time. Certainly, everything is tracking the way we had expected it to.</p>
          <p>Rick had mentioned, and I just wanted to make sure that it was clear, that we really have been producing 290, 300, over 300 since the middle of January. So the production number of 278 does reflect a bit of a slow start as we came out of the turnaround December and a few of the maintenance issues that we had for the first two weeks in January. So since that time, we've had very consistent production, so we would continue to see that going forward.</p>
          <p>The sales mix, we adjusted slightly; that was the only thing. So feeling pretty happy about where we are, and hopefully, we will not have to revise that outlook, and certainly not expecting for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>So with that, Patrick , I think we will open it up for questions. Once again, we do ask that you keep the questions to a strategic level. Maureen, Tim and I will be very happy right after the call to deal with all your detailed volume questions, and that would be the appropriate time to do it. So, Patrick, why don't we open it up to any questions people may have?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Robert Kessler of Simmons &amp; Company. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on a good set of operational results. Ken, I might ask you for an update on the financing. I recognize you relayed again your confidence that you've got enough spare capacity with your undrawn credit facility and cash balance, but you did churn through quite a bit of cash in the first quarter. I know a lot of that is due to the front-end loading of the capital program. Can you guide us to where you expect to be on the undrawn credit facility and cash balance by the time you reach the merger close? I know that the influx of Petro-Canada cash flows from operations will help balance this out. Just looking at what happens between now and then, where is CapEx likely to be in the next couple of quarters or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Robert, as we said, the CapEx was front-end loaded, so we expect to see that level off and be reduced through the balance of the year. So we're still tracking to our total spend of about $3 billion. And that includes the safe mode costs that we have for our Firebag and Voyageur upgraders. So our current plan is with the financial capacity we have in place now, we are not anticipating that we would have to issue any debt prior to closing the transaction. Obviously, that depends on when the transaction closes and where commodity prices are going to be, but our base case assumptions right now would be that we would not need to issue any new debt to get to closing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And those base case assumptions based on $40 per barrel WTI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just real quick, of the 3 billion, it looks like basically 1.5 billion spent in the first quarter. Should I just assume about 0.5 billion per quarter, then, for the next two quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually Robert &#x2013; it's John &#x2013; the second quarter will be a little bit higher; by the third and, of course it &#x2013; by the third and the fourth, it trails off considerably. So as we had mentioned, a lot of it is right at the front end, it was in the first quarter, less in the second quarter but still higher, and then the third and fourth quarter it just drops off completely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, just &#x2013; this is Rick here &#x2013; just to follow up on that, just remember that the two, the only two projects we have going big time are the sulphur plant at Firebag, and that'll be commissioned in the third quarter and again you'll be tapering into that through the second quarter; and then the Steepback extraction plant, which again is commissioned in the third quarter. So again, towards, down in the second quarter you'll see that the capital investment on that taper off. So that's why it's tapering into the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then, Rick, I might be jumping the gun a little bit here, but just as you think about the combined capital programs for Suncor and Petro-Canada, can you talk about opportunities for high-grading there? Where are you likely to shift the mix between, say, oil sands and natural gas? And then within oil sands, as you look at on the NC2 side, Mackay River potential expansions versus Firebag potential expansions, is that sort of mutually exclusive or do you plan to do both there in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a great question. I think it's just a little bit early. We are plowing through that and it'll be a strip return on capital calculation, and we'll look at all those opportunities, and lay them all out ,and then just attack them on a return on capital on a go-forward basis. And what I don't know is how those all stack up. We have got a lot of work to do over the next months here and that work is ongoing to do that.</p>
          <p>On the natural gas business, a slightly different issue, in the sense that I'm lined up with where most of the industry is, I think, today, in the sense that we're probably likely to experience relatively low gas prices here for quite a period of time. What we really need to do, as we put those two gas businesses together, is make sure that we move them to a viable spot where you move towards a low-cost position. And so, the emphasis there may be getting to a return on capital cost position rather than a volume position on gas. So that's the work we're actually undertaking and that's going to take some work as we put these two companies together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Rick, you'd mentioned that you're trying to work with some of the contractors to bring down the capital costs. I was wondering on the operating costs side, it seems like you've made some progress on the unit cash cost side. Is there potential to bring down the absolute cash costs from here further? I realize the unit cost's likely to come down as volumes go up, but I was wondering if the absolute number had some room to come down, as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arjun, the way I would put that and that way I've talked about it publicly is that we're targeting in the near term &#x2013; the near term being the next twelve months &#x2013; about 10 to 15% reduction. What I would remind you is that this business is still a very high fixed cost, low variable cost business in terms of cash operating costs. So a 10% on what you actually can control is quite a large number. But absolutely, we anticipate seeing reductions on the cash costs. Exactly how far we can push that, we don't know yet, but where our target is, is in that 10 to 15% range of total cash costs. That's quite a significant portion of your variable costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm sorry, Rick, just to clarify, that is on an absolute dollar basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be quite good if that came true. On the Voyageur, where you had the budget of the 20.6 billion, of which I believe you spent about 7 billion of it, the remaining 13 billion, you've slowed down or deferred the project for the time being. Is all of those costs negotiable with the contractors, or some portion of that locked in, and therefore, some portion you're going to have to continue at whatever the costs were in the higher cost environment? Or how should we think about the flexibility, the opportunity to reduce the remaining costs you had for Voyageur whenever you decide to go forward with that project again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well especially around Firebag 3, 4 and the upgrader, a lot of the equipment has been purchased and &#x2013; not all of it, but quite a bit of it, so not as much opportunity there.</p>
          <p>I think the real opportunity lies in terms of labor productivity, in terms of designing these projects, in terms of not peaking manpower at the wrong periods of time, and around tightly controlling the costs. So while I don't &#x2013; and I know that there are some numbers that people put around about cost reductions &#x2013; what I would say is we're just plowing through that right now. We will be very tightly controlling this as we go forward.</p>
          <p>And the good news is I think we have a lot more options. Now, a lot of the contracts that we had in place are now put to rest; we'll be able to rebid a lot of that work, and so there's plenty of opportunity. But you can't think about it in terms of you got 100% of your costs and you can just reshuffle the dice.  Most of the contracts, though, can be renegotiated or restarted or rebid.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Good morning. I think that the first one I just want to get out of the way, John, when you get a chance, can you give me a call later on after this, tell me what is the FIFO inventory gain, whether you have anything in the quarter and how much is that?</p>

          <p>And Rick, you have now got a couple of more months that since you announced the merger with Petro-Canada. I'm quite sure that you guys go through all the due diligence beforehand, but you now have two more months to do it. Is there anything that you have learned, in addition, that you can share with us at this point in terms of upside or downside?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to set the record right, Paul, I think we announced on March 23, and today, if I remember it right is April 23. I think that's one month in there if I've got that right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does seem like a while.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Though I will tell you that work is still going on full time. You know what? If anything, I would say no negative surprises have come out to date. We still see huge opportunities on the synergy side and we're working that issue. I have not had a chance to, and the teams have not had a chance to, really evaluate the assets and how they go together. That's a lot of the work we expect to be done.</p>
          <p>When you saw the announcement of the organization, you'll see the integration team that's headed up by Mark Little and Harry Roberts, and those teams are just being formed as we speak. They'll be formed this week in terms of again, that work cut off &#x2013; started off- and we're going through the whole basis in terms of benchmarking every set of the businesses, taking a look at how oil sands fits into this new refining system, down to what size and scale we think the natural gas should be &#x2013; so the natural gas business, just to give you an example.</p>
          <p>So that work has been started by the teams. We expect to have that a long ways along in the next 60 days. The first 30 is around trying to convince the market this is the right thing to do, to get the teams announced &#x2013; which we did yesterday &#x2013; and then get the integration team started, which is underway. So there's a natural sequence to this.</p>
          <p>I will just tell you lots of work's going on behind the scenes, but I would say no real surprises to date.</p>

          <p>Rick, can you share with us that how many &#x2013; I assume that you have set up a pretty effective core group of integration team at this point &#x2013; how big is that team? And in the Canadian north, the motile flexibility, does it allow you guys before the closing that really go into and take a detailed look on the asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there'll be certain areas where the Competition Bureau would certainly not &#x2013; will not allow us, and that has to do with anything with marketing, anything to do with pricing power, anything to do with retail, and a number of other issues. On the other hand, we have gotten support in terms of announcing the senior management team and then starting the due diligence. And you are able to do a lot of planning around the corporate office functions, whether that's HR, supply chain management, IT, a whole &#x2013; that's where a lot of the groundwork actually starts. So I think as time unfolds here, and this is not a single point, in the sense that the dialogue with the Competition Bureau is ongoing. We expect to have more things released that we can actually work on. But I will say we have plenty released to do a lot of activities right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is maybe for Ken or John. In oil sands typically, first quarter and the fourth quarter, given the weather condition, is the most challenging and costs tends to be their highest. Is there any particular reason that we should not expect from the first to the second and third quarter, your unit costs should be lower than the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's like leading the witness here. Paul, I think you're right. we typically do have production levels that are challenged in the first quarter, and we do have costs that are challenged in the first quarter. I think as Rick acknowledged, we are expecting that those costs will begin to trend down. We have not chose to change the guidance, however, because this is a process that takes some time, because a lot of it is negotiation with our suppliers and contractors in terms of reducing those costs. So we would expect that you should not see costs higher than what you saw in the first quarter, and there's a good chance that maybe you'll see them lower. But again, we didn't take the opportunity to change the guidance on the costs, so we're just holding tight. Hopefully, we'll have some good news for you in the second and third quarter on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. A final one, Rick, earlier that you mentioned that the timing on when you're going to restart the Voyageur construction in north end is somewhat depends on how's the cost structure, though. Can you elaborate a little bit, because in the subsequent one, Arjun was asking the question, how much of the costs is actually subject for negotiation, and you have indicate also it's not really that much. So I'm not sure I fully understand that what this two comment is; is that I'm missing something here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, when I talked about restarting, I talked about restarting Firebag 3. And so what you're going to see through here is a start on these projects one at a time and sequence them through. We're not at all concerned about being benched benched-in long for periods of time, so where's there's, in this market, especially given the pull on heavy in the United States and given our position, both in the new company and in Suncor today, so you're going to see us start first of all probably, most likely at Firebag 3. And then we'll go to 4, and then we'll see whether that, after that it goes to Mackay or whatever the next opportunity is.</p>
          <p>And you have to remember, each one of these projects is in a different state of being done. So Firebag 3 is about 50% complete on construction. So you're 12 months away from when you pull the trigger to steam in the ground. And so, you can't take it at a blanket comment. When I was talking about getting started again, I was talking specifically about Firebag 3, not the upgrader, which is in a whole different hill; the upgrader I think is 10% done on construction. And so your degrees of freedom and ability to make up or change your cost structure is directly related to how far you are along with that part of the sequence of the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you actually think that the Voyageur, even though the major equipment already has been acquired or contract, you actually still have a reasonable flexibility in the cost reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, in terms of manpower and productivity numbers and efficiencies in the field. You're going to see some &#x2013; expect to see some cost reduction, absolutely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had a question around more the timing of the capital project review. Do you have a sense for what kind of expectations that we should have before you make an announcement on when you restart elements of the Voyageur project, or just generally, what the sequencing and timing would be on the overall shape of the major projects that both companies have? Do you think this will be a year-long process, where you look at it for six months, rebid it for six months and then move forward, or could it be something sooner than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you'll see it later this year, whether that's at the tail end of the second quarter or the third quarter &#x2013; Believe me, I'm not really in a position to do that. Because I think I want the teams to do their work. But we're not talking about waiting well into next year, especially with particularly Firebag 3, because it's 50% constructed already. And 4 is well along as well. And so I think the next couple of steps are pretty logical.</p>
          <p>What I don't want to do, though, is preclude what happens beyond that, because we haven't had a chance yet to review how the economics of a Mackay River expansion compared to a Firebag 5, compared to Fort Hills, compared to other options we have around expansion. So I think the logical sequence is there, but don't think about this &#x2013; are you going to study this for a year and then kick off. That's not going to happen. What you will see here, as we get through the second quarter, and we should be able to talk about this a little bit more as we get over the next quarterly conference call. And then you'll see us go at this in a sequence that makes some sense to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then is it really the upgrading that becomes much more of a complicated set of decisions to make? Do you &#x2013; in terms of should we think about a possibility of re-scoping the Voyageur upgrader once you have a chance to study the Petro-Can refineries and see if anything can be shifted to those plants, or is it just a matter of having enough capital to go ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's this massive change in terms of that, because the designs really basically &#x2013; we're very far along and the pots and pans for a large part have been ordered or are in the middle of manufacture, so not huge scope for that. There will be some lineup of assets; there's no question about upgrading into these refineries and into the marketplace after we get a chance to take a look at all that. But what I would say is that we're very confident that we can go bitumen long for quite a long period of time before we do the upgrader. So if you think about Firebag or Mackay River expenses in particular, these are pretty incremental decisions. What you want to do is make sure you're bitumen long before you have that upgrader, so that when you get the upgrader done, you have plenty of bitumen to fill it. And so &#x2013; I look at this as a sequence, a timing sequence.</p>
          <p>The biggest, probably the biggest capital project we have left is finishing the upgrader, and you'll be, want to be very careful about you do that in the right environment, at the right time, with your balance sheet in the right position. Because what you want &#x2013; what we'll want to do when we get these two companies put together is make sure we head for an optimum capital structure. And then, so we want to sequence that through to make sure that it all fits.</p>
          <p>So again, I was quite clear when we announced the merger: this merger is not being done so you can leverage on the balance sheet. It's done for a whole host of the other reasons we've discussed. And so I want to see how that lays out. And probably the biggest decision you have out there is when do you complete the upgrader. And you know what? I'm not really in a position until we get this all put together to really talk about exactly when that'll happen. It will happen, I just don't know exactly when.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen, just a few questions here. Circling back on the Firebag, obviously you did have a good first quarter because you were slightly under 40,000 in January, so obviously volume's lifting up quite nicely. You talked about the facility, the sulphur emissions and the delay there. Is there any potential production limitations as a result of that?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>And a good question, Will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the downstream side, would you guys mind providing a little bit more color into the results? Obviously some pretty strong numbers that came out of that group before the quarter. Is there anything on the inventory side there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. I think the thing that's surprised us and surprised everyone was the margins that we received in both of the refining and a little bit on the retail side, Will. So it was the fundamental business, as opposed to anything funny that was going on there. I think, like everybody, we were delighted, I think is the word, that we were actually able to generate the kind of cash and earnings out of that division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they were very strong numbers. On the natural gas side, with Neil [Camarta] assuming the reins of the combined company, which is an interesting shift, can we interpret that as being a move to significantly change the strategy of this operation going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What I would say about that, Will, is that we definitely are going to take a look at the whole natural gas business. And my comments before were exactly how I think about it. And that is in this environment, what you need to do is to move, particularly on the natural gas side, but all of these businesses, to a low-cost position. And I think as we put these two companies together, that's what we've got to be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's a comment for the Petro-Canada natural gas business as much as it is as the Suncor natural gas business. It applies to both and it certainly applies to the new company as it's formed. And this is our chance, really, to take a look at that and really decide what assets we think fit with that, how we drive to a low-cost position, and how we get this thing ready for the long haul. So that's work that's ongoing. I don't want to say a lot more than that because I want the teams to do that work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just circling back on another question, there seems to be a lot of guys asking questions about the whole Voyageur, Firebag expansions. I'd just like to come back to a more philosophical point: with the combination of Petro-Canada and Suncor, is your focus going to be more on the cleaning up of the combined organization, or investing in new opportunities? So freeing up some of the capital from the combined organizations to put to work; or are they both going to be simultaneous?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The answer is both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And more or less simultaneous. But one of the ways I think about this merger is near term we should be able to protect our major assets, i.e., the oil sands, Firebag, Mackay River, and the refineries from a lot of change and turmoil. A lot of it's going to happen in the other parts of these merged companies. And so if you think about the synergies we announced, whether it's the 300 million on expense or the $1 billion on capital, it shows you we're going to work both sides of that equation. And so I would say both, and pretty much simultaneously, although the capital number will take a little longer to roll out, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last but not least, just going back to your announcement yesterday about the management team, and I guess giving an opportunity here to talk about Ken and the fact that he's not part of the new organization; didn't really see any commentary there. It was a little bit of a surprise to me, and just wondering if Ken would like to take this opportunity to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks, Will, I appreciate it. No, my plan is to retire. I've been talking to Rick about succession planning and plans for retirement for a while. But as we went through last year, which was quite an interesting year and obviously through this very exciting merger; I wanted to be part of that. My plan is to retire at the end of this year, and we've got a very good internal succession plan in place, and Bart Demosky will be the CFO replacing me. But I'll be around for the transition, and work with the team through that. So I'm very excited about getting through the close and the transition, but also, my plans are to retire. But thanks for asking, Will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're too young to retire. But at least you can work on your golf game with John. So ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just add my two cents' worth, Ken's just done a terrific job here, and also was really instrumental in getting this merger put together. And it wasn't easy work, and so I feel very fortunate that he put his shoulder to the wheel and really helped get that done. And I also feel very fortunate that he's going to be here to help through the transition. So as he mentioned, he'll be here into the early part of next year, and that'll be extremely helpful to Bart, to me, to the whole team as we go forward in terms of putting this together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The other thing I was going to mention also is that Bart Demosky is not new to this particular area, to the finance area, and many of you have not had the opportunity to date to meet Bart. He was the Treasurer of the company for about three years, and then moved on to another senior role within the company, and now he's coming back as CFO. So we're expecting a pretty seamless transfer from Ken to Bart, and Bart does have, as Rick mentioned, the luxury of having Ken for a few months to school and tutor him through this. So we're all going to miss Ken in this thing, but we're also looking forward to having Bart come in as the new CFO.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rick, with respect to your comments about "reshaping the natural gas side", it doesn't take too much reading between the lines on that to conclude that you're looking toward divestments. I'm wondering how you reconcile that, though, with your outlook, which I happen to share for whatever it's worth, regarding the natural gas price picture for the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't think it's inconsistent. I am not talking about divestments, I can tell you that, until we get through with looking at the asset base. And I'll be quite honest with you, I have not had a chance to do a detailed review, and would expect the teams, as a combined team of Petro-Canada and Suncor people who are knowledgeable in the gas business, that'll do that complete review, and see how we put this together and how it fits. So I wouldn't jump on the divestment bandwagon too quickly.</p>
          <p>My only point behind that is that as we go through that the real focus has got to be on getting to a lower cost position. Ultimately, we'd love to get to a top quartile cost position and looking at return on capital; those are the two things that are going to be pressing us. Not volumes per se because, and my expectation here is that there's going to be a lot of gas around. We're not quite as concerned about the natural gas hedge as we were when gas prices were above $10, and but we want some of that natural hedge for sure, but don't really feel right now that that has to be a strict rule on that and certainly would not take a lower return on capital to keep a natural hedge position on a go-forward basis. So I wouldn't jump too quickly on the divestment thing. I want the teams to do their work, and do it well, before we conclude that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Ken, just to clarify, because I thought I heard you say that the 4 to $500 million of costs for the safe mode exercise, that is indeed included in the $3 billion CapEx budget for this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian. That's right. So when we planned the spending the 3 billion did include the costs for making those projects safe. We weren't sure at the time that we announced the capital spending budget that it was going to be capital or expense, but the accounting treatment for some of these costs is to write them off as expense in the current year. So it is included in the $3 billion total spend.</p>

As you know, it is a processing agreement, so that actual processing fee we get for that is in the revenue number, but they are not included in the sales number because they're basically not sales; we're doing this on a fee-for basis. So when you actually look at the statements, you actually do your calculations of sales versus price, as you get to the revenue number, there will be a hole in that particular area, and that's basically the &#x2013; part of it is the Petro-Canada processing agreement, the other part is the mark-to-market, which is in the revenue number, and then there's a few other things in that. So it is a bit of a peculiar thing, yeah. We'll look forward to not having to do this in the future, but this is really the only way we could do it, because you can't actually show in your statements single contract accounting. So that's what we didn't want to do. So sorry that it isn't completely clear, but this is about as good as we could make it.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your next question comes from Kam Sandhar of Peters &amp; Company. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; two questions. First of all, on the Steepbank extraction point, can you just talk a little bit about what impact that might have on operating costs and on production when that's commissioned? And then my second question is whether you have any clarity on where your cash taxes might end up, dollar amount, for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Kam, I'll handle both of them. Steepbank extraction plant we're expecting to come in in two phases, one is middle to the end of August, and the other one is near the end of September. That really is a replacement for what I call Lease 86/17 extraction plant, which was the original extraction plant we've had at the oil sands. It does include an upgraded technology in the extraction plant, plus it does have new ponds where we can actually access. So some of the issues that we've had in the past from the Lease 86/17 extraction plant will be put to bed with this.</p>
          <p>We're not expecting that it will have a dramatic impact in terms of the actual per unit operating cost. It's more from an efficiency point of view and really we just have to move the extraction plant from one spot to the other. So that's probably the best we could do.</p>
          <p>The other thing I should mention is whenever you do bring out, we've just learned this over time, a brand-new asset like a new extraction plant, there can be some break-in issues as a result of that. So we're going to have to be a little bit careful as we go forward. But we do have the luxury of also having Lease 86/17 extraction plant that maybe we could use on a bit of backup basis. So that's that.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash taxes, it is actually in the statements, but we are expecting somewhere in the neighborhood of 350 to 450 this year in terms of cash taxes.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if there's any idea that you may make a move on Fort Hills acqui &#x2013; is making a move on the Fort Hills acquisition is out of the question right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Carrie. The real answer is we've got our hands full doing what we're doing today in terms of taking a look at how we put these two companies together. There are no current plans by Suncor in terms of looking at that currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you go through the acquisition, could Petro-Canada go ahead and proceed with such a transaction, or do you have agreements right now that you would have to work together on something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a question you should ask Petro-Canada rather than ourselves, only because I can't speak for them. The companies are not put together yet. And so that would be a decision that they would have to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm asking is does the merger agreement allow for that, or would something like that, would you have to consult with each other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there is a duty under the arrangements that if there are any major significant issues come up that, from our side or from their side, that there has to be a dialogue and discussions in some sense. Would that actually qualify? I don't know. I would have to get legal opinion on that.</p>
