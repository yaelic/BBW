        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for coming to this fairly early morning meeting. It's a little bit cool outside. With Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and G&#xE9;rard Lamarche, it's a great pleasure for us to meet with you here. Also we've got the whole team, the management team of GDF SUEZ. We welcome you here this morning for our first presentation of the financials of the new company, GDF SUEZ. We can say that results are growing. All the indicators are showing that we've got double-digit growth. The international environment is a difficult one, and we'll be coming back to this in greater detail.</p>
          <p>Now of course this presentation is taking place at a fairly special time. A project that was begun quite some time ago has come to fruition. It was announced two years ago and it has now been completed. For us, this is much importantly the beginning of a really marvelous business venture. We can say that we've got the good results. They demonstrate we've got a sound balance sheet. We've got the strength of a very strong business model to develop business, which today is clearly one of the majors in the energy industry.</p>
          <p>Now a preliminary comment regarding presentation of these first results. Today we are going to be going through a fairly special exercise. This morning we're really publishing three sets of accounts &#x2013; first of all, the half yearly results for Gaz de France, the SUEZ stand alone results as well for the first half. I'd also mention that for each of these businesses, you will see the usual segmentation that you're accustomed to in the financials. That will enable you to analyze the very good operational performance of both of these companies in the first half, and you were to  compare this with the first half of 2007 for both of those companies. In addition to this, we are presenting you with the half yearly pro forma results of the new group, GDF SUEZ.</p>
          <p>The outline of our presentation today therefore is in line with these three sets of publications. Jean-Francois will be running through the Gaz de France financials, G&#xE9;rard will be running through the SUEZ financials and then the pro forma financials. And then together with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, we will come back to talk to you about the industrial forward motion, our strategy and commercial objectives.</p>
          <p>My first point, I'd like to say in no uncertain times, the merger is completed. Gaz de France/SUEZ shareholders very massively approved this merger. Over 99% of them approved this at the annual general &#x2013; at the general meeting. It's important support that was lent to this project. The Company is very much moving forward in terms of governance, organization, in terms of the integration. Everything was set up as from July 22, the day of the merger.</p>
          <p>Top managers are meeting at the rue du Docteur Lancereaux, the new HQ in Paris. Over 200 appointments were made, which means most of the main managers. So we can say that this company is very much up and running, moving full speed ahead since July 22.</p>
          <p>Now second observation I'd like to make, GDF SUEZ has been demonstrating very sustained growth, dynamic growth. We've begun with our corporate project, our industrial project. Our industrial development is very strong. I'd like say that we need to underscore this. We can say that there's been good industrial and commercial growth for all of our business lines. And every time it was possible, this was a development that was organized jointly by the ex-SUEZ, ex-Gaz de France teams &#x2013; together, in other words.</p>
          <p>Regarding development in France for instance, under the impetus of Henri Ducr&#xE9; and his teams. But also in the U.K., think of the Teesside investment made by Gaz de France/SUEZ 50-50, just before the merger, as the run-up to the merger so to speak, which just goes to show the teams were already working together at that time.</p>
          <p>Now on that particular point regarding industrial development and implementation of our strategy, let us confirm to you today, the date for holding an Investors Day. We'd announced this. This will take place on November 26, Investors Day. At that time, we will be able to run through with you in detail the medium-term outlook, the synergies, our performance plan. And all of this will be in sync with the new segmentation of the Group in six business lines.</p>
          <p>A third point of introduction, GDF SUEZ is positioned as a major player in its industry, with very strong industrial assets. It's a buoyant sector, and things are changing, moving forward very quickly.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about our challenges. The first one of course has to do with prices. Fossil fuel prices are high, probably for the fairly long term, though there may be fluctuations. Oil prices have gone up by 60% since the first half of 2007. There's been both growing demand and supply shortfalls. So energy prices have gone up worldwide.</p>
          <p>A second challenge has to do with security of supply. This will mean that gradually it'll be necessary to find new forms of energy, such as liquefied natural gas, renewal energy, plus there'll have to be greater geographic diversification. That's something that's becoming more necessary all the time. We see that. New infrastructure will be required to carry the energy from production locations to the major consumption markets.</p>
          <p>A third challenge, this has to do with sustainable development and requirements in this area &#x2013; fighting global warming, improving the environment. And also I want to talk to you about social considerations. We can say that public policy is trying to reconcile all these various factors. The economic and financial environment has become more difficult, and there's been a deterioration in government budgets, and sometimes a deterioration in people's purchasing power.</p>
          <p>Due to all these changes, we're moving forward, and we can say that we are resolutely optimistic, very much prepared to act. It's a world full of opportunities. So we're not sitting back and finding that this is a problem. On the contrary, we find this is a springboard. This is a way of moving forward.</p>
          <p>And I'd especially like to emphasize some of the real assets we have in this new company. First of all, we're at the heart of Europe, and we've got an energy mix, which is diverse, flexible. Among other things, we've got expertise in nuclear power. This is a true asset, major asset at a time where we see worldwide there's renewed interest in nuclear power.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are positioned as an international leader in three specific areas: LNG, power generation, and Energy Services. Now liquefied natural gas, here we can say that we've very much got a global ambition. And it's possible for us to play the conversions card of gas, electricity. Not many, or I would say probably no other actors can work on conversions of gas and electricity.</p>
          <p>We've become a leader regarding independent energy production in key areas such as the Middle East, as well as Latin America. And we're continuing to move in this direction in North America as well, and in the very near future in Asia. Furthermore, we enjoy true leadership when it comes to Energy Services. It's one of the main features of our Group. We've got a full business line on Energy Services. So these are really three areas &#x2013; LNG, IPP, and Energy Services &#x2013; that are providing long-term advantages, a competitive edge, and this will be crucial for the future.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our Group also reaps the benefits of synergy between energy and the environment. We announced this on Friday in Bahrain. I'm alluding to an agreement, a contract to produce electricity and desalinated water. That's an illustration of the synergy in energy and environment. This is an illustration of our strategies, strategy of leadership. It's a dynamic lasting strategy for this Group.</p>
          <p>I'd like to underscore four of the main assets we have. First of all, production mix, you can see here a breakdown of our production, installed production capacity for us worldwide. You've got a good balance of power gen. It's competitive. Here in 2007, you can see capacity that was managed by GDF SUEZ.</p>
          <p>Now let me also underscore that in the very near future we'll be adding between 15 and 20 gigawatts. These are projects that are being built, contracts that have been entered into, such as Al Dur in Bahrain that I alluded to earlier, announced Friday, plus <mark type="inaudible" /> that was announced in August. And then there's also Jirau in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Installed capacity is flexible. High performance does not emit much CO2, on average 0.3 times CO2 released per megawatt-hour generated. Our energy mix also includes wind energy, water, thermo energy. GDF is the #1 operator of electricity power plants that use gas turbines and combine cycle. We've got modern power gen facilities that do not release much CO2. All in all about 50% of our global installed capacity releases very little CO2. About 30% doesn't release any CO2 whatsoever worldwide.</p>
          <p>Now our installed capacity is flexible. This means we've got a good balance between generation, points of generation for both basic peak and sub-peak generation. Flexibility is very important in deregulated markets. That way we can really capture the value of energy price volatility. These prices fluctuate all the time.</p>
          <p>Let's briefly talk about renewable energy. In this area, we can say that sometimes our positions aren't that well known, and sometimes our positions are underestimated. But this Group is a major player in the area of renewable energy, thanks to our hydroelectric install capacity, a very large install capacity here, over 10 million megawatt-hours. We're also a leader in wind and biomass. This isn't as well known. We're also developing &#x2013; and you know this &#x2013; interesting positions in wind, biogas, and sun, solar energy.</p>
          <p>Lastly, let me say that hydro of course is key. We've got hydro facilities in Europe, France, and elsewhere. We've got a little bit of hydro in Asia, a lot in Latin America. And we're looking for this in the United States as well. But it's fairly infrequent there.</p>
          <p>A major asset of ours is our position, our global reach in both gas and liquefied natural gas. Let's remember we're the other one purchaser of gas in Europe, a global leader in LNG. Soon we'll have a full fleet of 20 methane tankers, thanks to which we can be constantly moving on any opportunities for supplier or arbitrage. This is a major advantage of ours, which helps us further diversify our supply portfolio.</p>
          <p>Here we have an illustration, a chart that shows us the diversification of the supply portfolio. You can see the natural gas supply here. This is both gas sold to third parties, as well as volumes that we optimize by using these in our own electricity generation facilities and gas facilities. This is about two times the consumption of the entire country of France, just to give you an idea of the amounts involved here.</p>
          <p>We're going to be talking to you about our pro forma results here. They're growing for this half year. Our balance sheet is a sound one as well. On the slide share, we can see a summary of some of the elements. Revenues and net income are the highest in our industry. We've also got the highest growth in EBITDA, including a major acquisition recently. Revenues reaching &#x20AC;43 billion, up 17%. EBITDA above &#x20AC;8 billion, up 20%. Current operating income, almost 5.5 billion, up 20%. Net income group share, 3.4 billion, which is up 14%. It's important to look at our debt, &#x20AC;18.8 billion net debt. Now considering the size of our Group and our balance sheet, this is a good figure. Our gearing ratio is 29%.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about some of the main explanations here, first of all to talk about the volume sales. In electricity we saw increased sales in electricity and gas in Europe and internationally. Now business outside of France is covered by Energy Europe and International Jean-Pierre Hansen leads that with the <mark type="inaudible" /> Pierre Clavel in charge of Europe and that business line.</p>
          <p>Now a second factor which has enhanced our forward momentum, hydrocarbons. We've been optimized the gas portfolio. In gas, here we're talking about areas for Global Gas and LNG led by Jean-Marie Dauger.</p>
          <p>Now Infrastructure, this business makes a strong contribution. It's led by Yves Colliou.</p>
          <p>Now services, Energy Services you'll later the strong commercial development here, and it's J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Tolot who leads Energy Services.</p>
          <p>SUEZ ENVIRONMENT's performance has been excellent. We won't go into this again. Jean-Louis Chaussade and his team presented these results last Thursday for SUEZ ENVIRONMENT. As you know, SUEZ ENVIRONMENT will become part of a CAC-40 index replacing SUEZ there. I like that idea very much.</p>
          <p>Now these last few months, we've seen some particularly remarkable developments, which just to show that we've got great forward momentum in industry and in our sales Group-wise in all the business lines.</p>
          <p>I just mentioned the great diversity in areas of expertise and geographical locations, where we've seen great success. This all illustrates the know-how of our teams. That's a real strength of ours. These projects really help add to our experience, add to our know-how, and keep us flexible, able to adapt to different types of technology, regulatory systems, market organizations. And as business cycles change, we've always got our ear to the ground. We are quick to act wherever we may be. This also helps us attract the best, most talented people. And we do everything we can to move on any opportunity to create value whenever such an opportunity rises.</p>
          <p>We can say that through our financial standing, our traditions of leadership, and our excellent business complementary, GDF SUEZ has the human resources and the technological resources to be a major player in its business area.</p>
          <p>We've got a major CapEx program, a little over &#x20AC;5 billion, 10 billion per annum. We're speeding up our international development, for instance in the Middle East and also in Italy, after an agreement with ENI. Thanks to all of this, we take a leading position, and we know that it's a time of great international demand, which is growing all the time.</p>
          <p>Those are my introductory comments. I'd like to give the floor to Jean-Francois who will be going through the Gaz de France financials.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Good morning to you all. I'd like this morning to present to you the first half the year Gaz de France results for the last time under this segmentation because we were not merged at the first half. The strongest earnings ever posted by Gaz de France, another record. All the activities of Gaz de France contributed to these very good results.</p>
          <p>You can see on this slide, that all the strong earnings growth across the board, excellent results, leaving aside revenues, which in the gas sector is not very meaningful because of course it depends on its volumes and energy price-driven. And when you look at the income statement, they're all double-digit growth, close on 30% per EBITDA at 3.9 billion, and for current operating income, up 29%, as well as net income group share, which is up 13%.</p>
          <p>Now this strong earnings growth demonstrates, the sustained growth of all the business areas of Gaz de France, as well as the improvement of our operating performance, and it needs to be said, favorable comparison for the first half 2008 as compared to H1 2007 last year.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you for those of you who've forgotten that the first half 2007, the point of comparison was abnormally warm. It was very mild, a very warm summer in 2006, 2007. As compared to average climate conditions, you'll find that in the &#x2013; a deficit of 26 terawatt-hours and that had impacted our performance. Now the winter that we just experienced 2007, 2008 is not a normal winter. It was slightly milder, so it's below the normal seasonal variations, but not on a par with what we experienced between 2006, 2007. It is however worth recalling that we ended the 2007 year for Gaz de France with record earnings because of a gradual return to normal of the environmental factors during the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>What we're seeing today is really the continuation of this buoyant trend that is driving us since the second half of 2007 and which continued throughout this first half. This, with sustained growth in Gaz de France during this first half, with growth in CapEx of over 60%, as you can see, which is fully in line with the annual target that we indicated for 2008, which was CapEx of &#x20AC;4 billion. So that's up by &#x20AC;1 billion as compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Cash flow generation remains very considerable with &#x20AC;3.5 billion. So therefore we can maintain a limited gearing level of about 15% gearing. When we consider this income of 1.7 billion just in one half, it's almost the earnings that we achieved in 2005, 1.8 the whole year. This is just 1.7 billion on one half.</p>
          <p>When we now look at how the various activities contributed to the growth of EBTIDA, the slide here speaks for itself. There were two major sectors that were hugely boosted during this first half, posting quite remarkable growth &#x2013; exploration production, which was very favorably impacted by price levels of hydrocarbons and the forecast that had been announced to the market for this year.</p>
          <p>Energy, purchase and sales, these are all that sales made by Gaz de France both to residential clients, to major accounts, but also the trading margins on LNG and benefits from a return to normal at market conditions. More about that later.</p>
          <p>Distribution also posts remarkable growth. This is of course volume-driven essentially because here it's relatively clear distribution. One additional terawatt-hour is &#x20AC;5 million, so 18 as compared to the first half of last year. If you do the math, it's readily calculated. So distribution benefited from a return to normal selling conditions in volume terms. We can also note that it's the first time that the competitive activities, as compared to regulated business, exceeds far and away 50% of the Gaz de France EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Moving now to a more detailed review of all the finical results, starting of course with exploration production, which has become &#x2013; I mean, it's nothing new here, but it's been confirmed a major contributor to the overall performance of Gaz de France and today of GDF SUEZ, with close on 1 billion EBITDA for this first half. The exploration production represents 25% of GDF EBITDA, and just over 11% of the EBITDA of the new group GDF SUEZ &#x2013; quite remarkable performance, an increase of 86% in a half &#x2013; half-on-half is due to the combination of the two factors, both price changes.</p>
          <p>Of course, the price context was extremely favorable. Just to give you two indicators, the average in euros, the price of the barrel was &#x20AC;48 for the first half '07 and rose to &#x20AC;71 the average across the first half of 2008. At the same time, when the price of gas on the U.K. market, the NBP, was multiplied by two to reach a price of &#x20AC;25 per megawatt in the first half of 2008. Now the price of gas from the U.K. market is not that high, but it was extremely depressed a year previously because of the very mild winter.</p>
          <p>In addition to these price factors very present, there's also recovery in production growth announced for the first half just over 25 million oil equivalent barrels up 24% as compared to the same period of 2007. So our output in 2008 is in line with the guidance of the order of 50 million barrels stated at our annual result session for the year 2008. So this increase in production is essentially as a result of the production increase started in 2007 with the new commissionings, in particular in the Netherlands, in Norway, Njord, Fram, and the arrival of Sn&#xF8;hvit in the accounts and the results for Gaz de France.</p>
          <p>Here you can see that the CapEx effort is very considerable, very sustained. Our target is to size the exploration program so that it generates as many oil equivalent barrels as what we're producing. So there's a major effort implemented at the first half. We drilled nine wells, twice as many as the same period in 2007, five of which were successes.</p>
          <p>Purchase, sales, energy with a contribution to the GDF SUEZ EBITDA close on 13%. It's also very considerable in terms of its level. It's the highest level ever secured in this segment, and the very positive earnings momentum is to be linked to a more normal level of sales.</p>
          <p>I mentioned the climate effect. That's always very important for us. We have of course cooler climate conditions at 17 terawatt-hours. One terawatt-hour generates approximately 10 million additional EBITDA. So you can see the impact of a return to more normal weather conditions, but also good sales on the major European accounts. Gaz de France is selling more to major European accounts than in France, and we're continuing successfully the expansion of our sales in Europe. We've entered for the first time this year in Austria with sales in Austria. That's a new expansion for us.</p>
          <p>And then there's the dynamism of the LNG trading business, sustained during this first half with 20 shipments sold outside our French market for a total volume of about 17 terawatt-hours. And the major beneficiaries were Asia, a new destination during this summer &#x2013; winter as compared to the previous winter where much went to the U.S. because of price trends. And more broadly, the Russian are leading to these good performances, good fit to market conditions of our gas and electricity supply portfolios.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the regulated tariffs and the trend in our sales to French households, what was a key component, accounting for just over half of sales in this segments in billions. That's about 6 billion out of the 12.6 shown here.</p>
          <p>We were hardly hit by the price of oil that I mentioned, the barrel going from 48 to &#x20AC;71 on average. And no increase in the gas tariffs occurred in 2007. So at the end of 2007 we had to pass on price hikes in our tariffs in the price of the gas, and then we had two price increases in this half on the basis of the agreement agreed with the State. There were two increases in January and in May, but these price increases did not make it possible to pass on all our supply costs in the tariffs in spite of two price increases. And there was third in August. We were not able to pass on all our supply costs, which you will see on the next slide &#x2013; leads to an increase in the difference between the tariffs and this price insufficiency increase.</p>
          <p>Now the dynamism of our energy purchase and sales is driven by CapEx, sustained growth in electricity. There are two GTs is being build, three across the Group. The growth of wind power and the acquisition with the SUEZ of Teesside, the U.K. company, included in these figures.</p>
          <p>Just returning for a moment to the regulated tariffs for gas, as you can see, this is a chart that we've always shown you, which is really the trend in the cumulative lost revenues. It posted a slight profit in 2007 there. We actually reduced the lost revenues by 84 million. However, in 2008 there was an increase in cumulative lost revenues by 179 million. So total lost revenues cumulative went from 906 million to 1,106 this year. So that is total lost revenues of 179 million.</p>
          <p>In spite of these price increases, we weren't able to pass on all our supply costs. The State has indicated its intension to review the tariffs that links the price trends between GDF SUEZ and the State. That's why we wish to complete this as soon as we have a clearer view of the tariff, as part of the new public service contract that we had assigned with the State.</p>
          <p>Just a quick word on services. Not much to say on services. Doing well. Revenues also at record level and quite significant growth. Strong improvement in profitability on a par with SES of SUEZ, and we can see the merger there in services, which is a key activity of the new Group, will be done on a par with companies &#x2013; not on a par in terms of size, but in profitability. So there was the favorable impact of the integration of six cogeneration plants in Italy for 370 megawatts of install capacity improving the accounts of this first half.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the infrastructure activities, which have for the most part regulated activities across the growth of these major regulated activities are perhaps less impressive than those in the competitive environment. They remain satisfactory nevertheless.</p>
          <p>Firstly, transmission and storage, not regulated but where the growth is of course in line with price trends of storage activities, increased in April 2007. And in April 2008 on transmission, there'll be a new tariff that's under discussion to be applied as of the 1st of January next year. And you can see the transmission and storage activities are delivering strong recurring results year-after-year, not too sensitive to external factors. And it's unlikely to be impacted by weather conditions because in transmission, we reserve capacities whatever the weather, hot or cold, the same trading levels.</p>
          <p>EBITDA closed on &#x20AC;800 million for the first half, contributing to 10% of GDF SUEZ EBITDA. It's a segment where CapEx is high and has been high for two or three years. Strong growth, &#x20AC;500 million as compared to &#x20AC;300 million in CapEx last year. You see the increase &#x2013; very substantial growth in CapEx essentially due to the increase in CapEx for the transmission to fortify compressors. We reduce the number of zones transmission from four to two in France to facilitate, to improve the efficiency of the transmission network and many developments for a long-term development plan storage capacities for the new Group GDF SUEZ. And this CapEx is really driving forward the growth in these areas</p>
          <p>A word on distribution. As I said, these results were directly linked to weather conditions, to cooler weather conditions than in the first half 2007. Growth volume up by 20 terawatt-hours, including 17 due to cooler climate. Here again distribution generates EBITDA which is broadly similar to transmission and storage activities in this area.</p>
          <p>The new development was the finalization of the new tariff, which came into force, this incentive regulation on July 1 of this year, accessed by third parties to distribution activities. As of July 1, it runs for this incentive the regulation, this tariff, for four years, whether pointing towards a price cap regulation giving better visibility for distribution. And we are very satisfied with that.</p>
          <p>Just a brief word on transmission distribution international, which is joining the Europe international business line of GDF SUEZ. Its growth performance for the first half 2008 was impacted by various scope effects. In revenues here you have the consolidation of Italian operations, which we didn't do previously &#x2013; accounts in large part for the growth in revenues, but with proportional integration of SPE, the second Belgium utility, and Gazac from Germany now accounted on equity method accounts for the drop in EBITDA and current organic income for 2008.</p>
          <p>But in organic, you can see an increase and all these aggregates with a slight squeeze on the EBITDA margin because of certain tariff tension seen in another countries, in particular in Romania where during this first half we were unable to pass on all our supply costs and there was an increase in the 1st of July, which would of course be reflected in the second half accounts.</p>
          <p>So when we now look at the growth in net income, the operating performance of the different activities that I've just described have a positive income impact on the net income &#x2013; on the income statement, leading to net income of &#x20AC;1.7 billion, which is exactly half of the net income for half, GDF SUEZ, what does it tell us? Well, it demonstrates the strength of this new Group given the earnings that it's posted. You combine the SUEZ and Gaz de France earnings, also the immense fit of the businesses between the two groups, there's been no cannibalization. We're making more money. There's various strong rationale to this merger, which is apparent as of the first half of the GDS SUEZ accounts.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to G&#xE9;rard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Francois. Good morning to you, one and all. SUEZ has also got some superb results, just as Gaz de France in the first half 2008. We have sustained growth in our business activity, as you can see, revenues up 14%. Organic growth of revenues is plus-15.7% excluding currency effect, which were negative due to the dollar change to minus-447 million. There's slight positive scope effect due to the acquisition of Teesside, 50-50 with GDF in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about EBITDA. EBITDA is 4.244 billion. SUEZ performance is such that we saw a 40% increase in EBITDA, 15.1% increase organically. That's above our objectives that we set for full year, 10% for the full year. Now a growth in current operating income is 9% in spite of some unfavorable basic effects. You'll remember last year we had to write back some provisions in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now we can say there's slight drop in income from operating activities, minus 3.4% inter alia to some capital gains and divestments made last year after a divestment of some financial holdings, as well as some stakes in some joint companies in Belgium.</p>
          <p>There's negative impact mark-to-market financial instruments due to the increase in commodities prices in the first half. So all-in-all as you can see, the net income is 2.046 billion, which is up 10%. Net debt of 15,999 million, I'll come back to that later. There's an increase in debt due inter alia to some CapEx in the first half.</p>
          <p>Next chart, here we can see an illustration, the breakdown really of increase in EBITDA, organically up &#x2013; organic up 15%. Now you can see that all of the business lines are feeding into this, any energy in Europe and Energy International.</p>
          <p>Now before going into operational results, I'll talk of &#x2013; so say that energy in Europe always includes Electrabel's result, as well Distrigaz, which hadn't been sold at end of the first half, and Fluxys that'll be changing consolidation methods in the second half of as well.</p>
          <p>Energy in Europe, revenues for energy business plan have grown strongly, up 24%, distinguished at Benelux from other European countries. In Belgium, our growth rates continue to be good in volume in spite the fact that nuclear power availability is reduced due to some scheduled offline of the nuclear facilities. You know that we've got a very high availability rate, up more than 90% for our facilities. But in the first half this dipped down below 85% availability. In the very near future this will go back up to the usual availability of our nuclear power plant.</p>
          <p>Prices have gone up as you know. By way of illustration in Belgium, the base load price went from &#x20AC;52 per megawatt-hour to over &#x20AC;68 a megawatt-hour. To date sales have almost all been hedged, as is our custom at this time of the year for fall 2008. We've already presold 85% of our electricity for in 2009. Market share has gone from 75% electricity to 72% in Belgium.</p>
          <p>That was on Belgium. Now let's talk about the rest of Europe. Excluding Benelux countries, volumes have also grown there as well, up 6.8% particularly thanks to the acquisition of Teesside. I'd also underscore excellent performance at CNR. They benefited from increase for the French base load, 29 megawatts an hour.</p>
          <p>We also moved on some very beautiful arbitrage opportunities in both LNG and gas. Now in all of Europe, we see some of costs have gone up, such as fossil fuel prices, CO2 transmission, and distribution. This was an additional reason for overall price increases in Europe. Overall EBITDA is 1.959 billion, which is up 14% for Energy Europe. COI has gone down slightly at 1.524 billion due to some write-back provisions, which obviously are one-off as per definition and these one-off buybacks were in 2007.</p>
          <p>I'd also mention some really substantial SUEZ industrial successes in Energy Europe. Particularly, I'd like to mention a stake we took in George Besse ll, a plant that enriches uranium. That way we can have greater security of supply for uranium. We took a stake in <mark type="inaudible" />. We also acquired a large plant in the U.K., Teesside &#x2013; I mentioned that earlier; that's the partnership with GDF &#x2013; in the first half. So that's Energy Europe.</p>
          <p>Energy International, SEI, here the results are excellent in the first half. EBITDA, 996 million, which is up 30% gross and almost 40% organically. Prices are up in all markets where we are located. I'll give you a couple of example of this. First of all, let's talk about the gas market. Future prices in the U.S. on average went from $7.16 to $9.48 per MBTU, which is an increase on the order of 32%. Coal index has almost doubled in one-year of time. In Brazil electricity prices, which were below R$50 per megawatt, skyrocketed. At some points during the year in there first half, there was a tenfold increase in these prices, growing up to over R$500 per megawatt. Tractebel Energia, which was long in electricity, benefited beautifully from this, thanks dynamic arbitrage between selling sales commitments they had to the distribution network and sales to the stock market.</p>
          <p>There were increased arbitrage opportunities &#x2013; nine shipments in 2008 as opposed to three in 2007. That also set into the very positive performance here. There were also other arbitrage gains. We've seen all these positive factors in the SEI business line. We of course can't extrapolate all this for the full year, although we're very positive when it comes to the results for this business plan.</p>
          <p>I'd like to emphasize speeded-up development of SEI. You can see CapEx of 922 million. That's up quite substantially. The biggest contributor here was the construction of Ponte de Pedra, a hydro plant, 250 million CapEx here. Furthermore there have been many other commercial successes mentioned earlier, such as Jirau, Al Dur, Astoria plants around New York, Ras-Laffan and the Bahrain contract.</p>
          <p>Services now, the third business line, SES revenues up 8%, reaching almost 6 billion in the first half. This growth, among another things, is due to more positive weather than last year. Also thanks to our commercial development, we've continued to see success in services. I'd like to mention a contract for London Olympics, also the tendering of the GEPSA prison.  Now there have been new orders of installations in Europe. These orders continue to increase. Margins are very high here in spite of the fact the overall backdrop is more difficult than some countries such as Spain.</p>
          <p>Let's mention engineering lastly. We reached a record number of orders in June. The backlog is now 15 months of activity in engineering.</p>
          <p>Now the results, we're seeing an improvement in operating profitability. EBITDA is 413 million, which is up 10%. COI,  we're seeing continued profitable growth, up 14%, and we can say that 4.8% is ROC of our revenues.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about SUEZ ENVIRONMENT very briefly here because you then had an opportunity to have a presentation on the results of SUEZ ENVIRONMENT last Thursday. So good business activity in SUEZ ENVIRONMENT in spite of the sale of Applus in mid-November, and also some negative dollar effects, which had an impact on United Water. These negative effects were very much offset by growth in the base of SUEZ ENVIRONMENT and also through some small acquisitions. They're called tuck-ins at SUEZ ENVIRONMENT.</p>
          <p>There's growth in various segments, water in Europe plus-8%, waste management up 5% in Europe, plus-7.6% internationally. Internationally, I'd like emphasize very strong growth in Lydec in Morocco. Also we can say that this international growth is a reflection of pasture elements such as the landfills tax hike in some countries and some indexation elements in contracts.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for SUEZ ENVIRONMENT is 1.6 billion up 5%. We're seeing increased profitability here, particularly internationally. Lastly I'd like to say that EBITDA margins over revenues are 16.7%.</p>
          <p>COI, you can see that growth versus current operating income is 3.8%, somewhat lower due to increased prices for renewing concession contracts. We can say that there's been substantial CapEx, 1.4 billion. We can say this increase, 300 million in maintenance but 700 million in CapEx, having to do with AGBAR bid. Small acquisitions represented 176 million in cash-backs and tuck acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now lastly on a SUEZ ENVIRONMENT, let me just mention the beautiful success of the SUEZ ENVIRONMENT IPO. The price went up over 15% compared to the initial offer price in July. The shareholders' part of the agreement make up 48.1% of capital and, as G&#xE9;rard said, SUEZ ENVIRONMENT will be part of the CAC-40 index, and that's great piece of news.</p>
          <p>Just explained the top of the income statement, talking about operating performance in the various branches, now let's take a look at what you've got underneath operating income. I'd like to just comment briefly on some specific points here. Mark-to-market for financial instruments regarding commodities have had a negative impact to the tune of 148 million, negative on operating income due to commodities price hikes, as opposed to a positive effect of 55 million in 2007.</p>
          <p>Furthermore as you can see here, there is a 47 million write-back of provisions. This is from Merchant, the company in the U.S. that's going to be divested in the next few weeks. Furthermore we can see on the table here we had fewer capital gains from divestments in the first half compared to last year &#x2013; 27 million as opposed to 25 million asset disposals. That's why COI is slightly down from last year.</p>
          <p>Financial result would appear to be lower due to some non-recurring elements. Some of you will probably remember that we made some positive ForEx results due to some reimbursements of financial instruments in Brazil floating rate notes, and that had generated a non-recurring gain. But if we took a look at the average cost of debt, it remains almost completely stable, 5.4% as of June 2008.</p>
          <p>Taxes, income tax a little bit lower down on the income statement, down 334 million. This is due to the recognition of 200 million in deferred tax assets &#x2013; has to do with SUEZ tax integration. Overall tax rate of the Group has not changed much though. It's approximately 24%.</p>
          <p>Now the share of income of associates, slightly down, 152 million, is mainly due to the divestment of part of our stake in Intercommunals in Belgium &#x2013; I went into this already &#x2013; plus with the minority interest, it's 297 million, down 72 million. This is the full year effect of this squeeze-out for Electrabel. This is the end of that effect, the last of that effect. We see that on this line here. And there's also the exiting of part of the minority stakeholders in AGBAR.</p>
          <p>Those were the half yearly financials for SUEZ. Now if we look at all this, we can understand the net income group share of 2.046 billion, an increase here. Now after going through the standalone accounts for GDF SUEZ, let's look at the pro forma financials. This is the main thing we communicate on on our financials.</p>
          <p>Now there are some limits to this exercise since this is based on some working assumptions and some conventions. What are these assumptions and conventions? First of all, we've acted as though to establish these income statements &#x2013; as though merger had taken place on January 1 of this year. Now for the balance sheet, we acted as though the merger had taken place in June 30. We're doing this like reverse acquisition where SUEZ is the acquirer due to the effective size of the groups. But from a legal point of view, it's Gaz de France that absorbed SUEZ.</p>
          <p>SUEZ ENVIRONMENT is still consolidated through full consolidation, but the earnings it has taken to the tune of 35%, we've done a preliminary allocation of the acquisition cost. This work will be finalized before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The amortization charge in the half year will be 375 million. Impact of remedies hasn't entirely been taken into account since we didn't sell Distrigaz, Fluxys, Coriance, SPE in the first half, nor have we taken account of the capital gains for divestments over 2 billion here, nor have we taken account of the contribution of assets and companies that we bought from ENI.</p>
          <p>The pro forma finance results of the new Group display double-digit growth rates for the operating indicators, up 17.4% for revenues, up 20% for EBITDA, up 19.6% for COI. Each of the two companies, as we just explained, have made a contribution to EBITDA growth, respectively 14% contribution by SUEZ and 28% Gaz de France.</p>
          <p>Current operating income grew just as fast as EBITDA. Net income, we can see the figure here; it's up 14% at 3.038 billion. Mark-to-market of financial instruments, we've seen less income from divestments. This has been offset though by the deferred tax. Debt is 18 billion. Our rating was reconfirmed by the ratings agencies in July. In the first six months of the year, we made 5.7 billion in CapEx together, which is very much in line with the overall envelope for CapEx, which is 10 billion in capital expenditure per annum for a three-year period.</p>
          <p>The next chart explains changes in debt. Debt went from 15.8 billion to 18.8 billion. Now you can see the main flows are due to operations, cash flow, which entirely invested our CapEx plan. In the first half we paid 3.3 billion in dividends and 1.2 billion for share buybacks &#x2013; 1 billion from Gaz de France and the remainder for SUEZ.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet and financial structure are very sound indeed. We see that in the next chart, next table. Our debt rate is 29%. Average cost of gross debt is 3.4% &#x2013; 5.4%, sorry. We can say that we're pretty much shielded from interest rate hikes. Our dept is at fixed rate, 75% of which is &#x2013; 75% is fixed, 61% taxed. 19% of our debt is in dollars; the remainder, 61% in euro. And 5.2 years is the average maturity.</p>
          <p>Last chart here, what we see here are the figures for the first pro forma in the first half, adjusted for the impact of remedies and removal from our consolidation scope of Fluxys, Coriance, SPE, and so forth. This is the basis you can use to calculate full year growth taking account of the guidance that'll be given in just a moment. By end of the year, we'll be finishing our work on the entry balance sheet PPA. We will have fully harmonized to our accounting rules. We will then present to you a new pro forma, which would take account of all these slight changes, as well as scope changes.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Let's return briefly to the industrial momentum of GDF SUEZ through our investment program as well as the major operational achievements of the first half of this year. We've indicated to the market on several occasions that our CapEx was about 10 &#x2013; increase of about 10 billion per year over the next three years. That is 30 billion all business lines told. This is the CapEx program announced and presented at the time of the merger.</p>
          <p>In this program essentially what we're seeking is organic growth with the projects that are all at this stage identified. And you see that Energy Europe and International will be contributing extensively to this CapEx program with an annual program of between 4 and &#x20AC;4.5 billion per year. That is all the investments in power generation, but also in gas, methane terminals internationally that will drive this expansion.</p>
          <p>So where are we at? You can see the acceleration, the strong acceleration of the program between the 2007, 2008. Our achievements in this first half 2008 make us confident on achieving these multi-year objectives, 5.7 billion as compared to the 3.8 billion at the same time last year. So it's the acceleration in the Group's industrial expansion program that we see in 2009 is already underway, and we're even ahead of the initial plan.</p>
          <p>During this half, a number of acquisitions, significant acquisitions were made. As a finalization of the bid of AGBAR, the joint acquisition GDF SUEZ of Teesside, acquisition in France of the Nass &amp; Wind wind power operator entry of the enrichment plant at Tricastin, as well as building our position and exploration production in Egypt with the acquisition of Alam El Shawish.</p>
          <p>In total, external growth acquisitions account for just over 40% of this amount of &#x20AC;5.7 billion CapEx for this first half. But the heart of our business, these investments all in strict compliance with our financial discipline. &#x20AC;2.1 billion devoted to expanding already underway projects such as our German for the coal power plant, combined cycle, three plants in France and Gjoa in Norway gas. In total &#x20AC;4.6 billion generating additional earnings for GDF SUEZ in the out years.</p>
          <p>If we look at our achievements business line by business line, today this structure is fully in place, and all businesses have achieved major breakthroughs in their different areas. I won't go through them in detail, but maybe just highlight the key ones.</p>
          <p>Energy France first of all, good performance in terms of winning utility clients, which isn't an easy market. We conquered 85,000 new electricity clients. At the same time, the Group is posting good, good resistance on its portfolio. Gas clients had over total of 10 million individual customers. We lost 148,000. In fact we're losing few of heating customers than hot water customers. We're continuing to build competitive electricity power portfolio that is energy-efficient for our retail electric division. Three combined cycles under construction in France betters our wind capacity through the recent acquisitions and we're very satisfied with the hydro power capability. CNR quite remarkable, as well as the auction procedure launched by EDF after the view of the competition authority giving us very adequate sourcing for our electricity customers.</p>
          <p>Europe and International, four major breakthroughs. Teesside, an important component in forging our U.K. strategy; at the same time, the first joint acquisition by GDF and SUEZ, a rather symbolic importance there. And then the expansion on the gas front in a new country with view as a very promising large country where we weren't present &#x2013; Turkian Gas, the acquisition in August, its third distributor, gas distributor in Turkey, a very fine project that's the industrial hinterland of Turkey in the Istanbul area. These are essentially industrial clients.</p>
          <p>This is the first acquisition of the newly merged GDF SUEZ Group, and I'd like flag the fine developments in hydropower in Brazil. Jirau dams and Ponte de Pedra have the total capacity of 3.5 gigawatts. That's the increase in the Group's expansion in Brazil with some very impressive projects there.</p>
          <p>And the first half was also marked by a very structured partnership between Total Areva and GDF SUEZ in the nuclear sector in the United Arab Emirates. Global gas and LNG reserves. interesting discoveries in Egypt, West el Burullus, continued developments in the Netherlands, U.K., Norway. The exploration machine is working well, and it'll -LNG terminals, they're &#x2013; a new partnership with Singapore. With PowerGas we'll be building the first LNG terminal in Singapore. There was one in India. We're now moving into Singapore. Asia will be looking at gas increasingly.</p>
          <p>In terms of supply, we renewed the major Group's suppliers over the past two years. We can add to that 10 billion cubic meters with Shell and we're the only company in the energy sector to be able to supply in certain countries to the major accounts. We have no competitors there.</p>
          <p>Infrastructures, you know that initially and by definition, they were centered on domestic markets. They are expanding beyond our French borders, notably in storage where we have rarified and cutting-edge skills. It's the case in Germany, U.K., and Romania that we are implementing services.</p>
          <p>Division is extraordinarily dynamic with the merger of Elio and Coppertech. Many contracts in our book. G&#xE9;rard mentioned the 2012 Olympics. That is a highly symbolic contract. Leadership in Italy with the acquisition of cogeneration plants. And I'd also like to flag the three biomass plants agreed between the CRE and the State where the Group demonstrates its innovation and expansion in new forms of energy biomass. In cooperation with manufacturers, we have three projects between 10, and out of the 10, 20 agreed by the State.</p>
          <p>On environment I won't speak to that because you heard from the management recently. Over to G&#xE9;rard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Francois. So just a few words by way of conclusion. Jean-Francois has just explained that our CapEx program is moving forward consistent with the ambition that we set out at the time of the announcement. What are the targets? EBITDA of &#x20AC;17 billion by 2010, on the basis of this CapEx program, potential for operational synergies of approximately 1 billion per year by 2012. More about that during the Investor Day in November. CapEx of 30 billion over three years, essentially industrial. All this driven by strict financial discipline.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that the GDF SUEZ merger is based on two pillars: accelerated industrial development and better remuneration for shareholders. We confirmed the dynamism of our shareholder remuneration program with a payout objective that is higher than 50% of Group recurring net income average annual growth in dividend per share of 10 to 15% per year between dividend paid in 2007 and dividend paid in 2010.</p>
          <p>The Group has also decided, and this is a decision taken by our Board on Friday, to put in place as of 2008 an interim dividend to be paid out in the second half before year end. So for 2008 the Group will pay out on November 27 &#x20AC;0.80 per share. That's a total of &#x20AC;1.7 billion. This payment will be an interim dividend. The May 2009 shareholders meeting will pay out the ordinary dividend balance for 2008, increased by an exceptional payment of &#x20AC;0.80. That's &#x20AC;0.8 share special dividend, and there will be the interim dividends, and this for the year underway towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The year 2008 will also see the completion of an additional share buyback program of &#x20AC;1 billion by the end of 2008. So for 2008, we confirm what we have already indicated. EBITDA growth, normal weather conditions, higher than 10%, CapEx &#x20AC;10 billion. And these targets are the added to the pay-out of the exceptional dividend and the share buyback that I've just indicated.</p>
          <p>In summary we can say that GDF SUEZ has achieved excellent operational and financial performance during the first half 2008. All the business lines have contributed to the progress, commercial and industrial. We indicate growth rates for the year that are at least equivalent to our previous announcement. The group plans to continue its unique dynamic value-creating positions and dynamic for shareholder remuneration.</p>
          <p>We wish to strengthen the dialogue that we have with the market with analysts and investors that the publication of revenues for the third quarter will be on the 13 November and the Investor Day is on November 26.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, that's what we wanted to present to you, and we're now ready to take questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Credit Suisse. I have three questions. The first concerns the dividend. So you've explained there will be &#x20AC;0.8 in November. So this will be an interim dividend with the exceptional later. Do we have to draw conclusions on the level of recurring dividend for 2008 full year? Do we just double the level? Are market expectations too low? And the fact that you will pay out an interim dividend every year, does this is mean that we're likely to see exceptional dividends again? So that's the first question on the dividend.</p>
          <p>Second question on SUEZ Energy Europe &#x2013; could you indicate how soon we will see a return to the rate of availability of nuclear power plants?</p>
          <p>Third question on SUEZ Energy International &#x2013; could you indicate the contribution to EBITDA or the LNG business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Let me answer the first question. I'll give the floor to Jean-Pierre Hansen regarding availability rate of power plants. And regarding LNG, maybe G&#xE9;rard will want to come in on that one.</p>
          <p>But on your first question, we announced a dividend of &#x20AC;0.8 to be paid before the end of the year &#x2013; to be paid before the end of the year in November. So this will be an interim dividend. That's what we have finalized in the financials.</p>
          <p>Regarding the ordinary dividend each year, we've given guidance, and we stick to that. The ordinary dividend is growth of 10 to 15% per annum compared to 2007. We're not changing that guidance. That remains the foundation, the basis for growth in ordinary dividend between 2007 and 2010. That guidance remains unchanged in terms of an annual payment of ordinary dividend each year. But what you're going to see &#x2013; there's an interim dividend paid this year of &#x20AC;0.80. The remainder of the ordinary dividend not yet set, but will be paid in May of next year, decided on by the AGM, plus the &#x20AC;0.8 of exceptional one-off dividend. That's this time around an exceptional non-recurring dividend.</p>
          <p>The Board of Directors decided there'd be an interim dividend payment in a recurring fashion. As from the end of 2009, there will be an interim dividend to be paid out by virtue of 2009 results. The remainder of the ordinary dividend should be paid out in 2010. Is that clear?</p>
          <p>So today you cannot, how should I put this, actually draw, decide on some specific indications as to the level the ordinary dividend that's going to be decided on by the AGM after a proposal made by the Board of Directors at the next AGM meeting. It will be in a range 10 to 15% increase as announced, and we will very much abide by that.</p>
          <p>So the piece of good news is there's going to be the payment of an interim dividend systematically. It will begin this year with the &#x20AC;0.80 and then each year henceforth, including next year, and following years there will be interim dividend payment.</p>
          <p>Regarding the availability rate of nuclear power stations, could Jean-Pierre Hansen be given the floor? He's at the front here.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Just briefly, now you shouldn't talk about reestablishing availability rate. No, because even at today's level, there's been indicated we compare very beautifully to the benchmark, the re-establishment. Well, as G&#xE9;rard said, we're bringing the availability rate back up.</p>
          <p>The big statistical change here was due to some maintenance, some scheduled maintenance work, which was extended for one of the plants for labor reasons. No conflict, but there was a problem in some overtime there. So the maintenance program's completed. We now intend to see a reestablishment, as you put it, by the end of the year in the second half. So we'll go back up to availability rates that are the best in the industry.</p>

          <p>Question three on LNG from Energy International, G&#xE9;rard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, LNG business internationally is located in our SUEZ Energy North America subsidiary. Generally, we don't communicate on that business segment because it's fully integrated in electricity activities. But I'll give you an estimate. In EBITDA in the first half, SUEZ Energy International, 996 million. This includes approximately a contribution of 220 million from LNG business.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a brief word about the dividends &#x2013; for those of you who wish to see the flows, how it's going to proceed, I suggest you refer to slide 98 in the annex. You will see the histogram there that will set out the cash payment flows for these dividends payout.</p>

          <p>Merrill Lynch. Couple of questions &#x2013; just returning to the performance of SEI, Latin American, and the U.S. to verify performance levels. Q1 exceptional Tractebel and gas prices very high, they've dropped down in the U.S. Could you extrapolate on H2 and see where you're at in the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question &#x2013; Electrabel is there another item to be added to the weak availability of plants that accounts for the increase of only 1.4% increase of EBITDA in H1, given the high price of electricity? I know you contract ahead of time. Could I have some details about that for H2? Since you're strongly accelerating your CapEx, where are we at in terms of work in progress, the massive capital employed, which in your balance sheet doesn't generate any return?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll field this question, answer those questions. But let me ask Dirk to talk us briefly about SUEZ Energy International. It's performed beautifully of course in Latin America and mainly in Brazil and in the U.S. Could you comment on this briefly, and possibly give us some information on any elements that might sometimes to be nonrecurring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First of all, regarding Brazil, earnings were substantially impacted by increases in stock prices in Brazil especially in the first part of year in January. At that time due to some shortfall in the market, prices went up to around R600. Another big impact in the &#x2013; And this had an overall impact on results. The Brazilian real continues to go up against the dollar and even against the euro. Those are the two important elements. The most important thing is spot prices that were really high in January. But it's not just Tractebel or Energia Brazil that did beautifully. All Latin American activities performed well.</p>
          <p>Then in North America, earnings felt a really positive impact due to hikes in gas prices and improvement in margins for Boston activities, which is related to LNG and gas sales. On the other hand, we can say terms were pretty, good conditions were pretty good for all U.S. activities, including electricity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dirk; on Electrabel, G&#xE9;rard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so on Electrabel, I indicated that the availability rate was below 85%, whereas we're used to having figures higher than 90%, which means that when we shut down the nuclear plant for maintenance, we have to buy energy at the rated market price. And so we lose the margins, the portion of the margin on the nuclear power plants.</p>
          <p>Second half, since maintenance work is almost completed, we will gradually be returning to the previous levels. Now this means that in the second half, we can expect a more substantial increase in the earnings of Electrabel, which in the first half saw its results dip. For working capital requirements and the non-productive capital, that's something we don't disclose to markets. So I can't answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. BNP Paribas -three questions. First of all, could you specify contribution of &#x2013; talk about the inventory effect for natural gas in France in the first half?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could we get an indication as to contributions of activities that are going to be divested on a half-yearly basis for Distrigaz, SPE, and Coriance in looking at both '07 and '08?</p>
          <p>Thirdly could you update us on why the public service contract with the French government hasn't yet been signed? What are the hitches, and what are the stumbling blocks? And what would you view as the timetable going to be to finalize that contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just to answer your first question, the natural gas storage effect in France. Yes, it's positive during this first half at least. I mean, we don't disclose a particular figure. It's not much higher than last year. It's not the storage effect that is driving the increase in results as compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Now on the public service contract, there's no disagreement. It's not a sticking point in the discussions with the State. It's just that the State, having indicated its intention to change the tariff structure, which will be a regulated act, we're waiting for this information to be published so as we can adjust that to the new framework the State wishes to implement.</p>
          <p>And then the second part of your question, contribution of Distrigaz, disposals of Coriance, or deconsolidated the Fluxys &#x2013; I suggest to refer to page 39 of the presentation. There you will find calculated the EBITDA base which gave you the guidance. You have the pro forma for 2007, 13.140 billion, and the new basis that excludes in EBITDA the contribution of the disposed activities, Coriance, et cetera, Distrigaz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there further questions? Madame?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Dresdner Kleinwort &#x2013; two questions. To come back to the interim dividend, &#x20AC;0.80 for per share, is this the same one you announced in July of 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you then for that answer. Second question, could you clarify your strategy regarding natural gas? Is it going to have the same share as previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to answer your first question, I confirm it's the same. It's not in addition to that. It is the same interim dividend. So in terms of the dividend in respect to 2008, shareholders will be entitled over and above the ordinary dividend within the guidance. 10, 15% will be entitled to &#x20AC;0.8. In addition we're paying out this 0.8 in the form of an interim dividend. The balance will be paid next May of the ordinary dividend, plus &#x20AC;0.8 exceptional dividend. And let me add third, we are thereby initiating a policy of an interim dividend payment. And slide 98 clearly sets out the sequence of the various payments in this respect.</p>
          <p>On Gas Natural, the Gas Natural transaction is a good industrial operation because it's forging closer ties between a gas provider and electricity suppliers. So this all make sense. We've never commented during the summer. We were mentioned here and there, and but we always said that we would not comment. And we will now look in detail when we as the other shareholders for that matter informed of the expected capital increase what our attitude will be towards this transaction. It makes sense from the industrial standpoint. It's very logical from the industrial standpoint. And as of now we continue to defend our shareholder interests to the best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have three questions. You announced &#x20AC;1 billion share buyback plan. Are you going to be starting overall policy for share buybacks of &#x20AC;3 billion a year, if we extrapolate?</p>
          <p>Second question, on growth through acquisition &#x2013; you announced about 40% of CapEx that relates to external growth. You talk about investment of &#x20AC;10 billion per annum. What's the proportion external growth as opposed to organic growth in your overall CapEx program?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, on scope effects &#x2013; could we get the date of when you'll be consolidating assets from ENI? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taken from ENI, if that's your question is? Yes? Okay. To begin with your first point, we indicated that one of the two pillars of the merger would be an improvement in shareholder remuneration, and I believe we're demonstrating this, demonstrating this through the &#x20AC;0.8 added to the ordinary dividend. We're demonstrating this through a policy of an interim dividend, which will include flows for shareholders. And we're demonstrating this also through the 1 billion share buyback program between now and the end of the year, which we said in passing added to what the two companies did separately, each during the first half.</p>
          <p>Each of the companies had accustomed the market to this policy, which has continued. Having said that, the Board decided this 1 billion for the end of the year. And we're not making any commitments for what comes afterwards, but it's a shareholder remuneration instrument, which each of the companies had used. The newly formed group GDF SUEZ is continuing this policy this year, and we will tell you in due course what we will be doing next year.</p>
          <p>As to external growth, I would say the following. The basis of the CapEx program for the Group is industrial growth. It's organic growth. It's the Group's philosophy that we've always applied. It so happens that for time, time-to-time, to generate organic growth in certain countries, you need a certain industrial base. It's the case in Turkey, where we had base in electricity, not in gas. So we're acquiring it in gas, and then the objective is to grow to expand around that base.</p>
          <p>Jirau in Brazil is fully organic growth to build a dam from scratch. Sometimes it's a mix, for instance in New York, on the Astoria project where we are acquiring a stake in the most recent power plant in New York and Queens, and we're going to double the output. So all these transactions, the plan rests essentially on industrial growth, which sometimes is supplemented by stakes and acquisitions that are of average size and scale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could we see slide 37, this gives us the breakdown of CapEx, maintenance, acquisition, and development in the first half. Now if we look at this one, we see that investments and development are 2.1 billion; other, 2.5; maintenance, 1.1 billion. Under acquisitions, I'd mention to you the biggest transaction in the first half had to do with AGBAR with the buyback of minority stakes, 707 million. And the remainder, well, this is a very large number of small acquisitions, the biggest one 250 million. As G&#xE9;rard said, development represents 2.1 billion, and these are a whole series of small acquisitions that can be included into organic growth.</p>
          <p>On your final point, as G&#xE9;rard indicated the ENI assets will be taken into account in respect to their contribution to revenues and EBITDA as of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any further questions please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have four questions. First of all, LNG and cargo rotation &#x2013; apparently 29 from SUEZ use tankers. When do you decide get other tanker, and how much does this yield you per tanker? You've given us some figures, but just for total LNG activity, I believe at SUEZ.</p>
          <p>A second question &#x2013; when do you think you'll be changing the balance of assets? And then -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was that second question is the follow-up -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Balancing assets for the GDF SUEZ, when you will be dealing with the remainder of assets?</p>
          <p>Now EPR delays will this be in any way changing your intentions regarding EPR technology?</p>
          <p>And then my last question &#x2013; seasonal effect. We know there is a quarterly seasonal effect. Is there also a seasonal effect from first half to second half in the new scope?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on LNG, first off, two things &#x2013; 20 Gaz de France at the first half and nine tankers. It's not 20. It's 20, 29 tankers. The figure given &#x2013; I mean, I may have misheard 220 million. In fact it was 120 million for SUEZ once again. In all, the Group's capacity to reroute LNG outside of its primary area in large part depends on the contracts it has with its producers.</p>
          <p>You don't reroute Algerian LNG, as you can reroute or send a shipment from Sn&#xF8;hvit in Norway or from Egypt. It depends on the contracts, the way these contracts are drawn up. We have this ability, we have this capacity with differences between contracts and that this capacity is quite high. So we can indeed benefit from market opportunities once we ensure the security of supply of the two markets in which we have very special responsibilities.</p>
          <p>France and Belgium, where we have clients and there is a need to ensure continuity of gas supply, and there we've been able benefit in the past two years of relatively mild winters in Europe, and so an additional capacity to reroute tankers as we choose.</p>
          <p>I won't give you a figure by tanker, but I can tell you that it does rise very high. It depends on the country. It depends on the time of year, and sometimes several dozen million euros on an LNG tanker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Francois. Regarding the remedies and the timeline here, to simplify, most of the disposals will be completed by the end of the year, the acquisitions toward the beginning of the year. Distrigaz, for instance, a big transaction, big divestment, this was toward the beginning of July we concluded with ENI. It was divestment agreement. Publigaz had preemptive rights. Publigaz announced that it wouldn't be making this preemptive right.</p>
          <p>So ENI can acquire &#x2013; So it did two things mainly. First of all, a go-ahead by the European Commission, which shouldn't be problematic. The formal request though could just be made once Publigaz announced it would not be using its preemptive rights. Secondly, since 57% is being divested, it's necessary to submit a public offer for the minority stakeholders. The prospectus has to be approved by the banking commission, bank supervisory authority.</p>
          <p>So this is why this should all be taking place toward the end of the year; the same thing regarding other transactions, which is also why capital gains from the divestments of SPE and Distrigaz &#x2013; substantial; over 2 billion capital gains &#x2013; will only take place in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now regarding the acquisition of assets from ENI, this will also be toward the beginning of next year that it'll take place. That's when in 2009 these assets will contribute to revenues, EBITDA, and GDF SUEZ earnings.</p>
          <p>About the seasonal effect &#x2013; Oh, wait. Let me talk about EPR first. We're not worried. They've been demonstrated as the actual technology for EPR, which we think is very well suited. We're very much in favor of developing third-generation nuclear capacity for this Company, and we very much believe this is well suited to the international market situation generally.</p>
          <p>Final question on the seasonal factor &#x2013; Well, of course the seasonal variation depends of course on the heating season and the number of winter months. As we know there are three months in the second half and two months in the first half. So Gaz de France is most exposed to this seasonal factor &#x2013; achieves 60% of its earnings in the first half, as against 40% in the second half. SUEZ service activities that are exposed to seasonal variations as well as <mark type="inaudible" />. And overall we generally achieve about 55% of our earnings in the first half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One last question on the Fluxys, Distrigaz deconsolidation, and SPE &#x2013; of course from the accounting, will they be under a separate line or will they be integrated in the accounts? I know it's rather technical. Thank you.</p>

          <p>As I mentioned, we will be drafting a new pro forma by the end of the year, which will take into account <mark type="inaudible" />of accounting rules for the two companies &#x2013; there with the final entry balance sheet and also exclusion of assets. We will exclude them in from the pro forma for the full year.</p>
