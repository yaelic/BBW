          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. and welcome to Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group's Third Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call. The presentation hosted by Mr. Didier Valet, Group Chief Financial Officer, will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over to Mr. Valet. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everybody. So I'm pleased to be here with you to discuss this third quarter '09 results. If I start with the presentation that you had on the website since this morning. On the slide three, just to comment the quarterly highlights of our results. Despite the very <mark type="inaudible" /> first encouraging signs of recovery, the economic environment remains fragile. And in the backdrop, the operating performance of the Group's core businesses is satisfactory overall.</p>
          <p>If we look at both French and International Retail Banking as well as Private Banking business, they all posted solid commercial activity. Our Corporate and Investing Banking franchise also achieved a strong operational performance for all its business, confirming the success of the very well balanced business model. The situation is more mixed for Specialized Financial Services with activities slowing down, and there is a negative effect of an environment that has remained unfavorable during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Lastly, realignment measures approaching for Security Services, while Asset Management is showing the first signs of stabilization. In total, the Group produced net banking income of &#x20AC;6.7 billion, up 6.5% versus the third quarter of last year. This is after excluding the non-recurring items, which amounted in the third quarter &#x20AC;4.8 billion. I will comment that more into detail.</p>
          <p>So the reduced negative accounting impact of the credit spread narrowing amounted to a &#x20AC;0.5 billion versus 1.3 billion in the second quarter. And impairment and write-downs on assets at risk amounted to &#x20AC;0.2 billion versus &#x20AC;0.4 billion in the second quarter. On top of that, if you have noticed it, we have recorded some provisions on the classified securities in the provision for credit losses line.</p>
          <p>The Group has also continued during the quarter to sell its assets at risk for a total of &#x20AC;1.7 billion this quarter with a limited positive impact on its P&amp;L. In term of cost of risk, as I've said, we booked &#x20AC;334 million of portfolio based provisioning on the CDO for RMBS that were reclassified as loan and receivables a year ago. Excluding these items, the commercial cost of risk was stable compared to the previous quarter at 117 basis points compared to 118 in second quarter.</p>
          <p>As a result of all these items, the Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;426 million this quarter. And finally regarding solvency position of the Group &#x2013; and I would give you more granularity in the presentation &#x2013; you can see that pro forma from the right issues that was settled on Monday the Tier 1 ratio of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale stands at 10.8% and the Core Tier 1 at 8.6%.</p>
          <p>If we move on slide four, where you have the full detailed P&amp;L of the Group. You can see that the net banking income line, including the non-recurring item, we are at &#x20AC;6.0 million, up 19.2% on a like-for-like basis compared to last year. And as I said already, up 6.5% if we were to exclude non-recurring items.</p>
          <p>Due to the moderate rise in operating  expense, which are up by 6.7% on a like-for-like basis, the gross operating income grew considerably to 2.1 billion, up 52.3% on a like-for-like basis. The cost of risk that I will detail on next slide has doubled compared to last year due to the deterioration of the economic environment since mid 2008. But as we said already, it is almost stable compared to the second quarter. Last, but not least, so the return on equity of the Group stands at 4.1% for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>On page five, if we turn to the risk which are starting to stabilize, as already mentioned in the second quarter. In the French Networks the cost of risk is stable and exactly in the same, let's say, mixture than in the previous two quarters, with most of the risk coming from the business customers.</p>
          <p>In International Retail Banking, the increase in allocation to provision, which are by 8% compared to Q2, is mainly due to a slight deterioration of the risk in <mark type="inaudible" /> subsidiaries. As you can see that excluding Russia the cost of risk rose from 97 bps to 123. If we look at our two large subsidiaries, in Czech Republic the cost of risk increased from 131 in Q2 to 139 in Q3, and in Romania from 97 in Q2 to 128 in Q3. It remains moderate overall and it should be noticed.</p>
          <p>Signs of stabilization can be seen in our Russian subsidiaries, with the cost of risk that still is high at 523 bps, but slightly down compared to Q2. I think we should be cautious at this point, but it's positive and as expected in terms of having in the coming quarter cost of risk that will stay between 500 to 600 bps.</p>
          <p>In Financial Services, the cost of risk is continuing to rise for consumer finance, which accounts for four-fifth of the total of provisioning. The cost of risk in consumer finance rose to 501 basis points during the quarter, whereas the situation is stabilizing for equipment finance where the cost of risk was slightly down to 113 compared to 130, particularly because of improvements we see in Germany.</p>
          <p>Last but not least in the Corporate and Investment Banking, I already mentioned the provision where we classified securities. Excluding that, you can see that the cost of risk was stable compared to Q2, in term of basis points it is down compared to Q2, essentially because we registered this quarter &#x20AC;90 million of provision for litigation, this is all litigation which for one it was started in the early '80s &#x2013; '90s, sorry, and so overall the portfolio is behaving extremely well.</p>
          <p>If we move to page six on the Tier 1 position of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. As I said, at end of September before the capital increase, the Group financial structure grew by almost 90 bps compared to end of June with a Tier 1 of 10.4% and a Core Tier 1 of 7.9%. If you have to split this 90 bps, we can say that half is coming on one side from the capital increase of the employees, a little bit more 10 bps and 30 bps from the hybrid issuance that we made in August for &#x20AC;1 billion, and the other 50% is coming from retail earnings for almost 15 bps and contraction of the risk weighted assets for almost 30 bps.</p>
          <p>On top of that we will benefit from the capital increase of &#x20AC;4.8 billion, which were successfully closed last week with a subscription rate &#x2013; over subscription rate of 172%. You can see that 98.9% of the subscriptions have been done on a irrevocable basis, and so pro forma from this right issue the Core Tier 1 of the Group will be up to 8.6% and the Tier 1 to 10.8%.</p>
          <p>I would like now to turn through the businesses starting with the French Networks. That developed in an economic environment that was globally more positive in the third quarter. They have developed a strong commercial activity. This is illustrated by the opening of new joint account which were up by plus 49,000, highlighting the good campaigns that we made with young customers especially.</p>
          <p>In term of savings, you can see that deposit outstanding has continued to increase, reaching almost &#x20AC;100 billion, up 2% versus last year. And this was driven by regulated savings, as well as sight deposits, which were respectively up 11% for regulated deposits and almost 4% for sight deposits. We have seen a slight decrease by &#x2013; new decrease by 26% for the term deposits, which have suffered from lower level of interest rates.</p>
          <p>In term of new business, in the lending side we've seen good momentum, particularly for housing loans, which were up by 26% to &#x20AC;3.2 billion in Q3. This is an increase of 26%, as I said, compared to Q2 and also consumer loans did behave well in the Networks.</p>
          <p>In term of investment loans, it's important to notice that investment loans for corporates have increased by 5.1%. And if overall the loan outstanding rise was limited to 0.7%, this is essentially due to the contraction that we've seen in operating loans, which were down by 21%.</p>
          <p>In term of P&amp;L, as mentioned in mid September, French Networks have delivered a good top line growth, up 3.6%, which is in line so with the target that we have for the full year, to achieve 2%. I remind you that we were slightly positive for the first half and so we are on the trend of almost 4% for the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>This change is attributable mainly to improved interest margins. You have seen in the appendices that interest margin was up compared to the third quarter last year and the second quarter of this year, and commission remained almost stable. We have continued to control our operating expenses, which are up by 0.7%, and this has translated into an improvement of our cost/income ratio by 1.8 points to 62.5% excluding PEL/CEL effects.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page eight and have a look to International Retail Banking business. We can say that they have achieved a good resilience in an environment that has been deteriorating over the last 12 months. We have implemented realignment measures, which have been adapted to each country's particular situation. And as you can see, we have closed 47 branches in Russia this quarter. On the other hand, we are continuing to make some investments in the Mediterranean Basin, with 10 branches open in that region. So all in all, you can see that the Group has 3,761 point of sales as of end of September.</p>
          <p>We have also reduced further the headcounts, which were down by 2.1% from end of June to end of September, totaling as of end of September 63,000 people. You can see that in term of mixture of growth in terms of deposits and loans, it is totally the opposite than it was 12 months ago. Deposits are growing by 4%, while the loan increase is limited to 1.7% leading to an improvement of the loan-to-deposit ratio, which is below 100% at 97% as of end of September.</p>
          <p>In term of financial results, they are satisfactory overall and we can say that in Russia where the ROEs increase is limited to plus 1.1% at constant exchange rate. You can see that for Romania has shown a strong growth in term of revenues, which are up almost 10% on a like-for-like basis, excluding the capital gains that we booked last year and that was disclosed  on Asiban, which is life insurance subsidiary that was sold to Groupama.</p>
          <p>Overall, revenue increased by 3.2% versus last quarter and also so we have been able to improve sequentially the cost/income ratio, showing the tight control that we have made on the cost base, which dropped by 2.8% compared to the second quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>In term of return on equity after tax, you can see that the division has continued to deliver a 14.1% return on equity after tax despite the losses in Russia. It would be 26.9% excluding Russia and you can see this is supported by the strong return still achieved in Czech Republic, 41.5, or in Romania, 36.4.</p>
          <p>If we turn now to Financial Services on page nine, as I said, the environments has remained slightly unfavorable and in this environment the business, new business has slowed down. You can see that new business has contracted in both consumer finance minus 16.6% and in equipment finance minus 19%.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I would like to point it out that in France the decrease in this activity has been more limited showing the fact that we continue to accompany our customer base. In term of outstanding there was a slowing down of the growth, but still positive, with loan outstanding up 7.2% in consumer finance and 3.6% in equipment finance. The growth in France is 6% in consumer finance and 8% for equipment finance.</p>
          <p>In term of revenues, this combination's rising outstanding has triggered a 7% increase versus last year of top line to almost &#x20AC;700 million. This was supported also by the resilience of the margins in our businesses.</p>
          <p>We have continued to contain the cost base and optimize the cost base and activities which were suffering from the slowdown of economy. And you can see that operating expense were stable and head count has been reduced by 10% compared to last year. Combined with the betterment of the life insurance and also with the cost of risk already mentioned, the net income was slightly positive, close to breakeven in the third quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>If we move now to Global Investment Management and Services, starting with Private Banking. Our Private Banking activities are continuing to grow and they have registered &#x2013; recorded net operating inflows of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, which is extremely satisfactory. Outstanding asset under management has increased by 4.9% compared to end of June, benefiting also from the rebound in the equity market.</p>
          <p>It's important to notice that the invested assets of our customer base has increased, with now the cash in the total AuM going down from 33 to 30% as of end of September. And thus this has a slightly negative impact on our treasury revenues, but nevertheless being counterbalanced by increase in fee business.</p>
          <p>Overall, our net margins stand at 112 basis points this quarter. And as you can see, revenues are up by 2% compared to last year. Operating expense were under control, decreasing by minus 5.1% compared to last year and this has lead to almost 18% increase in the gross operating of our Private Banking activity.</p>
          <p>For Asset Management the trend was towards stabilization in the third quarter, with 1.6 billion outflows essentially coming from, on one side alternative investment/divestment, minus 2.1 billion outflows and the shift or switch from money market funds minus 2.5 billion into corporate bonds funds plus 1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Assets under Management stands at &#x20AC;273 billion as of end of September, which is a slight increase compared to the previous quarter. Net banking income for this quarter was almost &#x20AC;200 million, up 9.4% compared to last year, and we have continued also to contain the cost base, which is down by 2% compared to third quarter of '08, and thus the gross operating income stands at &#x20AC;17 million in the third quarter '09.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 11, with custody, Newedge and Boursorama. We can see that  both custody and Newedge have suffered from the low level of interest rate, as well as tightening of spreads. Regarding the assets under custody, this is nevertheless the first time that these two has &#x2013; is exceeding the &#x20AC;3 trillion of assets under custody, benefiting from expanded partnership with European, Belgium and international, as well as rebound from the market.</p>
          <p>In term of volume for Newedge, you can see that we are continuing to trade 750 million lots during the quarter, increasing our market share by 0.7 points to 12.5%, confirming the positioning of Newedge as leader in this industry cost-to-cost with Goldman Sachs.</p>
          <p>Lastly, with Boursorama it has continued to achieve a dynamic development. As you can see, stock order trade has increased by 25% compared to last year. And more importantly, in term of direct banking activity, it has been successful with almost 9,000 new accounts opened during the quarter and more than 96,000 accounts as of end of September.</p>
          <p>Overall, this division has seen its revenue slightly going down by 15.2%. But also we have put an emphasis on the cost control, which were down by 8.6% limiting the impact on the gross operating income.</p>
          <p>If I turn now to Corporate and Investment Banking. As I said, we have recorded &#x20AC;751 million of non-recurring item this quarter, &#x20AC;530 million linked to accounting impact of the spread tightening on our CDS portfolio as well as our own spreads and &#x20AC;221 million of markdowns in revenue lines on asset at risk. Excluding these items, the performance was extremely satisfactory at &#x20AC;2.5 billion, up 43% compared to last year. And you can see that in term of commercial activity, we have achieved in the third quarter our second best revenue level at 1.5 billion, so approximately 60% of total revenues of the division.</p>
          <p>The trading has been well oriented despite the fact that we have reduced the VaR, and so this has been achieved not with an increasingly fat appetitive. The value at risk, which has benefited from some technical, let's say, compensation effect this quarter went down from &#x20AC;50 million in the second quarter to &#x20AC;31 million in the third quarter. We should expect the VaR to start to re-increase in Q4 looking at this, let's say, almost unique compensation, high compensation level in terms of back accreditation.</p>
          <p>If we move to slide 13 to look more into detail into the performance of each business line. Equity activities has performed strongly during the quarter, with market parameters which have also improved, rising indices, falling volatility and also the rise in learning curve. This performance has been supported by solid structured product activities, which has increased by 47% in term of new business compared to last year. And the trading activities were solid, benefiting from the complementary nature of the value strategies.</p>
          <p>On the fixed income side, the business line has recorded a decrease in revenues to slightly below &#x20AC;1 billion. Our client-driven revenues fell by 15% compared to previous quarter due to lower margins. And in term of trading, let's say, also we have seen a contraction also with lower activity as always in August during the summertime.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, we were very pleased by the performance of the Financing and Advisory business line, which has achieved a record performance in the third quarter, above &#x20AC;500 million, which is traditionally more quiet in term of debt and equity origination. And this has been, let's say, supported by a solid structured finance revenues performance, particularly for natural resource and export finance, and also in capital market despite quieter months in August. We have been able <mark type="inaudible" /> our position as number one in euro corporate bond issuance with a market share of 10% and number two for overall euro denominated issuance.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I would like to note that the Group's customer franchises are continuing to grow. This is demonstrated by the commercial rebound that were achieved by the French Networks and also the strong resilience in International Retail Banking and Private Banking activities.</p>
          <p>The Corporate and Investment Banking business model has been also confirm &#x2013; has confirmed the gain in market share and also the business of its franchise. The Group has continued to realign the cost base, especially in the businesses which were the most affected by the crisis and to reduce its assets at risk with this &#x20AC;1.7 billion of asset disposal, as I said, with slightly positive impact in term of P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>The Group financial structure is extremely solid after the right issue, but also due to the internal capital generation achieved in the third quarter with a Core Tier 1 of 8.6% and a total Tier 1 ratio of 10.8%. And so this mix is comfortable to achieve our priorities, which are to maintain a balanced and diversified business portfolio geared towards growth, while continuing to optimize the operating model. And we will also, as illustrated with illustration we hold currently with Dexia's on the acquisition of 20% stake in Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord, selectively reinvest &#x2013; we will selectively reinvest in our businesses to strengthen our business model.</p>
          <p>That's it for the presentation. I would like also to mention you that we will be pleased to discuss all this points more into detail and also to discuss our ambition in an Investor Day that we plan to organize in June 2010. We will also provide you more granularity in term of financial and operational targets that we have for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in the coming years.</p>
          <p>That's it. I am now ready to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Didier. I was wondering if you could explain yet again very strong numbers in equity derivatives. I mean, in the equity line, if I would annualize that it was more or less the best number ever. So can you explain, is there any reversals of reserves in there with any dividends for correlation book? How should we read this number as we go forward?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the corporate center cost considering some of the spreads have come down, how should we look at the financing cost within the corporate center going forward in terms of run rate cost? And thirdly, can you talk about provisions and the dynamic of provisions that you see as they have gone through the quarter within the key businesses? And particularly I'm interested in your Financial Service business as provision continuously increase. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Kian, thanks. I will let Michel answer to the first question on equity derivatives, and I will take the following two questions on the corporate center and provisions. Michel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kian. Indeed it's been a very good quarter on equity derivatives, which has been highlighted by the fact that we had not only a good trading performance on the back of market normalization and effectively we've been benefiting from positive trends on the dividends and volatility. But also it's a lot due to the fact that our client business has been up compared to previous quarter of $0.12 and on year-to-year its up 22%. And that has been driven particularly by the revival of the solution and structured business on the client side. And this is a trend which has already been detected in the Q2 and is accelerating on Q3, and our pipeline there is pretty encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And should we &#x2013; but there is no kind of extraordinaries in there or things that you would say it's probably going to be unlikely to be repeated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you speak a little bit louder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Is there anything in the numbers that you would say it's unlikely to be repeated within the equity line going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that indeed we've benefited from &#x2013; to some extent from market normalization, but overall I think it's a pretty balanced performance in between the client side and the trading side. We are close to historical highs.</p>
          <p>We said in a previous presentation that we anticipate the equity derivative business to be on the average would be closer to 800 million per quarter. We've been a bit above that, but nothing special, just a balanced and pretty encouraging business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So regarding the corporate center, Kian, and the spreads tightening in fact with the corporate centre is more holding the widening of spreads in the past, so we will not benefit from the spread tightening at some point or it will take some time, so you should expect to get that staying at a certain high level, I would say, in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Regarding the dynamic in terms of provisions, businesses by businesses. On the French Networks, I would say, there is not that much to say, and as I said during the presentation, with the kind of stability and we should expect that to stay in the same level in the coming quarters. International Retail Banking it is, again, almost as mentioned over the last six months, which is that we were expecting that side of the cost of risk to increase slightly and it has been the case in Romania and Czech Republic, but it is extremely limited and under control. In Russia, the stabilization at this high level is, first, I would say, positive signs, but we are not expecting that to decrease in the coming quarters. We should be so in that range of 5 to 600 basis points.</p>
          <p>Regarding Financial Services that you specifically mentioned, in the consumer finance, yes, we've seen this further increase from a little bit more than 400 bps &#x2013; it was 413 in the Q2 &#x2013; to 501 in the third quarter. I would say there is &#x2013; the dynamic are different from one country to one other. This quarter we've seen an increase in Italy and to less extent in Poland, while as we've seen Retail Banking outside France, for example, there was kind of stability in Russia and well under control in France.</p>
          <p>So it's kind of mixture. It's always difficult to project our self in the coming quarter, but I'd say we should still expect to start increase, let's say, maybe, or to stay at that level in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Regarding leasing, on the other side, as I said, we have benefited from a slight decrease which was linked to &#x2013; more to the provision that we booked in first and second quarter on certain funds in Germany, rather than an overall global improvement.</p>
          <p>Lastly with the CIB side, there I'd say if you strip out the litigation provisions, you can see that we were down compared to second quarter in terms of real commercial losses. Important to notice that there is no big fire. So in term of large corporate counterparts, there was no accident over the last 12 months, which is extremely satisfactory. It could happen, but nevertheless the shape of the portfolio and the way we do manage it has been extremely positive so far.</p>
          <p>Regarding the sectors, we can say that the two sectors which are explaining most of the burden in this quarter as in the previous quarter were, first, certain commercial real estate exposure. And second, and to less extent, certain smaller deals. But again, it's a few tens of million euros, it's not a big impact. And that's for the CIB.</p>
          <p>Regarding the reclassified assets, as we said, and some of the right issue we have 334 this quarter and we should expect some further provisions in the quarter to come.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is basically &#x2013; the way we do really the impairment test is based on the evolution of the underlying portfolio for MBS in term of increasing the foreclosure real estate own and past due 90 days. So we always made a photo &#x2013; take a picture at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We knew, nevertheless, that the likelihood to see that level increasing in the quarter &#x2013; in the current quarter is a likelihood that is extremely high. So, yes, we would like to get a further provision on these assets in the fourth quarter. Especially on the CDO for MBS. For the rest there was no provisions, and the impairment tests we made are comforting ourselves in the underlying quality of the asset that were not classified. So it's solely on the CDO front, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just very briefly on the exotic credit derivative book, which you over hedged, and the CDS spreads tightened. You clearly have a mark-to-market loss. Is there any change in the way you manage that book? Is it still overhedged?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we already mentioned in the second quarter that on the line under which we report the losses on the exotic credit derivatives, which stands at &#x20AC;441 million in the quarter, they are the one item which is not exactly linked to the management of the portfolio, which is a credit macro hedge that is on a corporate credit and this is essentially &#x2013; and where we booked this quarter minus &#x20AC;130 million. Or it should be more looked at macro on core asset at risk hedge rather than something dedicated to the exotic credit derivative book. So if we strip out that, we are more at minus 311. And we always said that there is a lag of this portfolio, which is booked in monocline and when we have a minus on one side, we have a plus on the other side. So on the plus in monocline -- so on the hedge of monoline, which is dedicated to the CMBS assets which are in this exotic credit portfolio were positive by plus 118, so from an economical basis the loss was minus 193, so let say's &#x20AC;200 million. And this is in line with the loan protection position that you can see in the appendices of our  D7 disclosure, which mean that we are essentially long &#x2013; especially CMBS &#x2013; so long protection on CMBS and slightly long on EBIT, and so when spread our tightening we are negatively impacted.</p>
          <p>Just to mention that if we look at what happened during the quarter, on the EBIT and the AAA all six or seven being hedged, we're seeing an increase on average from $0.40 a dollar to $0.50 a dollar, so this is explaining part of the loss that we booked on the long hedge position and on CMBS the increase was from $0.81 to $0.87 and so also explained the slight negative impact that we had booked on this long protection position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Autonomous, but hello, Didier. Quick question on the reclassified book. On the U.S. RMBS CDOs among the reclassified asset generally what is the shadow P&amp;L and what are the expected losses on the U.S. RMBS CDOs effectively? And can you tell us specifically what are the vintages which have been &#x2013; or we should believe at this point are more problematic than others? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jacques-Henri, with shadow P&amp;L on the CDO for MBS as of end of September was slightly below &#x20AC;1 billion. It was slightly below &#x20AC;800 million as of end of June. The &#x20AC;200 million increase of the shadow &#x2013; and this is pre the provisioning that I would comment later, so this is really the difference between the price at which they transferred a year ago and the price at which they would be if they were still in trading. The &#x20AC;200 million increase is linked to two factors. One, you've seen that we have a <mark type="inaudible" /> assumption on the 2004 vintage cum losses, which were increased by from 4.4% to 5.5%.</p>
          <p>And the second impact is leading to the relative evolution of our vintages and from RMBS, which is slightly worse than the average of the market, and so this is contributing to increasing the shadow P&amp;L. And there it is essentially on the vintage 2005 that we have this slight worst behavior compared to the average of the market. So we have, so as I said, 965 to be precise million euros of shadow P&amp;L as of end of September. In front of that we have with our impairment test mined the gap, I would say, partially with this &#x20AC;334 million provisioning. So the net gap between now the value loans and receivable netted provisions and the value of the mark-to-stress is a little bit more than &#x20AC;600 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just wanted to clarify the 1.7 billion of disposals that you've done in the quarter. And if you could just elaborate, maybe you've mentioned in the early part of the call, but if you could just elaborate what they are. And secondly, have you got a little bit more clarity &#x2013; I still don't understand on the CLOs that are hedged with monocline, why the fair value of the CLOs have not deteriorated in value when the tranches that are hedged with monoline have collapsed in rating during the quarter? I'm still not sure exactly how that works, if you could clarify?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your question. Regarding the 1.7 billion assets that we sold during the quarter, in term of underlyings, there is 1.1 billion, which are U.S. ABS, half which are CMBS, RMBS and half which are other type of assets. And &#x20AC;600 million, which are European ABS.</p>
          <p>Just to give you &#x2013; I don't know whether this is sufficiently clear or precise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's fine. Yes, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the mixture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding then your second question regarding the CLOs. In fact, the rating of the tranches are not key, because when you look into detail to the way we do make our mark-to-stress, we're not looking by transparency, not to the rating of the tranche that we own, but to the rating of the assets which are in that tranches.</p>
          <p>So if you look towards the appendices on the supplementary data on the page 57, you can see &#x2013; yes, following the Moody's update in term of rating, as said, lot of our tranches have moved from AAA to AA. But it is not how we were looking at them, because if you're looking at them as AAA, in that case we would have no losses.</p>
          <p>But we are looking at the underlying assets and so it's more the second line on page 57 which is key. So the fact that we have 3% of BBB and above, 20% of BB, 59% of B and 17% of CCC. And based on this, underlying assets are not the &#x2013; originate will be tranches that we own, but more on the assets which are in that tranches. We have so this mark-to-stress assumption of 5% cum losses for BBB, 17 for BB, et cetera, up to 100% below CCC. So this is what is explaining essentially the way we do mark-to-stress our assets.</p>
          <p>Just because I have the underlying asset distribution of the second quarter, you can see that we have 73% of BBB, it was the same percentage as end of June. And BB we're seeing already some technical impact, because some assets which were in default have disappeared from the underlying assets, but BB was up from 18 to 20%, B was down from 60 to 59%, and CCC was down from 19 to 17%. So you can see that everything is almost stable, and this is explaining why there is no that much sensitivity in our mark-to-stress, even if the breaking at the top level tranches were moved strongly from AAA to AA.</p>
          <p>Is that clear, Guillaume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I had actually a follow-up question with regard to the reclassified assets. Can you guide us or help us build our forecast basically for the next maybe 10 quarters? Is it reasonable to assume 1 billion, 2 billion, 3 billion provision on these assets? Have you got any hint for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the shadow P&amp;L, as of end of June, it is at 2.3 billion for the sole CIB side, with 2.4 billion as the total. So this is, I would say, a kind of worst case scenario. If we were to move into trading. Nevertheless, when we look more into detail, as I said at the time of the right issue, the draft of the shadow P&amp;L where we are more attentive in the <mark type="inaudible" /> CDO for MBS. We are clearly less nervous on the CMBS where the shadow has strongly reduced both the tightening of the spread as well as on the CLOs.</p>
          <p>On the CDO for MBS, as I said to Jacques-Henri, currently we have still &#x20AC;600 million plus of gap between the shadow and shadow net of the provisioning, and so this is certainly something which is clearly very likely to happen in the current quarter.</p>
          <p>After that, as you said 10 quarters it was as if you're asking me what is the trends for the coming 10 quarters in term of cost of risk. It's extremely difficult for me to go that far in term of trends with a kind of precision of x million euros, for example.</p>
          <p>There is some more to come, &#x20AC;600 million at Q1 parameters but as you've seen during the quarter it could migrate especially if our portfolio was to confirm the <mark type="inaudible" /> we are slightly worse than the average of the market. That's the type of thing I can tell you. But so you can imagine that for the coming quarters, if we have something which is in the region of what we've seen this quarter is not totally realistic.</p>

          <p>We now have a question Mr. Brice Vandamme from Deutsche Bank. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to ask you a few quick questions, Didier. The first one is related to the international retail activity. Could you give us, as you did during the last quarter, the ratio of NPL and coverage ratio by main countries? And you did &#x2013; so that for the main division all offshore activity.</p>
          <p>I have another question related to the risk-weighted asset reduction you had this quarter. If I understood well, you told us a few minutes ago that we should expect a bounce back of your VaR in Corporate and Investment Banking in Q4. Does it mean that we will also see a part of this risk-weighted asset reduction we had in Q3 offset next quarter?</p>
          <p>Another question perhaps related to the level of non-performing loan coverage, which is did stand 61%. We have recently for the equity talking about countercyclical provisioning. Does that mean that you intend to increase this coverage into coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And last question on M&amp;A, could you perhaps just tell us where you are in your discussion with Dexia? And also if you've been invited by KBC perhaps to have a look at their private banking activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Brice, hi. Regarding the NPLs, same perimeter then last quarter. So regarding the retail outside France, last quarter we had NPLs loans of 7.6%. It has increased to 8.5% and the overall coverage was slightly down from 64 to 61%.</p>
          <p>For the major subsidiaries, on Commercial Banque we had 5.7% as of end of June. It went up to 6.1% end of September. And coverage ratio was down by one point from 52 to 51%. For Rosbank, the NPLs were 8.6%. The increase was to 11.7% and the coverage ratio was down from 86 to 82. And lastly for &#x2013; I think I gave only the <mark type="inaudible" /> for BRD. The NPL ratios stood at 4.4% end of June, went up to 5.5 end of September, and the coverage ratio went down from 58 to 46%, but there was some technical reclassification as NPL.</p>
          <p>Regarding Financial Services, NPLs were 8.1% end of June, went up to 8.8% end of September, with a coverage ratio up from 50% to a little bit less than 52. And for Retail Network in France, NPLs increased from 3.7 to 3.9, and coverage ratio was almost stable, 48% end of June and 47% end of September.</p>
          <p>And for the CIB &#x2013; just to finish on each division &#x2013; NPLs were 2.1 in end of the June, 2.6 end of September, and coverage ratio went down from 48 to 46. Overall, you're seeing that NPLs went up from 4.2 to 4.7% and the coverage ratio, excluding portfolio based provisioning, was down from 53 to 52.</p>
          <p>That's it. Maybe regarding your third question you mentioned that Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oud&#xE9;a mentioned statistical provisioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some contra cyclical provisioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Contra cyclical, well, that I'd say it has to be discussed under the new IAS 39 rule where actually we would welcome this mechanism to be able to create some buffer when the sun is shining, and to be able to get some write-backs of some cushion when days are getting worse. How we have seen in the Spanish banks.</p>
          <p>But I think that technically it has to be more defined and there is a consultation paper which has been sent by IS Board regarding the technicality of that additional provisioning.</p>
          <p>On the 61, you've seen that it was relatively stable, and I should mention that in the definition of non-performing loans we are &#x2013; gross non-performing loans -- we are not taking into account any collateral or guarantee on that exposure.</p>
          <p>Regarding the risk-weighted assets, the answer to your question, Brice, is yes. We are expecting the VaR, the VaR is extremely likely to increase in the fourth quarter. In that case, this meaning that the increase in the risk-weighted assets of the Corporate and Investment Banking will be, of course, influenced by this re-increase of the VaR.</p>
          <p>Lastly on the M&amp;A, regarding Dexia, we're continuing to hold discussions, so I would say we -- at this point we have nothing to add except that we are continuing to hold discussion with Dexia. We don't provide regular update until the deal will be closed.</p>
          <p>And regarding KBC, no comment. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oud&#xE9;a mentioned that -- and it has been confirmed in the recent announcement that with a new commission asking to a lot of groups to divest of a asset, there will be good assets available. So we will not comment on each name that will be forced to sell assets, whether we have an interest or not. The sole area that we said is that we have interest in CE, especially in Poland, and to less extent, in private banking. That's it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Alessandro Roccati from Fox-Pitt. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mr. Valet. A very quick question from me. The first one is again on the core Tier 1, 7.9%, at the end of the quarter you saw an 8% decrease in risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>Now how much do you think that risk-weighted assets might come back in the coming quarter due to the change in the market risk? And should we see a decrease of the quarter one on a quarterly basis on the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the provisions you made on the IAS 39 reclassified assets, 334 million, so roughly 1% of the 29 billion total assets you have transferred. Now you mentioned earlier that there might be some fair provisions which should be in the region of recorded in the third quarter, so we're looking at three, 400,000 million. But if I am not wrong then benefit of transferring those assets was in the region of 2.4 billion. Now the trend has been positive in the recent course, but obviously if we divide these 2.4 billion by three, 400 million which is the run rate on a quarterly basis, we're looking at further provisions for the next five or six quarters. And finally, I am just wondering whether you can give us the breakdown of the equity and financing revenues between clients and trading for the three divisions' equity and finance which are confined? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good afternoon, Alessandro. Regarding the &#x2013; what could come back and what would be the impact if the market risk were to re-increase, as I just mentioned, it's always complicated. But the risk-weighted assets linked to market risk went down by &#x20AC;5 billion during the quarter, so part is linked to VaR and part is linked with counter &#x2013; more counterparty risk on market activities. But as we have little more than &#x20AC;320 billion of risk-weighted assets, 5%, this is 1.5% increase multiplied by 8% of Tier 1, this means that we will lose 10 bps, something like that, if the 5 billion was to revert. And the 5 billion means that the VaR would have to on average increase from 31 to 50, so it gives you kind of sensitivity. But I think that I have no clue at this point to what will be the level, precise level of the VaR at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding the reclassified assets, you mentioned &#x2013; yes, it's 1% of total assets that were reclassified, the 28.6 billion as of 1st of October. Bear in mind that, I would say, only 23.5 billion is linked to the CIB, the rest was &#x2013; more was a technical in the insurance side, so the more appropriate base is more 23.5 billion for the sole CIB. And as I said earlier, within this &#x20AC;23.5 billion, where we have actually a strong attention is on the CDO for MBS, which is &#x20AC;5 billion of nominal reclassified exposure, which has been when it was transferred already discounted at almost 35%, so this 334 is increasing this coverage.</p>
          <p>On the client side, yes, as none of our competitors are disclosing the split between trading and clients, we need to be more shy. But I would give it to you. For the equity side, client revenues were &#x20AC;629 million compared to 560 in the previous quarter and trading was &#x20AC;402 million compared to 441 in the previous quarter. And for the fixed income side clients was 375 compared to 462 and trading was 590 compared to 956.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. This Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi. First question is, did you have any exposure to CIT bankruptcy, Commercial Investment Trust in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And the second question is if you can give us an update on the operational efficiency plan. I think you're targeting 430 million gains for this year, and I wonder how much did you achieve in the third quarter please. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kimon. Regarding CIT, we have no comment. If we had an exposure to comment, we would have done it, so no comment on CIT.</p>
          <p>Regarding the operating efficiency plan, yes, we are expecting &#x20AC;430 million of gain this year. We would update you at the full year's results, but we are on track with this target. As you have seen us saying, various evolution of the cost base across the Group, you're seeing that the cost base as I said controlling the French Networks plus 0.7%, despite the fact that we have, of course, some normal and traditional wage increase just to take some example.</p>
          <p>Secondly we're seeing that we have extremely well control because wage in the Financial Services reduced in the Global Investment Management and Service, and also the cost base of the CIB ex-valuable compensation is very much under control, so this is signs of the benefit from this operating efficiency plan.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello there. I just have two quick question as most of mine have been answered.</p>
          <p>Is there &#x2013; first, is there a capital gain to be expected from your joint venture from the concluding of the deal with Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And as a matter of interest, the Basel Committee released its impact study on market risk, and as flagged by many banks, the average was about 3.2 times increase, so the increase by 2.2 times, if I may. So obviously then the volatility around that number was huge as well, so I was just wondering whether you maintained maybe your impact to range that you gave around three times or whether, post that impact study, you changed your mind either way? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean Francois, good afternoon. Regarding the capital gain on the contribution of the CAAM to Amundi asset management, we are expecting to have a capital gain of almost &#x20AC;700 million this quarter &#x2013; next quarter, sorry. The impact would be mutual in term of Tier 1, as we will also book in front of that some goodwill from the acquisition itself at this stage in the new group for 25%.</p>
          <p>Regarding the question on the market risk, no, we are not changing our mind. This is a mechanical calculation, so as we said, we are expecting an increase for almost &#x20AC;35 billion linked to incurrence of this charge <mark type="inaudible" /> and so this will take place in early 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just as a follow-up, I was just wondering about the operational side of things. Is there any impact that you either see reversing or increasing with the new regulation? Because I can see obviously that you have quite a bit of operational risk and I was just wondering whether there was some legacy from previous quarters or past history there that we should expect that to change either on the way up or down? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operational risk, risk-weighted assets related to operational risk are, I would say, relatively stable.</p>

          <p>We now have a question from Patrick Leclerc from Merrill Lynch. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Didier. Well, coming back on what you just say about IRCM <mark type="inaudible" />, so I understand you just mentioned 35 billion impact on risk-weighted assets, but I mean not that long ago figures mentioned were around 50, 60 billion if I'm not &#x2013; well, if I'm right.</p>
          <p>Second question, regarding Tier I ratio, while the core Tier 1 capital seems to have increased by 1 billion in this quarter, and I can't really find where they come from. 330, from net profit, a bit from capital increase for employees. And then I guess you have accrued dividend. And, well, I'm still missing part of it.</p>
          <p>And third question on the value at risk. I understand you benefited from some compensation effect between asset classes, which are a bit exceptional this quarter. Could you just clarify exactly what is the balance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Patrick, good afternoon and welcome back, as we said.</p>
          <p>Regarding the incremental recharge and so on, maybe the figure that we had as of June, &#x20AC;17 billion   as a total of risk-weighted assets related to market risk. And we say that it will triple, so this mean that that's why we said 51, but increase is more 35 billion, so &#x2013; and restricted to that.</p>
          <p>The 35 billion will be almost one-third for each subcomponent or large one-third for income that is charged and a small one-third for stressed VaR and correlation book each. So that's for the first point.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question, I didn't catch. On the capital generation, your question was related to what, accrued dividends, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, basically I try to understand the increase in Tier I capital in this third quarter. According to my calculations there is 1 billion increase in Tier I capital, I mean, to &#x2013; for the move from 7.3 to 7.9%. So can you give us the details of this 1 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> you should start from the net profit of the Group, including minority, and because this is part of Tier I.</p>
          <p>You add back to that the remainder from the prudential bonus you will have to add back to that the result on our own spreads which were neutralized when it was a plus and so also neutralized when it is a minus. And this gives you the increase in the &#x2013; this is a cash flow contribution net of the dividend provisions that were added to the Tier I calculation.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the right issue of the capital increase &#x2013; not the right issue of the capital increase, it's of the employees was little bit short of &#x20AC;300 million of additional capital, and so if you put all that together, you should end close to the 1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is the accrual in line with the 35, 40% payout ratio you pointed to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is &#x2013; well, the accrual of dividend &#x2013; everything will be set by end of that year, but we have started to accrue for dividend, and we said at the time of the capital increase that we are aiming, that we have a target of 35 to 40%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. I'm sorry, you said before capital increase, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I said at the time of the capital increase we gave the guidance to the market that we aim to be making a dividend payout of 35 to 40 million &#x2013; 35 to 40% each year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your last question was on the compensation of the VaR. Yes, what I was willing to say, if you go to the appendices on page 46, you will see that there is two phenomena which are explaining the decrease in the VaR. The first one is the decrease in the credit VaR. This is especially &#x2013; this is entirely the consequence of the spreads tightening as the shut-in VaRs gets calculated as a percentage of the level of spread. So if spreads are tightening, the shut in basis points is mechanically going a little bit smaller, so that's why you have seen this &#x20AC;17 million decrease in the credit VaR, while fixed income line was more also lean to absolute level of rates.</p>
          <p>But on the other side, you can see that the compensation effect was not moving that much. This means that when you make the calculation of 63 compensation to 94, which is a growth VaR, you have a compensation effect of 65%, which, when you back test this ratio, is 5 to 10 percentage points higher than what we use to have in the past. And so this is more &#x2013; and I said, this is not something that you, I would say, paid out. It is more a consequence of different scenarios that could compensate themselves, and especially this quarter we have benefits from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this is not sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say nevertheless this is not a voluntary position, so it's more consequence of the calculation, so if it were to last, it could. But looking at the back testing, it is unlikely to stay that high for a long period time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Maxence Le Gouvello from Morgan Stanley. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of the run rate of acquisition of new clients, we have seen quite a very high level for Q3 numbers. I just wanted to check if what is in your view the usual run rate over the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be regarding the life insurance. You have achieved a very strong performance for the third quarter. Have you done a special commercial campaign? And how do you view the end of the year on this particular products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding the opening of a new current account, bear in mind that the 49,000 of this quarter, there is always this campaign for young people which took &#x2013; which takes place when they are starting their study at university or <mark type="inaudible" /> so September is always a month where you have to conquer these clients.</p>
          <p>I would say, to have something &#x2013; at least 200,000 a year is something which now seems to be realistic. So that's the targets. 100, sorry, 100, that was a &#x2013; I made a mistake. So 100,000 a year, sorry, is something that seems to be a reasonable ambition and I hope that <mark type="inaudible" /> for this year and this is 100,000 for this year with a weak first half, and so we should gain ground in term of momentum in 2010. I didn't catch your second question, Maxence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the life insurance, the level of the premium has been quite high on the third quarter. I just wanted to have a better feeling of have you &#x2013; was it a special campaign dedicated in September budget or will it be we can in the coming quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The performance in life insurance was extremely satisfactory. I think that we &#x2013; what we say that the image of SocGen is normalizing and definitely this is showing that in the figures that we have delivered this quarter, which we are extremely pleased. We have been able to capture market shares on all type of savings, which means like sight deposits, for corporate customers, but also for private and U.S. were well oriented compared to the previous trend.</p>
          <p>Regulatory deposits, you've seen have a good momentum. We continue to and we are almost the first on the market to do that to push a bit more <mark type="inaudible" /> which is in our view an attractive product in the current market environment. And on the life insurance business, also we have seen much more than any growth of the premiums compared to the average of the bancassurer, so I think this show that on the savings side our two networks, Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale  were able to achieve a strong performance relative to peers.</p>
          <p>In term of loans also I would like to mention that already last year &#x2013; we have not started only this year &#x2013; we were confining our customer, special corporate customers when you look at the loan growth that we made with corporate customers into '07, into '08 and into '09. We continue to have good trends in terms of investment loans, which were up by 5%. Really we have seen this contraction of &#x2013; in treasury loans, but which is in line, a little bit worse than the market, but nevertheless this will show that the customer base is acting to reduce its working capital needs. And in term of mortgages, we've seen since spring, as we said, rebound of the new business and you've seen that the increase Q3 to Q2 is 26% in term of new mortgage business. So I'd say overall we are pleased with the performance achieved by the two networks this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Third question regarding the cost in French Retail. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was mentioning in the last &#x2013; that you are under process of grouping all the back office and is going to potentially necessitate more &#x2013; some investment upfront. When &#x2013; do we need to expect those investments upfront? Is it for the first half of next year or is going to be a bit later on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure that Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois said exactly that, because he had not the mic. But I can &#x2013; what we aim to do is that we have 23 back office in the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale network, and we have also certain number of platforms in the Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord. What we believe is that there is some capacity to go further in term of rationalization of these operations. We have already on a standalone basis for each network launched some initiatives, which will optimize the procedures and <mark type="inaudible" /> to benefit from the natural attrition of our work force in these platforms. And definitely one of the challenge that we will have as from 1st of Jan when Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will take over on the three networks, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and Boursorama, will be clearly to find and to look for further synergies in terms not only on back offices, but also in term of IT between the three networks. And so this is something that will generate some synergies. So now Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois has the mic, so he will be able to answer better than I do your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maxence, clearly the first step is first to have a unique IT system. There is no interest to have the same back offices or back offices in the same place if they don't share the same IT system, so the first step is to have this unique IT system for Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord and Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. And after that we will be able to look at the convergence between the different back offices. But the first step is to have this unique IT system and it will be very long as I said during &#x2013; it will last at least three years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then last question for the CFO. In terms of disclosure with the &#x2013; for next year on the Asset Management, the Asset Management division will be only 80% of the CW and the associate, and 25% of the stake that you have in the JV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be yes &#x2013; bottom line it will be that, but in P&amp;L it will be 100% of CW because it's only minor interest that will be dedicated at the bottom hand. We'll get 25% stake in Amundi and we will get also the revenues for JVs in Korea and in China.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Some quick question. First of all, I don't understand why the cost of risk in Q2 in the previous presentation was 112 and why it is now 118. Second question is, what is in your view your optimal size of Rosbank? Do you think that you're going to close --</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have lost Pierre. So, nevertheless, I can answer his first question. Yes, I forget to mention that in the calculation of the cost of risk in Q1 and Q2 we have slightly changed the calculation, which mean that we were taking into account the cost of risk ex reclassified assets divided by loan and receivable including reclassified assets and it has appeared to be more &#x2013; it was almost not that an issue until we had some purge in reclassified assets. As now we have some, we have calculated on the loans and receivables. Excluding reclassified assets the cost of which you have on page five. We hope that we will find again Pierre.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Didier. I still have one remaining question, it's regard the variable level of the taxes this quarter, especially in the corporate center with very high number, a positive number. Could you give some more explanation on this number please? And just a quick follow-up. You mentioned the IRC application for early 2011. I had in mind that it was already applied for full year &#x2013; end of year at least 2010? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pascal, good afternoon. Regarding your second question, the point whether it will be 31st of December 2010 or whether it will be 1st of Jan, 2011, so there could be some slight shift so that's why I was mentioning 2011, and this is still under discussion with the Basel Committee. But I would say regarding the investments that banks would have to commit, there could be this shift one day, which from an operational point of view will allow us to gain at least six months.</p>
          <p>Then regarding your first question on the tax rate. On the tax rate, so first to remind you how we do calculate the tax rate at the business line level, and how would we cross-check while we had then the calculation at the Group level. So for the business lines, we have a kind of normalized tax rate which is weighted average based on each domestic tax rate. And then we have at the Group level the corporate center just making the gap between the Group level and each weighted average of the division. While we said that, we aim to have on a normal rate the  tax rate for the Group as a whole in the region of 28 to 30%, which is in line or slightly below the weighted average as we have for each business line this quarter and  it was slightly the same in the previous quarter as we booked some losses in jurisdiction which have tax rate which is above the average of the tax rate of the Group. We have some benefits and that explains why tax rate is going down and the full benefit is I would say enjoyed by the corporate center.</p>
          <p>As for each business line this is something which is set once a year and is not causing across the year, so all benefited from &#x2013; all benefit, I would say, from low tax optimization because that is not much &#x2013; it's certainly because of certain losses that could temporally distort the tax rate at the Group level. All this benefit is located at the corporate center level.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way we do calculate is that we adjust the tax rate year-to-date to the tax rate we are expecting to be the one for the full year. So the 7% is just for the Q3, but for the year-to-date we're at 11% around. So we should expect if there is no move in the base of earnings per jurisdiction compared to our business plan, we should aim the tax rate to be in the region of 11% for the full year for the Group.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I have a follow-up on the number of net account opening. Could you have an idea of the breakdown between the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale own network and Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord? And by the way could you remind us what were the level of opening in the second quarter? I couldn't find the figure again. Another point, could you let us know how you are now targeting the development of your customer base? What's the proportion that mortgage loan is expected to play in the client acquisition? You mentioned that Q3 was the quarter for students, but excluding that what's the strategy beyond now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pierre, good afternoon. On the 49,000 accounts opened during the quarter, you know that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is almost four time bigger than Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord, and so we are not that far from this mixture. We are slight &#x2013; a little bit above for SocGen than this four-fifth I would say, and little bit below than one-fifth for Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord. The opening that we had in second quarter was little bit above 8,000 during the second quarter net, so it was certainly in Q1 little bit above 8,000 in &#x2013; 13,000 in Q1, 8,000 in Q2 and so 49,000 in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding our strategy, yes, we &#x2013; it's true to say that mortgages is &#x2013; looking at the increasing volume is back which will acquire new customers, but nevertheless it has been only one way to capture new customers as we had also, of course, the recognition the fact that we have this campaign with young people, which is always important. Even if contrary to certain of our competitors, we have maybe refused to pay as much as they are paying and trying to find more solution, which are making them more faithful. For example, rather than to put &#x20AC;100 on their current accounts that they take and run, we prefer to provide them some services for free and they will use the current account if they want to benefit from this rebate.</p>
          <p>And third way of competition &#x2013; of conquest I would say is also our successful partnership that we have with La Banque F&#xE9;d&#xE9;rale Mutualiste, which is a way for us also to attract civil servant and to serve them, offering them the same type of product range than for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale personally.</p>

          <p>We now have a question from Ms. Anke Reingen from Execution. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Anke from Execution. I just had a few follow-up questions. Firstly on &#x2013; just to complete on the exposures, I just wondered in terms of fair value of own debt and also the CDS book combining the disclosure of end of Q2 and the markdowns in Q3, should this mean that both positions the remaining are potential markdowns in the next quarter should be well adjusted assuming that credit spreads are now markedly coming in. Then also on the exotic credit derivatives book, should we basically think the net number of 200 million negative in the third quarter would be something you would be thinking more about for the next quarter?</p>
          <p>And then next on the cost of risk. I saw somewhere that Komer&#x10D;n&#xED; commented that they expect loan loss charges to go up in the next quarter. So should we basically assume for the SocGen Group overall Q4 2009 or Q1 2010 as more like a peak level where you expect loan loss charges to peek, I mean, probably outside the CIB division where loan loss charges a bit more lumpy? And then, sorry, but just on the corporate center, the net loss 180 million, is it more the run rate as we adjust for the tax more like 250 million net loss in the next quarters? And then lastly, maybe just on acquisitions, when you talk about acquisitions, is this more like incremental within your core and capital base or do you think you're basically depending on opportunity there might be another time you might come back to the market because you might find an opportunity which is probably outside your current capital base? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. So regarding your question, first with the CDS our own spreads, on the CDS just to mention that the non-crystallized policy mark-to-market that did exist, is just &#x20AC;100 million and while this will of course depend on the evolution of the credit spreads, corporate credit spreads, but I'd say most of the comeback has been done and they've stabilized over the recent days and weeks. Just to mention also that we've strongly reduced the nominal outstanding of the CDS, which stands today at only 13.5 billion as of September compared to more than 50 billion at their peak. And in due course by selling certain CDS we have also crystallized &#x20AC;0.5 billion so that we currently have added some productivity that <mark type="inaudible" /> that we have hedged, we were able to take benefit from the widening of the spreads to crystallize some of the gains.</p>
          <p>In term of our own spreads, currently we have surprisingly a slight negative loss which is not crystallized, about minus 57. This means that on average the spread at which our structured notes have been issued on SocGen was slightly above the 78 bps, which were the spot price that we've seen as of end of September. But you've seen our CDS has slightly widened month to date, so this means that on the other side we should have &#x2013; we could have a slight positive impact if we were to take the picture today. Nevertheless, I think that on these two items we're more likely to be zero &#x2013; around zero plus or minus, but the volatility will be much more limited due to current level of spreads and also reduction in nominal exposure.</p>
          <p>Your second question was related to the exotic credit derivative books on the minus &#x20AC;200 million economic, whether it is something that is more likely to be a run rate as from today. Again, as I said, as we have loan protection position, and I mentioned that we've seen some increase incurred in third quarter for both EBIT and CMBS indices. If spreads were to continue to tighten in the same magnitude, this 200 million negative could be the sensitivity. But again quarter-to-date spreads did not move that much or most likely widened on certain classes in a very limited way. So we're more, I'd say, in that case likely to get maybe some policy, but again it's a big challenge. The final figure will be close when we will take the picture as of end of December.</p>
          <p>The third question was on the cost of risk following the comment made by KB this morning. As I said, we've seen in Czech Republic a slight increase in the cost of risk Q3 compared to Q2 and we really said that in retail outside France we were excluding ex-Russia, which has already peaked and was at extremely high level. We run &#x2013; we wouldn't be surprised to see further slight increase in Romania, Czech Republic, looking at the economical environment in these countries.</p>
          <p>But again dimensional control, and I would say we believe that compared to most of our risk in that country, cost of risk is well below ensuring the fact that we have managerial exposure in our portfolio better than &#x2013; much better than the average. So regarding Retail Banking outside France, if there was a kind of stabilization, it will be more linked to a kind of also the size of Russia in the total of provisions extremely important and it does account for more than 50% of the total, so truly the main driver at this point is still Russia and we've see a stabilization during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding the rest of the business, as I said, we believe that we should not expect any increase, more plateau in French Networks. CIB, again, performance of the portfolio excluding restructured assets is extremely satisfactory with no large corporate problem. And the problems that I mentioned on commercial real estate and on NBOs is relatively limited compared to the size of the Group, so it's something that we can manage going forward.</p>
          <p>Last but &#x2013; on the corporate center, you mentioned &#x2013; your question on the corporate center, on the &#x2013; I heard &#x20AC;80 million figure, but I can't figure out to what it was related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was more about the run rate per quarter for the corporate center, because it's 180 million net loss in the third quarter benefited from the huge tax reverse, so it is more like 250 million negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can see on the corporate center is that I would more comment at the operating profits pre provision level we should expect something in the region of 200 to 250 losses, which is linked to the negative revenues that we have in term of cost of liquidity, which is kept by the corporate center. And then the final &#x2013; the bottom line figure will be more linked to the tax rate that we will have at the Group level. And as I said, in a normal environment we are more likely to be between 28 to 30%, and maybe this year we should be in the region of 11%.</p>
          <p>Your last question was regarding M&amp;A. On the M&amp;A I think your question was whether we could go again to the market if we have some attractive acquisition. This is not what we have in mind. Actually we said that we want to make bolt-on acquisition. We have strengthened our capital position. You're seeing with the Core Tier 1 that will be 8.6%. So we believe that we are able to size bolt-on opportunities with our current capital position.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Hi, Didier. Chris Malner here. I just had a question just to clarify your weighted &#x2013; so your guidance for the fourth quarter provisioning right on rather. You said previously the third quarter is not an unreasonable indication. Was that only referring to the 334 million in respect to securities reclassified? Was that the number that we should think about as a level for Q4 compared to Q3?</p>

          <p>Okay. Yeah, so the question is basically you provide &#x2013; you basically said it's not unreasonable to assume that the write-downs in Q4 will be in line with Q3. Can I just clarify that that refers to the 334 million that you had on reclassified assets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 751, yeah, the spreads will be the final data that we will have to get the final figure. I remind that, again, as I said in term of trends and <mark type="inaudible" /> for the first two items which are, as I said, on spread and CDS, we should expect &#x2013; except if there is any short in the market and we're another the volatility should be much more limited</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Just two quick questions. I mean, the first one regarding disposals, I mean, at the beginning of the year you've been talking about strategic review of assets. Now following the capital increase you're talking about bolt-on acquisitions. Does that mean that at the end of the day we should not expect any disposals? Or do you still consider you have non-core assets and we could have something come in by the end of the year or half of 2010? And what is the deadline for your disposals? Secondly, regarding the capital gain on Amundi I understand 700 million. Can we expect these to go through P&amp;L or would it be an opportunity, for instance, to write down some of your goodwill and I'm thinking about Russia, of course, or any clean up of the portfolio, for instance, to increase the NPLs coverage, for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, good afternoon. Regarding the strategic review, I think it was more in the newspaper than what we said officially. What we said that we will look at the business model, we have looked at the way we are positioned and to make an assessment of the positioning does not mean that we are obliged to make some disposal. We have taken a lot of initiatives in various activities. For example, Michel in CIB has created a merger between equity and fixed income activities, has also changed the profile of the business to be more account driven, in term of trading activities to be also on more liquid strategy. So this increase is also a way to act in term of reviewing our strategic portfolio, and to change and to fine tune the way we conduct the business.</p>
          <p>In term of teams, clearly also the decision to combine and not to divest, but to combine our Asset Management activities under Amundi was a way for us to make a strategic decision to partner with a large player in Europe and to be able to benefit from economies of scale and also of credit deals and underlying asset management so that it will improve the product service to our customers in our retail networks. So that's the type of thing that we've done to take some example. And definitely we will be pleased to discuss with you where we want to be in June. As I said, during the Investor Day that we will also provide you some &#x2013; more granularity businesses by businesses and also on the transformation of the operating model that we tend to conduct in the coming three to five years.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question, I think we've just closed the results, so I'll not comment on your point, Eric, as I'm not at the point to close the full year accounts.</p>
          <p>A final question</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sorry, it's a follow-up. The first one is with regard to domestic retail cost, I haven't followed the French press very recently, but I'm hearing there is a strike on the 24th of November and I wanted to know, A, whether it's happening and whether we should worry about the cost for 2010. And the second one is, have you actually given a target for the Equity Tier 1 ratio for either this year or for next year or for the medium term? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you read in the press you know that until debate is there, negotiation continue to be there, so we will see. Regarding your second question on Equity Tier 1, no, we have not given any target. We said that the 8% that was resulting from the capital increase was just a result, and was putting us well compared to peers, at 8.6% we are even better compared to peers at 8% and that's it. I think this provide us some  room of maneuver , also regarding, as we said, potential growth of the businesses that we want to accompany, also that potential acquisition that we would be able to seize.</p>
