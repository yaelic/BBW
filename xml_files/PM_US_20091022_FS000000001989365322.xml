          <p>Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management, and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2009 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmintl.com.</p>
          <p>As we take you through our call today, we will be talking about results in the third quarter of 2009 and comparing them with the same period in 2008, unless specified otherwise. References to volumes are for PMI shipments; industry volume and share data is sourced from AC Nielsen, other third-party sources and internal estimates. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenue data exclude excise taxes.</p>
          <p>You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to revenues and Operating Companies Income, or OCI, for currency and acquisitions, adjustments to earnings per share as well as other reconciliations to US GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.</p>
          <p>Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. And I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements' disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.</p>
          <p>It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In spite of the impact of the global economic recession, I am pleased to announce that PMI has achieved very strong third quarter results that confirm our company's ability to grow profitability even in these difficult times.</p>
          <p>We have achieved excellent financial results in the quarter thanks to our strong pricing initiatives, with net revenues excluding currency up 6.9%; excluding currency and acquisitions up 4.1%; adjusted Operating Companies Income or OCI excluding currency up 13.7%; and excluding currency and acquisitions up 10.6%; and adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency up 18.3%.</p>
          <p>While we expect volume in 2009 to fall below last year's level, the 4% organic decline in the quarter was amplified by specific circumstances in a few markets. Therefore, our year-to-date organic volume decline of 2.1% better reflects our anticipated full year volume performance. On a year-to-date basis through the end of September, we have achieved a 4.7% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions, an 8.6% increase in adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions and a 15.4% increase in adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency.</p>
          <p>This chart shows that in 2009 we have delivered consistently against our mid-to-long-term currency neutral financial targets, in spite of recession-driven retail volumes, thus demonstrating our ability to generate strong results even in the most turbulent of economic times. We are today revising our EPS guidance for the full year 2009 to a level of $3.20 to $3.25. Compared to our previous guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 this represents both an increase in our guidance and a narrowing of the range.</p>
          <p>The improved and narrowed guidance reflects the continued strength of our underlying business and a more favorable currency environment. We expect the currency impact to be neutral in the fourth quarter of this year and at current exchange rates it would be a tailwind in 2010. However we will continue to focus on our constant currency growth rates as PMI will continue to manage its business in the long term interest of its shareholders.</p>
          <p>A key driver of our improved profitability in 2009 has been our ability to successfully increase prices across nearly all our major markets by safeguarding our competitive position. I would like to emphasize again that our pricing decisions are established on a market-by-market basis taking into account the competitive environment, consumer affordability and the fiscal and economic situation. We are confident that our price increases are sustainable and we will continue to balance revenue growth with volume growth going forward, as at the end of the day, shareholders are interested in earnings per share rather than cigarettes per share.</p>
          <p>Boosted by recent price increases in Germany and Spain, our pricing variance was $590 million in the third quarter for a total year-to-date variance of $1.5 billion. Even though we increased prices this year, at a somewhat faster rate than previously, consumer behavior has remained resilient during this recession. Consumer down trading which was a major concern of investors in the first half of the year has remained a globally manageable phenomenon. It has had a substantial impact in three of our key markets that have been particularly affected by the economic crisis, namely Russia, Spain and Ukraine. The situation in the latter has been severely exacerbated by very large excise tax increases. Positive trends have however continued in other emerging markets such as Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico.</p>
          <p>In most markets the key economic component that tends to impact consumer behavior is unemployment, and in particular any sharp increases thereof. In this context, the consumer down-trading in Spain was therefore no surprise, as unemployment has climbed to above 18% nationally and to 25% in the south of the country.</p>
          <p>With the exception of Brazil and Ukraine, nearly all governments across the world have treated excise taxes so far in 2009 in a rational manner. And they have benefited from the positive impact on excise tax yields of higher retail prices. We remain optimistic that such a rational approach will generally prevail as governments prepare their budget plans for 2010. Although, we do expect some VAT increases in addition to excise tax increases as governments seek to boost their revenues, we believe that these should be globally manageable.</p>
          <p>Let me now highlight our performance in some of our key markets. As I mentioned earlier, the magnitude of the organic volume decline in the quarter can be attributed to exceptional factors, with nearly two thirds of the decline coming from three markets: Ukraine, Spain, and Pakistan. In Ukraine the massive excise tax increase in May this year, which led to retail price increases that month alone of 22 to 50% on PMI brands resulted in a severe market disruption and our shipments were down by 23% in the quarter, broadly in line with the total market contraction. While our share declined slightly in June due to the greater availability of old price competitive products in the market it has since recovered to reach 35.6% in the third quarter, 0.1 share points above last year's level.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the total cigarette market was down an estimated 10.2% in the quarter due to the recession and higher retail prices exacerbated by weak tourism. Our shipments declined by 23.5% due to unfavorable distributor inventory movements, as well as the overall market decline. Our market share in the quarter was off just 0.2 points to 32.1%, with gains for L&amp;M nearly completely offsetting the decline of Marlboro and Chesterfield.</p>
          <p>The 16.1% shipment volume decline in Pakistan is attributable to trade inventory movements, subsequent to the excise tax increase of June 2009. In Russia, the total market which grew at an estimated rate of some 4% in 2008, is declining at an estimated three to 4% this year, reflecting the economic downturn and the departure of an estimated two million migrant workers.</p>
          <p>In the third quarters, PMI shipments were down just 0.8%. Our market share was, however, up 0.6 points in the third quarter to reach 25.6%. This strong performance is attributable to the growth of Bond Street in the value and Optima in the low price segment, the resilience of Parliament and the overall strength and range of our brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, market growth is trending at three to 4% this year compared to an estimated 10% last year, even though the Indonesian economy has suffered less than others from the global economic downturn. Due to the timing of Ramadan this year, PMI shipments were down 1.1% in the quarter. PMI's key brand, A Mild, continued to grow share and was up 0.5 share points in July/August to 10.7%, while Marlboro share was also higher. Excluding currency, our OCI increased in Indonesia at a double-digit rate in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Marlboro continued to perform strongly in Japan in the third quarter, gaining 0.4 share points to 10.6% behind the success of Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Filter Plus. During the quarter, we rolled out Lark Mint Splash nationally. Along with the previously launched Lark Classic Milds, this new launch has helped us stabilize the market share of the Lark family at 6.6% in the quarter. These innovative new products from Marlboro and Lark have helped consolidate our leadership in the growing menthol segment, which was up 1.1 share points to 23.2% in a total market that was down 3% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>With respect to the intentions of the new government in Japan as to the future of the tobacco sector, there is at this stage much speculation but nothing concrete. We expect clarification of their plans early next year. We continue to advocate regular, moderate excise tax increases combined with manufacturers' pricing freedom.</p>
          <p>The highlight of our strong quarter in Asia was Korea. Our shipments increased by 21.4% and we gained 2.4 share points to a record quarterly level of 14.6% due mainly to the continued strong performance of Marlboro and Parliament.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to our improved results in the European Union Region. Adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 5.3% in the third quarter helped by price increases in Germany and Spain that more than offset negative volume and mix. On a constant currency basis, our adjusted OCI margin grew by 2.2 points to 52.2%. Our market share was down slightly by 0.2 points at 38.9% due to a weaker performance of Marlboro in France, Germany and Spain.</p>
          <p>However, we are continuing to strengthen our second pillar in the E.U. region, L&amp;M already the region's second best selling brand, gaining 0.9 share points to reach a 5.7% regional share behind strong performances, notably in Germany, Poland and Spain. We are optimistic that the rollout in the E.U. region of our innovation pipeline behind Marlboro will start to bear fruit next year.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased by the strong performance of Marlboro in Italy. We succeeded in growing the market share of Marlboro during the third quarter from 22.6% last year to 23.1% this year and that's stabilized our overall market share at 54.5%. This achievement was made possible by the successful launch of Marlboro Gold Touch, a new innovative offering in an unprecedented cigarette format. Designed with a slightly slimmer diameter to provide a smooth taste and comfort in the hands. Marlboro Gold Touch achieved a 1.4% market share in Italy in the third quarter and continues to grow.</p>
          <p>On a global basis, we have continued to benefit from the strength of our overall portfolio. Where down-trading has occurred, we have generally been successful in keeping our consumer base thanks to our range of strong value international and local heritage brands. Our best performing international brands in this recessionary environment have been Bond Street, particularly in Russia and Lark, particularly in Turkey, which are in the lower price categories.</p>
          <p>In the premium segment, the rate of decline in the shipments of Parliament and Marlboro during the third quarter was in line with our overall organic volume trend. Both brands achieved volume growth in the quarter in Asia, primarily driven by their strong performance in Korea, and they have been gaining share in the premium segment in most key markets.</p>
          <p>We have continued to invest strongly behind our key brands, increasing the level of our spending this year in the E.U. region behind Marlboro. The new architecture for Marlboro is being successfully deployed in two steps. We are strengthening the core Red and Gold variants through an upgrade of the Red pack, so far available in Austria, France and Italy; and the modernization of the Gold pack, now available in 26 countries. Consumer perception of the new Gold packaging is very positive.</p>
          <p>The second aspect of the rollout of the Marlboro architecture is the development and launch of innovative line extensions, appropriate for each family and in line with adult consumer preferences. These new products have not been deployed globally, but rather we have focused on one or two of them per market, establishing priorities on a country-per-country basis in line with our enhanced consumer understanding and engagement. In total, we have launched Red line extensions in 34 markets, Gold line extensions in 17 markets and Fresh line extensions in 33 markets.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some examples of our successful innovative Marlboro line extensions, Marlboro Filter and Flavor Plus. They have an innovative four chamber filter that includes a tobacco plug intended to enhance the flavor experience in a low-tar cigarette and is sold in an innovative sliding pack. Marlboro Filter and Flavor Plus is available in six, three and one milligram variants. In July/August this year, Marlboro Filter Plus notably achieved a 2.4% share in Romania, 2.3% in Kuwait, 1.8% in Paraguay and 1.3% in Kazakhstan.</p>
          <p>Under the Marlboro Gold umbrella, we have launched a range of different line extensions. Marlboro Gold Advance is a smoother tasting, full flavor product in a very elegant anthracite pack. This variant is now available in four markets and achieved a promising 0.3% national share in France and Portugal in September following its launch in June and July, respectively.</p>
          <p>Marlboro Gold Touch is available in eight markets in addition to Italy. In Greece, based on in-market sales data, Marlboro Gold Touch already had a 0.5% market share in September. And initial consumer research learning in July showed that over 40% of early adopters were median age minimum 18 to 24 year old smokers.</p>
          <p>Marlboro Gold Edge is a super-slims variant that is sold mainly in Central and Eastern Europe. During the third quarter it achieved a 3.4% share of the fast growing super-slim segment in Poland and a 4.8 segment share in Hungary and is performing well in duty-free outlets. Marlboro Gold Smooth 1 mg has been launched in the Middle East, in August it achieved market shares of 0.7% in Kuwait, 0.5% in the UAE and 0.3% in Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p>In the Marlboro Fresh family, our most successful innovation has been Marlboro Black Menthol, with its refreshing, high menthol content and attractive pack. In the third quarter this year, Marlboro Black Menthol obtained a 1.4% market share in Japan and a 3.3% market share in Hong Kong. Marlboro Black Menthol has also being launched this year in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
          <p>Our latest innovative line extension is Marlboro Superpremium. The cigarette is made using top-grade flue-cured and burley tobaccos. The distinctive pack, with its red metallic interior was designed by Pininfarina, the world famous Italian designer of cars, notably Ferrari models. Marlboro Superpremium was launched in the exclusive setting of the Singapore Formula One, Grand Prix last month.</p>
          <p>Our strength in the premium segment underpins our profitability and positions us very well to further grow profitably as the world economy gradually moves out of a recession during which our cash flow has remained formidable.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our free cash flow totaled $1.7 billion, and year-to-date it has reached $5.9 billion. Excluding the impact of currency on net earnings, free cash flow was 17% higher in the quarter and 12.4% higher in 2009 through the end of September.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to enhance shareholder returns remains as strong as ever. Reflecting the strength of our underlying business, we increased our quarterly dividend in September by 7.4% to a level of $0.58 per share. At our current stock price of $50.82 per share, this represents an attractive yield of 4.6%.</p>
          <p>We have continued to steadily implement our share repurchase program, spending a further $1.5 billion in the third quarter to buy back an additional 31.5 million shares. We now have $3.4 billion remaining in our $13 billion program, which runs through the end of April next year. In 2009, we have so far returned a total of $7.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since we were spun off in March 2008, the number rises to $15 billion, representing more than 15% of our current market cap.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength is a key component of our success in the current difficult economic environment. It is reinforced by our excellent business momentum. The third quarter has illustrated again our ability to deliver against all our currency neutral financial targets. While volumes remain weaker than last year, we have more than offset this by higher prices, strong performances in most key markets, the continued benefits of our productivity and cost saving programs and we have intensified our efforts to optimize working capital levels. Today we have raised our 2009 EPS guidance for 2009 to $3.20 to $3.25, representing an increase of 12 to 14% compared to 2008 on a currency neutral basis.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your interest in our company. I will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Judy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hermann, just as we think about 2010 and think about volume outlook, I was hoping to just get your perspective on volume outlook. You said year-to-date it's down about 2.1% organic. As you start to lap some of the challenges that you faced this year and then the macro starts to get better globally, do you start to see &#x2013; would you expect to see volumes start to turn positive as 2010 progresses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well let me start really with putting it into the perspective, I mean a 2% &#x2013; minus 2% organic volume I believe is an excellent performance for a consumer goods company in a recession. Looking forward, the key of your question here is, look I would say I expect some improvement in 2010 over 2009, but I would say at this point in time impossible to quantify. I mean there are a number of factors that influence that situation. Of course the first and most important one is the general question about economic recovery and also recovery in terms of employment, i.e. a rebound of the stock market doesn't mean yet new jobs for the people; there will be a certain lag to that. So that is of course one thing. I mean in key markets like Russia I personally think that could come or start &#x2013; begin to improve in the second quarter of &#x2013; second half, I'm sorry, second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Then of course it gets to the next question on really total market size developments of major markets. Look, Russia last year, and it is a huge market; it was last year about 400 billion. A year ago, it was growing 4%. This year it's declining three to four. Is it going to stabilize or even already return to growth? That's a key question with major impact on the total volume number.</p>
          <p>Indonesia is a 250 billion cigarettes market. That market has been growing last year about 10, now it's growing three to 4%. The growth of next year is going to be important and yes, of course the various &#x2013; another important market being Japan, also in the range of 250 billion cigarettes. There lots will also depend on the new governmental policy on excise tax. And I guess we all would love to accept a certain market decline in Japan in exchange for pricing freedom. So all in all, it will depend on those key points.  We will continue to strike the right balance between price, earnings and volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just following up on the Indonesia, you said the industry is growing three to 4%. I think you said your volume was down, but there was the timing of the Ramadan holiday, so can you quantify how much the timing impacted your volume in the third quarter? And then just broadly speaking, can you talk about some of the factors that may be impacting slower growth for the industry in that market this year versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The Ramadan impact I would estimate, and this is just a shift quarter-to-quarter, anything around a billion cigarettes probably is a good estimate there. In terms of overall growth of the market, that will of course depend here again on economic recovery. Indonesia as a country, in any case, is doing much better than many others. The main thing for Indonesia that I also would like to highlight is that the growth of that market today is actually in the very low price category of that market and that one &#x2013; that growth is driven by a tax loophole in that market.</p>
          <p>As you will recall there is a three-tier excise tax system in the market. The lowest tier, called "Tier 3", goes for volumes of a brand of up to 0.5 billion and is specifically for hand-rolled cigarettes. That's of course perfectly justified for employment reasons. But then there is a second tier that is valid between 0.5 billion and two billion that actually also includes machine-made cigarettes and there is the abuse of the legal loophole, in particular by one big competitor in there. So you just have new legal entities that then fall under this category and all the rest then is just taxed normally. So that's something we are working on that should be addressed going forward. That's the one and only reason, actually, why we show some market share loss in that market. It's only due to that segment; otherwise we are doing really well in Indonesia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Hermann.</p>

          <p>You're welcome.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Jon Fell of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I just wanted to follow on the volume question first of all a little bit. I mean, Hermann, you said yourself that investors in the market are interested in earnings per share rather than cigarettes per share. Do you think that maybe your one to 2% long-term growth target for volumes is maybe a little bit aggressive in this environment? And I think price mix in the last quarter was 8%. At what point would you start to get worried that you're maybe asking the consumer for a little bit too much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, on the overall volume targets, 1% is our organic volume growth target, 2% would include acquisitions. With the 1% organic volume target we have met it this year &#x2013; last year. We will not meet it this year and we probably &#x2013; it will be unrealistic to assume that we already go back to 1% organic growth next year. But these are mid to long-term targets. And as I said at the beginning, we have achieved it last year. I think we again can achieve it going forward; I see no reason to change it. But I mentioned previously, it also will depend really on the overall market growth trends of some &#x2013; of the really major, major markets, which are Russia, Indonesia and Japan.</p>
          <p>On the second part of your question, look I am convinced that we are striking the right balance and as you know we really manage always for the long-term and not for the short-term. Look at this year's year-to-date pricing variance; it is actually 2.5 times the negative volume mix that we're having on a year-to-date basis. I think that one is the strongest argument. The second argument I think is that we kept our competitive position. We are very strong and have remained very strong.</p>
          <p>The third one is that sometimes price increases also can avoid excise increases for the <mark type="inaudible" /> part governments make more money. And the last point is that excise tax structures around the world have improved a lot. Minimum excise taxes, higher specific elements, you name it; there is some progress there, everywhere around the world. And if you go to the top 25 markets around the world, such protection is in place in one form or the other in every one of them.</p>
          <p>Actually in that context I probably should mention that this morning European Time, the Advocate General has come out with her opinion on the pending case on minimum reference prices in the European Union. Her opinion is a negative opinion and of course this opinion carries some weight. However, I'd like to stress that the member states involved in these cases have also voiced their opinion, supported by what I would consider to be very strong arguments. So finally it will be the European Court of Justice who decides about that in about three to six months is probably a realistic timing.</p>
          <p>I'd like to add that for me it's kind of hard to understand why the principle of free circulation of goods, which is anyway I would say an illusion when it comes to cigarettes in the European Union labeling requirements, excise tax terms. You know all that; why such a principle would override the public health concerns that have been brought forward by those member states. That being said we just said that there are other means, which are being used by governments around the world and it's actually interesting that the E.U. Commission themselves acknowledges that these tools might need to be further reinforced. Just one example there could be that the minimum tax, which today in the E.U. is kept at 100% of the tax on the most popular price category eventually could go above and beyond those 100%. So I wanted to use that question also to provide recent information to everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hermann. Could I just follow on from that and ask you to remind us which markets currently have minimum reference prices in place at the moment? And are there any of those markets where you're worried that alternative tools such as existing minimum excise tax requirements couldn't be used to achieve pretty much the same thing?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The countries concerned by the case are Ireland, France and Austria. A fourth country that has a minimum reference price is Italy. I believe that all those countries, if the final decision and that we don't know yet, let's wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice, would be negative, I think they would address it in the sense we were discussing earlier, where you have to see that that is simply then a burden on the low price end of the price segment and not on the premium price segment actually.</p>

          <p>Hi Hermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi David.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify what you were saying to John, if you didn't &#x2013; if you couldn't have minimum reference pricing in Europe, governments could elect under their existing authority, you essentially achieve the same impact on cigarette pricing architecture through the utilization of minimum tax levels, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a question that depends on country to country. You can go under today's law; you can go up to 100% of minimum tax of the most popular price category in that market. That category of course varies from market to market. That can be actually the premium price in the specific markets; it depends. New rules eventually could foresee that that goes beyond that 100%. And the other element there is of course available today is a higher specific component in the overall excise tax mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, Hermann, do you &#x2013; and I realize this is a forward-looking question, but at current exchange rates, do you think something like $4 in earnings as a stretch next year is feasible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't put our budget and plans yet together for the next year. I think I have to beg your patience for the 2010 guidance until we publish the full year earnings, which would be February 11 of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Hermann, what's the early read, and I know that you have a competitor that had a fair level of inventory of 17 packs, but what's the early read on consumption trends in Germany subsequent to the fairly substantial increase in per cig pricing in the middle of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is &#x2013; there are two things here. I mean 17s packs, which are on the new price and 17s packs that will still be available on the old price. On the new price, this is just a face value advantage and not a real advantage. There is some advantage, but I wouldn't say it's huge in the German environment where via the vending-pack contents smokers are still used somewhat to differing pack contents. So I think you have in the German market for now and on Marlboro you have some impact of the price increase, but that is a temporary phenomenon. We will have to see what the fourth quarter is going to show to us. But it is important that we have that minimum pack count change actually in the German market to 19s, and I'm glad that this has been achieved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Hermann, lastly what's the status of your request to increase pricing in France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The status in France right now is &#x2013; you are right; we have sent a price list to the French government for homologation. That homologation is still pending. There might be implicitly some link of course to the announced publication of President Sarkozy's anti-cancer plan. I would expect in the public information that that plan might be announced anytime from here to the mid of November. I don't want to speculate on the contents of that plan. We will have to wait for the announcement. However, I would say that over the last couple of years, the French government has been pretty rational and pragmatic and efficient when it comes to cigarette taxation, so I don't expect any catastrophes at that end.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on pricing if I could; we saw 8 points of positive pricing in the third quarter similar to the second quarter. Given the timing of price hikes earlier in the year and what you might see in the fourth quarter and perhaps what we're lapping, is this an achievable growth in the fourth quarter as well for pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Forward-looking pricing, you know that I won't do that. But, look, we had strong pricing this year at a somewhat faster pace than we had last year. Our expectations, I would say are of course lumped in in part of our assumption for the full year guidance, which, as you have seen was narrowed and raised. So, it's all worked into that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On that point Hermann, the guidance then which was narrowed and raised, could you quantify at all how much you would say is coming from the improved FX outlook versus pricing in the stronger than expected third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that I can. We had in the previous guidance we had in there a $0.55 negative currency assumption, remember down from the very beginning of the year $0.80. Now our year-to-date September negative currency is actually $0.52, and I don't expect further negative currency in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then moving to Marlboro or E.U. in general, we saw now the third quarter consecutive quarter of share losses despite some improvement in the underlying markets. I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit on Marlboro's performance or your expectations or perhaps the year-over-year challenges and when do you think that trade down might stabilize for you in the E.U.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look in general and I will talk about the E.U. markets in particular, but in general, the first thing is of course that would the Marlboro volume be stronger if there were no recession out there in the world? Of course. Being in the premium segment has a certain consequence. But that's the way it is. Going forward, this is going to change and when this is going to change, we will have <mark type="inaudible" /> at Marlboro for up trading to come back and remind you we were discussing pricing earlier that up trading will come at higher margins than ever. I mean the innovation is out there; it's working. It will provide future benefits.</p>
          <p>You had the examples in the prepared remarks and there are plenty of examples around the world where Marlboro is very strong and is growing and that is in places like Korea, Argentina, Brazil, Philippines, Japan, but also in markets in Europe like Portugal or Italy. And Italy, I would say is maybe a little bit comparable to what you see for the moment also in Germany. After the last price increase in Italy, Marlboro for a couple of months or for two quarters was weaker because it had to absorb the price increase and now it's back on track and growing. So, really I think the share decline in Marlboro is attributable to the price increase. We haven't had one for a while in Germany. I'm convinced it nevertheless was the right decision.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the share decline is the simple consequence of a serious recession. The country really is in deep trouble overall. But, our share, yes, we see down trading, but there you know that it's from a small base. And in France, quite frankly, it is right now the difficult price point situation. We have major point &#x2013; brands still at 480; Marlboro is at 530. That's a temporary disadvantage that Marlboro is suffering from in France, but that won't be forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In all, I think we're doing the right thing. We keep on going. We keep on strengthening the brand. We even have increased the investment behind Marlboro in the European Union in this year. It will pay off going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that Hermann. And my final question on Canada, we saw organic growth this quarter which reversed declines in the first half if I'm not mistaken. I know there was some regulatory factors helping. Is that really what's going on there? Were there easier comps, or can you talk about where the growth is coming from perhaps high end, low end and whether the government support is really what's driving that turn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes we are growing share first of all in that market, 0.3 in share to 33.9 in Q3. So, we are doing competitively really well. But very important is actually that the total tax-paid market in the third quarter is up about 6% in Canada. What's happening there is that you do see increased enforcement or literally more police cars controlling people coming out of the Indian reservations, or along the Indian reservations, i.e. checking if there are illegal products being bought. That helps; that's a good development. It's very positive.</p>
          <p>However, I have to add that in order to have a sustainable improvement in Canada, the enforcement then really would have to go to the roots of the problem. And the roots of the problem are well known. They are factories in the Indian reservations there. So the place is known, the ones who run them are known. This is where I would hope that the next stage of enforcement would go. So, it's positive news for the quarter. I hope they keep it up, but I hope even more that finally the underlying problem will be tackled.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you very much. Can I ask you just a factual question, what the market share was for Marlboro in the E.U. in the quarter and what it was in the second quarter as well, because I don't think that's in the press release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know many things by heart. This one I don't know by heart, but I can give you a couple of markets. I wouldn't know the way to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Well, let's hear it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>France is down about 0.9% I believe. Germany was down 1.2%; Spain is also down in a similar range. These are the markets that are really down. Italy, we already told you is up; Portugal is up. Poland in the quarter is actually up 1.7 share points to 9.5 percentage points. Hungary is also up. So, therefore really, and I believe that's of course the core of your question, there is no generalized Marlboro problem in the EU. There are specific reasons in France, Germany, and Spain that I explained just in the question before. But as you can see that there are also a number of markets with positive news.</p>
          <p>There are also a number of markets where the young adults smokers' share, i.e. between 18 and 24 year olds, is growing; it's actually for example steeply growing in Portugal. It comes back to the point here that I really believe we are doing the right thing for Marlboro and at the same time, I'm happy that we &#x2013; I'm also able to say that we are making big progress in establishing a very solid second leg in the European Union. L&amp;M is already #2 brand in the E.U. today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I move on, thank you very much for that answer. One question about buybacks and one about Mexico. Very quickly the buyback figure 1.5 billion if I remember rightly, is a step up from your previous 1.4 billion. Should we assume that 1.5 is the quarterly rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no change to what we said earlier. You should expect for the full year of 2009, a dollar amount that is very similar to the amount that we have spent last year, and last year's amount was in total $5.4 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I quickly then turn to Mexico. Final question, your major competitor there has said that it believes it has changed the competitive dynamics very substantially through, I suppose innovation and from their point of view, better distribution and I was wondering on how you would see the trends in that market in your outlook, particularly given you've been so successful there in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would rely them rather on our distribution than of one of our competitor there and I guess the best argument is that our share is up 0.9% to 69.4% in the Mexican market. A couple of words, I mean what's really happening in the Mexican market is that really you have essentially a polarizing markets where we have a very strong premium segment. This is where we are with Marlboro and Benson &amp; Hedges.</p>
          <p>I mean Marlboro is 48% market share and Marlboro and Benson &amp; Hedges together have a premium segment share of about 83% and then the music for the rest of it is actually in the low price segment, where we are being extremely successful with Delicados growing very nicely there as well. Our segment share in this growing segment it's actually growing to 25% of the market now. Our segment share in there is now also 60%. Really the segment that is in the squeeze is the mid-priced segment. I believe that's the real dynamic in that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it would be wrong to say that it's become harder for you to compete in that market that would just be a wrong conclusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always enjoy healthy competition, but as I said look at our market shares. I think we are doing well. We will continue to take the competitive suggestion very serious and we will continue to compete as good as we can.</p>

          <p>Hi, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you? I just had a couple questions for you. First of all, I didn't get this from earlier in the call, but I noticed that in most of your &#x2013; or a lot of your major markets you cited inventory distortions &#x2013; distributor movements, that kind of thing. And it looks to be overall to have been a burden to your volume and I'm sure that's a reality of the economic environment we're in. But can you quantify or give us a sense of how much of that hurt your volume in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say that it's in most of our important markets. I have given a couple of specific examples. That was Spain; that was then the shift in Indonesia. I would rather say in general, and this is not huge numbers, but if you are in an environment where also eventually here and there your customers, i.e. your wholesalers or even your retailers, are in a working capital squeeze, then I think as a manufacturer, as Philip Morris, we are better served to help the trade by lowering the inventory levels at the trade compared to a situation where I would keep up those levels and increase payment terms. To do the second thing would be wrong. In that scenario we have chosen rather the first one, i.e. help the wholesaler with their own working capital squeeze there. So, yes, there were some effects there, but it's not a worldwide serious phenomenon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I understand. And then I think you mentioned before that your premium price products, your volume, was about in line with your organic volume growth. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your &#x2013; if you looked at like mix in the quarter, I guess I am trying to understand is how the different price segments from premium, mid and low performed. It sounds like there wouldn't be a major mix change in this quarter if premium was down about in line with the category &#x2013; I am sorry in line with your business. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well it kind of equalized out over PMI, yes I mean, but of course we had a couple of markets that you are aware like Russia where we did see down-trading from the premium and mid actually to the low price segment. So that actually that down-trading trend did not deteriorate. However, I also have to say it didn't improve yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, sure. And then my last question for you is in terms of the &#x2013; if you look ahead at 2010, you had mentioned in your slides about potential VAT increases and excise tax increases. Are there any slated for right now that you're aware of for next year that we should be watching out for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah look, in terms of VAT increase there is now a proposal in Spain that would bring VAT up by 2% by the middle of 2010. So of course that will then require in the cigarette category an adjustment of the minimum excise tax. You remember that around the last price increase in Spain, the Spanish government has understood that mechanism very well. So I'm confident that they will do the necessary again. Another example out there is, and this you have eventually seen that all published plans out there are not yet fully finalized. In Russia, the excise increases there would be somewhat higher than the ones that we have seen this year. But in general I would say the rollover of those increases in 2010 would be in the range of two rubles. If you put that into relation to the overall price level, Marlboro is retailing today at 42 rubles, L&amp;M is retailing at 27 rubles. So it's a manageable situation again.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have wait in Japan. We of course make our arguments and we talked to the opinion leaders. We advocated as I said for moderate and regular excise increases accompanied by pricing freedom. I hope that we will be heard, but as I said there is really no official government tobacco policy out there. We have to wait there. You know that the budget cycle of the Japanese government does not follow the calendar year that but goes from April to March. So beginning of next year I think there should be more clarity on Japan.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hermann, I just want to clarify one thing, the guidance increase that you gave today, only $0.03 of that is driven by better than expected currency, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I was a little bit surprised though that that this quarter was the worst quarter in terms of currency impact. Can you give us an idea of what the major currency movements were behind that big impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way; you have seen the breakdown that we had forecast for the year. Now we are essentially done I would hope with negative currency for the year.  Over these three quarters, the currencies that have hit us most are of course the Euro, but beyond the Euro the emerging current markets currencies. First of all the ruble, the Ukrainian grivna was a severe impact in there; these are the most prominent ones and then there also would come the Turkish lira.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then at the beginning of the year you explained to us that down-trading in Russia was driven by the collapse of the oil price. Do the recent gains in the oil price change the outlook for Russia? Is the worst over in Russia and should we get back to uptrading there if oil continues to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will certainly help Russia, now we are talking about the Russian economy overall and not just the cigarettes. I mean this will certainly help. However, from there until you see really more employment, remember, there is not only unemployment in Russia there is also underemployment in Russia where people only work part time and get paid therefore only part of the salary. And on the countryside you would find situations where people get their salaries paid late or maybe for a month not at all. As soon as that comes back to a more normal pattern and the consumer confidence is going to come back, that is going to be the moment where you will start seeing upgrading in Russia. But let's be realistic; I don't think we will see that beginning before the second half of 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you so much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our final question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a couple of things, one Hermann, if you'd give an update on the outlook for tobacco leaf pricing for the balance of this year and 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Leaf pricing year-to-date we have a negative leaf price in our P&amp;L of $150 million compared to last year. So, you will have pro rata about the same effect still for the remainder of the year. That of course again is baked into our guidance for the full year. Going forward the crucial question remains that we achieve a balanced supply of tobacco, balanced with the demand for tobacco. And quite frankly I think this is perfectly achievable.</p>
          <p>Let me speak for us. We at PMI, we know exactly how much tobacco we need for the coming year; our volumes don't vary that much. So, therefore I think as we know that, the farmers are the ones who need to have that visibility and the farmers need to know that they can make a decent normal margin on the leaf they grow and not actually like it has been in the past, abound one year and a loss in the next year. So that's directionally how we are tackling the problem. So we are in the process of getting it under control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as we look at 2010 should we expect a similar pace of new product introductions like we saw this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have quite a nice pipeline developed out there. We often talk about Marlboro. We are also working with the other brands. Not every innovation is already rolled into every market and that as I said would be even wrong. It has to be adapted to that market. That's what we will continue to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last, any update on the potential of lifting the ban on Snus in the E.U.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the ban on Snus in the E.U., there really nothing has changed. The lifting of that ban is still a 50/50 chance; we will have to wait and see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So before we conclude let me maybe add one point here. You have seen our results of the third quarter and the point I would really like to highlight is that really since being a public company, since the spin, we have consistently delivered on our constant currency financial metrics and we have done that even in the most difficult of economic times. I believe that is a great achievement and we will work hard to continue to do so.</p>
