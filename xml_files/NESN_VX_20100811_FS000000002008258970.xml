        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the First Half Year Results Presentation. As you will appreciate, this is a new format. We're combining the conference call with the roadshow presentation in one event. Hopefully by pulling together the best of both, we can make better use of everyone's time in the spirit of Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence.</p>
          <p>I'll take the Safe Harbor Statement as read, and go straight to the highlights. Nestl&#xE9; has again delivered growth at the top and bottom lines. We have done this consistently over 10 years and more and this is the essence of our commitment to our investors, to all stakeholders, that we will focus on total performance without compromise.</p>
          <p>Our top line performance is broad-based on a geographic basis in each category, by all management responsibilities. We are seeking to drive the top and bottom line together consistently over time, whilst also investing for the future. We increased spending to support the healthy competitive positions of our brands, launch new products, and expand our manufacturing and distribution footprints. With strategic alignment and employee commitment, we are driving Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence and delivering significant savings. Simply, we believe all these actions together produce a multiplier effect in terms of value creation that is a sustainable catalyst for Nestl&#xE9; across geographies, across categories.</p>
          <p>Looking at the figures, a solid first half performance by the group. Sales at CHF 55.3 billion, growing organically at 6.1%, with real internal growth of 4.6%. The group EBIT reached CHF 8.4 billion, an increase of 13.6%. Margins were up to 15.1% plus 100 basis points reported, 80 basis points like-for-like and 70 basis points like-for-like in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>Net profit was up 7.5% to CHF 5.5 billion, representing a margin of 9.8%, 10 basis points up. There were excellent progress in earnings per share at CHF 1.60, up 13.5% over the same period in 2009.</p>
          <p>For Food &amp; Beverages, there were equally strong performances at both top and bottom lines. Sales were CHF 51 billion with organic growth of 5.7% and real internal growth of 4.2%. EBIT reached CHF 6.7 billion, up 10.6%. The EBIT margin is now 13%, up 60 basis points reported and in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>These figures highlight once again our focus on delivering profitable growth, combining a good balance of top-line and bottom-line improvement. This is an example of what we mean when we said Nestl&#xE9; is an "and" company, not an "or" company. It is also, of course, in line with the definitions of the Nestl&#xE9; model.</p>
          <p>The economic environment remains uncertain and there will be input cost headwinds and tougher second half comparatives, as we had anticipated. Our first half performance, therefore, allows us to expect an organic growth of around 5% for the full year, reaffirming our earlier guidance for Food and Beverages. We also expect an improvement in EBIT margins in constant currencies compared to last year.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Roddy, who will run through the zone and product group performance. In response to your feedback to our earlier survey this year, he will go into a bit more details, so this will be a little longer than before. Then I will go through the income statement and the cash flows and then talk about a couple topical subjects before opening for Q&amp;A. Roddy?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. If the results season has demonstrated anything, it's that the best catalyst for share price performance is simply consistent growth and an improvement in the bottom-line performance year-after-year.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at how Nestl&#xE9; has achieved this once again in the first half of 2010. On my first slide is the regional performance of our total Food and Beverage business. I'll just give a few key messages before going into the detail by management responsibility.</p>
          <p>All areas of the world are contributing positive RIG and organic growth. This is a truly broad-based performance. In the Americas, there has been an acceleration during the second quarter driven primarily by Latin America. Our developed margins in the region are achieving positive RIG.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Western Europe is delivering positive RIG. Growth is there to be had, in developed markets if you pursue the right opportunities. In AOA, we have continued to see strong growth in the emerging markets, particularly Africa and Asia. In total, our emerging markets grew over 11% and our BRIC markets were faster.</p>
          <p>This next slide is a just a snapshot of the RIG and organic growth by reporting responsibility, and it shows that all areas are contributing positively to both the first half RIG and the organic growth. I'll now going through these in more detail, starting with the Americas.</p>
          <p>The zone achieved 6.1% organic growth for the half, up from 5.1% at the first quarter. Both North America and Latin America contributed to the improved RIG of 3.1%. This trend is important because it demonstrates that we have good momentum in the business as we faced tougher comparatives in the second half.</p>
          <p>Pricing was up in Latin America, but slightly less positive in the North than in the first quarter. In Latin America, there were strong performances from Brazil and Mexico as well as from the smaller regions. The Caribbean region was the only weak area. The economy there is suffering from smaller dollar remittances and lower tourism and the region includes Haiti and Jamaica.</p>
          <p>Looking at the categories in Latin America, I would highlight the performances of Soluble Coffee and Powdered Beverages, PetCare and Biscuits as well as Dairy and Chocolate, the two biggest categories. By the way, the photo is of the Nestl&#xE9; ship that is selling our products on the Amazon. It's a good example of how we are increasing our distribution in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In North America, PetCare has had a strong start to the year with market share gains. I'll come back to this in my product review. The Frozen Meals business continued to be weak, but is trending better. I'll also discuss this in my product review.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with the first few months' performance from the recently acquired Frozen Pizza business. It is on track on all measures, but the major aspects of the integration are still to come.</p>
          <p>The Chocolate and Sugar businesses both achieved double-digit organic growth. Catalysts include the extension of the Wonka brand into Chocolate, a new variance of Butterfinger and Raisinets.</p>
          <p>Ice Cream enjoyed positive growth in North America, once again driven by the premium offerings of H&#xE4;agen-Dazs as well as the nutrition-focused Skinny Cow brand and by the impulse Drumstick brand. The Dreyer's premium business was weaker as you will see on the Billionaire Brands chart, but maintained its share. The Canadian Ice Cream business is performing very well.</p>
          <p>Soluble Coffee is strong with the Nescaf&#xE9; Cl&#xE1;sico the star. We are excited by the Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto launch in the U.S. starting next month and we look forward to updating you on that in February.</p>
          <p>The zone's EBIT was down 10 basis points at 15.1%. The key issue here is the Frozen Food business in North America. Its margin has been impacted by the reduced sales as well as increased marketing and promotional support in the category. On the positive side, we've seen a further improvement in our cost competitiveness due to Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence. Also we've increased our investment in brands across our categories.</p>
          <p>Zone Europe, the Zone achieved 2.2% organic growth for the half, down from 3.4% at the first quarter. This was a solid first half performance in that it was achieved without the usual stimulus of double-digit growth in Eastern Europe where we continue to be held back by the poor dynamics in the Russian Chocolate market. The situation in Russian Chocolate is improving slowly, whilst the other categories in the region continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>The RIG was positive for the Zone both for the half and for the second quarter, as indeed it was for Western Europe. In general in Western Europe, I would highlight the work our people have been doing with our customers, which is reflected in increased distribution, a key growth driver and in customer service levels that are at all time highs.</p>
          <p>Also, there was a good contribution from innovation. Overall, our market share performance in the big European markets is good, particularly France, Germany, Spain and Russia. Less positive for the Zone were the impacts of a slow start to the Ice Cream season and the voluntary recall of certain premium Nescaf&#xE9; products.</p>
          <p>Nescaf&#xE9; continued to achieve positive growth despite this, in part due to continued good performance of Dolce Gusto and Greenblend.</p>
          <p>The big Western European markets all achieved positive RIG with the stronger performances in France, particularly Culinary Chilled, the Herta brand and Nescaf&#xE9;, in the U.K., particularly Chocolate and in the regional PetCare business. The Iberia region, which is Spain and Portugal, was also positive</p>
          <p>In Spain, I'd highlight as key stimuli for growth in a tough environment, the Soluble Coffee business and PetCare, a strong performance by properly positioned products, allowing customers to trade down without trading out of our brands, and increased distribution at Mercadona, the largest retailer there.</p>
          <p>The Zone's EBIT margin has increased by 10 basis points to 11.9%. The improvement was achieved whilst increasing our brand support and despite the costs of the Nescaf&#xE9; recall. It reflects strong results from Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence, our efficiency program.</p>
          <p>Zone AOA, the Zone achieved 9% organic growth for the half, down from 10.3% for the first quarter. The developed markets in the Zone had a slower Q2 than Q1. This is due mainly to Australia. Some of our big Nescaf&#xE9; products there that include milk have been disrupted by the Foot and Mouth outbreak that occurred first in the original supply market and then in our replacement supply market. We now have alternative supply arrangements in place.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we are achieving positive RIG with a particularly good performance in Nescaf&#xE9;. For example, our Barista machine sold 100,000 units in 2009 and we are expecting to ship 600,000 in 2010.</p>
          <p>This is further evidence of our strength in beverage systems and our ability to be flexible with our delivery mechanisms, so we can adapt to the needs of different markets. We have continued to see strong growth across the emerging markets. Those in Asia and Africa achieved higher RIG than in Q1. In the case of Asia, this was despite a slowdown in China. In China, this time last year following the melamine milk crisis, consumer demand for milk had fallen dramatically but supply had not. We were, therefore, buying significant quantities of milk from farmers and selling it to industrial buyers who use milk in their finished products.</p>
          <p>Since then, the fall in the milk price has resulted in a reduced supply of milk from farmers, which we are now able to sell under our brands to consumers. The lower supplies impacted RIG but the good news is that the shares of our core branded milk business have continued to grow and of course, selling Nestl&#xE9; branded milk is higher margin than selling bulk milk.</p>
          <p>The issue will run through the current quarter as well. To give you some idea of the scale of the impact, Dairy had low single-digit growth in China, but excluding the impact of the industrialized milk, it was in the teens. The rest of China is achieving double-digit growth. In total, the emerging markets in the zone are double-digit for both RIG and organic growth and the popularly positioned products, our PPPs, were accretive to that emerging market growth.</p>
          <p>Among emerging markets, I would highlight particularly the performance of the South Asia region, which includes India, Indonesia, the Indo-China region, which includes Thailand and Vietnam, and Central and West Africa. By category, there were strong performances in Ambient Culinary helped by our innovation in Powdered Maggi, ready-to-drink beverages including Milo and Nescaf&#xE9;. Nescaf&#xE9; ready-to-drink is benefiting from increased investment to deeper distribution since we took it out of the BPW joint venture.</p>
          <p>Ambient Dairy, which is growing double-digit in the zone despite China, we are seeing a meaningful benefit from our recent packaging redesign, which has brought closer visual alignment across the categories there, and Chocolate, where our people are executing well behind a very developed PPP strategy.</p>
          <p>This zone's EBIT margin increased by 20 basis points to 16.9%, reflecting our ability to leverage our growth, as well as the faster growth of more profitable categories and was achieved despite increased investment in brands and distribution.</p>
          <p>Next, Nestl&#xE9; Waters, the bottled water market has experienced a return to growth in many developed markets this year including France, the UK and the US and has continued to grow dynamically in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Waters has seen an acceleration in the second quarter to 3% RIG for the half with 2.5% organic growth. This pick-up in growth was reflected in good share performances in our European and emerging markets. In North America, we are down in volume share but up in value. In Europe, we are seeing continued positive growth and we know that our sponsorship of the Tour de France in July has extended that trend into Q3 as we build on the share gains already achieved in France.</p>
          <p>There's double-digit growth in the UK and good performances, too, from Germany, Spain and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>In North America, our accelerated growth resulted from our response to the private label pricing initiatives in Q1. These initiatives saw a continued good performance from the value priced Pure Life but also an improved performance from regional brands, especially Poland Spring.</p>
          <p>Organic growth in the emerging markets is near 20%. This performance is consistent across Asia and Middle East and Latin America. This category is a good example of how we can benefit from our exposure to the different market segments. The PPP offering, Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life, is growing double-digit. The mainstream brands such as Poland Spring are also growing. The super-premium San Pellegrino and Perrier are also enjoying strong growth.</p>
          <p>I think this is an important point generally and not just for Water. Consumer goods companies are not going to win in a developed or emerging markets by making choices between premium or value priced offerings in any given category. They will win by having offerings across the price points, allowing greater consumer choice, supported by appropriate business models and cost structures.</p>
          <p>A business model in PPP is quite different from mainstream, as indeed is a mainstream business model from one for super-premium business. The Water's EBIT margin improved by 10 basis points despite increased oil related costs and the reduced pricing in North America.</p>
          <p>Key to the improvement were the good &#x2013; were the growth, the good discipline in areas such as fixed and overhead costs, the positive impact of Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence and improved distribution management. The cost situation will be tougher in the second half of the year than it was in the first.</p>
          <p>Moving to Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition, the business is demonstrating that it is back on an improved growth track after the weakness in 2009. In Infant Nutrition, all three divisions being Infant Formula, Baby Food and Infant Cereals are performing well, leading to high single-digit growth for the division.</p>
          <p>RIG is positive in all three zones and double-digit in AOA. Standout performances include the U.S. and Canada amongst developed markets, whilst amongst many strong performances in emerging markets, I would highlight Russia, China, South Asia, Indo-China, the Middle East and the Bolivarian region. The improved growth was a contributing factor to the increased Infant Nutrition EBIT margin, which is above the Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition level.</p>
          <p>Healthcare Nutrition is also growing faster than in 2009 and achieving a higher EBIT margin. This reflects the benefits for the SKU and customer rationalization program that we have carried out since the acquisition of the Novartis business. Performance Nutrition is showing an improved EBIT margin performance, following a closer alignment of the business to its core customer base and retail channels.</p>
          <p>Weight Management continues to be held back by a reluctance of female consumers to spend on themselves rather than on their families in the current economic environment. This is the same dynamic as we're seeing in the Frozen Food area with LeanCuisine. That said, the in-home business is performing well, and is compensating somewhat for the weaker performance of the Jenny Craig Centres.</p>
          <p>The recent launches in France and the U.K. are showing positive early signs, but it is still too early to read much into this. Finally, on Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition, there has been a good margin progression from the business, up 160 basis points to 19%. This reflects the benefit of the higher growth, good cost management and delivery of acquisition synergies. Again, there will be additional cost pressures in the second half.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the operating segments is the important catchall, Other Food and Beverages category. There is good news here from both the main constituents, Nestl&#xE9; Professional and Nespresso.</p>
          <p>Nespresso has once again delivered above 25% growth. I hope that the doomsayers about the impact of increased competition in France will be reassured by this performance, especially as there has been no slowdown in Q2. The situation in France is much as we expected. Some existing customers are trading the competitor &#x2013; are trying the competitor products, but repeat purchase levels are not impacting Nespresso's growth.</p>
          <p>The boutique openings around the world continue, with about 30 planned for 2010 including one in Shanghai opening today. And the investment announced in Avenches, will double our capacity by 2012 to 9 billion capsules a year. Nespresso's margin increased in the period.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Professional, our business serving the out-of-home consumption market, achieved mid single-digit organic growth. It is performing well in AOA and Latin America, achieving double-digit growth, helped by a rebound in the economies there, as well as by expansion by restaurant chains in those regions.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the Frozen and Chilled business is performing well. Davigel is benefiting from the widening of its focus from institutional customers, such as schools and hospitals, to include commercial customers, such as restaurants. The North American business is flat in a depressed market.</p>
          <p>Looking from a divisional aspect, the Beverages business grew over 6%, driven by our proprietary Nescaf&#xE9; Solution business. It grew strongly in all regions, though the European growth was compensated by our decision to reduce our participation as an ingredient supplier to vending operations.</p>
          <p>The integration of Vitality in the U.S., acquired in 2009, is on track and the performance is to expectation. The key drivers in the Food business, which grew about 5% were Culinary and Milk. Zone AOA, particularly in China and Latin America performed well. Europe was also a positive, but North America remained weak as well here.</p>
          <p>The Nestl&#xE9; Professional EBIT margin improved, driven by lower raw material cost as well as the benefit of the SKU and customer rationalization in 2009. Cereal Partners worldwide had mid-single digit organic growth and gained share around the world.</p>
          <p>There was a dramatic improvement in the EBIT margin of Other Food and Beverages, up by 250 basis points to 18.6%. Each of these businesses contributed to that improvement.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the product group reporting. First is Powdered and Liquid Beverages, which also includes Nespresso.</p>
          <p>The Soluble Coffee category is achieving mid single-digit growth. This is lower than in 2009, although the RIG is almost twice as high as in 2009. Pricing is positive, but not materially. Recent innovations are continuing to drive volumes, particularly Dolce Gusto and Greenblend.</p>
          <p>The European performance is strongest in Germany and the Iberian region. The UK growth rate has been held back by the recall of some of those super-premium lines. In the Americas, Nescaf&#xE9; Cl&#xE1;sico continues to be a growth driver in the U.S. and is moving increasingly to mainstream from its Hispanic roots. The Soluble Coffee business continues to grow double-digit in Latin America. In AOA, we are seeing good growth in many of the emerging markets including Indo-China and China, as well as in Japan.</p>
          <p>Powdered Beverages are growing high single-digit with good performances from Milo in AOA, Nescau in Latin America, and Nesquik in Europe. Nestea Litro is also going well with launches in Indo-China and elsewhere. Among countries and regions to highlight are Africa, Indonesia, Indo-China and South Asia, Mexico, France and Oceania.</p>
          <p>Ready-to-Drink Beverages are growing double-digit. The business is performing well in AOA, particularly Nescaf&#xE9;, which is benefiting from increased brand support and distribution, but also Milo. The business is also growing double-digit in the Americas.</p>
          <p>The EBIT margin for Powdered and Liquid Beverages increased by 20 basis points to 22%. The second half will see increased spend on Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, ahead of the peak Christmas season, also relative to 2009 and increased input costs including cocoa.</p>
          <p>Next is Milk products, including Ice Cream. First Milk, which is the key growth driver, it has high single-digit organic growth driven mainly by RIG. The growth is coming from the Nido, affordable PPP range, which is growing double-digit and the growing-up milk category, as well as innovation such as Liquid in Brazil, Fruit Vitality in China and Lactose Free in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In AOA, the growth has been driven by Indonesia, the Philippines and Africa. I have already touched on the situation in China. In Latin America, Brazil is performing well, as are some of the smaller regions.</p>
          <p>I've already discussed Ice Cream in my earlier comments on Americas and Europe. Overall, the product group improved its EBIT margin by 50 basis points to 11.5%, both Milk and Ice Cream contributed.</p>
          <p>Next, Prepared Dishes and Cooking Aids. There has been an acceleration in organic growth in the second quarter to 3.4%, driven wholly by RIG. Re-pricing actually is slightly lighter than at Q1. The drivers of this acceleration are the inclusion of the Frozen Pizza business acquired in March, a further acceleration in Frozen and Chilled Food in Europe and a continued good performance in Ambient Culinary in Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>
          <p>In Europe, I'd highlight in Ambient Culinary, market share gains for Maggi in Germany and the continued progress of Juicy Chicken across Europe. Juicy Chicken will hit sales of over 100 million within three years of its rollout.</p>
          <p>In Frozen, the continued good performance in Buitoni and Wagner pizza, with strong innovation &#x2013; also the strong performance by Nestl&#xE9; Professional. In Chilled, good innovation in filled pasta in Italy and also increased distribution in Lido.</p>
          <p>In North American Frozen Food we are seeing a change in trends from the last few quarters. Stouffer's Family and Value Packs are solid, as are the Hot Pocket multi-packs. The change in trend here is that there is some improvement, even if the category dynamics are lackluster. The Lean Cuisine and Lean Pockets brands are struggling in a weak category.</p>
          <p>We launched late in the half, a new range of steamed offerings under the Lean Cuisine Market Creations brand, and whilst it is early days, these are going well and should bring some improvement to the H2 performance.</p>
          <p>Despite the segment challenges, Lean Cuisine is outselling its competitors by two to one. The good news in North America is the strong start by the newly acquired Pizza business. The product group's EBIT declined by 90 basis points to 11.3%. This is the only category where we saw a margin decline. Key to the decline was the negative growth in the Frozen Pizza business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Also, we are spending behind the frozen brands to try to get more excitement into the category including in support of the recent new Market Creations launch. The margin decline also reflects increased brand support in the other categories &#x2013; for the brands in the other categories.</p>
          <p>Turning to Confectionery, the strong performance already seen in the first quarter and helped then by the early Easter has continued for the first half. We have RIG of 4.3% and organic growth of 8.4%. Much of the trends seen in Q1 remain consistent for the half. We are seeing good growth in the U.K. and the market overall is growing.</p>
          <p>Western Europe as a whole is achieving positive RIG. The extension of the Wonka brand into chocolate in the U.S. has created an inflated short term RIG in that market. The true success of the launch won't be clear until after the autumn season.</p>
          <p>The emerging markets generally are achieving double-digit growth. We are investing in new capacity in China, in the Middle East, in India and in Brazil to meet the demand in those regions. The PPP model is working very well in countries such as India and China. Chocolate has about 0.5 billion of sales from PPPs on an annualized basis.</p>
          <p>The Russian market continues to be weak, even if there are some signs of recovery. We are confident that our market segmentation strategy leaves us well placed to exploit the recovery.</p>
          <p>In general, the competitive environment has been very promotional. The category is also facing increased raw material costs in the second half, with cocoa around all time highs and we expect to give back much of the H1 margin improvement in the second half. Equally, there is always the risk that pricing could impact volume. The first half margin improvement was 70 basis points to 12%.</p>
          <p>The PetCare business has performed well in the Americas and Europe. AOA had a difficult first half due to some import issues but these have since been resolved. The key drivers of the North American growth, which accelerated in the first half were Beneful including the IncrediBites launch. ProPlan, with double-digit growth including the Shredded Blends launch, as well as Fancy Feast appetizers and the new super-premium brand Chef Michael's, targeted at small dogs, also continued to gain distribution.</p>
          <p>There is also a mid single-digit organic growth in Europe with good performances in Russia, Spain and France amongst others, as well as strong performances from premium brands such as Gourmet, including the &#xC0; la Carte innovation, Felix Sensations and Purina One. The growth in Europe and North America has been achieved despite an ongoing SKU rationalization program that has seen the business shed around CHF 1 billion of sales on a global basis since 2003.</p>
          <p>We have shed private label production that came through acquisition, as well as much of our exposure to less value-added areas such as bulk wet dog. The benefit of this is that we've been able to switch our capacity from this low value production to high value-added premium and super-premium products and brands rather than having to build new factories.</p>
          <p>The benefits are there to see in the margin progression that the group has reported over the years, but are also felt in the return on invested capital. In the first half, the product group increased its margin by 190 basis points to 17.6%, contributing to the improvement were mix, just discussed, but also raw materials and cost savings, marketing spend was up in the half.</p>
          <p>Next is the Billionaire Brands chart. I just picked a few, as we've already discussed our growth performance. Three topical areas are Nutrition, Nespresso and U.S. Pizza. It's good to see the NAN infant nutrition brand back at the high single-digit growth level. Also, with all the brouhaha about Nespresso, I am pleased to report that it is performing above its target, which was set before the new entrants launched their products.</p>
          <p>Those products were launched in France and in France, Nespresso continued to enjoy double-digit growth. The newly acquired Digiorno pizza brand is achieving double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>In Chilled, the low Herta organic growth reflects negative pricing as RIG is mid single-digit, good performance. Also, the strength of our PetCare business is demonstrated by its Billionaire Brands all being in the 5 to 20% growth bracket. In our Milk business, Nido is back to double-digit growth, with PPPs performing very well.</p>
          <p>I think the key take-away from that run through is how broad-based our performance is, positive real internal growth in emerging markets and positive real internal growth also in the developed markets.</p>
          <p>As I said at the start, we are growing in Western Europe and we are growing in North America. And the emerging markets are enjoying double-digit growth. The EBIT margin improvement is also broad-based with all the categories, bar one, contributing and it has been delivered, whilst also increasing our media spend and brand support.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude on Food and Beverages, 5.7% organic growth, 60 basis points improvement in the EBIT margin.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand back to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Roddy. For some time now, we have been sharing with you our view of market conditions. These remain uncertain with a fair degree of volatility in currencies, in commodity costs and a general weakness in certain major geographic groupings, particularly Europe.</p>
          <p>This environment is not, in general, a surprise to us, although different elements emerge from one period to another. We've also shared with you the nature of specific actions that we continue to take to improve performance.</p>
          <p>Today, again we've clearly demonstrated that our strategies are delivering good results, a broad-based performance by Nestl&#xE9;. By leveraging our competitive advantages, particularly R&amp;D, and aggressively supporting our brands, we have improved our market shares globally.</p>
          <p>Our competitive performance, measured by the number of business sales we have around the world, is at its best position since we introduced this metric in June 2006, and we expect to continue to improve.</p>
          <p>We captured growth and leveraged our scale, which enabled us to continue to achieve significant savings, well in line again, with our target to deliver another CHF 1.5 billion this year. I think it's important to recognize the degree of focus and discipline with which we remain aligned to our strategic framework even in these uncertain conditions. This commitment and determination is key to the delivery of our performance.</p>
          <p>As I have just mentioned, our performance framework is an "and" agenda. It's not being compromised by making either/or choices. It is about driving performance, about enabling scale benefits, about driving simplicity, and about investing for growth in the future. I'll review the first half numbers then we'll talk about international presence and about GLOBE, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.</p>
          <p>Here you have the usual EBIT bridge, there was a positive strong &#x2013; a strong and positive influence from cost of goods sold at 160 basis points. The key driver here is the savings from Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence, as well as leveraging the benefit of organic growth, partially offset by increase in raw and packing materials and conversion costs.</p>
          <p>For the second half, we continue to see volatility in some raw materials and increased cost pressures. I've added a one-off element to the bridge. This is the 20 basis point benefit that accrues from the fact that on the IFRS 5, we are no longer able to depreciate the assets of Alcon, as Alcon is treated as discontinued in our financials. These 20 basis points is included in the cost of goods and contributes the 180 basis points reported.</p>
          <p>Distribution costs fell by 40 basis points, much of the benefit related to savings resulting from good work through the operations in the different zones. The Waters business has also been very actively realigning and reducing its distribution structures. This brings a collateral benefit through its environmental performance. Looking to the second half, we see higher oil costs than we have experienced in the first half.</p>
          <p>Marketing costs have increased by 140 basis points. We have accelerated our promotional activities on all fronts, particularly in consumer facing initiatives with more product launches and faster global rollout of new products. Administrative costs are down 20 basis points. We are expanding Nestl&#xE9; Continuous beyond operations to include administrative areas and are leveraging our scale through our business services and best practice initiatives around the world.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D remains unchanged and that gives the 80 basis point improvement in EBIT margin on a like-for-like basis, combined with the IFRS requirement and Alcon depreciation, resulted in 100 basis points as reported. Further, from the group's point of view, the underlying performance in constant currencies is an improvement of 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>Next is the income statement from EBIT to net profit, three main comments here. The increase in financial expense reflects a significantly higher net debt in the period due to the impact of the accelerated share buyback program over the last 12 months, as well as the larger acquisition of the U.S. Pizza business.</p>
          <p>The increase in taxes reflect the geographic mix in the business and the increase attributable to non-controlling interest reflect the improved performance of Alcon. The net profit for the period is CHF 6.3 billion, 11.4% of sales, an improvement of 40 basis points. And net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent is CHF 5.5 billion, 9.8% of sales, 10 basis points up. Earnings per share are 13.5% ahead of last year to CHF 1.60 per share.</p>
          <p>And now to cash flow, the important message here is the trend of improvement that we are seeing over time, because both 2008 and 2009 were impacted by the raw material situation, firstly by steep cost rises and then by the correction in those costs, as well as quite significant currency movements period-end over period-end.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this slide, our operating cash flow had improved from 7.9% of sales in 2004 to 8.4% in 2007, before the volatility in 2008 and 2009, swinging between 6.5 and 12.3% sales. Today, it stands at 10.4% of sales, demonstrating the trend of improvement over the time and that improvement is still continuing.</p>
          <p>Supporting this trend is the improvement in our working capital ratios, which has improved from 9.4% of sales in 2005 to 7.4% of sales in 2010. The 2010 performance is a 100 basis point improvement over 2009.</p>
          <p>On an absolute basis, our operating cash flow is down CHF 600 million due to the increase in working capital needed to support the growth in the business. Our cash conversion cycle has also improved.</p>
          <p>Our net debt &#x2013; this is an update of the slide I showed at the full year and highlighted the cash impacts in 2010. The short-term gearing level is temporary and we will manage back to an appropriate level of debt in the near-term. This, in our view, is responsible with flexibility both to support the strategic priorities of the business and to achieve a competitive returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Just a quick update on Alcon, nothing has changed since February. We still expect to close the deal in the current quarter. We have been preparing for the inflow of cash in terms of how we manage it from a treasury point of view and minimizing the counterparty risk associated with such a large inflow of cash.</p>
          <p>We believe that the continuing strong performance of the Food and Beverage business combined with the positive impact of the share buyback, we will &#x2013; will be sufficient to compensate for any dilution that may accrue from the disposal of Alcon.</p>
          <p>That concludes my run through the financials. I would like to talk a bit about Nestl&#xE9;'s global presence and growth profile. Let's look at Nestl&#xE9; growth profile. Our growth profile is broad-based, as you can see from this chart. I'm not going to read the individual elements, just comment on some of the important ones. It is important to note the specific performance globally and by geographic segments, combined with some of the key drivers of growth, such as our geographic presence, PPPs, innovations and R&amp;D and the Billionaire Brands all improving our competitiveness globally.</p>
          <p>Our Billionaire Brands represent approximately 75% of our Food and Beverage business, and as you have seen, are growing around 7% organically so far this year. More than half of these brands are growing above 7.5%, and 90% are in positive territory. Only three brands out of 29 are not growing. And these are improving and gaining shares in declining market.</p>
          <p>Buitoni and Poland Spring are not currently Billionaire Brands, but with about CHF 0.5 billion year-to-date June, growing 11% and 6% respectively, they may be back on this chart very soon. Innovations, innovations launched in 2010 have contributed to 60 basis points of this year's RIG and we are about 80% of the planned launches for the year, which means that we should see a big impact from 2010 innovations in the second half.</p>
          <p>Innovation is just not about giving a short-term push for growth. It's about building brands quickly and sustainably. Look at the Billionaire Brands that did not exist 10 years ago such as Beneful, and Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life, just examples, or Nescaf&#xE9; Dolce Gusto, which is likely to reach CHF 400 billion this year. This is a core competence of Nestl&#xE9;, and the area where we stand out, our ability to create, nurture, build and sustain new large brands.</p>
          <p>On M&amp;A, our activity is a future growth driver for the group, both in developed and emerging markets across a number of categories and distribution channels. So far, we have announced transactions with annualized sales about CHF 2.5 billion this year, primarily smaller bolt-on acquisitions as previously discussed. I would say the Pizza deal was slightly on the higher side. Our focus is on Food and Beverage, particularly Nutrition, Health &amp; Wellness, in both emerging and developed markets.</p>
          <p>As you're aware, Nestl&#xE9; was one of the pioneers in emerging market development, nearly 140 years ago. During the last five or six years, we have set out to you on more than one occasion, our assessment of the emerging market opportunity, incorporating about 1 billion new consumers or potential consumers of Nestl&#xE9; brands. We also told you that we are adapting business models to capture growth across the economic landscape of consumers globally. Hence, our integrated PPP business model, targeting specific income groups, our leadership in halal foods and the U.S. Hispanic initiative, targeting cultural preferences as well as premiumization across categories and value-added disease specific nutrition. These are all plans that we are executing today, creating and embedding capabilities to achieve competitive leadership positions in the developed world and in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>There has been a lot written recently about emerging markets. Much of the research has tended to focus on relative exposure in the &#x2013; of the companies as a percentage of their sales. And I suggested that Nestl&#xE9; is under exposed to the emerging markets, despite the fact that we have more food and beverage sales in those markets than any other company.</p>
          <p>I think there is a danger of people underestimating the value of scale. If one company has CHF 2 billion or $2 billion of sales in China and the other has 200 million, then it is clear who has the greater presence and who will be better able to leverage their scale, even if the $2 billion sales is less than 2% of the first company sales and 200 million is more than 4% of the second company sales.</p>
          <p>What are the advantages of scale? One way of answering the question might be to look quickly at what a percentage of sales approach does not tell us. The percentage approach tells us nothing about the absolute scale of a company in a particular market, whether it is manufacturing locally or whether it has the scale and capability for local R&amp;D, how long it has been in the market, its presence there in terms of share leadership and the ability to strengthen its brands there.</p>
          <p>Its give us no insight as to whether the company understands the intricacies of local distribution, the trade environment or the country's traditions. It tells us nothing about a company's ability to attract local talent or ability of a company's risk profile in that market and of course, it tells us nothing about a company's financial performance.</p>
          <p>The single simple, most important thing to do in our opinion is to look at a company's actual scale and geographic development in any market. This will give you an insight to what really matters. A company with meaningful scale will have consumer relationships, but dating back over decades and well entrenched brands, will have a meaningful presence in terms of market shares and physical duration in the market, will be able to manufacture locally and adapt products to local tastes even to have fully fledged R&amp;D facilities.</p>
          <p>Will understand local challenges whether logistics, cultural or political and, critically, it will be able to leverage that scale to optimize growth opportunities in the market. And from a financial perspective, a company with meaningful scale, which has been in the market for decades, will have a lower risk profile than a new entrant and sustainable returns, whether in terms of EBIT or in capital</p>
          <p>And of course, it will be seen as a meaningful player, able to attract the best talent. Speaking personally, if I were looking to invest in a business, this is just the sort of information I would want to have.</p>
          <p>Sure, a company's overall exposure to the emerging markets is an interesting snapshot but I'd want to get deeper behind those percentages.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at Nestl&#xE9;'s in particular. We have CHF 35 billion of sales in emerging markets, about 35% of our Food and Beverage sales, our size and scale in Food and Beverage are unmatched and reflect our longstanding commitment to this geographic area. What does that mean in terms of our portfolio?</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see our biggest emerging markets. In total, we have 18 emerging markets with annual Food and Beverage sales in excess of CHF 500 million. You can see where we rank in terms of sales in each country compared to all the other local and international Food and Beverage players.</p>
          <p>We are top three in 13 of the 18 countries. It is interesting to note that Brazil is already our fourth largest market in the world, with sales of over CHF 5 billion. And it is one of four emerging markets that have sales over CHF 2 billion. India, the only BRIC not above 2 billion, has comfortably over CHF 1 billion of sales and double-digit organic growth. We have the second highest level of Food and Beverage sales in India, after a local cooperative.</p>
          <p>Seven of the 18 markets are in Asia, five are in Latin America including three of the top five, four are in Europe, two are in the Middle East and one is in Africa. Our scale is, in fact, broad-based. These 18 markets show clearly the bench strength that Nestl&#xE9; has in emerging markets. They represent an amazing platform for growth, already achieving a good level of EBIT margin and return on capital. And of course, below these 18 are many more markets with equally exciting growth potential.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you can see our categories. For each category, you can see what percentage of sales in the category is achieved in emerging markets, as well as how many of the categories' top ten markets are performing.</p>
          <p>The product categories divide into two subsets, first are those that have strong emerging market presence. Many of these are dehydrated in one way or another, easily transportable, easily portionable, safe and shelf stable, for example, Infant Formula, Ambient Dairy, Soluble Coffee, Powdered Beverages, Culinary.</p>
          <p>Confectionary and Ready-to-Drink beverages are an exception, not being powdered, though they are shelf stable, portionable, safe and more for impulse consumption. These are generally the pioneering emerging market categories for Nestl&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>The second subset is categories such as Ice Cream, Water, PetCare and Frozen and Chilled Culinary, which I would classify as follow-on categories. These represent opportunities, which are being captured as the routes to market are being developed. Milk stands out with 80% of its sales in emerging markets. Nine out of Milk's top ten markets are emerging.</p>
          <p>Powdered Beverages has 65% of its sales in emerging markets with Milo, Nescau, Nestea, and Nesquik. Five of its top ten are in emerging markets. Infant Nutrition, Ambient Culinary and Soluble Coffee have half of their sales in emerging markets. Six of Infant Nutrition top ten markets are emerging, as are our four Culinary and Nescaf&#xE9; markets.</p>
          <p>The Nescaf&#xE9; and Maggi brands both originated in Europe. This trend of European brands being adopted in emerging markets is one which we have seen for many years and will be there for many years to come, with such brands as KitKat, Nespresso, Friskies, Dolce Gusto and even specialty building their presence in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Confectionary has 4 to 5% of its sales in emerging markets. Ready-to-Drink beverages has 40%, and six of the top 10 are emerging markets. The biggest of the second set is Ice Cream with 20% of its sales in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>PetCare is interesting for a couple of reasons, firstly its presence in emerging markets are small &#x2013; is small, but growing very rapidly and 10% of that category represents CHF 1 billion.</p>
          <p>Secondly, PetCare is one of our fastest growing categories with consistent 6% or more organic growth, despite being predominantly a developed market business so far. Other fast growing businesses with predominantly developed market presence include Jenny Craig, even if its recent performance has slowed and, of course, Nespresso and Nescaf&#xE9; and Dolce Gusto. This demonstrates that there is more to high growth than just being present emerging markets. This too is a point that is sometimes overlooked, developed markets can also be a growth driver.</p>
          <p>I hope I have demonstrated that Nestl&#xE9; does not lack scale relative either to the international or local competition in emerging markets. In fact, the opposite is true. Our scale is unmatched. We have long said that our geographic presence is one of our competitive advantages. It is. And not just because of our scale, but because of our longevity in these markets.</p>
          <p>Today, these markets have sales of CHF 35 billion, as I said, 35% of Food and Beverage. Over the last five years to the end of 2009, they have averaged 11.5% organic growth. So, we're rich with potential for further growth in these markets.</p>
          <p>The research written about emerging markets concludes surprisingly that a company with higher percentage of its sales in emerging markets will have a higher growth profile. We're not surprised the math would tend to work that way. But what the research doesn't generally seek to do is to make an analysis of the company's non-emerging market businesses. It is almost as if the assumption is that all developed markets are equal and that all the performances of all companies in the developed markets is also equal. This, you know, is not the case.</p>
          <p>Again, let's look at Nestl&#xE9;. Over the last five years, North America has averaged 6% organic growth. I think we can all agree that this is a strong performance from a developed market. Certainly, it is outperforming the overall Food and Beverage industry in North America, helped by category choices that we have made. Nestl&#xE9; has CHF 29 billion of sales in North America, before consolidating Pizza. This is no accident and we are proud of this achievement. We have been long bullish on the North American consumer and remain so and we will continue to believe that the demographics there and the trends in our particular categories are very positive for us.</p>
          <p>Western Europe has averaged 2.5% organic growth over the five-year period. This is rather slow than North America. You might say this is not a great number, and we too would have liked to have done better. But it has been good enough to see the EBIT margin progress meaningfully from period-to-period. And by the way, even in the current environment, we are achieving real internal growth in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Germany is positive, PetCare is positive, France is positive, the Great Britain region is positive and so are the Iberian region and Italy. And the globally managed businesses, we're enhancing to the region's growth. The other point about Western Europe, which I have already mentioned, is that it has been the launch pad for many of our brands that are driving growth in emerging markets today and it will continue to be in the years to come. This should not be underestimated. Emerging market consumers are aspirational. This has been true for a while of mainstream brands and it's becoming increasingly so for premium brands.</p>
          <p>In our total developed markets, our total developed markets have averaged about 4% annual growth over the last five years. Think about that for a moment. If 65% of the business is growing at 4%, you can appreciate the degree of commitment to investment in capabilities, brands and people that we are making to enable the remaining 35% to grow to become 4 to 5% of our sales by 2012.</p>
          <p>It is absolutely critical that our evolution, both in emerging markets and the developed world is well understood. We do not want to be under valued for growing our developed markets as well as the emerging ones. Whether as a business or as an investor, you need to understand your risks, as well as your opportunities. The emerging markets are certainly an opportunity to enhance performance. Those who are able to optimize those opportunities, whilst managing the attendant risks will be the winners and there, Nestl&#xE9; has a head start.</p>
          <p>The developed markets have challenges, but they too, also offer opportunities. We have demonstrated our ability to navigate around the difficult environment in developed markets and to optimize the opportunities there as we have proven by our positive organic growth performance in the developed world even in 2009 and which continues in 2010.</p>
          <p>So let's not forget, we are running a global business at Nestl&#xE9;. The winners who create the greatest value for their consumers on a sustainable basis will be winners &#x2013; will remain winners, will be those who will win on a global basis, not those who only progress in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And winning is the theme of the next part of my presentation. When we talk internally at Nestl&#xE9; about winning, we mean a couple of things, driving performance or driving competitive advantage along the value chain, creating performance gap between ourselves and the competition, and increasing our own level of competitive intensity within the company &#x2013; within our operations. It is our ambition not just to create gaps, but to be ahead of the competition permanently. A key enabler to doing so is GLOBE. This year is the 10th anniversary of GLOBE, so it's fitting that we revisit it.</p>
          <p>I want to briefly remind you what our ambition was 10 years ago and then talk more about what GLOBE means to Nestl&#xE9; today, and what our ambition is for the future. And not surprisingly, the best is still to come.</p>
          <p>This is a statement Peter Brabeck made when he launched GLOBE and you can read it. His message was that we needed to leverage our size as an advantage, and to do so without being held back by the problems size can bring, such as complexity, slow decision-making and inertia.</p>
          <p>GLOBE had three initial objectives, to harmonize best practices, and remember, GLOBE &#x2013; the acronym stands for Global Business Excellence. This aspect of GLOBE continues today to be a key driver of operational and financial performance.</p>
          <p>The second objective was to create one set of data standards. And by the way, during the last years, we have reduced the data population by almost 65%. And to put in place a common IT system and we chose SAP as the main software platform. We accepted the fact that given our global scale, we would always be complex. But we believe that with GLOBE, we could break the rule that complexity necessarily mean efficiency &#x2013; inefficiency. We believe that we can create a new dynamic, where complexity will be accompanied with efficiency. I believe today that we are well on course to achieve that.</p>
          <p>This chart shows IS/IT spend, couple of points to make. Firstly, if you look at the top red line compared to the black, that gap is important. Because at the time of launching GLOBE, we were experiencing a significant escalation in IS/IT costs and you could see it from 1995 to 2000.</p>
          <p>We said, we believe that our first or near-term objective should be 1.9% of sales and then 2%. We did this, including the depreciation cost. This in itself was a good cost avoidance achievement. Without GLOBE, we would have probably been running cost at about 30 to 40 basis points higher than we are experiencing today.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; where we are today ten years after the launch, some statistics tell part of the story. GLOBE is in 90 countries 2,500 facilities and being used by 160,000 people. More significant is that we have just done a major upgrade of our entire operating system globally, and we did it without any disruption to our business.</p>
          <p>That was a major achievement by our people. But what is really exciting about it is that we are now set to move to a higher level of performance over the rest of the decade with the benefit of the latest technology.</p>
          <p>We're moving now from focusing on what Peter Brabeck described as unlocking our potential to focusing on GLOBE to keep us one step ahead. In other words, to enhance our competitive advantage and drive competitive gaps along the value chain.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at some of the ways we will do this. The start point is to understand how linked GLOBE is to Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence. Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence took its name from the Nestl&#xE9; inspiration of continuous improvement and GLOBE's focus on business excellence, hence Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence.</p>
          <p>Today the combination of the two, NCE and GLOBE, combines to create a way of driving improved performance that goes beyond any standard efficiency program. There are three new objectives for GLOBE as enabler &#x2013; link to Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence, two on this slide and one on the next. The first is about operational performance, driving synergies, optimizing SKUs, improving our environmental, social governance performance, which by the way, has a direct link to our financials as you will see later, increasing traceability and so on.</p>
          <p>Of course, you will say, we and everyone else has been or have been all doing these things for years. I am not talking about doing them. I'm talking about becoming the best at doing them. If I take traceability as an example, after the melamine crisis in China, we were the first company to be able to become melamine complaint by stickering our products. That gives us a clear competitive advantage at the time and contributed significantly to our good market share performance there.</p>
          <p>If I take cost advantage or cost savings as an example, for 10 years, we were running at about 1 billion per year in savings. Now, we are averaging 1.5 billion a year, think about that. After 10 years and CHF 10 billion, it ought to get harder, not easier. In fact, the fact is that by using the end-to-end process from supplier to customer to consumer, we have been able to increase significantly the cost base on which we can attack for further savings.</p>
          <p>The second objective is all about business excellence, which has always been at the heart of GLOBE and of Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence. Just think about the experience or the expertise that resides in 160,000 people who are using the system everyday. Simply put, we're pulling together the best of everything in Nestl&#xE9; and we are sharing it around the organization.</p>
          <p>This has a huge multiplier effect because regardless of how any one person is, they are not &#x2013; they cannot be good at everything. So everyone, every factory, every distribution centre, every sales team, every admin function, every R&amp;D center has room for improvement. They all have the ability to drive efficiency, enhance growth, to accelerate innovation, to improve whatever KPIs they have. Of course, there is structure behind the concept. That structure include our shared service centres, which we call the Nestl&#xE9; Global Business Centres, or on a regional basis, the Nestl&#xE9; Business Centres, as well as the teams that support them. And of course, there is the data as well.</p>
          <p>The data is key to measurement, to rapid informed decision making, to accountability and to delivering against targets as well as ensuring the organization remain in a controlled environment. Equally, high quality, timely data enables us to manage extreme complexity with incredible efficiency.</p>
          <p>For example, ongoing double-digit growth of our PPPs and the associated increase in distribution centre activities including the multitude of SKU. Just think about the number of complexity, or the degree of complexity it adds to our manufacturing set-up, all of which need to have the same quality of performance, in terms of products and in terms of the organization. Yet, we are doing it and it is accretive to earnings.</p>
          <p>The third objective is all about efficiency and effectiveness. It's about reducing cost, about being the low cost operator. It's about capital avoidance through increased efficiency, about increasing returns on invested capital. It's about reducing inventories at the same time as increasing customer service levels. And it's about continue to control our IS/IT costs.</p>
          <p>I hope I have given you an overview of what GLOBE and NCE means to us today. We will probably come back to this with you or come back to you with this sometime later. For now, here are just some of the KPIs that we look at when measuring GLOBE's success as an enabler and the impact of NCE. From an operational perspective, these include cost and capital savings, our records on safety and on quality incidence, demand planning accuracy and customer service levels, working capital. These KPIs tend to feed into product benefits such as freshness and reduced bad goods and of course, we are very focused on our 60/40+ to ensure that we have best products in the market.</p>
          <p>These and other product KPIs also feed into our growth performance. SKU optimization is key to healthy growth. This is perhaps a bit counter-intuitive, but the fact is that optimizing our SKUs are freeing up resource, financial and otherwise, to put behind your winning SKUs. This will help accelerate growth. And the same is true for simplicity. Again, it frees up everyone's time to focus on RIG, on profitable growth.</p>
          <p>A couple of examples on the KPIs. First, manufacturing, we've increased our tonnage for factory by 23% over the last five years. This is a great example of capital avoidance. Despite the tonnage increase shown on the previous chart, we have reduced our usage of water and energy by 21% and 15%, respectively. And our Greenhouse gases are down 18%.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our lost time injury is down by over 70%. Again, this feeds directly into financial performance. Think about the cost savings related to 15% reduction in energy in these times. We hold annual business excellence awards. These are just not awards ceremony. It is a one way of &#x2013; wonderful way of sharing in the business the best practices around the world. Last year, we had 140 examples and this year are up to 100 such examples again. This is really an effective way of encouraging and seeding further performance improvement.</p>
          <p>That completes my overview on GLOBE. The first 10 years saw a real commitment, excellent execution and good progress. But the best is yet to come. GLOBE more than ever, with Nestl&#xE9; Continuous Excellence, will be an enabler to future profitable growth. It will raise our standards in terms of cost and capital efficiencies, and working capital performance, but it will also free up resource to drive growth. It will be a catalyst for our performance.</p>
          <p>As Paul Bulcke says, GLOBE will create sustainable competitive advantage by creating performance gaps between us and our competitors, all along the value chain from supplier to consumer to customer.</p>
          <p>And this is the key point that Paul made, Paul was not talking about achieving a particular competitive advantage somewhere in the business, he was really talking about creating competitive advantage everywhere in the business. And that is something that we will &#x2013; that will be incredibly difficult to manage and therefore, we are really building a truly sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>Thank you much &#x2013; very much for your attention. I will now wrap up my presentation before going to Q&amp;A. To summarize, Nestl&#xE9; delivered very strong top and bottom line in the first half year. Accelerating our investments in our brands and capabilities around the world, we have prepared the company for a more challenging second half. This allows us to reconfirm our earlier guidance for the year that we are expecting now around 5% organic growth, whilst improving EBIT margins in constant currencies over 2009.</p>
          <p>We are focused on winning all around the world not just emerging markets, not just in developed markets, every market in the world has opportunity. We are going to win wherever opportunity lies. These opportunities are a catalyst for Nestl&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>GLOBE has been a fantastic enabler of performance for Nestl&#xE9; in the last decade. I believe however, that as we move from implementation to exploitation of GLOBE capabilities, the best is still to come. GLOBE is another catalyst for Nestl&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>And finally, since I'm talking about catalysts, I believe that regardless of what the latest topical theme may be, the best catalyst of all is simply consistent year-after-year progress in operating performance. And that is our focus in every product group, in every operating segment.</p>
          <p>So to conclude, Nestl&#xE9; is focused on year-after-year performance improvement, in line with our total performance framework and aligned with our strategic priorities, performance without compromise.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Let's go to question, Roddy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Warren Ackerman at Evolution. Two questions, the first one, Jim, you said you're preparing the business for a more challenging second half of the year. Can you just expand on that comment, please?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, more specifically on Europe, Europe grew I think in Q2 organically at 1% versus 3.5% in Q1. I was just wondering what's behind that slowdown and how much of a role did Ice Cream play in that slowdown in Q2. If you ex out Ice Cream, would there still have been a slowdown? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's in terms of preparing the business, as I said in the presentation, during the course of last year and especially the beginning of this year when we announced our results, I showed you a chart about the recognition of the market conditions. And one point in that chart was marketplace uncertainty that will result in increased pressures on pricing and volumes.</p>
          <p>I also explained that we were taking several initiatives to make sure that the organization was ready and prepared and to take early action in order to achieve flexibility to deal with conditions that some &#x2013; sometimes are not easily predictable.</p>
          <p>Those actions have been put in place. We talked about accelerating our promotion activities to make sure that our brands remain competitive and well supported in the minds of the consumer, building relationships with them.</p>
          <p>We talked about using all vehicles for communicating with our consumers and increasing the activity in that area. And we also talked about actions that we will take to help protect from the volatility in our input cost basket. And if you could recall, we did guide you to an increase in our input costs, somewhere between 2 to 3%.</p>
          <p>Those were what &#x2013; those are the things that we're talking about in terms of how we are preparing the organization for the second half &#x2013; for the first half &#x2013; for all of this year and perhaps next year as we go into next year.</p>
          <p>So, when we say this is not a surprise to us, we are not being &#x2013; it's a sense of confidence in the organization that we are recognizing that the environment, especially certain parts of the world are difficult. But we need to make progress and you've seen we've made progress. So, that's what we mean when we said we have prepared the organizations.</p>
          <p>It's not something that we started to do last month or in May. It's something we've been doing since last year in trying to implement initiatives. Some that are top driven and some that are adopted, initiated by the markets to make sure they make progress as we've done in the first six months.</p>
          <p>Just coming to the other question on Europe. First of all, the numbers may say the second quarter is lower than the first quarter. But I would not characterize our experience as a slowdown, because if you look at first and second quarter, whether you look at first, or you look at second, or you look at them together for the first half, I think we are making good progress in Europe.</p>
          <p>Sure, it's a more difficult market environment. You've seen, if you go back four years or five years, North America grew 6%, Europe grew 2.5%. The whole developed world grew 4.5%. In fact, what you are seeing is the step down in growth and Europe is relative to that.</p>
          <p>All our major markets in Europe had positive growth in the first six months. And all our categories also have positive growth in the first six months. So, yes, it is one of the difficult areas in the world, but we are doing everything possible to make sure we get growth wherever growth can be had.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I think Ice Cream was slower, yes. I think we had a slower start to the season, but Ice Cream in total is positive organic growth.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's Julian Hardwick from RBS. Could &#x2013; I would just follow up on from that and perhaps you could just help us to understand, has anything about the outlook for the second half changed in your thinking over the last, say, three months or so. Specifically, are you still looking for 2 to 3% raw material cost increase for this year? Have you changed your view about what the pricing environment is going to look like or the competitive market? Though I think that it'd be &#x2013; that would be quite helpful, just to understand how your thinking has evolved about the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Julian. Yes, I think we are maintaining our guidance in terms of our input cost basket, 2 to 3%. The first half was at the lower end of that range, as a matter of fact, slightly below 2%. And therefore we were expecting a higher level of cost impact in the second half. And to the extent that we can protect against that, we are, and we continue to do so. But this is the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year and we are sticking with that for the rest of the year &#x2013; for the full year.</p>
          <p>I think the volatility that we're seeing in some of these commodity &#x2013; in some of these commodities will lead to some price reduction later on in the year. And we are engaging with all the parties concerned about what are the implications for sustained volatility and how we can work together to make sure that we minimize the impact on the consumer. As you know, we don't only depend on pricing to manage cost, input cost pressures. We have a very aggressive &#x2013; a very successful savings program and this is why we need to be successful in these area and we are. We are trending very well in terms of achieving our CHF 1.5 billion again this year, which will help us deal with some of these issues.</p>
          <p>Our pricing, you look at first quarter, second quarter is trending down. What I would say given what pricing actions are likely to take place this &#x2013; the second half, you'd likely see a more stabilization of that price level. So, I don't see our pricing &#x2013; I see our pricing more at a stability level rather than continue to decline because it's sort of carry-on effect from last year. But you'll start instead of seeing this gradual decline, you'll see more stability in our pricing going forward for the balance of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Nico Lambrechts from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. For the second half, should we expect a significant deceleration in the margin expansion following quite impressive 60 basis points increase in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've said in our guidance that the EBIT margin in 2010 will reflect an improvement in constant currencies over last year. That's our guidance and we're sticking to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have commented on cost pressures, could you maybe give us some insight then in into &#x2013; should cost savings in the second half accelerate and would the increase in market spending not be as big as in the first half? Maybe and some insight into the moving parts and the bridge into the second half, if you could.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, we said, I mean if you look at the input cost, we said the first half was slightly lower than the range we gave you and the second half will be higher. Our savings program tend to be greater in the second half, because the first half you start implementing rolling over plants and we tend &#x2013; this is why we said that we are well on trend or on track to achieve the 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On promotions, including consumer-facing promotions, we will do what it takes to be competitive. So, we are going to be launching new products. As I said, we have 80% our program this year on innovation already introduced to the markets. Now that has been phased in and as you launch new products, new innovations or you extend the reach of the &#x2013; of existing innovations to new markets, that requires an increase in advertising and brand support to make sure you have a good start. And that is the way we have been managing the company.</p>
          <p>You'll see the first half this year is an acceleration in terms of our spending against the support of our brands relative to last year for the first part. You may see some tapering down, because in fact what we are spending at a level more or less somewhere between where we are today and where we ended, the average of last year. So, you could look at the numbers and see it for yourselves, so.</p>
          <p>But we are going to spend what it takes. I think there were some questions last year whether we were slow to act. In fact, we are not &#x2013; we have not been slow to act. We are very consequent in terms of how we spend money to support our brands. And it's not only spending advertising and promotion, it's what is the value we are building into our brands in terms of increasing the value to the consumer and the business models we are using to make sure that we have brands at a value that consumers can afford.</p>
          <p>So, within our categories, in addition to our PPP model, we have segmented products in terms of value within our brands, so you can trade up or trade down without having to trade out of the Nestl&#xE9; brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a follow-up on that. You indicated GLOBE and our potential acceleration of cost savings and tie that into your revenue performance in a difficult market period. Do you think '011 going forward, we could see similar growth rates that we saw the previous five years or acceleration or a step-up from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we talked about Nestl&#xE9;'s ability to continue to make progress. I mean most of the second part of our discussion this morning is about what are the core competencies and capabilities of Nestl&#xE9; to continue to perform in the emerging markets and in the developed markets, in terms of our brands, our global presence, our R&amp;D set-up and the productivity of our R&amp;D and the 260,000 people we have around the world. These are the four competitive advantages we have that have taken us through one of the most difficult periods over the last 40 or 50 years. And we are highly confident as we are doing this year that we will continue to perform, given whatever the market conditions are. And surely, we are not immune, but I think we have the defensive capabilities to make progress even if things get difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that there are number of questions around the same subject in terms of H2 and into 2011. But I think if you look at the first half income statement, it tells you what we are doing to manage the business and to prepare for 2010 H2. The cost of goods sold is under control, savings are coming through, you're seeing an increased investment behind the brands. And it's clear that we will &#x2013; we'll spend more in 2010 than we did in 2009 on brand support. And we said before, as we put more and more nutritional arguments behind our brands, you need to spend to make the arguments. So, that trend is a trend that will continue. Equally, distribution costs are coming down, R&amp;D is flat, is up a little bit in terms of absolute spend. But you can see in the income statement exactly what we're doing to prepare ourselves for the challenges ahead and to continue to drive growth and that's all aligned with the Nestl&#xE9; model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez, Cheuvreux. I need clarification on two technicalities, the first one is the working cap, you showed us this chart that present a trend down, but in the financial report the working cap swing is massively negative. So, what's the technical difference? And the second point of clarification, when you say consumer facing marketing spend, are consumer facing promotional pricing included in this or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The working capital numbers you see is the absolute numbers at the half year, going back 12 month sales. So you can actually do that calculation. So, those numbers are in the financials. The absolute working capital has increased and we told you the reason is that we are back to a normal level of working capital to support the business in absolute terms. The business is growing 5.7%, 6.1% and that increase requires additional working capital around the world. And as you launch new products, it does have some volatility in your working capital and the seasonal business like Ice Cream and Water in this season, I think they have some seasonal impact on your working capital. But the fact is that in absolute Swiss francs, our working capital values have increased consistent with the growth requirements of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you're talking about the difference between the cash flow and the balance sheet then the difference is simply that the cash flow is down at December 31 exchange rates, the balance sheet is not. So, there is a difference in that you won't be able to read across through. And consumer facing marketing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just, the consumer facing marketing is what we spend directly to benefit our brand and benefit our consumers. When we talk consumer facing, we do not talk about price promotions, kind of price related promotions. They're not included in that categorization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Simon Marshall-Lockyer from Jefferies. Can I just ask you on the cost savings in the end of the presentation related to GLOBE, Jim? You were indicating that 1.5 billion, I think so far the 1.5 billion you talked about was an increase from the 1 billion in the 2010 context. Are you saying in that GLOBE and Continuous Excellence program that the target is effectively being raised now to 1.5 billion on a recurrent basis? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is really more understanding and granularity on the Other Food and Beverage performance during the first half with the 250 basis points improvement in margins there, yet the Powdered and Liquid beverage margins were up 20 basis points. So, my question relates to Nespresso with Nestl&#xE9; Professional. Should we take it that it was Nestl&#xE9; Professional that drove most of the increase in margins in Other Food and Beverage during the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, let me deal with the first question on cost savings. There are two &#x2013; there are three savings out of GLOBE categorization, one is the cost avoidance. If we and I personally believe this, if we did not have a more holistic approach to information systems management, and data management and managing what technological platforms you embed in the company so complex and so large that our &#x2013; the 2% that you're seeing that we're experiencing today, would have been at least 30 to 40 basis points higher per year.</p>
          <p>You take that, that's about 300 million to CHF 400 million in cost avoidance. And if you capitalize that, you'll get a value in excess of CHF 4 billion on an after tax basis. So, that's a big benefit that we're getting from having GLOBE the way it is being configured and deployed in the organization.</p>
          <p>Yes, the 1.5 billion is what we achieved last year, slightly more or less. This is the target this year. It had been 1 billion in the past. And as I said, you have a company, a billion a year, 10 billion over ten years, it should be a little more difficult to get the next billion. But with GLOBE, we have not maintained the 10 &#x2013; we have not only maintained the 10 billion &#x2013; the 1 billion a year, we've increased the target.</p>
          <p>Now, GLOBE is an important enabler of that. There are other things we're doing in the company, but GLOBE is an important enabler there. The other one is capital expenditures, and that is where the ability to have visibility on what the organization is doing, how we're managing every selling unit in the company. Since the implementation of GLOBE and the more adoption at the higher level of operating efficiency of GLOBE over the last three years &#x2013; over the last four years, we have reduced the data population in Nestl&#xE9; by 65%. We have reduced our SKUs by 35%. You see the increase in the production or the productive capability of our factories by 20 to 30%, which means that we are producing a lot more products in the same factory, relative to what we have done in the past.</p>
          <p>So, when you look at GLOBE and how it is driving value creation in the company and how it is enriching the lives of the people that work within Nestl&#xE9;, it is a value that you can't simply attribute to it, but you know it is one of the catalysts in Nestl&#xE9;. And that's why we said GLOBE is a catalyst for performance.</p>
          <p>Now the other question on Other Food and Beverage, yes, I would say all the elements in the Other categories, the joint ventures, Nestl&#xE9; Food Service or Nestl&#xE9; Professional and Nespresso have contributed significantly. You see 240 basis points improvement. It's a smaller base, but it's an important improvement. But Nestl&#xE9; Professional is not the key, it's an important contributor, but it's not the dominating contributor in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the Powdered Beverages &#x2013; Powdered and Liquid Beverages, first of all remember that both Nespresso is in Powdered and Liquid, but so are the Coffee sales made by Nestl&#xE9; Professional in Powdered and Liquid. Okay, so both of them have done well and both of them have contributed to that 20 basis points improvement. Thus, the obvious question is that something must have gone down and clearly within Powdered Beverages, we have the malt beverages, the high cocoa content, there's some raw material pressure there.</p>
          <p>And in Soluble Coffee, we mentioned Dolce Gusto, about 400 million of sales this year. We're continuing to roll that out. We have a lot of markets that therefore are not yet making a profit, let alone a Soluble Coffee margin profit. And on that theme, when we go out in the U.S. in September and we go nationwide in a huge number of Wal-Marts, marketing support behind that. That trend of investment in the future profitable growth of Dolce Gusto is going to increase.</p>
          <p>So, there are things going on in those businesses that are impacting the margin, if you like. One is raw materials, the other is investment. But within the globally managed businesses, we're seeing very strong performance in Nespresso, a very strong performance from Professional. So, I hope that -</p>

          <p>Morning. It's Polly Barclay from JPMorgan, Cazenove. Just come back to Europe, please. On the Q1 call, you commented that performance of organic sales growth, I think it was 3.4% in the Q1 period, could be roughly what you would deliver for the full year.

But we do continue to believe that we will deliver positive organic growth and RIG. I won't say that the first half number is a good guide for rest of the year because you probably won't believe, after I got it wrong last time. But we are still pretty positive about &#x2013; we're still very positive about &#x2013; or very committed to delivering a positive performance in both Western Europe and in the zone.</p>

          <p>There is &#x2013; first of all, I just want to make one thing clear is that our reporting of revenues is consistent to what we have done for many years. We have not changed anything. And by the way, if we change the reporting on net-net sales, it will not change, as a matter of fact, it will have a very positive impact on our margin structures.</p>
          <p>And we've shared that with you before. But it's not going to change the absolute numbers in terms of what we achieve in margins, how much we spend against our brands or earnings per share or net profit or cash flows.</p>
          <p>But we recognize that that is something that we look at from time-to-time. And there is a new IFRS exposure bulletin that has recently been issued and we are looking at that to see what will be required when those new standards are implemented. So, we're studying that now and we'll get back to you if and when we decide to change anything.</p>

          <p>And I think, I mean, you phrased your question very well. We're talking about comparability. We're not talking about performance. And over the last five years, we've returned, including 2010, 60 billion to shareholders and that doesn't change if you change how you report your sales. So, we are talking about comparability, not about performance.</p>
          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Jeremy Fialko at Redburn. A couple of questions. The first one is on marketing in the second half. Obviously, your consumer spending mark &#x2013; consumer-facing marketing was up quite strongly in the first half. Would you expect a similar sort of increase in the second half?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on your emerging markets more generally. It certainly seems quite as your default view that the emerging markets will continue to grow at a pretty rapid rate. Are there any sort of major emerging markets where you are seeing any signs of a slow down at the moment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marketing spending, first half versus second half. Yes, the first half, our consumer facing marketing was up 14%. As I said, we continued to spend &#x2013; continued to increase spending in this area. And I have no forecast that would indicate that we will reduce the level of support we give our brands for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, we believe that emerging markets will continue to be an important aspect of our growth. We have not seen any indications of any slowdown in any one of the major emerging markets. As a matter of fact, you see the BRIC markets are growing above &#x2013; the BRIC markets, which are the larger of the emerging markets are growing faster than our total emerging market growth in total. So, we don't have any indication of any slowdown in any one of those larger markets.</p>

          <p>Alan Erskine from UBS. A few quick questions, I mean one, can you tell us was Eastern Europe, was it negative in the quarter? Secondly, was &#x2013; you said in the presentation that the Infant Nutrition, if I heard it right, the Infant Nutrition margins are above the margins for the Nutrition division as a whole. I could take it from that that the clinical nutrition margins are below the 19% reported. And thirdly, can you give us some granularity as to the contributors to the margin improvement in the Nutrition division? Was it mainly the clinical side or was the baby food part of that as well? And if so, what was helping to drive that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, Infant Nutrition, your assumption is correct. And on the healthcare side, I mean the margins are lower, but they are improving across the board driven mainly by the work we did last year. If you remember, we talked about that when we were getting out of some unprofitable customer relationships, we were taking out &#x2013; doing the synergies based acquisition, we were rationalizing the brands. So, we now have a much more focused business in terms of product and in terms of customers and we're seeing the growth coming through quite nicely and the margins are also improving. And in Europe, we were positive in the quarter. In fact, Russia improved a bit over where it was in the first quarter. We said it was &#x2013; there were some signs of some improvement. But the numbers were nothing to write home about, but it did improve a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, both Eastern and Western Europe had positive numbers in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Hi, Deborah Aitken of Bryan, Garnier. Could you help us to understand the issue behind not releasing the net profit figure on a continuing basis for half one and the EPS there versus giving us the consensus or the adjusted number for half one '09? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't give a continuing EPS at the full year either. And the reason we won't do it is because if you take Alcon out of the earnings, you then need to put the $28 billion cash into your numbers somewhere, and also extract from that some benefit from having a different net debt or even cash position. You can't do one without doing the other.</p>
          <p>And first of all, to do that, you need to know when it's going to happen, and then you need to have the assumptions. And to our minds, it's a totally meaningless number. So, once we do it, then we could &#x2013; obviously, we're going to report. But there's no point in us trying to guess some number that will bear no relation to anything and it won't be comparable to the 2011 number either, won't from a comparable basis in 2011. Just seems, to us, it's a meaningless number, so we're not doing it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I just &#x2013; I thought that it was there available for comparison on the half one '09 that you sent around &#x2013; .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no. We gave you an underlying earnings per share number for the group as a whole. And this morning, we sent out the spreadsheet with that on it. So, if you haven't had it, then apologies and we'll send it to you. But it has been sent out this morning, the underlying earnings per share number for the group.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Could I ask a second question, please, about Chocolate in Russia? And you said that that's progressing. Could you just explain when you would expect to see mid single-digit growth there again? How long it's taking and what exactly are the issues still outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think one category that is sort of difficult in the market as a whole is the Confectionary category in Russia. And the business is recovering but recovering slowly. As a matter of fact, the category remains in negative territory, but our business in the market is gaining share. So, we're making progress competitively but it is a market where it is difficult to predict the improvement in the category as a whole. I think given the nature of the category, which is impulse, will depend a lot on the recovery of the Russian economy, in general. We are seeing some progress in our business in terms of growth and in terms of market share, and we expect that to continue for the balance of this year and, hopefully, well into next year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you had the &#x2013; you obviously you had the impact last year of the ruble devaluation, cocoa price, and U.S. dollar going through the roof. So, it's a double-whammy there for the consumers as well. So, there are some pretty major macro issues.</p>
          <p>Just one &#x2013; I'm afraid one final question or maybe, if it's quickly two questions.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Joseline Gaudino, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. So, I want to come back on the raw materials situation. In fact, due to the category you are involved in, it's easy for you to be hedged. So, you have more long-term vision than the short-term, you have probably six to 18 months lag between what happened on the market. So, I don't understand why &#x2013; what has changed really in the situation for the second half, why you are so cautious.</p>
          <p>And in terms of &#x2013; you mentioned that the price effect is going to be more stable in the second part. You very often mentioned to &#x2013; you need to stay competitive &#x2013; you need to stay competitive. For me, as soon as a company starts saying we need to stay competitive, meaning I'm going to cut price. So, what's really the situation or meaning you need to pass on to consumer in the second part of the year, the situation of raw mat in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's lead with the first one. The &#x2013; and I know you are talking about arrangements with key suppliers and the timeframe, and the lag timeframe, that has not changed. And there is no doubt that Dairy is one of the area where we are seeing an escalation in pricing, in cost and therefore, it's one of the area where you're likely to see some pricing action. Now, when we say we are going to remain competitive, we have said before that we do not believe in Nestl&#xE9; in our model that prices is the major competitive weapon we have or the major sort of go to action when you have competitive cost structures.</p>
          <p>We build competitiveness in our products by increasing the value, especially the whole focus on 60/40 and 60/40+ is about putting more benefits to our products that are meaningful and relevant to the consumers. And therefore, if you are only competing on price, there is no price low enough and if you are only competing on price promotions, then there is no price promotion level high enough. And so, if you get into the price game, you behave differently than if you are looking focus on increasing the value to the consumer. And that's the whole PPP business model, the whole focus on improving the nutritional foundations of our products, these are all geared towards delivering better value to the consumers.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the raw material bit, I mean, also just your question suggested you thought something had changed dramatically. But it hasn't and our guidance is the same the guidance has been, 2 and 3%. So, nothing has changed dramatically. In fact, so far as we're concerned, in terms of our guidance to the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm afraid that we need to wrap up there. And my apologies to the people on the phone who didn't get a chance to ask a question. It's not funny, it's a serious apology. Don't laugh.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much for your interest. I hope this has been a very useful session and as usual, we are open to your feedback. I just want to summarize very quickly, as we said, we talked about the opportunities that are being pursued, both in emerging markets and the developed markets and you've seen our performance is broad-based. It's broad-based both in emerging markets and the developed markets and by reporting responsibilities and by categories.</p>
          <p>We also said one of the catalysts of growth for Nestl&#xE9; &#x2013; or catalysts of Nestl&#xE9;'s performance is GLOBE. But in the end, we say the catalyst for our performance and our valuation should be our consistent performance time-and-time, year-after-year and that's the Nestl&#xE9; model. That's our focus. And based on our performance so far this year, we have reconfirmed our organic growth now sort of a bit sharper at 5 &#x2013; around 5% and we have maintained the guidance on the EBIT margin being EBIT margin improvement in constant currencies over last year. Thank you. Thank you very much for your questions and for being here.</p>
