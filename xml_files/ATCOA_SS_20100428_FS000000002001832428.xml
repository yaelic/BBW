          <p>Good morning and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Atlas Copco Q1 Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Just to remind you this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to handover to today's chairperson, Hans Ola Meyer, CFO. Please begin your meeting and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and warm welcome to everybody participating in this call on our first quarter results of Atlas Copco Group. I will very soon handover to Ronnie, our CEO, who will give you his comments on the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Just a remainder first of all, perhaps to say that we're sorry for the slight delay in starting the call. We will have to unfortunately stop the call also in exactly in one hour because we have the Annual General Meeting coming up this afternoon here in Stockholm. So we need to be in time for that. But, I'm sure we will have time for many questions in between.</p>
          <p>So please Ronnie with that, turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much Hans Ola, and good morning and good afternoon to all of you. I will follow the handouts that I guess you have in front of you and I will time-to-time also refer to the numbers on the slide. So we talk the same slide.</p>
          <p>Let me then start immediately with slide number three called Q1 highlights. What can we take away from that, I think during the first quarter, we saw a strong recovery of the order intake and especially in the latter part of the quarter was very strong. We also see that a very &#x2013; and that's a bit &#x2013; but, I have here on the emerging market a very positive development &#x2013; a positive view, India, China, Brazil all came out with very, very high figures on orders received and results also and that was maybe also for me a bit of a surprise to see also a very good development in North America, especially also U.S. Europe still remained soft.</p>
          <p>Mining activities that is I think also no surprise, but I know one of you continue to be very strong. And if you look sales of aftermarket product and services continue to increase, its always nice and if we then look to the operating profit where we came out with 17.2 coming from good and efficient working in the cost &#x2013; the cost side, the cost measures that we took last year, I think have yielded this result prices have kept up and we also are helped with a favorable mix and not so much punished by currencies. And last but not least, again a strong operating cash flow and I'm very pleased to see that.</p>
          <p>Now, I go to slide number four, figures in summary. Organic growth 22%, as we can only be happy on that front. So then the order to build increased of course due to that is now around 113. So that is good to see. I think the rest of the figures, I think you can read yourself, there is nothing more to say than you already know.</p>
          <p>I would like now to go to slide number six, which says orders received in local currency and we see the figures of course, we have <mark type="inaudible" /> not cleaned up with the cancellation. So what you see here is also compared with some cancellation fees in from last year. But, any how all figures look very solid and that's maybe an under statement, of course with the exception of Europe, which is a small plus seven, and if we would do reduction for cancellation it will be &#x2013; maybe close to flat. But, I think you see South America plus 60, Australia plus 76 so a very, very solid development.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to go to slide number seven. The Americas, yeah, you see here the &#x2013; very strong in all areas, mining equipment also the industrial part shows a good development and the aftermarket continues to improve and we see also an improvement on the construction equipment, which is maybe also a change compared to last quarter. What we cannot say here, we got <mark type="inaudible" /> so also that helped of course the figures and that integration went smooth and well.</p>
          <p>On South America, it continues to be a very strong and especially when you look to Brazil, which is going extremely well, we have not much negative effect on the earthquake in Chile that I think was not significant for us from a demand point of view.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight, Europe, Africa. Here Europe, it's bit of a mixed view you can say Germany, the Nordic countries are developing positively, there we see some more activity still a bit on the low level &#x2013; say a sequential improvement, but of course also on a lower level, but then when look to do the Southern part of Europe it is still very soft. Africa, Middle East here we have also an increase that &#x2013; you would say plus 16 is maybe a bit modest, if we compare with the other regions, but we should remember that also last year we have not such a drop in that region.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine, Asia, Australia &#x2013; look China, India they all came out very strong also the region Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, they did very well, where we see still a slow development is the South Korea and also Japan. And you see also that the relative amount of that regions become higher and higher, we already have 21% for that region now.</p>
          <p>And then of course, demand in Australia and the mining side is doing very well but I don't think for those who are following the mining industry it's no surprise. But, when I see, also I think on the Australian continent, you can say that they also see good development on construction equipment and I think also the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Then, I would like to go to slide number 10. After five quarters of negative development; finally we come back to positive. So, it is always nice when you see that, so it's 22% up.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11, sales bridge &#x2013; yeah, like I said 22% up for orders received, revenue minus four compared to last year, you could say, yeah, maybe disappointing, but on the other hand, I must say when I look to the development in the quarter, I was very pleased to see the output in March of the different factors and <mark type="inaudible" />. So I'm not worried about that we are coming up with more output.</p>
          <p>Then, I'm on slide number 13, when we talk ROCE, of course here we see gradual improvements as operating margins are improving and we continue work on our capital employed so that is where I put focus on it.</p>
          <p>Then, on slide number 14, the business areas and we start with Compressor Technique. I'm very pleased to see that this 10% organic growth that came from all areas, but Europe saw emerging markets and North America was very solid and it's also good to see after so many quarters of diminishing demand that also the portable compressor business comes up, but still at a lower level if you compare with the pricing figures.</p>
          <p>Aftermarket continues to do very well and so that is one of the cornerstones and operating margins 20.6. So these guys are back on pre-crisis profitability. So that's very good and it comes from good work on the cost side efficiency and the ones who are following this business area see also that with good design and development work but also the pricing <mark type="inaudible" /> and to pick myself with the Quincy acquisition is finalized with an exception of China where we expect that to close &#x2013; to be closed by end of May beginning of June.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to slide number 16, construction and mining. Extremely strong organic growth of 38% up. So all businesses in that business area went up but of course mining industry is down, but we saw some good sales development in the road construction equipment. So that was very nice to see that that market is also coming back and service and consumables are continuing to develop in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Operating margin 15.4 given the output level here. I think it's a good margin and again it is the same remark as I made for Compressor Technique, it's a positive mix prices are doing well and of course we get an improved utilizations in our operations, which of course helped the margin. There is some and we will elaborate a bit later on that one a bit negative effect on currency as you'll know that the Swedish krona has strengthened.</p>
          <p>Then, I would like to go to slide number 18, Industrial Technique an year also have a very strong demand &#x2013; good Asia and a very good North America. So they also come back to North Americas, we see some new orders from the MVI business of course it is a sequential improvement from a lower level, but I think its definitely good news and we see also a good aftermarket demand. And for those who remember last year and the difficult period we had in the business area, can see a 16.4% operating margin of course makes you happy for the future.</p>
          <p>Then, I would go to slide number 21, just a small overview about the different figures which you all already know by now. Operating cost is 17.2 compared to the 30.1, but we exclude one-time items we see a 14.5% compared and so a significant improvement even revenues are lower compared to last year. So I think, it's a very good result.</p>
          <p>Slide number 22, the profit bridges and here I think most of you have been already looking to that <mark type="inaudible" /> and the flow throughs. If we take the column of organic growth and price volume you see a negative on revenue because we have not the same volume as we had last year, but on the other hand positive effect on EBITDA and you can say &#x2013; summarize it comes from a positive mix and I think a very good cost efficiency or savings what we've done. So I think our break-even level is lower than last year.</p>
          <p>So that's good and then I think on the currency side, yeah, here the effect on the <mark type="inaudible" /> and in SEK because it is a beneficial &#x2013; the part comes from a beneficial euro and other mining currencies and what I mean, this is the real Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar and maybe the South African rand, which has strengthened even that the SEK has turned to the euro, but even this mining currencies has strengthened towards the Swedish krona. So and that was beneficial primarily for mining CMT business area.</p>
          <p>Then, that 23 is more of a different business area which you can look on that, the balance sheet &#x2013; what is primarily changed is mainly the &#x2013; yeah that we had the acquisition of Quincy, that means that the intangible asset has gone up by that and we paid that, so there was no problem. The rest on &#x2013; then the receivables, I think nothing to say more than it developed very well. I think capital structure that also I think has nothing changed compared to last time.</p>
          <p>26, the loan maturity profile, I think that keeps going on as we will see that for 2010 loan will be paid in May so that will disappear. Then we come to the cash flow. Again a very strong cash flow from operation and you see change in working capital even which succeeded to generate cash out of that so that was good to see of course I assume when the orders getting out and we get a higher receivables that that will change that may be the last time when we see this kind of quarter that is very strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>Then, I'm coming to slide 29, the last one and of course you have all read this already and what is our near term outlook. I think as it says there and given orders received we &#x2013; see now in quarter one, I think we expect that to improve somewhat from that level so that is &#x2013; I think the assumption and the <mark type="inaudible" /> we have now for the time being.</p>
          <p>So I can summarize that I think we are strong at the right places. So by this, I would like to hand over to Hans Ola for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Ronnie. And I turn now immediately to the operator and could you please repeat the procedures for the questions please and then we'll just get on with the Q&amp;A session right away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question comes from the line from Johan Eliason calling from Cheuvreux. Go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. This is Johan. Obviously, as you said the good orders in the mining comes as no big surprise. I remember in Q4, it was really the order intake in compressors that was a bit of a disappointment and especially oil and gas. So what are you seeing happening in this area and was that the big surprise derived from North America i.e., compressors overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To answer your question I think if we look <mark type="inaudible" /> this in a different way, but if you look to Compressor Technique and you exclude the GAAP basis as we call it internally. I think, we had a very good development overall, except of course Europe also in United States. When it comes to the gas and process business and it was not such a bad quarter. But, I believe we have reached more or less the bottom. So, quarter one was sequentially &#x2013; slightly better than quarter four, but not to say, okay this is bringing &#x2013; making Compressor Technique better. I think it was slightly better and while you see and read about the activities that is going on there, my assessment is that we have reached the bottom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just one question on your balance sheet, still have a lot of cash at hand, also after the Quincy acquisition and yes, now you have the dividend and that quick payments coming up. And are you seeing further acquisitions like Quincy in the pipeline or what's your ambition on the added <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good question and its definitely we are still working hard. So, we are in the hunting season. You remember our vision &#x2013; our strategy on that part is two-third coming from &#x2013; our results comes from organic and one-third from acquisition. And definitely we are mapping and seeing and talking to the world and see where we can make agreements from that side. And I love to add a couple of Quincy's add-on but of course this &#x2013; this takes a bit of time before all this is landing. But, I think definitely activity on that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line from Ben Maslen calling from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. This one is Ben from Merrill Lynch. Two questions please. First your mining, it's a very big sequential pick up. Could you say are there any large orders in that that maybe inflated the order in-take? And it's not the right kind of a run rate you expect in terms of orders to see MT going forward.</p>
          <p>And then just highlight, how quickly can you ramp the sales up to come more in line with the order level that's the first kind of question. And secondly, just on currency, the negative impact for the quarter year-on-year was a little bit less than you guided to Q4. Was that because you had some currency hedging gains in there or were just helped by the kind of currency moves that we saw later in the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The currency part I will hand over to Hans Ola. But, let me first answer your first question on that one. I think of course that in the mining business there is always some big orders in. But overall, I saw good activities in all divisions also in the &#x2013; on the construction side. So that where we saw a higher than expected sequential increase and to submit that, because there I also was wrong, when it came like I mentioned in the telephone here already before, it is in the latter part of the quarter where we saw that it became very, very solid.</p>
          <p>Now, when it comes to the sequential improvement for &#x2013; as we talked in quarter two, I think this is of course, you never know, but I expect us to stay that level more or less &#x2013; around that level, that is what I expect. Then when it comes to the output, the beginning of the year was not extremely strong on the output. That of course it comes also because the order increase came last year also at the end of the quarter and also we had New Year, so it took a bit of time for the supply chain was filled up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so again in the March output was at a good level. So I'm <mark type="inaudible" /> confident that we will increase the output in quarter 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, yeah currency then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that Ronnie actually gave most of the answers already in summary that we expected also to suffer, if I call it like that a little bit more from the strengthening of the kronor that we saw coming so to speak in the beginning of this year. But fortunately, we have this good mix of revenue currencies and cost currencies, if I call it like that, because you know that we don't only manufacture in Swedish krona. We manufacture even more in euro terms, if you &#x2013; if you call it like that and we purchase also a lot in euro. So it helped us to balance a little bit. One extra help in that, but that was of course not a surprise to us is that in Q1 in 2009, if you read the interim report from that time and also remember from the call at that time you can see that we had a negative effect in 2009 of corporate hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the dollar and the euro was strengthening to the krona and we actually lost a little bit of that upturn by hedging. Today, we have no such effect, but in the bridge how would we have done with the same exchange situation as last year it comes &#x2013; it makes the difference. So that's why we also had a little bit less perhaps of the profit bridge from currencies than what you were expecting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any maybe it's a follow-up on that Hans, I mean, if we stay at currency exchange rates, what would you expect for Q2 and the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, we know that if we look at today's trends, I mean, we don't know where the so called mining currencies go. But, we normally see that they correlate rather well with metal prices and then so on. So but, apart from that if everything is the same as today we had a &#x2013; how should I say, a more negative currency development in Q2 last year because we were already then starting to see this peak of the dollar residing a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So only with that change we would probably have a little bit even less negative effect in Q2 perhaps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's only towards the very end of 2010 that you will start to compare a positively perhaps to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line from James Moore from Redburn &amp; Partners (sic) Redburn Partners. Please go ahead your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. This is James at Redburn. I wonder, if I could understand your organic bridge, it looks like you did 3, 400 million better than you would in a normal incremental margin world. Some of that is obviously savings, it looks like there is some price of mix in there? And I'm also wondering whether some of which is the over production or over absorption of fixed costs. I wondered, if you could just walk through that and where we are on the incremental saving story. You said you were 2 billion at the third quarter and I'm looking at your head count and even ex-Qunicy that's going the other way now with the rehire. So I can't see you would be getting so much incremental savings. I'm trying &#x2013; I'm struggling really to see how you done such a good bridge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at it and I will start and then Ronnie can follow-up and add on a few comments perhaps. As you say it's not the normal situation that you have a negative revenue bridge and a positive profit bridge in the first place. But it of course relates to those things that you've mentioned yourself. We have, of course, taken out quite a lot of costs compared to Q1 last year. You referred to what we have already commented last year that two 2 plus billions Swedish krona we have mentioned that number on an annual rate and we should remember though that already in Q1 last year we had already started to get effect from the reduction of costs and reduction of workforce, et cetera. And now, as you say, we have slightly started to reemploy people, because we see that the load in the factories, et cetera, et cetera, is now coming back.</p>
          <p>So, but if you to that &#x2013; to those comments that we have probably quite a big part of those savings, if I call it, intact in Q1, but we have also had a positive mix effect in those numbers that helped it bridge a little bit further. And that positive mix is rather simple. It's just so that last year we invoiced more equipment sales compared to this quarter. So, we earned more money, of course, on the aftermarket and consumables part of the business in percentage terms than equipment. And that situation was favoring the aftermarket revenues in this quarter compared to Q1 last year.</p>
          <p>However, and I take the opportunity to look a little bit ahead, if you look at that mix in Q1 for orders received, it has already started to turn the other way. So compared to last year on that one, it's not a favorable situation, which means that we will, of course, have invoicing gradually more and more of equipment, now that as we go forward. So &#x2013; but it explains a little bit that not only the cost savings, but also this mix improvement compared to last year helped us in the profit this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think one other part maybe, Hans Ola, is also that our component factories are much better loaded and we know also that there the absorption that costs a lot of money when you don't have that right absorption. And if we compare with last year quarter and now, this component factories are better &#x2013; much better loaded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The core factories --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the core factories, and that of course there is a lot of better flow through in these.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow up on that with two follow-up points. Firstly, on the savings, would it be fair to say you had something like 300 in the first quarter last year, so we're talking incrementally a couple of 100 million there. And secondly, could you be clear as to whether your manufacturing production volume was greater than your invoicing volume in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think much more, because if you look to our inventory increase just a debt one that has stayed more or less at the same level, so I think what we had produced this quarter is more a less also what we have without debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on the others &#x2013; yeah, you want to give numbers of the cost. Let's put it this way that in a annual type of cost situation, I would estimate that we have between 1.5 and 2 billion of disadvantage, let's say, still intact, on an annual run rate basis, if that translates in to your 300 or something quarter, I don't know really, but that's how we see it, because we have started to add variable cost again as you say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It actually answers the questions. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from the lines of Fredric Stahl from UBS. Please go ahead, the line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. It's Stahl Fredric here at UBS. Could I ask you, when you see your orders in Asia and in Latin America at all time highs, do you get any indication from your people on the ground that we're overheating there? I have numerous examples of other areas in China and in Brazil where you would normally say this is gone to far. And I was just wondering what your view is on that. And then secondly, if you just could give me an idea when did you start talking to your suppliers about better demand on the mining side in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To answer that last one that's maybe the easiest one to answer, I think it was around October, November last year. We already start talking here in Sweden about a higher demand. So, that is at that time, so I think that especially when it comes to the underground equipment on that part. When it comes to, yeah, overheating of economies and Asia and South America where will it end to know that, yeah, it is a very difficult subject to answer that.</p>
          <p>If I listen to all the people that they see still good projects, I think it's a lot of small project, it's not the big one, because if I compare between the order spectrum from two years, say, pre-crisis and then we take China, we had a lot of big, big orders on that, and that is what we don't see. Of course, we still have significant orders, but not this big huge orders, which disturbed more or less the statistics. We get a lot of small orders; many, many, many small orders. So, there is a lot of activity going on also in the SME area and that makes me say, okay. That means there is an underlying demand. If it is overheating, yeah, I think that's okay. I actually don't know what opinion on that one. I think we &#x2013; the way I organize here is to be ready for the upturn and to make sure that if it happens that we also can break.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just a question on your mix for CMT, as we move along the year with the visibility in the backlog how would you say construction is going to evolve compared to mining? That's the first question &#x2013; especially regarding the regional equipment, not aftermarket. Then second question is regarding your investment plans, I guess that your CapEx for 2010 is going to be below 2009 levels, but do you see any upside risk maybe to second half of 2010 or any comments for your investment plans in 2011? And then last question on growth construction equipment activity in emerging markets, can you just specify which countries have been doing better, and in China have you seen any pricing pressures? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the mix, I see &#x2013; of course, the mining is maybe growing a bit faster than the construction part. So, if you see that that is what we have. So, we don't have the opposite. So, that it's one &#x2013; answer on one question. Then on the investment in the CapEx for 2010, I have not seen, I'm now looking to Hans Ola also to see if there is something, which I missed on big things, but we do not have any big manufacturing areas, which we go to build whatever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to follow up on that. It's exactly as I said and there not &#x2013; partly because of the timing factor, we don't expect 2010 to show anything else than lower numbers than 2009 in CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, that will be more or less something it will be not --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll follow the trend you've seen in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And if we do CapEx increase it primarily will be in Asia, that this way, it will be. And then when it comes to your question on the road construction, of course, it is India, China, that is really going strong. But we also saw that Australia was doing very well and we should not forget also Brazil was developing in that area. Is there price pressure, I think there's less price pressure than there was last year. So on that part, it is better, but we should not forget that China is a very competitive market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maybe a follow-up on your manufacturing unit that you're putting up in China by the end of a year, large China gas and process. Could you comment first on activity levels in terms of gas and process in China? And then secondly, whether the manufacturing unit is just inline with your expectations? And when do you expect to start to deliver product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when it comes to the manufacture unit, it will be inaugurated normally in November, end of the year. So that is what the plan is and I haven't heard any other news, so I will fly over there and, yeah, <mark type="inaudible" />, but we will get that. Of course it will be gradually start up, because you cannot expect spectacular things from that one. When it comes to the GAP business in China, there is some activity, but as already mentioned a bit in one of the previous questions we do not see this big 20, 30 million orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Euro order, yeah, euro, euro orders. We don't see that as many as we had seen that before. There are some hanging, but of course there are more competitors who are also working on that one. So, that demand &#x2013; that activity is less. But there is an underlying demand. It's not that the business is fully dead, so there is some activity on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as Ronnie has commented before that investment is really looking for the future, it is not sort of trying to maneuver in relation to what's the actual demand situation in China is right now. So, that's very --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and maybe in the euro.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line from Colin Gibson from HSBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Couple of quick questions please. In answer to a previous question you talked about the level of factory loading in Q1, I think you said production volume was around the same as invoicing, perhaps a little more in Q1. Does that mean restocking didn't happen at all in Q1 or that it just didn't get underway until March? Is it reasonable to expect the factory loading, therefore, might be better in Q2 than Q1? I think that seems to be something of the consensus from most machinery companies at the moment.</p>
          <p>Second question, just thinking about your comment about mix in compressor technique and also your comments in the report that demand for small compressor is currently better than demand for large compressors, how do you see the mix effect evolving as you go forward over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Colin, when it comes to the factory loads, of course, if we get, like I said, if our output put is in balance or our activity is in balance with our output and our output should go up in &#x2013; sequentially in quarter two, of course we will get a better load. I think that is my assessment on that. And I see that factories in under layers have already commented that they are recruiting people to get higher output on that one. So, that is what I should expect. Of course, I don't hope this is at least what we don't plan for is that we put it all in inventory. It's actually that we should get it on invoicing level. And that is the at least the &#x2013; the gospel I am spreading in that part.</p>
          <p>Then when it comes to the mix, yeah, you read the document very well. I think what we see is that the improvement, the business sequential improvement in the CT business is better in the smaller compressors than in the big one. So, the bigger gas and process compressor, the bigger oil-free compressors as we have not seen in quarter one the same increase as we have seen for the smaller compressors and then for the portable compressors. What does that mean in profitability and mix it will not make a big difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. And so just a quick follow-up. Just going back to the question of loading and where we are in the restocking cycle, the movement in working capital is really surprisingly small in &#x2013; I thought in Q1. Is there a currency effect working there and should we expect a bigger movement or bigger reinvestment at all in working capital in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe, Hans Ola --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There is a bit of &#x2013; in the numbers that you can see, there is a bit of a translation effect that we carry, of course. A part of this inventory is carried in euro and there when we report in Swedish krona you get the lower number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But when you look &#x2013; on the other hand, if you look in our cash flow, it is actually adjusted for these translation effects, both on the inventory receivables and operating supplier debt, if I call it like that. So, the &#x2013; and that number is still a reduction in total working capital. So you &#x2013; yeah, we expect the same trend as you are seeing as well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Yes. Thank you. Mats Liss, Swedbank. Just a couple of questions regarding CMT. I guess, very strong orders there, of course, but investment plans in from the customer &#x2013; your mining customers have been revised gradually, and I guess my question is more related to, if you have seen the full impact of that or if this is more related to wear and tear in the aftermarket and the replacement of certain machines and yet there is more to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that the question? It's a rhetorical question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what &#x2013; have we, if I try to understand a bit your question --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I guess the question is more related to there is a time lag between when my &#x2013; when you play on the new mine and you get the &#x2013; you try to get the suppliers to make an offer--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I see a significant improvement, because otherwise we will not be able to &#x2013; of course to publish these figures in demand for the mining equipment. So, I assume that there is already part what we get this is real investment, as we get that. But as we've seen everything, I don't know. Of course I also read and then see and talk to these people and then you see that the commodity prices are extremely high, the demand is still there. You see these guys having profitability published, which, of course &#x2013; yeah, there is a more and more investments going on, so I think only the outlook looks &#x2013; on that part, looks positive. That's the only thing what I look and I see a good development also in the aftermarket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when we refer to orders I don't think &#x2013; I understand where you are coming from, Mats, but I don't think that the mining companies that are actually even just started to plan expansion will wait to put the orders too long, if you see what I mean. So that placing orders, I'm sure, has already both an impact on &#x2013; from what is more wear and tear type of investments on new rigs, but also to investment for expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you already have the portion of both already in the numbers today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And &#x2013; it is there. I mean, do you see an indication that they are placing multiple orders or something like that just to secure deliveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And that is because I was just planning to say that and that is also one of the question I put forward to the guys, it is really again, will the history repeats themselves like we had in 2007 as everybody was putting forward, let's say, "fake orders". We got a couple of big orders, but these were really a real project, which I think will be realized this year and beginning of the next year. So, I think it's more tangible activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then maybe &#x2013; and are there report, within construction you have a certain amount of seasonality, I guess, and if you say a normal seasonality, perhaps <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the construction thing is but because also you see we are a global company and we are reasonable equally spread over the globe. And I don't know if they have the same seasonality in China or India as they have in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that is also &#x2013; we have the same dilemma on that one. But when I look to construction, I'm not so impressed of the sequential improvement that I have seen in Europe. There is some improvement, but it's not that &#x2013; definitely on the lower level, where we see a good development on Brazil, India and China. And to put the question again back to you, you will say what seasonality do we have there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. And then just trying to one short one on the outlook, do you relate to the March level or the average of the quarter when you say you will improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to the average of the quarter.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question would be on the lead times in the orders for the industrial technique and compressors. You mentioned about the CMT part. Second question relates to the &#x2013; sorry, the positive mix effect in the quarter, not only from aftermarket versus new equipment, but also looking into new products and subsegments within the division. Is that possible to quantify that to get a sense of what headwind we actually saw in the first quarter and what could possibly the sort of reverted as we go along? And then just finally to Hans Ola, could you give us any guidance on the financial net you mentioned that you will pay off debts in May and the financial net was bit a low in the quarter and the elimination of 153 million in the quarter, would you say that that is abnormally high number or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, Hans Ola, you can say start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll just start with, so what you called elimination, I think, is mostly all types of corporate non-business area, costs also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's a mix of various things, as you say. No, I think that there are always some elements of negative in one quarter or a bit specific positive in one quarter, but somewhere in that region of 125 to 150 million is probably what would be a normal run rate, I would say. And on that part which we call the corporate cost and elimination. When it comes to financial net, yes, we are paying off a loan and so on. And we have the couple of negative valuation effect in this quarter. So, it's likely that we will continue to go down, remember that even if we pay off 2 billion in a loan, if that we pay variable interest rates that are very low, so the impact is not huge on that. Then we have the dividend payout, which will affect two months out of three. So, we &#x2013; again it's not affecting tremendously, but slightly lower negative than what we had in Q1 is, perhaps, the best guess.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then I think when it comes to the lead time, I mean in industrial technique and CT, I think I &#x2013; and industrial technique, I think when it comes to that lead time that is more or less couple of week. So, they are really in balance toward SE, toward invoice. But when it comes to CT, it takes a bit more time the bigger the machine and that you know very well so and that we see a bit. It's a reasonable satisfaction. We do not have a big inflation yet, let's see, on that part of the lead times, of course, as long as the big units and gap is not increasing, because they are really the long lead-time items.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. When it comes on the mix effect, of course, what &#x2013; it is &#x2013; I think what will happen if today the aftermarket and equipment, which is when it comes on the invoicing level, I think we see a significant higher proportion of aftermarket and that, of course, gradually will &#x2013; would change because we have a higher orders received on equipment. So gradually over the next quarters we will start talking the opposite, that you will see that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Yeah. But you have a share there, take compressors as an example, are we talking about aftermarket now being, say, 50 in compressors? Is it that time?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions regarding the first incoming steel prices. When do you think this will hit you and have you thought about or how have you planned for compensating for this, even though you buy mostly components you are still having some steel in most of your products? And also looking at the CMT order intake that was quite good and you expect then this run rate to continue, what about sort of &#x2013; if you can call the installed capacity to take on orders, in your case it's mostly then assembly, but how much could you, in theory, deliver at this point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When it comes to the steel prices and order commodities, of course, they go up and, of course, also that is &#x2013; but we also read and expect that our suppliers will come and have a talk on that front. Of course, when it comes to a component order machine, it is more than steel. It is a lot of added value, it's a lot of reengineering, and of course on one hand we will have material price increases, but on the other hand, we will have by engineering work, by new designs, we will have cost reductions. And this &#x2013; that is the way we manage, that's one area and that's maybe the defensive area. But on the second, of course, when commodity prices go up, the good thing on commodity prices is to hold competitive defense.</p>
          <p>So, on that one the competitive horizon is not going to change and prices &#x2013; still the prices will go up. And that is something, which will then eventually be put into the market and held by new designs, new innovative compressors, drill rigs and other tools. This is the way we have to do the work, and that is we have done in the past and I don't see any reason for the time being what that will not be the same in the future.</p>
          <p>When it comes to installed capacity, CMT, yes, I think that is something also what is on my agenda. Of course, a lot of activities had been already done. I think we have &#x2013; when during the period 2008, although we have closed a lot of factories, we have closed &#x2013; we have closed the right ones. And we have definitely not produced the installed capacity. I think we have introduced installed cost, if I can say that. And on other hand, of course, in this CMT area, I think, we also have a lot of partners where we can work together and where we are talking with to do some assembly work outsourcing and other activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And exactly in the same way we did in 2007 and 2008, of course, but what Ronnie says is, of course, then one should remember another comment Ronnie made a few minutes ago on that, of course, in the supply chain there is a certain, how should I say, inertia and it takes some time until all of the suppliers are ready to deliver as quickly as we would like and so on. But on the other hand, I mean that is the benefit when you have the swings up and down, when the market fell, it helped us to have that outsourcing model to a large extent. And now, of course, we have to be a little bit patient, but we cannot affect everything by our own installed capacity, because as Ronnie said, there we don't have any fears that we are lacking anything, so to speak. But we need the whole system to work on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think what is still good and that is where we have still installed capacity is on our core component, which is where we do not have an order exit, then to do it ourselves. And there we still have a good overcapacity.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We're hearing that &#x2013; hearing there that component &#x2013; electric components is an issue some companies, not necessarily engineering companies, but how equipped are your sub-suppliers to cope with such a again booming mining market as it came quite rapidly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we will see that also and that is also I think good supply management, which we also have done during the downturn, where we have to see, okay, which suppliers can we keep going on and keep in business, which we &#x2013; I think we have done very well. I think when it comes to smaller component and smaller supplies, we see some stress. But there I think, as a company as from our side, I think we need to make sure that we also have some backup systems on that front. But when it comes to engines, combustion engines like a Caterpillar and then electrical Siemens ABB that's not an issues and that's one of most of the time a bottleneck item, but that's not yet. So, that's not an issue.</p>

And I'm sure there might be more questions waiting, but I do as we always say, we are very happy to receive those questions after the call. You know how to reach Mattias Olsson or Camilla Gustavsson at IR department and myself, if I am available. And I thank you all for participating and hope to speak to you soon again. Thank you.</p>
