          <p>Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to host Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gwen. So, welcome to LyondellBasell's third quarter 2012 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning &amp; Transactions.</p>
          <p>Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. And for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/InvestorRelations.</p>
          <p>And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with any other applicable disclosures including the earnings release are currently available on the website at lyondellbasell.com.</p>
          <p>Now finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 26 by calling 800- 839-5569 in the United States and 402-998-1150 outside the United States and the pass code for both numbers is 9511. During today's call, we'll focus on the third quarter of 2012 performance, the current environment, and the near-term outlook.</p>
          <p>With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call and are available on our website. Let's begin by taking a look at page 4 and reviewing a few financial highlights.</p>
          <p>Income from continuing operations was $851 million and EBITDA was $1.57 billion. The quarter included some items that are not reflective of the underlying business and exclusive of these, income from continuing operations was $791 million. Our earnings per share were $1.47 or $1.36 exclusive of the items that I referenced.</p>
          <p>I also want to highlight that we announced both a $2.75 per share special dividend as well as our regular $0.40 per share interim dividend. Overall, it was another very good quarter.</p>
          <p>The fundamentals that have benefited us over the past couple of years continued to drive our success. Key areas of strength were North American ethylene margins and production above our nameplate capacity as well as record profitability for the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Karyn and I will delve into more details during the call.</p>
          <p>But before doing that, I want to highlight another bright spot, our safety performance. On slide number 5, you can see that our safety performance continues to be excellent reflecting our focus on the details of our operations. I believe that our safety record is very near the best in class with the current recordable incident rate of 0.26.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss some key elements of our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Please turn to slide 6 which shows our first quarter and last 12 months segment EBITDA. The $1.57 billion of EBITDA reflects a $209 million decrease from the second quarter, the majority of which occurred in our European olefins operations. Year-to-date we have generated approximately $4.6 billion of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>From a segment perspective during the third quarter, O&amp;P Americas continued to generate very strong results with EBITDA of $820 million. As Jim mentioned, this excellent performance was driven by continued strong ethylene margins and operations. However versus the second quarter, underlying business results declined primarily due to lower ethylene and ethylene co-product prices. O&amp;P EAI produced $75 million of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Results from the European olefins and commodity polyolefins were approximately breakeven, reflecting poor economic and industry conditions. The segment EBITDA was generated from the differentiated polyolefin products.</p>
          <p>The Intermediates and Derivatives segment generated record EBITDA of $475 million. The chemical products results were relatively unchanged representing approximately 55% to 60% of the segment EBITDA. Oxyfuel results increased significantly benefiting from the strength in gasoline prices and octane value versus feedstock costs.</p>
          <p>The Refinery segment generated $150 million of EBITDA. Underlying results benefited from strengthened margins as the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark spread increased to $26.65 per barrel. However byproduct values remained weak and operating constraints reduced crude throughput to approximately 240,000 barrels per day. The Technology segment performance remained steady with EBITDA of $48 million.</p>
          <p>The bar chart on the right depicts the last 12 months EBITDA by segment. Over the period, total EBITDA was approximately $5.3 billion. Approximately 50% was generated from O&amp;P Americas while the intermediate and derivative segment generated $1.58 billion or approximately 30%. As you can see from the relative heights of the bars, the trends over the past quarter are relatively consistent with the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide number 7 and take a look at the key elements of our strong cash flow. During the third quarter, cash balances increased by approximately $1.6 billion closing the quarter over $3.5 billion. As you can on the chart, in addition to the cash generated from our earnings, the quarter benefited from a decline in inventories. As you might recall, we mentioned this inventory reduction during the second quarter earnings release call.</p>
          <p>On the right side of the chart, you can see that over the last 12 months, our cash balance has declined from $5.9 billion to $3.5 billion. Operations, including working capital, generated over $3.5 billion of cash while uses included approximately $1 billion for CapEx, $1.5 billion of debt repayment and $3.3 billion in dividends.</p>
          <p>Last quarter, I provided guidance regarding our capital spending and interest expense. Our capital spending outlook for the year remains unchanged at approximately $1.2 billion. You should expect that this will increase to approximately $1.5 billion next year and into 2014. In terms of interest payments, we are now running at a quarterly pace of approximately $65 million.</p>
          <p>You probably noted that our third quarter tax rate increased by approximately 3% versus the first half of the year rate. The increase results from the strength of the U.S. business profitability relative to the rest of the world. Versus the first half of the year, the higher tax rate impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.07 per share.</p>
          <p>On slide 8, we have included our working capital chart and a few key statistics. I won't go through each item, but I do want to highlight our free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have generated $2.8 billion. This enables us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. Inclusive of the dividends announced today our 2012 dividend payments are anticipated to be $4.20 per share approximately $2.4 billion resulting in a dividend yield of almost 8% at the current stock price.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, we currently expect that for U.S. taxpayers at least two-thirds of our anticipated 2012 dividend payments will qualify for dividend treatment under the IRS criteria. The balance would be treated as return of capital. Of course, this is subject to change and refinement, we felt that we should provide some early guidance to assist your year-end tax planning.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance beginning on slide number 9 with Olefins &amp; Polyolefins Americas. Third quarter EBITDA was $820 million, an increase of $44 million versus the second quarter. However, these results include a lower cost of market inventory credit, while the second quarter included a charge and an insurance settlement.</p>
          <p>Exclusive of these items, underlying EBITDA declined by $69 million versus the second quarter. Underlying olefins EBITDA declined by approximately $45 million from the second quarter. Ethylene production volumes increased significantly as there were no turnaround activity. Our plants ran very well exceeding design rates. Margins declined both to the lower prices and increased costs of ethylene production. On average, ethylene price declined by approximately $0.025 per pound versus the second quarter 2012. However, the price decline was reversed earlier in the third quarter as gradual price increases were realized throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our cost of ethylene production increased, but the increase was generally limited to naphtha cracking, as coke product prices declined. Gulf Coast ethane prices declined by approximately $0.08 per gallon while Midwest ethane increased by $0.03 per gallon.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, 85% of our ethylene was produced from natural gas liquids with ethane accounting for approximately 65% of the ethylene production. Propane accounted for approximately 18%. Polyolefin results declined by approximately $25 million versus the second quarter. Sales volumes of both polyethylene and polypropylene increased. Polyethylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, while polypropylene spreads were relatively unchanged. Overall it was another very good quarter for this segment.</p>
          <p>As we look to the fourth quarter, thus far the underlying fundamentals that have benefited us remain intact. Ethane and propane prices have remained low and olefins production has been strong. However, it is typical to experience some moderate slowdown as we approach the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Let's shift our focus to slide number 10 and the Olefins &amp; Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $75 million, a $260 million decline from the second quarter, which benefited from falling naphtha prices.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, our differentiated products such as polypropylene compounds and Catalloy resins continued to perform well, generating results consistent with prior quarters. We did not receive any dividends from our joint ventures, but they generated equity income generally consistent with the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Within Europe, underlying business conditions were weak. Olefins and commodity polyolefin margins were near breakeven throughout the quarter. Our olefin production volumes declined due to a turnaround at our largest European cracker. Our polyolefin sales volume exceeded weak second quarter sales by approximately 17%. Despite the volume increase, combined polyolefin results only improved by approximately $10 million. Polypropylene compound and polybutene-1 results improved by approximately $20 million, as volumes remained steady and margins increased slightly.</p>
          <p>During October, the environment for European olefins and polyolefins had remained difficult. Our ethylene plant turnaround has continued into October as planned, but we anticipate that the impact on our financials will be minor. Although we expect continued good performance from our differentiated products, a seasonal slowdown is typical.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to slide number 11 for a discussion of the Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segment, which had record EBITDA of $475 million. EBITDA exceeded the second quarter by $20 million. Underlying improvement was actually stronger as the second quarter included an insurance settlement and JV dividends which totaled $32 million.</p>
          <p>Within the segment, underlying results for the propylene oxide and derivative products as well as the intermediate chemicals were relatively unchanged. Propylene oxide and derivative volumes increased slightly while prices declined. The other chemical products generally followed a similar trend. Oxyfuels EBITDA increased by approximately $60 million as it benefited from both increased margins and volumes. The chart on the lower right provides a perspective on industry margins. Our results have generally followed this trend.</p>
          <p>We typically expect a slight fourth quarter slowdown of the chemical products within the I&amp;D segment. We expect oxyfuel results to decline more, both due to seasonally lower margins and the impact of a turnaround of one of our U.S. PO/TBA plants.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide number 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $150 million, a decline of $11 million versus the second quarter. Exclusive of second quarter insurance settlement and third quarter legal restitution related to a former employee's fraudulent activities, underlying refining results improved by approximately $20 million.</p>
          <p>Throughput at the refinery was approximately 240,000 barrels per day, as we experienced some operating issues in our gas plant and coking process. These were addressed during the quarter but resulted in lower throughput.</p>
          <p>The industry benchmark Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by approximately $3.50 per barrel to average $26.65 per barrel. Our spreads generally followed this trend. The refinery continued to realize a lower than historic yield on the benchmark as the value of byproducts such as petroleum coke and various natural gas based products remained depressed. We estimate that this impacted our margin by approximately $2 to $3 per barrel versus historic trends.</p>
          <p>Looking to the fourth quarter, our operating issues have been addressed and we expect to run the refinery at full rates. Industry benchmark margins typically decline by several dollars during the fourth quarter. Early this week, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged approximately $21 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Let's step back from the details and summarize the business environment on slide number 13. Third quarter results were strong and the factors that have shaped our results remain largely unchanged. The U.S. olefin business continued to benefit from shale gas opportunities and our plants operated very well.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the weak economy and high cost of ethylene production resulted in near breakeven EBITDA, but the differentiated products within O&amp;P-EAI generated good results. Intermediates and Derivatives had record profits from steady chemical results coupled with record oxyfuel EBITDA. Refining crack spreads were good, but low byproduct prices depressed our realized margins. We also encountered some operating problems which reduced throughput at the Houston refinery.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter has started with similar drivers across most business areas. However, as I mentioned, we typically expect some slowing during the fourth quarter. Thus far, we have not seen significant slowing and we don't expect to experience a decline as severe as we saw last December.</p>
          <p>Before we take your questions, I want to address a few other points beginning with our growth programs. First, the announced projects remain on schedule. And although we have not yet received our environmental permits, the process is proceeding as planned.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to introduce the next projects that we are developing. The first project is the Channelview ethylene expansion. Engineering has progressed and we have applied for the required environmental permits. The project is expected to have excellent economics similar to the La Porte expansion. Details are being finalized but we expect to add another 250 million pounds of capacity during 2015. We're also developing a plan for a Corpus Christi expansion. It is premature to discuss this project other than to say that it is larger than the Channelview expansion and looks very promising.</p>
          <p>I also want to shed some additional light on the $2.75 per share special dividend that we announced this morning. Over the past several months, Karyn, the board and I have been defining this payment and our future plans. The philosophy that we have discussed with you on many occasions has not changed. This special dividend supports our commitment to return value to our shareholders. Assuming that our results remain strong and we are fully funding our growth plans, we intend return cash to shareholders in a periodic fashion perhaps in varied amounts and more frequent intervals.</p>
          <p>2We will also consider share repurchases as appropriate. Management will continuously assess our situation and pursue specific actions within the framework of this philosophy. At this time I won't delve into specifics but I hope this helps clarify our intentions.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to discuss MLPs and our current thoughts. First, it is our responsibility to consider the risk and rewards around any opportunity to increase shareholder value. This is no exception. We have done some work around the MLP concept but it is preliminary. There are many complexities considered in this area, so we'll take some time to develop a firm opinion as to whether this opportunity can be executed by us to the benefit of shareholders.</p>
          <p>Those of you who have come to know our new company appreciate that our style is not to lightly make projections and commitments. Rather, we prefer to bring forward our plans and actions when they are concrete and we are convinced that we can be successful. We will follow the same course here in considering the merits of an MLP structure for certain assets. We will be thoughtful in our deliberations and bring forward a plan at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p>We're now pleased to take questions, Gwen.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you &#x2013; hi, good morning. Can you talk about your beliefs concerning the European olefin and polyolefin capacity over the four or five years? That is, do you think that capacity will be similar to where we are now? Do you think there will be material rationalizations or something in the middle or you can't tell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, I think there will be some rationalization. As you know, we've shut down some capacity that was fairly expensive a couple of years ago and continue to monitor our assets. I think there will be some industry capacity rationalization but I don't think it will be anything extreme. I think that's been the history of Europe. At this point in time, margins are basically breakeven. There's obviously some pain in the industry but everybody is working hard to reduce their costs and try to address issues that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally, when you chose your $2.75 special dividend, why didn't you choose $3.75 or $1.75? Why was $2.75 the appropriate number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at our balance sheet, we've tried to be very conservative. It's fairly difficult economic environment. We want to be a bit cautious. But as we said, we will also look at perhaps more frequent and smaller special dividends as we go forward, also look at share repurchases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar, Citi. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Jim, you mentioned that &#x2013; you mentioned your round two of the debottlenecking and I was surprised to see that Midwest crackers were not included in that. So just can you comment about that? And then this cracker advantage in the Midwest, once the pipelines get built from Conway to Mont Belvieu, you think that advantage could potentially go down next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., first on the Middle East cracker expansion, we don't have the same opportunities to expand there that we do here. The first question that always has to be asked is there additional ethane feedstock available and at this point in time, that doesn't exist. If it did, we'd be very happy to expand those crackers, but it simply doesn't exist this moment in time at the kind of pricing that was previously available.</p>
          <p>In terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., I just want to clarify for you because I think we had a little trouble hearing you. Were you asking about our Middle East crackers or our Midwest U.S. crackers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Midwest crackers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I misunderstood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Midwest crackers, we've got slight debottlenecking that happened after our turnarounds. There is still a pretty significant ethane advantage, but we've already seen that erode a bit with pipeline takeaway capacity. I think it's about where it's going to be for a while. I don't think it will deteriorate too much more over the near term. And there will always be a transportation benefit to those crackers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in your Oxyfuels business and MTBE you're seeing some good spreads which is really a spread between oil and natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Do you think that's sustainable given the advantage here in the U.S. and that business could contribute at current levels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as long as gasoline prices are high and the feedstock costs are low, we'll see very significant margins. That's been the case of our year-to-date. We've also been able to move more capacity, more volume and so that's been a benefit. These commodity prices generally should be favorable going forward because of cheaper natural gas prices, so we're optimistic that oxyfuels will be a good business for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., one thing &#x2013; and you can see it on the chart. You do have to consider in the very near term seasonality of course. And that has always been there in that business because the raw materials see some seasonality.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yes good morning. Jim, I just wanted to follow up on your comments regarding exploration of an MLP structure. I appreciate you're working on it. It must be a very complex endeavor given your level of integration but I'm just wondering if you've reached any preliminary conclusions as to whether it would make sense for any of Lyondell's existing assets or would the scope be principally some of the new projects resident in your pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin, that could be either new or existing projects. We have to look at things like where we are in our tax basis, the variety of different things. You could always consider unique assets to put into an MLP. We have looked at that somewhat before but as you know, there's a new ruling and we're going to take a much harder look at things going forward. More analysis to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And on polyethylene resin in the United States, would you comment on what you're seeing in terms of demand trends, kind of in the wake of Hurricane Isaac dovetailing into your order book for October? What does that look like and do you think it might be strong enough to get polyethylene resin prices higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point in time, inventories in the chain are reasonably low. That's particularly true with polypropylene and somewhat true of polyethylene. Days on hand are fairly low. Whenever you have a weather event, that can change things a bit but the most important thing we watch is which we way our price is going. If the customers think prices are going up, they try to build a little bit of inventory and if it's going down, of course, they're holding off their sales until the &#x2013; their buying patterns until a little bit later. I don't know that that storm will have a significant impact on things. It should be fairly modest. Obviously, there's a fair amount of processing up in the northeast but we'll just see where that goes.</p>
          <p>I think so far, polymer demand has been pretty good and we've been able to move all the product we need to move. One of the other unique things that's helped our profitability if we look at our olefins chain, as I mentioned, we ran extremely well this last quarter and continue to do so into this quarter. We find it sometimes better to sell spot ethylene than to make polyethylene out of it. And so when we've had those opportunities when our competitors are having operating issues, we're very happy to go into the spot ethylene market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the last question if I may, I think you set an objective to extract $200 million of run rate savings out of your European operations by year end. How much of that has been accomplished and how much is still to come here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working on that very, very hard, and we've had a lot of success. That number is going to increase. When it comes to cost, I'd like to make a very important point. In our company, we generally don't do big cost adjustments at some point in time and announce it in the quarter. I like to tell our leaders within LyondellBasell start on January 1. And we get to the budget season, you need to present a package that shows flat to falling costs. That's a hallmark of how we operate our business, you'll see that we honor that in the way we do our business day in and day out.</p>
          <p>We're in discussions with works councils on various matters within Europe, and there will be more to come on that but we recognize the economic difficulties within Europe and we're a company that addresses those kind of issues. So you'll see a bit more activity in Europe than in other places, but we manage costs everywhere starting January 1 of every year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, you're expanding, obviously, La Porte, Channelview and Corpus Christi, but you've yet to announce a greenfield cracker. Where does that thought process stand either by yourself, or a potential JV partner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've had significant interest in a variety of parties participating in an asset like that. Obviously, these debottlenecks have really favorable economics and if we can bring those up in 2014 and 2015, we'll be well in advanced of the big capacity waves.</p>
          <p>I think you've seen, David, that some of the competitors have said now that their schedules are slipping from 2017 into later years. I personally think you're going to see more of that. We continue to discuss a condo cracker but our focus in the near term has been getting this other incremental capacity on line because the as installed cost is a fraction of the new build. A lot of people quoting $0.75, $0.80-plus for new build and our expansions are typically in $0.50 per annual pound range, perhaps a little bit lesser than that.</p>
          <p>So the economics are just very compelling for the debottlenecks and as we work the numbers, as you can probably start to add some of the capacities up or in essence getting in pretty close to putting in a cracker together.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Dutch law changes on January 1 as it impacts LyondellBasell and its dividend paying history so that would be the possibility. But as I said, we'll look at multiple ways to return value to our shareholders. I think the key takeaway is we'll look at that more frequent and perhaps smaller and see where that takes us. But I think that's a prudent thing to do in light of economic uncertainties. And we like a strong balance sheet, but we have shown very clearly that we will return value to our shareholders.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer, Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. When we've listened to a couple of calls so far this quarter, a couple of your competitors look like they're in the mode of ratcheting back a little bit on CapEx. And so I'm just wondering when you look through the $1.4 billion that you talked about last December, are there projects in there that because of where the global economics are today, might get pushed out or how do you stand on what you guys announced last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Duffy, we have a very disciplined capital program. The projects that we're implementing have very strong returns. And at this point, we don't see ratcheting back any of those. As we've gone through budgeting processes this year, we've look at how much we spend on basic maintenance. We're trying to get more value for the dollars we spend and have a great deal of emphasis on that. Kevin Brown is in charge of project execution these days and we're doing a very nice job on all of that.</p>
          <p>Now there's potentially one exception that was the Flex project and expansion there. At this point in time, that doesn't look as good as it did in the past but instead of that what we're looking at is expansions, debottlenecks at both Corpus and at Channelview and those are actually stronger projects so we're feeling pretty good about our capital program, the rate we're spending. It's very, very disciplined compared to the cash of that we generating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then of those projects some of the larger discrete ones we can monitor the methanol restart, the PO JV but of the smaller ones, how much of that should we think about actually comes online next year and starts contributing kind of that call it 50% ROIC payback or yield I guess when we think about the investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we talked about methanol next year but when we looked at La Porte, that was 2014 and these other ones look like 2015 when they start up, so you probably noticed in our ethane usage that we're up. We've got the debottleneck work done at Channelview where that was going to happen. We've done some other work in our other facilities. And so, you're already seeing some benefit from that. Crackers are running very well. They're running very hard and we're using more cheap natural gas liquid feedstocks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Duffy, you may have been referring to the spending on the small higher return projects. We really started those in 2011 and they typically got kind of a two to three years sort of payback. So we're just partway through it. You'll start to see those programs really next year and forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jim, I had two questions on ethane. One is near term. In the U.S., you had correctly called for growing ethane surplus. We've seen ethane's fuel value premium come down significantly. Do you think we've reached the bottom there in terms of where ethane will trade relative to its fuel value, so it will just cycle up and down with gas now? And the related ethane question would be, we saw INEOS arrange a deal to potentially take ethane over to Europe. Do you think that there are other opportunities to do that, and how would Lyondell's European assets be positioned to take advantage of any ethane exports from the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, first on the question of ethane pricing in general, obviously, last year in December, we saw a real spike in ethane, $0.90-plus a gallon. I commented earlier that we don't that's going to happen again. Things seemed to be long. We expect ethane to stay reasonably cheap for the foreseeable future. Could it go lower than it is today? It has been lower, and so I certainly think that's possible. You get into the question of rejection economics and I know you're quite sophisticated based on reading some of your writing on that. There is always that question how much they want to reject and how long ethane is, but things are pretty favored right now for us, and ethane prices remain pretty cheap.</p>
          <p>In terms of the ability to export ethane, I really think that's going to be pretty limited. That's an expensive route; you have to have some facilities to do that. I think the volumes will be pretty small. One of the things that drove the Middle East ethane advantage was the high cost occurring to export that particular NGL cut. And so I think those same dynamics will remain true in the United States, and the ethane advantage will be something of a U.S. advantage and it's not something we're looking at any kind of size or scope over in Europe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to revisit the dividend, special dividend discussion. I was just trying to get some guidance as to how we should think about some sort of a maybe minimum dividend payout ratio. What are your thoughts about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've tried very hard not to be specific, Hassan. I think the reason is because we're always watching the economic environment, sources and uses of cash. I think the thing that should give you comfort is that as you looked at what we did last year, late last year and here in this third quarter announcement, we're returning significant cash to our shareholders. It's basically an 8% dividend yield and 80% of our free cash flow. So we think we're doing a pretty good job of returning cash to our shareholders. And as I mentioned, we'll look at perhaps more frequent and smaller in size.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Now on a slightly different topic, again, the ethane side and natural gas prices in particular, I was talking to one of the large methanol producers yesterday within North America. And what they're talking about is as they consider new capacity possibly trying to structure long-term contracts with gas processors and the like. And one of the things they've been talking about is trying to structure a contract which is beneficial to both parties where they indulge in some sort of margin sharing agreement with these gas processors. So what are your thoughts about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very dynamic market at this point in time. We're excited to bring up a methanol plant next year that has been shut down for awhile because it will have a nice impact on our earnings. As you can imagine, restarting an idle plant with this kind of cheap natural gas price is a wonderful thing for us. So we're happy to bring it on.</p>
          <p>We're looking at how we market our methanol. But generally those market sharing agreements aren't something that we, as a company, favor. I can't get into the details of exactly how we're going to move that product, but we have a very definitive plan in place already and expect to be able to move the volumes fairly nicely once that plant starts up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. But I guess what I was trying to get at was that as you also are considering some of your ethylene expansions, are you having conversations with the gas processors and the gas companies about structuring some sort of long-term pricing regimens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, generally we're not. We generally float with the market on that, and we think ethane is going to be quite long and we like the pricing dynamics. I think a few companies started to do some of that and got caught a little on the high side where they thought that the prices are going to be, so we'll watch the market. Now, if things look like they're going to change significantly, we may change our mind on that. But at this point in time, we're following the pricing curves as to how ethane moves. Frankly, I think we've been pretty much right on that so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, could you dimensionalize for us? You're on round two now of brownfield CapEx. And can you just help us understand? Some of it is obvious but some of it might be a little more nuanced, why certain projects are in round two versus round one. And should we expect lower returns with round two versus round one? And is there a round three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Vincent, I think in round one, we were doing fairly small projects that had very high returns, very short payout. I think Doug mentioned that a few minutes ago. That was in part because we were emerging from bankruptcy, had to get our operations cleaned up, work on our cost structure. And so we were trying to improve our balance sheet, and so we tried to have a great deal of discipline around our capital.</p>
          <p>I used the word chapters instead of rounds. But in chapter two, we started to expand and we've talked about debottleneck projects that have very robust economics. We announced La Porte. We talked about the methanol restart. We've now talked about a couple other expansions at existing crackers. Those have extremely robust economics too. If you think about where olefin margins are today and you start thinking about capital in the $0.45 &#x2013; $0.50 an annual pound range, those are very, very nice economics.</p>
          <p>So we're in that chapter today where we're doing those expansions and improving our execution ability. As Karyn mentioned, we're talking about a capital budget in the $1.5 billion range next year because of those additions of things.</p>
          <p>Longer term, we'll look at additional growth projects. But as we said, one might be a condo cracker but we continue to assess that based on seeing what our competition is doing. Our strategy has been to beat them to the marketplace, get the capacity up earlier, get it up cheaper, and make money in the interim; more to come on future CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe secondly, just obviously the operating rate over 100% nameplate in the quarter is impressive. Can you just dimensionalize it for us, how much does that help you relative if you're just running sort of at a very strong 90%-ish rate and how sustainable do you think this level is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vince, this is Doug. We produced about 2.4 billion pounds &#x2013; a little over 2.4 billion pounds in the quarter. So if you &#x2013; that's basically our full nameplate capacity. So if you look at them, you take each percent is worth another 24 billion pounds or so at $0.25, $0.30 a pound. So the math is kind of right there. And we've been having good strong operations for a while and as Jim said, that's where we've been putting our focus and money, making sure these things are running well and that we're capturing that $0.30 a pound every month and every quarter so I hope...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, nothing that you're going to see that's not obvious. I mean, of course there is fixed cost absorption, you're getting the variable profit on all the increments obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think a couple important points to think about in terms of our ability to sustain that. Generally, people can't run crackers at that kind of a rate over a prolonged period of time but we have spent considerable money in turnarounds over the last couple of years. We have some catching up to do, but as you know, both big crackers at Channelview have been in turnarounds more so I could go on and on but we've been freshening up our assets. We just finished up a big turnaround of ethylene, so we've got some assets ready to go and they're showing that they can run in a sustained way.</p>
          <p>We've really focused on those details. It shows up in our safety records, it shows up in our operating rates and we're very happy to sell spot volumes to our competitors when they're not running.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. The bright spot in your O&amp;P-EAI segment has been your polypropylene compounds. Despite the slowdown in Europe, you're still seeing some pretty good growth there. So maybe can you highlight where this strength is coming from in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in polypropylene compounding, we have very nice market shares particularly in Europe but also in the United States into the auto business. In Europe there has been some softening of auto sales. That's been more with I call it the local producers who sell primarily into their local market, country-specific where some of the larger more global automakers have still had pretty good sales and we've maintained a very nice market share there and we pride ourselves on extremely high quality, great consistency and the ability to make those premium customers happy and so our volumes have held up pretty nicely. You see good quarter-by-quarter type earnings so that's a business we're pretty proud of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And your Technology segment is pretty stable and frankly not talked about too much on these calls. Do you see the potential for growth maybe in your catalyst side or in the polyolefin licensing side for that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've had a bit more licensing sales these days. There's been some pickup in licensing sales in China. We have great technologies and when people start to add polyolefin capacity we will always get the call and always get a chance to compete and as you know we have a very nice market share there so we'll expect that we'll continue to have a very, very competitive licensing business going forward.</p>
          <p>Now on catalyst, that somewhat depends on how markets &#x2013; how much polyolefins are being sold particularly &#x2013; primarily polypropylene when you look our catalyst sales. If volumes are down in Europe, that impacts us a little bit but as you know we have worldwide sales in catalysts and they've held that reasonably well. The people who have come to us in the past continue to come to us. We think we have a wonderful offering and people see great mileage and products out of our catalysts and so it's been a good business.</p>

          <p>Thanks and good morning. Question on the use of cash, obviously you've highlighted special dividends in greater frequency, as well as your continuing dividend. Does this mean that you've taken acquisitions whether bolt-on or larger off-the-table in terms of capital allocation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Nils. I don't think we've taken if off the table. We're just very selective on what we do. We always look to see does it make us better not does it make us bigger. There have been a variety of assets that have been for sale and we're happy to let our competitors purchase those. They didn't look like they would help us. And so, we use the word discipline a great deal in our capital strategy. The projects that we do are expected to have very nice returns. We're extremely disciplined and so M&amp;A is not off the table, but we'll be selective and always use the word accretive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A quick question on some of the new expansions. So given the large number of expansions and greenfields out there in the industry, could you speak to the demand for contractors out there and if you've locked up the people and resources you need to handle the expansions, or if there's any risk tied to labor availability or increasing project cost inflation generally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that's a point that everybody is paying a lot more attention to. And as result of that, you see besides the permit questions, you see some people talking about delays and when they might come up. That could be an issue in the United States more so than some people expect at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Our strategy has been to get in early, and we're working with specific contractors as we speak on these expansions. If we're adding a furnace here and a furnace there and doing some debottlenecking, it's a whole lot easier project to execute than a giant greenfield cracker. And so, so far we've been able to find the resources that we need. We've been able to enter into contracts for La Porte, and those are progressing nicely. The contractors are performing well so far on that project.</p>
          <p>And as we look at these other expansions, we're working with specific firms and they'll get a chance to bid on that work. And so far, we've seen we've been okay on what we're doing. Again, if we're in front of that wave, that really helps us. And people recognize that our debottleneck projects will bring them work today versus a few years from now when the permits are granted.</p>
          <p>Before I leave that, I do want to be very specific about our &#x2013; we have started &#x2013; we filed for permits on some of these projects some time ago and are in pretty advanced stages. In fact, at Channelview I was just talking about that in more detail today, we previously filed a permit application on that, so we're pretty advanced.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and then just a quick follow-up question on the MLP opportunity, could you touch on whether there are any Dutch legal or tax implications that might complicate the opportunity, or is that too early to tell at this point?</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, folks. Hey, I wanted to &#x2013; Jim, you talked about decent demand in the polyethylene arena. Could you talk about the outlook there domestic versus export? Can you size how those markets are playing out both for polyethylene and for polypropylene here in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First, in the United States, the demand has been reasonably good, and we've been able to move the volumes without too much difficulty. When we talk about U.S. polyolefins, a very, very important point; a couple of years ago we used to export a fairly high percentage of our U.S. polyolefin production to Asia, particularly polyethylene. That has dropped down to under 2% today of our domestic production. We do take about 12% down to Latin America, South America because there is some good value there and some very good customers that we've had for a long time. But we are not a U.S.-based export platform to Asia like some of our other competitors.</p>
          <p>Now of course, in the old days we'd have about 15%-plus sometimes 20% to Asia. We don't market that way today. The Asian markets have still been vying for our Middle East production because of the significant cost advantage. And so we haven't had any issues moving the product out of the Middle East. Now, Asian markets are weaker, European markets are weaker, but the United States has held up pretty well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. So about 15% of your polyolefins are being exported today, mostly to Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little less &#x2013; yes, about that from the United States, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. And then if you could just got quickly size the &#x2013; or ballpark the negative impact in the third quarter from the Wesseling turnarounds for the olefin, polyolefins Europe, the refinery limitations, and then also looking at the fourth quarter in I&amp;D, the PO/TBA turnaround, just ballpark that for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, this is Doug. Let me try to do that. I guess first with Wesseling in Europe, we don't think that had much impact, probably under $10 million. Of course, that's consistent with the kind of results you're seeing in the market in Europe right now.</p>
          <p>In terms of the refinery running at 240,000 versus ay 268,000 barrels a day, probably around $30 million or so in that third quarter; of course, we got those issues are corrected now. The PO/TBA turnaround that one's going to have on a PO side with the number of plants we have and the system that we have, we cover everything that way. We will lose some oxyfuel sales over time because of the TBA production affecting that. Of course, that's partially why you time these things into the fourth quarter rather than the strong second and third quarters, so we'll just have to see how margins turn out on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I appreciate your endurance here, maybe an extension of that last question. Jim, if you look forward for the U.S. industry, maybe to the cusp of the big greenfields or even just after that, do you think we're going to need to increase the export numbers out of the U.S.? Do you think that the downstream markets in the U.S. will grow more prominently? Where is that polyethylene in five, six, seven years going to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, a lot of that capacity has to be being built for export. The United States market will grow but not to that size. If you think of all the capacity that was built both in China and the Middle East over the prior years and you think about what we're talking about in the United States, as an overall amount compared to the total olefins worldwide, that's still 5% &#x2013; 6%, if I remember, capacity addition and should be absorbed if we get into normal economic conditions. But to your point, the United States will have to become an exporter of polyolefins, and I think everybody is anticipating that. They're putting in place logistics for that. And so it should be an orderly transition, I would expect.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you start to consider share repurchase next year as an option for cash flow use, how do you think about the concentration of your largest owners? There were some share of sales earlier this year but I guess you weren't able to buy that stock. Could you directly buy from your largest owners, and do you have a sense if they'd like to participate in any share purchase ratably?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't know the answer to that at this point in time. I'd be speculating, and so I choose not to. It's something that we've commented on we have to watch. What is shareholder concentration? It was fairly high. That has been reduced slightly, but we'll just watch that over time and see where it goes.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Greg Goodnight, UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all. Oil prices being down in the last month was certainly beneficial for global heavy crackers. Obviously, polyethylene prices are also down now in the last month about $100 a ton or about 7%. And my question to you, have you guys thought about if we get into a weaker oil, stronger gas price environment next year, what impact that might have on Lyondell in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, obviously, one of the reasons we're doing so well these days is because that ratio is blown out. We still expect it to be very, very sizable. Oil prices can come down some. Gas prices can come up some, and we still have an extremely strong advantage in the United States just on a relative basis compared to naphtha cracking. Yes, it would hurt the margin, but those margins would still remain quite robust. So we feel pretty good about the future. It's always hard to predict oil prices. I've been in this business for a long time and the oil business for a lot of years and they go up, they go down. And right now, they're still in pretty strong areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we're at a 25:1 oil to gas ratio instead of where it was earlier in the year of over 50:1 and it has been over 30:1 for most of the years, on a percentage basis, what impact would you see to your EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, the one thing you have to remember in this is you want to look at Brent, and Brent crude has actually averaged around $110, plus or minus, a little bit for over the last year. So you're really are sitting in that kind of range now. Now we've spoken before about ethane and gas and the relationship to the cost of ethylene so that type of a move. And as Jim has spoken before about gas has some room, it moved up a little bit, ethane has been selling at over BTU value in the past anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think those are really the core. You've got to remember two-thirds of the world is really driving off of that Brent crude price. That's their naphtha base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And remember that at this moment in time, that Brent to WTI differential is around $22 a barrel, so it's very, very significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One thing I'm not really clear about on this; your polyethylene versus ethylene spreads are pretty bad. I think it showed a slight negative on your chart. Why isn't there enough market here for exports of polyethylene to snug things up here in North America and firm out those negative spreads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, those are industry quoted spreads and obviously, as you heard from our earnings report, we're making some money. The values are frankly better here in the United States than exporting to Asia especially after transportation cost. So if we can move the product here at higher values we will continue to do that and there is a positive margin both polyethylene and polypropylene in the United States at present. Europe is a little more breakeven as we mentioned.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me make a couple of final comments. We had a very solid quarter. We're executing our plan. We have a great safety record, generally reliable operations. When olefin margins are strong, it's nice to run over 100% of your plant capacity.</p>
          <p>Our investments are very disciplined. We're increasing those as time goes on and we think the shareholders will significantly benefit from that. We've had great cash generation and thus have been able to continue to reward our shareholders and I think that $2.75 special dividend and $0.40 interim quarterly dividend are examples of that.</p>
          <p>We think we have a great future and we very much appreciate your interest in LyondellBasell. Thank you.</p>
