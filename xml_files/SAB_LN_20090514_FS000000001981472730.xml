        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone.  Welcome to SABMiller's annual results conference call for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.  I am Gary Leibowitz, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at SABMiller, and with me today as usual is Malcolm Wyman, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First, some quick formalities, our presentation will contain forward-looking statements and those reflect the best judgment of the management but include risks and uncertainties and the company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines. So, let's get started.</p>
          <p>I am pleased first to report that SABMiller has delivered strong results for F '09, resilient against the background of considerable external challenges.  We've maintained organic volumes in the face of week consumer demand and we've raised our underlying EBITA by 5% despite very real commodity and currency headwinds.</p>
          <p>We've benefited from the operational strengths of the businesses we've built over many years, delivering this underlying profit result through a combination of strong revenue and solid cost management.  We're capitalizing on our strengths, a broad portfolio of leading local power brands as well as effective and efficient in-market execution.  Our consistent strategic priorities continue to drive value and in these difficult economic times the inherent resilience and flexibility of our business model is being proven.</p>
          <p>The fiscal '09 performance reflects a gratifying pattern of organic market share gains for the last quarter and strong unit revenue growth across a number of our key markets.  The strength of our leading local brand equities and sales operations have been key.  The results are clear.  Market share is up over 3 points to 65% share of alcohol in Colombia, and beer market share is up 4 points to 88% in Peru, up 4 points to 44% in Poland, up 4.5 points to 29% in Romania, further gains in Russia and Italy, up 2.5 points to 20% in China, up over 1 point to 84% in Tanzania and up 6 full points to 50% in Uganda.</p>
          <p>In a few markets such as the U.S. and the Czech Republic, our volume share is slightly down as we've implemented value oriented initiatives towards revenue with price and skew management and investing in the marketplace more selectively to enhance profitability.  And in South Africa, we're moving to address our share loss of a few points, which followed the transfer of the Amstel brand, but we're still at almost 90% there.  The outcome of this strong performance has been a continuation of our top line growth, which leads the brewing peer group.</p>
          <p>Our focus on local brand building, tailored customer service, and stakeholder relations is driving these results.  Consumers have a strong emotional connection to our national power brands rooted in local providence and built up over many years.  They're generally the number one beer brands and are growing -- and are among the most recognized national consumer brands across all FMCG categories.  And therefore, they exert a strong influence on the trade in their markets.</p>
          <p>It's also worth remembering as we've said before the improving position of beer in emerging market alcohol even in these difficult times driven by rising disposable incomes in many countries still and being driven by consumer lifestyle shifts towards increased socializing with alcohol in moderation, and by our work to raise the image and attractiveness of beer.  As a result, even in these times we're steadily gaining market share from cheap subsistence alcohol, generally local spirits, and we expect this to continue.  Supported by beer's relative price positioning, it's still a significant trade up from subsistence alcohol, but far more accessible than the international beers and spirits, where the gap can be as much as 10 times.</p>
          <p>Our business in Peru is a great example of how we've built a strong relevant brand portfolio and raised local performance.  Our major challenge in Peru had been the creation of a new economy segment following aggressively priced competitive entries by two companies.  We responded by repositioning our Pilsen Trujillo brand in the economy segment and strengthening our sales, service and route to market execution. Within the first year, Pilsen Trujillo had effectively contained the competition and with rising segment share through this year we were able to raise price.</p>
          <p>The benefits have been three-fold; improved revenue, a big share gain for our overall portfolio in the last quarter as I mentioned, four full points, and category value restored as the economy segment has now ceded share back to the mainstream.  And all the while, Cusque&#xF1;a's success with nearly 60% growth has continued to build the premium segment and deliver mix benefits to profitability for Latin America.</p>
          <p>Another example of improving performance is Angola, a strong African growth engine for ourselves and for our partner, Castel, underpinned by rapid economic growth.  Following our Coke bottling investments over the past decade and our brewery privatization in '05, we've rapidly expanded our production assets, depots, sales force and route to market.  Much like elsewhere in Africa, but harder as there are added pressures of double-digit demand growth and challenging supply constraints.</p>
          <p>In a number of our markets, the economic headwinds have created particular challenges.  Our teams are implementing wide ranging measures in revenue and cost management to protect profitability in ways that meet local needs and this is beyond just the very strong pricing that we've reported with 8% price mix for the Group.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, for example, even as we continue to gain share of alcohol in the difficult market, we've taken steps to restructure the business reducing a wide range of fixed costs and reaping savings in marketing, distribution and procurement even as we benefited from strong pricing and again positive mix gains.  We've also been boosting cash flow with reduced CapEx and working capital.</p>
          <p>And in the Czech Republic, where the market declined between three and 4% in the year, we've relentlessly focused on driving value in both the on and off-trade segments.  In the off-trade for example, our pricing over the past three years has been over 50% higher than the market.  As a result, we grew EBITA in the second half despite domestic volume declines of 4%, COGS headwinds and the currency pressure, a significant achievement.</p>
          <p>Now away from the developing markets another major feature of the year as you know has been the formation of MillerCoors in the U.S. and the JV's particularly strong profit delivery in its first few quarters.  MillerCoors got off to a fast start delivering cost synergies ahead of schedule, which is now including the very material savings that we expect from brewery network optimization over the next 18 months, greatly reducing beer transportation distances across the country, strengthening our brand portfolio and making inroads in sales and distribution, targeting excellent execution, more shelf space and increased advocacy by retailers, who are welcoming an alternative category captain across the U.S.. Our U.S. brand portfolio spans all price segments, flavors and styles.  Its strength and breadth and our category management capabilities in retail position us very well for growth.</p>
          <p>As you've heard us say, our top priority in the U.S. is winning in Mainstream Light.  MillerCoors has three complementary brands to capture profitable growth in the segment; Miller Lite, Coors Lite and MGD 64, positioned against the top researched consumer drivers in Mainstream Light of taste, refreshment and calorie and carb content.  Coors Lite and MGD 64 are growing very rapidly as is the overall MGD franchise, which is growing in mid single-digits for the first time in a decade.  And Miller Lite's marketing has recently been reinvigorated with its taste messaging now front and center together with new packaging innovations that are starting to roll now.</p>
          <p>In the high-end, we've got a great diverse portfolio from craft brands Blue Moon and Leinenkugel still growing to the imports, Peroni, Molson, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell.  And our strong portfolio in the economy segment has real brand equity in Keystone Light and Miller High Life.  High Life growth has accelerated to mid single-digits on a big base and Keystone Light is growing double-digits, gaining segment share through both distribution and velocity.</p>
          <p>Net revenue per barrel growth has been very strong at 5% in the U.S. over the past 9 months pro forma and the team has started chalking up some notable successes in chain sales.  They've also blunted some of the commodity cost pressures in the U.S. with cost efficiency measures beyond our integration synergies, which we expect they will continue to deliver and we'll discuss the topic of further efficiencies at our upcoming seminar in New York on June 9.</p>
          <p>Now, on that positive note, I'm going to hand over to Malcolm.  Malcolm?</p>

          <p>Good day to everyone.  As in the past, my presentation will focus on results on an organic constant currency basis as this better reflects our underlying performance.</p>
          <p>Against the difficult backdrop of the global economic downturn and the strengthening U.S. dollar in the second half of the year, the Group has delivered a resilient performance.  Total volumes for the year of 260 million hectoliters gave an organic increase of just under 1%, supported by low single-digit growth in non-lager beverages.  Although organic lager volumes were marginally down on the prior year, this is considered a solid performance given the high single-digits organic lager growth in the prior year and strong economic headwinds faced across our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We priced strongly in most markets to counter the effects of higher raw material input costs and Group revenue was up 9% on an organic constant currency basis.  EBITA increased 4.7% on the same basis, although flat on a reported basis due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against our operating currencies in the second half.</p>
          <p>EBITA margin did decline 70 basis points versus the prior year on an organic constant currency basis as a result of higher raw material input costs, increased investment in production capacity as well as inflationary increases and fixed overheads in most markets.  These factors were mitigated somewhat by actions we took in some markets in the second half to reduce our cost base.  And as a result, the 70 basis points decline is less than we reported at our interim results.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars was down 4%, reflecting mainly the relative strength in the United States dollar against our major operating currencies.  Double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth was however achieved in both sterling and South African rand.  The final dividend is US$0.42 per share, which brings the annual dividend to US$0.58 per share, unchanged from the prior year.</p>
          <p>As I've mentioned, on an organic consent currency basis, Group revenue is up 9%, principally driven by strong pricing across all of our divisions.  Our continued focus on building strong relevant brand portfolios enabled us to sustain price improvements and deliver strong revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Revenue per hectoliter grew across our portfolio.  Firstly in Latin America, we achieved a 5% per hectoliter increase with both price and mix benefits contributing to the good top line performance.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we obtained an increase of 6% on a revenue per hectoliter basis, evidencing our competitive strength in the region.  In North America, MillerCoors total net revenue per hectoliter for the nine months since July grew by mid single-digits on a pro forma basis driven by strong front line pricing and reduced promotions and discounts.</p>
          <p>In Africa, we benefited from full pricing in line with high inflation levels across our portfolio of countries, growing revenue per hectoliter by 14%, while firmer pricing and mix benefits in China underpinned revenue per hectoliter growth of 21% in Asia.  In South Africa, two price increases in both our beer and soft drinks businesses delivered revenue per hectoliter growth of 10%.</p>
          <p>Now looking at EBITA on a similar basis, our underlying organic constant currency EBITA grew by 4.7%.  Robust top line growth through strong pricing more than offset the negative impacts of higher raw material costs as well as increased fix cost for the year.  EBITA on an organic constant currency basis grew faster in the second half of the year despite lower sales volumes, and EBITA margin was virtually flat.</p>
          <p>In the second half, cost trends improved assisted partially by restructuring, particularly in Latin America and the contribution of soft drinks strengthened in both Africa and South Africa.</p>
          <p>Reported EBITA is flat year-on-year, affected in the second half of the year by U.S. dollar strength against the currencies of our major operations when the impact of the global financial crisis on economic growth and consumer demand was felt.</p>
          <p>Over the past two years, input costs pressures have had a significant impact on our EBITA and EBITA margins.  The current year total raw materials have risen by 16% on a U.S. dollar per hectoliter basis, following a 9% increase in the prior year.  Similarly, total cost of goods sold are up 12% off a rise of 6% in the prior year.  Although commodity market prices softened considerably in the second half of the year the group did not benefit from these lower prices due to the rates and timing of forward purchase contracts.  In addition, local input costs have been adversely affected by the strength of the U.S. dollar, the predominant currency which commodity costs are purchased.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Latin America; lager volumes grew by 1% on the prior year and constant currency organic revenue grew 6%.  Peru and Ecuador in particular saw robust volumes and revenue growth.  But this was partially offset by the impact of the economic slowdown in Colombia and also Central America.  Organic constant currency EBITA growth was well up at 11% and organic constant currency EBITA margin increased by 100 basis points to 21.4%.  These increases were driven by firm pricing, favorable mix and in the second half of the year restructuring initiatives and tight cost controls to reduce fixed expenses.</p>
          <p>The economic conditions in Europe however deteriorated sharply across many markets in the second half.  Against this backdrop we maintained organic lager volumes and achieved market share gains in Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom.  In the Czech Republic we focused particularly on value share leadership.  In Russia, poor summer weather and high distributor stocks affected our volumes during the year.</p>
          <p>Pricing remains strong across most markets with revenue growth of 6% on an organic constant currency basis, which offset the increases in raw material costs.  Focus on marketing effectiveness enabled the reduction in overall marketing spend.  However sales and distribution costs rose, in particular to support our growth in Romania and the upcoming commissioning of our Ulyanovsk Brewery in Russia.</p>
          <p>Reported EBITA declined 1%, while on an organic constant currency basis it fell 5%.  In the second half, action has been taken to reduce the Europe cost base by restructuring certain of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Our North American segment comprises results from Miller Brewing Company as a standalone subsidiary for the first quarter of the year and then out 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture for the nine months to 31 March 2009.</p>
          <p>North America delivered strong profit growth for the financial year with a very good earnings contribution from Miller Brewing Company in the first quarter and a strong financial performance from MillerCoors since it began combined operations on the 1st of July last year.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors' lager sales, excluding contract brewing for the nine months to the 31st of March on a pro forma basis decreased by 1.9%, while sales to retailers on the same basis were down just 0.4%.  The early progress on MillerCoors' integration accelerated the delivery of synergies which combined with robust pricing offset increased commodity costs and helped to deliver a 22% increase in EBITA.  The result was enhanced by some one-off benefits that occurred in the current year, including the sale of hops which was surplus to Miller requirements of $39 million and also some phasing of marketing spend in the last quarter.  A total of $78 million in synergy savings has been realized since the 1st of July last year, exceeding the MillerCoors' original goal of $50 million for the first 12 months of its operations.</p>
          <p>Now in Africa, our focus on extending our brand portfolio contributed to organic lager volume growth of 5%.  We increased our economy offerings and have launched additional premium brands in selected markets.  We have also made strategic acquisitions of water businesses and have grown our non-lager beer business particularly in Zambia and Malawi.</p>
          <p>Good revenue growth from pricing offset higher input costs but was not sufficient to maintain margin.  Our beer businesses in Botswana have been impacted by the 30% levy on alcoholic beverages introduced on the 1st of November last year although our soft drinks businesses has benefited.</p>
          <p>Our associate in Africa, Castel has also shown good growth in both beer and soft drinks across a number of markets.  China's industry growth in beer has slowed but our associate CR Snow has continued to increase market share through its flagship brand Snow.</p>
          <p>Growth in India has moderated somewhat and we have grown volumes in line with the market and maintained our market share.  Despite a slowdown in sales by recent months &#x2013; in recent months, EBITA grew in the second half of the year led by better volume and profitability and soft drinks and traditional beer in Africa.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, lager volumes were 2% down on the prior year affected by lower consumer spending and a decline in premium beer sales.  The fourth quarter also suffered from the lack of a peak Easter trading period and the introduction of provincial legislation against the informal retail liquor trade in the Western Cape.</p>
          <p>Strong double-digit revenue growth was offset by the combination of substantially higher raw material costs, increased marketing investments in a competitive environment and higher container deprecation charges resulting from the replacement of mainstream returnable bottles.</p>
          <p>As anticipated, the loss of the Amstel brand has reduced our share of the premium category and we are revitalizing our premium brand portfolio to deliver growth in this competitive segment.  During the year, two premium lager brands, Grolsch and Dreher were launched to bolster our premium beer offering.</p>
          <p>During the year, and in particular following the global economic downturn in the second half, we have focused on controlling our overhead costs and increasing our marketing cost effectiveness.  We have initiated restructuring in a number of our businesses in our Latin America and Europe regions.  This has resulted in exceptional charges of $82 million in the year, restructuring in these regions is expected to provide pre-tax benefits of approximately $37 million per annum in the financial year 2011, that's ending March 2011, with a significant proportion will be delivered in the 2010 financial year.</p>
          <p>Restructuring relating to MillerCoors joint venture where synergies are running ahead of schedule has resulted in charges of $61 million during this current year.  We have had a number of exceptional charges and credits this year with a net exceptional charge of $69 million against profit before tax.  As a result of the deterioration and economic and trading conditions in the Netherlands and Ukraine we have taken impairment charges of $392 million.  Of this, 42 million relates to our investment in the Ukraine and $350 million relates to the goodwill of our Grolsch acquisition.  However, we remain confident in the strategic and long-term potential of both of these businesses.  Further $38 million relates to the group share of the impairment of the Sparks brand recorded in MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>Restructuring and integration charges have amounted to $143 million, which I discussed on the previous slide.  On the disposal of our Miller Brewing company business to the MillerCoors joint venture and on the sale of two soft drinks businesses in Latin America we generated profits of some $526 million.</p>
          <p>Other items relate to a gain of 20 million on early termination of financial derivatives, a $22 million charge relating to the unwinding of fair value adjustments on inventory, $13 million litigation charges and $7 million relating to the group share of fair value losses on financial instruments in our hotels and gaming interests in South Africa giving a net exceptional item of $69 million in charges.</p>
          <p>I'll now move over to our group financial considerations.  Normalized EBITDA for the year, and that includes nine months of dividends from the MillerCoors joint venture to make this comfortable with EBITDA last year, is up 2% although margin decreased by 50 basis points.  Net working capital cash flow was $493 million negative; inventory values rose due to the increased price of commodities, an increase in inventory days in some markets, and the build up of stock ahead of the peak Easter period, which followed the year-end.</p>
          <p>Higher revenue increased our debtors' balances, and in some markets selective extension of credit to customers and increased sales to key accounts were factors.  There is a renewed focus on working capital.  All regions have been set specific targets and have identified action plans to reduce working capital during the course of the current year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure of $2.147 billion dollars was $110 million higher than the prior year, with the majority being spent in the first half.  Capital projects have been curtailed where appropriate in the second half of the year in the light of the economic slow down.  The group effective tax rates of 30.2% is below the 32.5% of the prior year.  This is due to a more favorable geographic profit mix, certain statutory tax rate reductions and continuing initiatives to seek efficiency in the group's effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>Now our net debt position has decreased from the previous financial year, benefiting from weakening currencies against the U.S. dollar in the last quarter of the year.  Our financial structure remains strong with gearing at 54.1% and net debt to normalized EBITDA of just 1.9 times.  We include the MillerCoors JV dividends in our normalized EBITDA calculation as the JV was structured to be debt free and the debts originally in Miller Brewing Company is held on our balance sheet outside the JV.</p>
          <p>We undertook a major refinancing in July 2008 when we completed a successful 1.25 billion-bond issue in two tranches.  Firstly, $550 million of 5.5-year notes with a coupon of 5.7% and $700 million of 10-year notes with a coupon of 6.5%.  We also established a euro medium-term note program to allow us to diversify further our sources of funding in the future.  Although no notes have been issued under this program at the current time.</p>
          <p>Despite the year-end net debt reducing year-on-year, the average net debt balances throughout the year were in fact higher, as a result mainly of the acquisition of Grolsch towards the end of the prior year.  This resulted in a $208 million increase in adjusted net finance costs compared to prior year.  The reductions in floating interest rates have recently started to reduce the cost of debt and our average interest rate at the end of the year had fallen to 7.1%.  I would add that in excess of 17% of our debt is held at floating rates, including inflation-linked debt to take advantage of lower interest rates.  Given the current volatility in the debts in foreign exchange rate markets, I think it would be important to cover the currency and maturity profiles of our debt.</p>
          <p>Now the pie chart on the slide shows our net debt profile by currency after the impact of derivatives.  As you can see we have a well-balanced currency profile given the spread of our businesses.  As we report in U.S. dollars, we also maintain a reasonable portion of our debt in that currency.  The maturity profile shows that the majority of our debt matures after two years.  We currently have headroom available to refinance all debt falling due in the next 2 years, in terms of existing unutilized committed facilities and cash resources as well as significant in-country banking facilities.  We are well positioned to face the challenges the current economic and financial conditions present.</p>
          <p>Now looking at our financial outlook, for the current financial year, the global economic downturn and the negative impact we have seen on consumer spending in the second half of the year is expected to continue in the current financial year, although visibility as to the extent thereof is unclear.  Based on current levels of exchange rates, our reported results would be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against our major operating currencies.  Throughout the group, we are focused on cash management and we expect the working capital trend to improve during the course of this year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is expected to reduce to approximately US$1.5 billion, which is well down on the past year's capital expenditure.  The majority of this expenditure will take place in the first half of the year as we complete major brewing capacity projects in Russia, Tanzania Angola and also at Mozambique.</p>
          <p>Input cost pressures are expected to remain due to the level of committed raw material procurement arrangements where over 75% of the commodity requirements are locked in for this year and also the impact of weaker local currencies on input prices.  As a result of lower interest rates and expected lower debt levels, finance costs are expected to decline for the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, our effective tax rates should approximate 30% this year, a level we are confident is sustainable with the current composition of the Group.</p>

          <p>Okay thanks Malcolm.  In conclusion I think we've shown today that our businesses are resilient, with very strong revenue and cost management delivering good results.  We combined strong brand portfolios with geographic diversification and our overall strategic priorities are well suited to these current times.</p>
          <p>And with that, Malcolm and I are ready to take any questions you might have.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I have a question on costs and a question on pricing.  First on costs, I was hoping you could just give us a bit more detail with respect to your commodity cost outlook, it seems like you're still tied into some of these contracts, I was wondering if we should expect to see some of these costs ease for you as we course through the year, and if we shouldn't expect to see any benefit until fiscal 2011?  And on the pricing side, you've been pretty -- done a pretty good job with respect to passing through prices in each of your markets. I was curious if you would see more of that this year or are we going to just see the benefit of those price increases that you have taken to flow through your numbers also this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Well, good morning and thank you.  First of all on the commodity cost side, we have in terms of our hedging arrangements and forward purchase contracts locked in a significant amount of our requirements during the course of the next year, and that comes about from the fact that issues or items like barley, we do need to purchase on a forward basis for the year when the crop is produced. And of course, we are big purchasers of all of our hard and soft commodities. We can't really go in and buy those at spot prices. We need to negotiate those in advance and we need to negotiate ahead of our actual requirements rather than relying on spot purchases.</p>
          <p>So as a result of that, we think that for the current financial year we will probably be up in commodities cost by about high single-digits and that includes &#x2013; that's commodity costs and of course there are the foreign exchange impacts where our local currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollar, which is playing a role in our costs.</p>
          <p>Now, we do expect to get some benefits towards the end of the current financial year, because whilst we are locked in for a major portion, that is more so for the first half of the year than the second half.  So, we would expect margins to be under pressure in the first half and in the second half we will see some of those contracts start to roll off. But it would be fair to say that the bigger benefit will come through in our financial 2011 rather than financial 2010.</p>
          <p>As far as pricing is concerned we have priced up recently to recover commodity costs and we've taken some hefty price increases over the last six to eight months of the previous financial year, that's from about mid 2008 onwards.  For example, in Colombia we took a 9% increase in first of October last year, South Africa we had a 9% increase or 8% increase in September and then another increase in January, February this year.  We've had increases in Czech Republic and of course, in the United States we've taken increases towards the end of calendar 2008.</p>
          <p>Now the annualization of that pricing will obviously roll through into this calendar year and that will take us through by and large on those big countries and certain others like Poland and Romania and Peru and that will roll through for the best part of 2009.</p>
          <p>As we get towards the end of 2009, we'll obviously look on a situational basis country-by-country to see how things are playing out, what demand price trade-offs there will be and we can assess at that stage what level of pricing that we will put through.  But at the moment we're not looking for major price increases, we will see how the annualization plays out and then we'll assess issues towards the end of the calendar year by which time the commodity prices we have should start to roll-off and we can start then assessing as I said the lower impact of commodity prices against the need for price increases.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you already negotiated, or began to negotiate at those lower levels that we're seeing on the commodity cost side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes indeed. In areas like aluminum where we can buy forward, we have been doing that on the markets and we have started to pick up products for later on or in beginning of &#x2013; later on F'10 and beginning of our fiscal 2011.  We don't see however, the need to move aggressively on price at the moment, we believe that there will be soft markets during the course of this year, this calendar year. So we're obviously from a procurement point of view picking our times as to when we think they're best possible to go into the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And if I could also ask on the restructuring side of the business and what you're doing there, it seems like you've had good opportunity to make some reductions and I was curious with respect to how you're thinking about this year. I don't know if on a regional basis if there are a good amount of opportunities left and how we should think about expense reduction on that side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suppose, just to give you some context, the amounts that we've talked about in restructuring are the smaller amounts of what we are doing in our cost reduction initiatives, rather than announce major projects which is not the way we handle our cost reduction and our productivity, what we tend to do is incrementally continuously try and take our costs and achieve cost productivity improvement on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>The restructuring that we've announced is in fact just a few projects which are in response to the downturn that took place in the last six months of last year, and we had a number of projects where we've taken specific exceptional charges and against those charges we have noted that we would get benefits of about $37 million against $82 million in charges, most coming in F'11 but a good portion in F'10.</p>
          <p>But besides that, that's just forms part of an overall cost reduction initiative that we are doing.  The others take place all the time. The costs of implementing the cost reduction programs on an ongoing basis or in our income statement and of course the benefits flow through from time-to-time in our income statement.  So, that is an ongoing process and that will continue very much so into the course of this calendar year as we expect things to be pretty tough during 2009 calendar year as the full effect of the global economic slowdown plays out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that savings number is across your regions, it's not particular to any one or two markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think its fair to say there is more going on in a number of markets, Europe for example where I think it wouldn't come as a surprise to anyone to know that that has been hit particularly hard. We did see the slowdown there first and in the last six months there has been a significant withdrawal of capital as the banks deleverage, and whilst the subsidiaries</p>
          <p>of the Western banks that are in those areas are still being supported by them, we think that capital has been withdrawn, which means there's less credit available for corporations and for customers.  So in that particular area, we think those businesses will probably have greater challenges to face, and therefore right across Europe we've been looking at cost reduction programs. In the United States you know we have our synergy program and besides that we have our ongoing cost reduction programs through Resources For Growth on the legacy Coors side and also our Project Unicorn on the legacy Miller side.</p>
          <p>LatAm is another area where we would have cost reduction programs in some countries like Panama and Colombia, whereas on the other hand Peru is growing very strongly. And we have not had any need. In fact it's been more about ensuring we have appropriate capacity. The same could be said for Africa, where by and large it is an issue of volumes we -- and ensuring we have appropriate capacity. Our volume growth in and across Africa was 10% in total volumes of which 5% was lager, and then a substantial increase in soft drinks and other beverages. So, our issue in Africa is actually keeping up with the volume growth as opposed to cost reduction programs. So, it is spread across the world and it is not consistent. We have strong growth in some areas which we're supporting with capital expenditure and then in other areas where we are seeing greater challenges, we're obviously implementing those programs to reduce our cost base and ensure that we have an appropriate lean base as we go forward during perhaps more difficult times during the course of this year.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  The next question is from Todd Duvick from Banc of America Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good afternoon.  I had a couple of questions on the -- I guess the first question is on the Polish stake that you announced you are buying the rest off, it's an all equity transaction and I am wanting to know if you can just tell us, with your balance sheet capacity, why you decided to go all equity? Was at the request of the seller or was it at your initiative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think the short answer is the -- as you have surmised here, we would like to have bought him out for cash but &#x2013; and we have long talked to him about taking his minority stake, but he's been a partner of ours for a long time and just did not want to sell out at all. And it was his requirement that if we did a deal, he would only do it for equity so that he could swap into SABMiller shares. And in the end I think we got a very attractive deal even on the price of the US$1.1 billion based on our current share price that came out on about an eight times EBITDA multiple on last years earnings, so I think a very good deal probably all round certainly we are very happy with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.  And have you announced any plans to offset the dilution going forward with some share buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we haven't. Buybacks we look at in a separate issue and of course that's always available to us to do that, but I think rather than just do an ad hoc buyback, we would probably wait and if we do decide to do something like that it would be in terms of a program.  So at this particular point in time, we've settled this in equity &#x2013; essentially equity for equity and buybacks will be a separate decision by the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then shifting to the debt balance on the balance sheet you have about $2.1 billion of short-term debt as you mentioned and that includes a note that comes due in July. Can we assume that you will be refinancing a portion of that short-term debt in the debt capital markets at some point this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well at the moment we have adequate facilities in terms of all of our corporate banking arrangements to in fact meet all of our repayments over the course of the next two years.  So it's not necessarily so that we will approach the market during the course of this year, but we constantly monitor the debt capital markets.  So I wouldn't say that that it's off the table, but it's not so much to refinance the 300 million, but more about when we think it's appropriate to enter the markets in perhaps a bigger way. But we do have the adequate facilities to refinance that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Okay.  That's helpful.  And when will your audited financials be released?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  And just one final question, if I may on the impairment charge related to Grolsch, could you indicate if that was cash or non-cash or a combination and what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a non-cash charge. Essentially it relates to the goodwill that we paid previously some 15 odd months ago, 15-16 months ago when we acquired Grolsch.  So the challenge we took now was a non-cash charge.</p>
        </plist>
