        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Amanda, and good morning.  Welcome to our call this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Joining me on the call today is our Chairman, President and CEO, Dick Clark; Mr. Peter Kellogg, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and we're also joined by our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Bruce Kuhlik.</p>
          <p>Before we get into the details, I would like to go over the logistics as always.  On this call, we will review the results contained in the release we issued at 7:30 this morning and you can access this through the Investor Relations section on merck.com and I would remind you that this conference call is being webcast live and recorded.  The replay of this event will be available later today via phone, webcast, and as always our podcast.</p>
          <p>As we begin to review the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this call may discuss certain subjects that may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks and uncertainty, which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements.  The forward-looking statements may include statements regarding product development, product potential, or financial performance.  No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those projected.</p>
          <p>Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Forward-looking statements on this call should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affects Merck's business, particularly those mentioned in the risk factors and cautionary statements set forth in item 1A of Merck's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and in its periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, which the company incorporates by reference and that are also posted on our website.</p>
          <p>We'll begin the call with brief remarks from Mr. Clark and Mr. Kellogg; then we will open the call for questions and expect the call to last approximately an hour.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Graeme, and good morning everyone.  Earlier this morning, we announced the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007.  We are joining you now to discuss them in greater detail.</p>
          <p>I am pleased that today we have another solid set of results with growing revenue and non-GAAP EPS to talk about.  The momentum Merck has gained through our consistent performance over the prior seven quarters is seen in our strong quarter and overall annual results and we delivered those results notwithstanding an uncertain short term economic outlook and the impact of major patent expirations.  I want to thank everyone at Merck for helping to get the company back on track and outperforming in terms of innovation, execution of our new commercial model, and delivering shareholder value.  I am confident that our continued focus on our Plan to Win will enable us to accomplish our business goals, help us address emerging challenges, and achieve Merck's purpose to discover and develop breakthrough medicines and vaccines.</p>
          <p>The results reported today show that Merck continues to deliver on our promise to remain a leader in the pharmaceutical industry.  For the fourth quarter, we reported revenue of $6.2 billion, which represents top line growth of plus 3% versus the prior year.  For the full year 2007, we recorded revenue of $24.2 billion, plus 7% higher than 2006.  Based on the continued market penetration and global rollouts of our new product introductions over the past two years including Gardasil, RotaTeq, Januvia, Janumet, and Isentress, we are on track to sustain growth in 2008 and deliver long term double digit EPS growth from 2005 to 2010 excluding certain items.  During 2008, we will continue to assertively launch our new products globally and ensure that as many patients as possible worldwide have access to our innovative and needed medicines and vaccines.</p>
          <p>Our most established products also continued to deliver strong performances, including Singulair, Cozaar, Hyzaar, Zetia, and Vytorin.  Taken together, these established franchises along with our new first in class vaccines and medicines such as Gardasil, RotaTeq, Januvia, Janumet, and Isentress, give us a diverse product portfolio that is well positioned to drive revenue growth through 2010.</p>
          <p>Merck reported full year 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.20, which excludes fourth quarter charges related to the US Vioxx settlement agreement and several government investigations, restructuring charges, and an insurance arbitration gain.  Our full year GAAP EPS were $1.49.  For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS were $0.80 excluding previously disclosed items.  On a GAAP basis, we had a $0.75 loss per share.</p>
          <p>Looking at our next generation products, I'm pleased to report that with the most recent approval of Emend for injection, we have achieved 8 approvals in 24 months.  That's a great example of the benefit of our new business model as it relates to the regulatory filing process.</p>
          <p>Gardasil's performance in 2007, its first full year on the market, was an exceptional $1.5 billion in sales.  Fourth quarter sales were $339 million.  To date, we have distributed more than 20 million doses of the vaccine worldwide since its market launch just a year and a half ago in June of 2006.  Gardasil has been approved in 93 countries and is being readied for launch in 76 of those countries.</p>
          <p>Together, global revenue for Januvia and Janumet reached nearly $300 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the high value that physicians, patients, and payors are placing on our products and on the healthcare benefits they provide.  This result also demonstrates that we continue to build on the momentum established with our product launches last year.  In fact, Januvia has already become the second leading branded oral anti-diabetic agent in the US in terms of new prescription shares.  As we move into 2008, Januvia has achieved second tier reimbursement coverage in more than 200 million lives across managed care commercial formularies in the US.  Ex-US, it is available in more than 65 countries including the recent approval in Canada.  In the European Union, Januvia already has received full reimbursement in 14 countries.</p>
          <p>The introduction of Isentress is a realization of Merck's 20-year commitment to HIV/AIDS.  We are working hard to build on the successful launch of Isentress to ensure that it reaches its full market potential.  We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to foster patient access to Isentress; and to assist patients in need, we have established a support program in the US.</p>
          <p>I am very encouraged that our business continues to deliver substantial growth.  This been another outstanding quarter for Merck as our new products establish their leadership in an increasing competitive market, even as old products have gone off patent.  We are leveraging lessons learned from our new product and vaccine launches and utilizing the new commercial model to further support and consolidate the strong position of our established inline brands.  Our success is helping us invest in Merck's future as we continue to fully fund our research spending on investigational product development, the acquisition of NovaCardia, and more than 50 new licensing opportunities in therapeutic areas that are of strategic importance to Merck.</p>
          <p>Our overall financial results were also supported by the strong performance of our partnership and alliances, specifically the Merck/Schering-Plough partnership, which in 2007 continued to drive our equity income.</p>
          <p>I want to take a moment now to address the ENHANCE trial.  There are a couple of points I'd like you to take away from this subject today.  First of all, Merck stands behind the safety and efficacy profiles of both Zetia and Vytorin.  Next, we acted with integrity and good faith in connection with the clinical trial.  Third, let's keep this trial in perspective.  ENHANCE was not powered or designed to assess cardiovascular clinical event outcomes.  As many of you know, we have a large clinical outcomes trial underway called IMPROVE-IT.  The IMPROVE-IT trial is intended to measure clinical event rates in more than 10,000 patients with acute coronary syndrome.  IMPROVE-IT is examining ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 versus simvastatin 40, and the relationship between LDL lowering and overall reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this patient population.</p>
          <p>Fourth and perhaps most overlooked in the ENHANCE trial, Vytorin significantly lowered LDL cholesterol compared to Simvastatin alone.  As the FDA noted last week in a news conference, elevated LDL cholesterol is a very well established risk factor for heart disease.  These important findings are also reflected in the National Cholesterol Educational Panel guidelines that continue to identify LDL cholesterol as a primary target for lipid modifying therapy and have recommended lower target goal levels for LDL over time.  Clinical studies which are included in Vytorin's prescription information have demonstrated that Vytorin lowers patients' LDL cholesterol more than atorvastatin or simvastatin at the doses studied.  Many patients with elevated cholesterol cannot achieve their cholesterol treatment goals with diet and exercise.  Many of those patients also cannot achieve their treatment goals with statins alone.  As we said, we plan to discuss the ENHANCE data in the proper scientific context at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March.</p>
          <p>Again, let me emphasize that operating with the highest standard of ethics and scientific integrity are of the utmost personal importance to me and are the foundation of this company.  We will continue to work hard to respond to any allegations to the contrary.  At the same time, Merck will not for a second lose focus of our overarching mission and that is improving quality of life.</p>
          <p>For 2008, the company continues to anticipate that many of our inline and newer franchises will maintain their strong performance and we look forward to launching additional new products such as Cordaptive if approved and our investigational atherosclerosis compound currently under standard review with the FDA.  We anticipate that worldwide revenue will be driven by additional indications for our company's products and their continued marketing uptake and global rollout of our new products as well as other potential new introductions.</p>
          <p>When taken together, all of this should help us offset the upcoming loss of marketing exclusivity for Fosamax, our second largest product in the US.  In addition, during 2008 we plan to file two NDAs for products currently in Phase III, namely MK-0524B for atherosclerosis and MK-0364 for obesity.  To position ourselves for commercial success in 2008 and beyond, we will begin to prepare for their prospective launches.</p>
          <p>On earnings per share, we are confident in our ability to execute against our plan and are reaffirming the full year 2008 non-GAAP EPS range of $3.28 to $3.38 excluding certain items.  We are making a slight revision to our 2008 GAAP EPS, which now anticipates to be in the range of $3.80 to $4.00.  Peter will provide additional details in a moment.</p>
          <p>We are halfway through the strategy outlined in 2005 in our Plan to Win and we have made some real strides toward realizing the benefits of our strategy.  We implemented a new research model and I'm confident that it will bring greater focus and efficiency to our early compound development.  We've also made significant progress towards creating standard global processes for late stage clinical development.  Our new Global Human Health organization is in place, representing a significant change from the way we have operated in the past.  And we are beginning to make inroads to a new customer-centric commercial model both in the US and in other key markets around the world.  We're also changing the way we support our global market franchises.  Across our global franchises, we have introduced new stage gates to help us fine-tune the focus of our research activities on our highest value areas in terms of customer need and probabilities of success.</p>
          <p>These changes are bringing us closer to achieving our goal of becoming a more flexible, effective, and efficient company.  For example, our manufacturing division and the Merck supply strategy have led the way in returning Merck to pre-Zocor patent expiry PGM [Product Gross Margin] a year earlier than we initially anticipated, establishing lead supply chains, leveraging low cost in external manufacturing, and consolidating our manufacturing plant network.  As you know, such global restructuring activities are a part of our overall strategy to further reduce our cost structure and create a leaner and more nimble business model so that we can respond quickly and efficiently to customer expectations, address emerging market demand, and support the drug discovery and development efforts that are core to our business model.</p>
          <p>As we implement fundamental changes to every aspect of our business, we remain confident that our current products and anticipated new product introductions as well as our cost savings initiatives will help us position the company to deliver what we promised in December 2005: to generate revenue growth in the range of 4 to 6% on a compound annualized basis from 2005 to 2010 including 50% of the revenue from the joint ventures from which the company derives equity income.  By sustaining our cost management initiative, Merck expects to fulfill our promise to expand the product portfolio while maintaining marketing and administrative expense flat in 2010 relative to the 2006 base.  And we continue to expect compound annual double digit earnings growth excluding restructuring charges and one-time items by 2010 from a 2005 base.</p>
          <p>In summary, our performance in 2007 has proved that the customer focused, more efficient business model we began implementing more than two years ago is delivering results.  With our strong portfolio of products, our robust pipeline of potential new therapies, and our leadership team focused daily on improving operational performance, I am convinced that Merck is well positioned to build on its record of delivering essentially breakthrough medicines and vaccines to the global marketplace.</p>
          <p>However, despite a strong 2007 performance, I see no room for complacency.  As I'll tell my senior management at our annual strategy meeting this week, it's way too soon to declare victory.  Although we remain confident that our customers will continue to find value in our products, we have much to do to reach our 2010 goals and we'll need to do even more to realize and sustain the benefit of our strategy through 2010 &#x2013; 2015 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter, who will provide additional comment on the details of our 2007 results and 2007 financial guidance.  Then we will take your questions.  Peter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning.  As Dick mentioned, we are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year business results.  Throughout 2007, our inline product portfolio and our newly launched pharmaceutical products and vaccines helped drive strong organic growth, overcoming the impact of the Zocor and Proscar patent expiries.  We continue to significantly reengineer our business to ensure that we have a sustainable operating model that can weather the upcoming loss of marketing exclusivity for Fosamax.  These successes have allowed us in 2007 to deliver 10% revenue growth including 50% of our JVs and 27% non-GAAP EPS growth despite patent expiries that exceeded $2 billion.  Finally, we continue to make the necessary pipeline investments both internally and externally to position the company for long term success.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we remain on track and we are reaffirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance and the guidance elements for the operating line that support this.</p>
          <p>Now related to our GAAP guidance, we are: one, increasing our restructuring reserve &#x2013; restructuring guidance rather for 2008 as we continue to drive efficiencies; and two, lowering the estimate for the minimum gain associated with the AZLP restructuring in 2008 based on new information that has come in and basically just update the calculation for the minimum gain.  Accordingly, I'll discuss our adjusted GAAP EPS guidance for 2008 later.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS growth excluding restructuring costs and certain items was driven by several lines in the P&amp;L, all with strong results.  Let's go through these lines individually.  First, the revenue line grew 3%, reflecting strong performance of our new vaccines and Varivax, the continued market leadership for Singulair, and our newly launched pharmaceutical products including as Dick mentioned Januvia, Janumet, and Isentress.</p>
          <p>Secondly, our product gross margin line showed continued strength and this strength is the result of sustained operational efficiencies and favorable mix.  Finally, we benefited in the fourth quarter on the tax line.  I'll go through each of these lines in more detail in a minute but let me start with revenue.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our total revenue was $6.2 billion.  That's a 3% increase over the same period last year as I just mentioned and it's composed of the following: a 1% decline in volume, a 4% increase from foreign exchange, and a 1 point increase from price.  On a full year basis for 2007, our total revenue was $24.2 billion and that's a 7% increase over the same period last year, including a 4% increase in volume, two points of increase from foreign exchange, and no growth from price.  And again, this growth was achieved in a year where we overcame $2 billion of patent expiries.</p>
          <p>Now a major contributing factor to our top line growth continues to be our vaccines business.  In the fourth quarter, the vaccines revenue as reported by Merck was approximately $1.1 billion.  That's a 59% increase as compared to the same period in 2006.  On a full year basis in 2007, our vaccine revenue as recorded by Merck was approximately $4.3 billion. That is a 130% increase over 2006.</p>
          <p>So now let's discuss the specific products beginning with Gardasil.  We continue to be extremely pleased with the progress of Gardasil in terms of the US market penetration and the global rollout.  Based on the international approvals, recommendations, the reimbursements, and launches, we are well positioned to continue to build on the success of this franchise in 2008.  In the fourth quarter, our revenue was $339 million, 268 million of which was in the United States.  Now US Gardasil sales were down sequentially in Q4 due to seasonality and some supply chain dynamics in the public sector and I'd like to discuss each of these separately.  First, seasonality in what we call well visits for the adolescent cohort is heaviest in Q2 and Q3, really not surprisingly given the typical pattern of back-to-school visits by this cohort group.  This results in a 63% of well visits typically occurring in Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in 2007 the public sector sales were heavily weighted towards Q1 and Q2, driven by very rapid adoption by all 55 projects following the November 2006 VFC [Vaccines for Children] contract.  As a result, please note that 64% of the VFC sales occurred in Q1 and Q2.  Now outside the US, the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture recorded end market sales for Gardasil of $231 million in the fourth quarter.  Despite the seasonal spike in the US demand for Gardasil in Q3, global end market sales for Gardasil reached a new high in Q4 and in its first full year on the market, 2007 revenue as recorded by Merck for Gardasil was roughly $1.5 billion.  Gardasil's performance in 2007 has been unprecedented for a vaccine launch.</p>
          <p>Now looking forward in the US, we estimate that more than 7 million 9 to 26 year old females have received at least their first dose of Gardasil and significant opportunity remains with over 29 million 9 to 26 year old females that have yet to receive a dose of Gardasil.  In 2008, we are focusing on increasing penetration across the initial 9 to 26 year old cohort and improving the compliance rates for second and third doses.  We also anticipate expanding the label for Gardasil through incremental indications, including an indication for adult women through 45 years old.  A new indication for adult women would more than double the eligible population for Gardasil in the US.</p>
          <p>To date, Gardasil has been approved in 93 countries, most under accelerated review, and has launched in 76 countries.  In 2008, we anticipate launching Gardasil in over 20 markets and as we continue the global rollout of Gardasil, we look forward to capitalizing on this significant international opportunity.  So as per plan, the international launches are just now beginning to pick up and they will be a significant driver for the franchise in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to Varivax.  In the fourth quarter, revenue was $270 million. That's a 187% increase over prior year.  This strong quarterly result is a function of two major factors.  First, we continue to make progress within the cohorts eligible for second dose varicella in the first full year of the new recommendations.  As of December 31, we estimate 80 to 85% penetration of the routine 4 to 6 year old second dose cohort and 20 to 25% penetration of the cumulative catch-up population.</p>
          <p>Second, as result of the back-to-school surge that makes Q3 the peak period for the youth vaccine business and the unprecedented demand for Varivax in 2007, we were able to ship approximately $75 million in backorders for Varivax in Q4.  By the end of Q4, the backorders for Varivax were pretty much negligible.  Accordingly, Merck is further increasing production of Varivax and expects to meet anticipated market demand for varicella, Measles, Mumps, Rubella vaccine through Varivax and NMR-2.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Singulair.  In the fourth quarter, our Singulair revenue was $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>That's up 20% year over year and on a full year 2007 basis, our revenue was $4.3 billion, up 19% over prior year.  The strong growth for Singulair was driven by continued market share gains in the US for both asthma and allergic rhinitis claims; and secondly, rapid growth in foreign markets where on a full year basis, we saw 27% year over year growth as a result of additional indications and a differentiated product profile.  Despite the recent slowdown in respiratory market share and potential new competitive threats, we continue to anticipate strong growth for Singulair in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Fosamax, our fourth quarter revenue was $796 million, up 1% and on a full year basis for 2007, the revenue was $3 billion.  That's a 3% decline.  In its last full quarter of marketing exclusivity, Fosamax has performed extremely well as a result of differentiation on efficacy, and of course that relates to hip fracture indications and spine fracture indications as well as the relevant managed care status of the brand now and its generic counterpart in the future.  An authorized generic strategy is in place to maximize the value of the franchise after patent expiry.  As we have illustrated with the Zocor expiry in the past, we have the necessary new and inline products to drive revenue growth through this event in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at total revenues including 50% of joint ventures.  In the fourth quarter, our total revenue including the 50% of joint ventures was $7.5 billion. That's a 7% increase if you do the same adjustment in the base period.  On a full year basis for 2007, revenue including 50% of joint ventures was $28.8 billion, a 10% increase over the comparable 2006 figure.</p>
          <p>As we have stated many times, we have the opportunity to capitalize on our robust product portfolio and deliver solid revenue growth through 2010.  Despite certain patent expiries during the timeframe that we talked about, we continue to expect the revenue growth of 4 to 6% including 50% of our JVs on a compounded annual basis and of course, this is driven by our inline products, our launched products, and our potential new products.  And of course, this 4 to 6% as I mentioned includes 50% of the revenues of the joint ventures from our 2005 base.</p>
          <p>Now regarding 2008 revenue guidance, we are reaffirming all elements of our full year revenue guidance.  As always to assist your modeling, we provide a breakdown of the product revenues in our other financial disclosures schedule attached to the press release issued this morning.</p>
          <p>Let's go down the P&amp;L to the next line which is materials and production.  In the fourth quarter, materials and production were $1.5 billion.  This quarter includes 118 million for costs associated with the global restructuring program, primarily related to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment costs.  Excluding these costs, material and production decreased 5% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter product gross margin was 75.3%.  This reflected a 1.9 percentage point unfavorable impact related to the restructuring costs.  Excluding these restructuring costs, we had a fourth quarter PGM of 77.1%.  Just as in previous periods, these results were affected by the final product mix.</p>
          <p>On a full year 2007 basis, our adjusted product gross margin was 76.6%.  Now looking forward in 2008, we continue to anticipate PGM in the 77 to 78% range.  This guidance excludes the portion of the restructuring costs that will be included in product costs and will affect the reported PGM in 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next line, marketing and administrative, our Q4 marketing and administrative expense was $1.7 billion and that's a 27% decrease over prior year.  Let me provide you with some additional perspective on that.  Included in the fourth quarter of marketing and administrative expense is a previously disclosed $455 million gain related to insurance proceeds which the company was awarded in the arbitration with the company's upper level excess product liability insurance carriers.   These claims related to coverage for costs incurred in the Vioxx product liability litigation.  Also as previously disclosed in connection with US Vioxx settlement agreement, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $4.85 billion, which represents the fixed amount repaid by the company to settle qualifying claims.  Note that we have broken out this charge on its own line in the income statements.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, the company did not increase the reserve related solely for future legal defense costs of Vioxx litigation.  However, in the fourth quarter, the company spent approximately $200 million in Vioxx legal defense costs, which resulted in a reserve as of December 31, 2007 of approximately $522 million solely for its future legal defense costs related to the Vioxx litigation, of which approximately $80 million has now been allocated to Merck's anticipated future costs to administer the settlement.  Consequently, as of December 31, 2007 if you add this up, the company had an aggregate reserve of approximately $5.372 billion related to the Vioxx litigation.</p>
          <p>Excluding these charges in 2006 and 2007, M&amp;A decreased 2% in the fourth quarter and increased 4% for the full year.  A significant portion of the increased spending is attributable to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which have increased significantly during last 12 months, as I'm sure you are all aware.  Now of course, we do see this as a benefit on our top line revenues as I mentioned earlier.  But this does increase our marketing and administrative dollars and dollar cost.  So regardless of foreign exchange, we maintain a healthy amount of support behind our growing core and successful new franchises, many of which are continuing their global launch activities market by market in 2008.  Reflecting our commitment to realizing efficiencies throughout the company and optimizing our cost structure, the component of marketing and administrative consisting of selling and general administrative costs that support our core operations remained down over the prior year.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are comfortable with the focus of these investments and it is important to note that we continue our increased focus on cost management and we are seeing the positive benefits of practical, ongoing cost management initiatives including the redesign of many our critical business processes.  Now looking forward in 2008, we continue to anticipate marketing and administrative expense to be approximately 7.8 to $8 billion for 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving to Research and Development, our fourth quarter R&amp;D expenses were $1.4 billion.  That's a 20% decrease year over year.  However, it's a 10% growth if you were to exclude the Sirna in-process R&amp;D charge in the prior year.  Our full year 2007 R&amp;D expenses were $4.9 billion.  That's a 2% increase year over year.  But again if you make the adjustment for the Sirna in-process R&amp;D charge and restructuring in the base period, it's a 15% growth.</p>
          <p>Let me take moment to explain the R&amp;D result.  We remained committed to fully funding our core internal R&amp;D, ensuring the continued success of all compounds in all phases of development.  Our internal R&amp;D growth remains strong.  We continue to invest in lifecycle management programs for Gardasil, Januvia, and Isentress and late stage clinical trials on our MK-0524 program, the MK-0364, MK-0974, MK-7418 from NovaCardia, and MK-8669 from Ariad, and the MK-0822 and our other investigational vaccines.  And I guess it's a good thing that I have to read off that many numbers related to Phase III programs.</p>
          <p>In addition, the company continues an active external collaboration and business development agenda, funding clinical grant programs, third-party scientific collaborations, and licensing transactions; and of course all that is within our R&amp;D line.  Our guidance for R&amp;D in 2008 is that we reaffirm the guidance that we have previously given of 4.7 billion to $4.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Now turning to restructuring costs, the fourth quarter total cost associated with the global restructuring program was $274 million. $118 million, as I mentioned earlier, for asset related charges were included in the materials and production line.  The restructuring cost line reflects $156 million of costs for employee separation and other related costs associated with approximately 1,200 position eliminations, bringing the total to 7,200 since the initiative started.  As we continue to reengineer our business, we will look for opportunities to drive further efficiencies.  As part of the company's restructuring of its operations, additional costs related to site closings, position eliminations, and related costs will be incurred in 2008.  We anticipate the aggregate 2008 pre-tax expense related to these activities to be in the range of 100 to $300 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to equity income.  In the fourth quarter, our equity income from affiliates was $796 million.  Our Q4 performance reflects the continued success of the Merck/Schering-Plough cholesterol franchise in the US and Europe and an increasing contribution from our European vaccine joint venture, Sanofi Pasteur MSD, which I'm sure is not a surprise to any of you.</p>
          <p>Now turning to guidance for equity income, the recent public confusion surrounding the ENHANCE results, although disappointing, has caused us to consider whether any different scenarios regarding the potential impact to the franchise are appropriate.  At this time based on the limited data, it is too early to make informed judgments or to change the long term trajectory that is expected for this franchise.  At this time, we believe we are looking at more of a reaction in the market than a real ongoing trend.</p>
          <p>In addition, the equity income contribution that we record is from a portfolio of several joint ventures and partnerships.  And on an annual basis, there are always positives as well as negatives within the portfolio.  At this time, we feel no need to adjust our 2008 equity income guidance and are not changing our range of 3 billion to $3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the taxes on income, the effective tax rates of 48.7% and 2.8% for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 respectively reflect the impact of the US Vioxx settlement agreement charge, several government investigations charge, and the gain related to the insurance arbitration settlement previously referenced.  Given the charges in the fourth quarter and the full year, it is helpful to look at the non-GAAP tax rate.  Our non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 and full year 2007 were 18.4% and 24.1%.  Of course that 24.1% is at the low end of our guidance range.  These rates reflect the favorable impact of an adjustment related to the termination of Puerto Rico tax benefits and fourth quarter adjustments related to certain federal and state tax items.  Looking forward, we are reaffirming that our full year 2008 tax rate guidance range stays intact, and I would direct you to today's press release for details.</p>
          <p>So coming to the bottom line, our net income and earnings per share, in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $1.6 billion or on a per share basis, that was a loss of $0.75.  However, excluding the restructuring charges, the big litigation reserves, and proceeds from an insurance gain, the Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.80 per share.  On a full year basis, our net income was $3.3 billion and the GAAP earnings per share was $1.49.  And again excluding the restructuring charges, litigation reserves, and proceeds from an insurance gain, the full year 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.20.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to 2008 guidance, I have mentioned several elements as part of the results review and I would direct you to the details of our guidance contained in today's press release.  In summary, we are reaffirming our 2008 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.28 to $3.38 excluding certain items.  On a GAAP basis, we now anticipate GAAP full year 2008 EPS of $3.80 to $4.00.</p>
          <p>So in summary, the company remains on track both in terms of strategy and performance to deliver long term double digit earnings per share growth from 2005 to 2010 excluding certain items.  We have financial strength and we remain fully committed to maintaining our dividend at the current level.  At the same time, we continue to fully invest in all of our key strategic priorities.  2007 represented an important step in a multiyear journey to return Merck to its leadership position in the pharmaceutical industry.  While much has been accomplished over the last 12 months, many opportunities remain and we look forward to capitalizing on them in 2008 and beyond.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Your first question is from Barbara Ryan with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much for taking my question.  Just a short one, Peter, for you and I guess you addressed it.  It was really related to the tax rate and I know you went through the other reasons but I know in Pfizer's case too, there was a lower tax rate in part because of the geographic mix which really swung and then it happened to be in their instance low-tax countries as well. I was just wondering if that played a role as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Barbara, this is Peter; thanks.  Every quarter, we have a little bit of geographic mix impact, although I wouldn't say that that was the primary driver this quarter.  The reason our tax rate was a little off trend in the fourth quarter &#x2013; and again, I am referring to this now on a non-GAAP basis, which is I am assuming what you're looking at.  It was more related to the termination of the Puerto Rico tax benefits that we were seeing and also some fourth quarter adjustments to certain federal and state tax items.  And these were really items that touched our reserves relative to what our expectations were.  As we closed these things out, we were able to then adjust the reserves.</p>
          <p>So it's a &#x2013; each quarter we look at our reserves relative to what we know about our tax position and quite frankly in the fourth quarter, these were more adjustments to that.  So, it's a little bit of mix but it's much more the adjustments related to those three items that caused this benefit.  Again, I would just highlight that it more happened in the fourth quarter.  As we move into 2008, I think we run right back into our ongoing tax rate that we've always talked about both in terms of guidance and what you should expect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Jami Rubin with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir.  Your next question is from John Boris with Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for taking the questions.  Peter, I think you characterized the Zetia &#x2013; Vytorin situation as a reaction in the media rather than an ongoing trend.  Just a three-part question to this, how many weeks or months do you need to be able to establish a trend for the joint venture?  Secondly, are you seeing any impact on your ex-US business from all of the media hype in the United States over the ENHANCE results?  And then the third part, can you just talk about first line use in the United States for Vytorin and what percent of first line use is made up of Vytorin's use?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John; thanks.  So first of all, I think it's hard to &#x2013; the data we have right now is obviously the daily scripts and then we have one weekly tabulation of that, and we're very cautious about reading daily scripts.  We acknowledge that's the only thing that's out there to look at but we often find it doesn't always represent exactly the trend that you want &#x2013; or it doesn't sync well with the weekly and monthly recaps.  So, we are very cautious about looking at daily scripts and drawing broad full-year conclusions on that.</p>
          <p>And I think that quite frankly there just has been a tremendous amount of various points of view and opinions floating around in the market.  It can be a little bit disruptive and create reactions.  I really believe that as the full body of evidence is digested in the medical community and as the full data of course of the trial is released, I would expect to see the market trends really emerge at that point based on a much more complete and scientific evaluation of what this trial really means or doesn't mean.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the ex-US business really has not been affected.  This has been pretty much of a US phenomenon at this point.  And I think again, the international medical community is I think not reacting quite as much to some of the news lines and probably most of the most news lines are a little bit more US centric.</p>
          <p>Related to the first-line usage of Vytorin, to be honest I'm a little bit &#x2013; I apologize not able to answer that question, and I think maybe we can come back to you on that later in the call.  So John, we've noted that.  Let me come back to that later in the call if we have that data.  Okay, I apologize for that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other point, John, is when you think about Zetia and Vytorin ex-US, we certainly had a very strong fourth quarter.  So for example, Zetia grew at 40% versus fourth quarter '06 and Vytorin grew at 84% in Europe.  And in the Far East, it was 67% for Zetia and greater than 100% for Vytorin.  So we continue to see strong growth for Zetia and Vytorin outside of US.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jami.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me?  Okay, great.  Just a comment, Peter; we've discussed this a lot before in the past but your stock is down 25% since the ENHANCE controversy on January 14, and I would just think with $10 billion in cash from operations; you've just received $2.5 billion from AstraZeneca; the Vioxx settlement is now behind you hopefully or really close, I can't think of a better time to announce a major stock buyback program.</p>
          <p>But my question also has to do with again going back to ENHANCE, are you aware that the negative publicity has in any way affected patient dropouts in the IMPROVE-IT trial?  And then my second question and I just want a chance to ask this.  With Gardasil sales outside the US or rest of world sales that you book, your sales were 70 million versus 90 million in the third quarter, yet you are in the process of launching in a number of markets.  Can you give us a sense of what's going on and how we think about that trajectory going forward?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple of questions; why don't we take them in the order that you laid them out, so I think you are just making a comment about the stock buyback.  I think the only thing I would just remind everybody and you see it in our press release is that as of December 31st, we had $5.1 billion approved by our Board under the current buyback authorization.  And that obviously compares to 6 billion that was outstanding as of September.  Clearly the points you made are not lost on us.  We understand exactly what you are saying.</p>
          <p>On ENHANCE &#x2013; on the IMPROVE-IT dropout, I don't think we've seen any reaction at all in that trial pool or participation, nor would we necessarily expect to see that at this point.</p>
          <p>Related to the Gardasil sales, I think clearly one of the things that you do see as you roll out bumps and ins and outs and so forth and some volatility sometimes as you go through quarters.  There were a couple of markets that had pretty heavy activity in Q3 and they didn't have quite the same activity in Q4.  But we don't really read that as a trend at all and these are some of the short term volatility elements that you get in supply chain or just the rollout activity in the market.</p>
          <p>Quite frankly, when we stack up the all the different data points and the approvals and the authorizations and the activity level and the awareness of Gardasil in the international markets that we're looking at, the kind of things we look at when we put together our plan, really Gardasil is poised to have a really good year internationally.  So we aren't really concerned about quarter fluctuations, and I would encourage everybody to look forward and recognize not only the number of approvals that have come through but how many of them were actually accelerated approvals and how good our authorization and reimbursement status is around the world.  So I really think we're headed for something where I wouldn't worry as much about quarterly fluctuations during a launch as really looking at the preponderance of all that positioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would make a few other comments on it, Jami.  First, as we said, Gardasil sales in 2007 were $1.5 billion and we have a tremendous amount of confidence and expect continued growth globally for Gardasil in 2008 above that number, and so we are very confident there as we roll it out throughout the world.</p>
          <p>The second point which we've said in the past is that females 9 to 26, if you look at the EU and US and other high income markets, is about 118 million; and as you know with our December submission for 27 to 45-year-old women, that 118 goes up to 264.  And so there is a substantial uptick and up-growth that we can provide based on the enhanced indications for the vaccine but we're very confident of where Gardasil is going to be in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just go back to John Boris's question if I may for a moment, just with regard to managed care and the use of Vytorin?  So in the aggregate, managed care organizations have all recognized the need for products with excellent LDL efficacy, notwithstanding the availability of generic simva [simvastatin].  In terms of the book of business, we basically indicate that about 93% of the business comes from continued therapy. 4% of our business comes from patients who are new to markets, who are initiating therapy and who have been naive to therapy previously.  2% of it comes from brand switches; and about 1% of utilities with add-on.  So that just gives you some perspective in terms of where the business comes from relative to Vytorin.   So with that, Amanda, could we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question is from Tony Butler with Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Given much of the hoopla from the Congressional investigation, I am curious, Dick, how you're feeling about the regulatory nature of Cordaptive, and do you think that the FDA is actually shy about approving a new therapy despite the fact that they were very bullish about niacin-based outcome studies on the call Friday?  And second to that question is, are you actually increasing the number of details today for Vytorin and Zetia?</p>
          <p>And moreover, could you go over or at least express some comments regarding the future for DTC [direct to consumer] ads?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly speaking first of Vytorin and Zetia, I think that the joint venture between Merck and Schering-Plough in the last few weeks has done an outstanding job of reaching out to healthcare professionals.  Approximately 95% of the top specialists and 90% of the PCPs [primary care physicians] have been called on by our representatives post the press release.  All these representatives were provided with our letter that we have sent and really have follow-up calls and so we're really helping the physicians position products correctly and I think we've got favorable response from that as well as favorable response from the patient ads that have been put in the majority of newspapers.  I think in addition, all the managed care organizations have been contacted by us.  There haven't been any changes and so I think we've done a fairly good job of really focusing on physicians to make sure we could put this in proper context and provide them the information that they needed and we are continuing to get good feedback from that.</p>
          <p>To your question about Cordaptive, it was reassuring on the FDA call on Friday where they said at this point, we believe it is premature to embark on any systemic changes on how we approve lipid lowering drugs because we believe there is a long track record of success in the approach that we have followed over the past several decades.  So I think that's reassuring from not only a Cordaptive basis but to make sure patients stay on their cholesterol lowering products in order to lower their LDL.  If patients would get off it based on some of the media hype that you see, that would be a terrible issue from a healthcare standpoint.  I think that's important and we are evaluating our DTC advertising as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Tony, I would just add that as we stated in December with Peter Kim at the annual business briefing, we went through with you how extensively we have studied Cordaptive as we were approaching this regulatory submission.  So we won't go through that again but I will just point you back as a point of reference to our confidence in terms of the filing relative to those remarks.  So, next question please, Amanda.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; a few question please.  I would have to imagine that you guys have heavily contemplated getting full ENHANCE results out earlier than the late March meeting of ACC, maybe published in something like a medical journal.  Because until results are published, your reps of course are very limited in what they can say to prescribers, so any comments on that?  The second question just going back to DTC, I thought the original word out of Merck was that DTC was temporarily suspended but that it would resume in very short course and I am wondering if that's changed.  And then on Cordaptive, do you expect that will likely go up for an FDA advisory committee?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your last point, we have not been advised of any advisory committee to date.  On your point concerning publishing, we're working with the lead investigator who will submit the ENHANCE study for publication to make sure that that is done as soon as we can; and so that is being certainly studied.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much.  I wanted to ask in light of the ENHANCE trial whether you are changing the sales effort on the ground.  That is you're not changing yet the DTC advertising beyond the temporary suspension.  You've commented on the results of the ENHANCE &#x2013; getting the ENHANCE results out.  What are your reps telling physicians and have you changed that message, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are making sure that we have all available resources for both the joint venture and the companies to make sure that we're able to get out our press release, to make sure that we're able to show the healthcare providers the position we put together from the letter standpoint.  The most critical thing we have to make sure that we're able to continue to deliver the message that LDL lowering is key, and so in some cases for LDL lowering, the patient may do well on a generic simvastatin.</p>
          <p>In many other cases, they won't be able to reach goal.  If that's the case, Vytorin and Zetia are the brand products that we've been able to prove clinically lower LDL to the right impact and have a better chance of reaching goal, and those messages haven't deviated. We've got very safe products in the marketplace and they're a very important part of the management programs. And our professional representatives continue to deliver those messages and ask those questions.</p>
          <p>We are obviously not backing off those two products because they are so important from a health management standpoint and we're making sure that we can answer any questions because with the media hype, there's a great deal of confusion out there and we have obviously the excellent comments by the FDA and the other societies that have come out and said LDL lowering is key to this and quite frankly, there are no better products for LDL lowering than Vytorin and Zetia.</p>

I know you mentioned about the seasonality elements but there were also some other elements &#x2013; and I apologize if you did address this in your prepared comments and I missed it, some catch-up vaccinations and whether or not that's already substantially done as far as you are hearing back in the chickenpox second dose and catch-up there, or any of the other pieces that may be, other than &#x2013; maybe other than seasonality?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>James, this is Peter; thanks.  So a lot of different parts to your question quite frankly; and so yes, there is seasonality in the vaccines business as I mentioned just based on the pattern of well visits for adolescents.  You do see a fairly healthy back-to-school surge.  I also commented on the call and I hope this is directly addressing it that as of year end, we estimate that 80 to 85% penetration of the routine 4- to 6-year old second dose cohorts of Varivax has been achieved, and 20 to 25% penetration of the cumulative catch-up population has been achieved.</p>
          <p>The other thing is we did have some backorders coming out of Q3 and I mentioned that in Q4, we shipped $75 million to completely fulfill that backorder situation.  I think that hits the point that you were asking.  If I missed it, please come back, I apologize.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just a couple of questions.  First on Vytorin and Zetia, can you summarize for us the clinical data that's expected to be presented for Vytorin and Zetia besides ENHANCE over the course of the next 12 months?  And then on Gardasil, just a clarification; Peter, you mention that supply chain dynamics influenced fourth quarter sales.  Was that just the VFC purchasing patents over the course of the year or was there something else that influenced fourth quarter sales?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Roopesh this is Peter.  Let me take in reverse order; I'll take your last question first.  The supply chain dynamics were much more in the public sector; you're right.  So, it was really the VFC contract and what we saw was very rapid adoption and pickup of the product by all the different various public sector sales entities.  And so as a result, that drove a heavier sales volume in Q1 and Q2 of us shipping product out.  And then as we went to the balance of the year, we saw that some of the supply chain items balanced out and get sorted through; and so as we came through the third and fourth quarter, we ended up with a little bit of a rebalancing some of that inventory.  It's a very fragmented system and obviously that is just the dynamic that occurs sometimes as you roll off these vaccines.  It's hard to know exactly also what's going on as we go because there is just an enormous amount of inventory reporting out there, but it was all public sector.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roopesh, with regards to the first part of the question with regard to expectations of clinical data dissemination, obviously we got ACC in March for ENHANCE.  With regard to SEAS, we expect to have the data in 2008 on SEAS.  Then you have SHARP; the expectation is we will have clinical data in 2011; and as we mentioned, IMPROVE-IT, which is still enrolling.  We expect the data to be out in 2011 as well.  So between now and 2011, the four studies will be disseminated.  Next question please, Amanda.</p>

          <p>Yes, to follow up on SEAS and IMPROVE-IT, if you could please characterize what Merck expects out of the SEAS study, that would be helpful.  And also if you could please comment on whether there is the possibility of accelerating IMPROVE-IT or the possibility of an interim look at the data before 2011 that could be made public?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, with regard to those two studies, clearly there are protocols in place and we have shared some of the information with you.  We certainly can't foreshadow when exactly the results will be available nor do we have here the exact setup in terms of the data monitoring boards and how the data will roll out of those studies.  Clearly the protocols are in process and as you know, there is one particular study looking at aortic stenosis and the other one is looking at another patient population.  So across ENHANCE, SEAS, SHARP, and IMPROVE-IT, obviously IMPROVE-IT is the critical outcome study in all of that.  We feel that there will be an awful lot of incremental data that we will gather with regard to these compounds.  Next question please, Amanda.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you; just three quick questions.  Maybe just on Gardasil in Europe, obviously you saw some strong acceleration this quarter.  Can you give us a little more color in terms of what countries were driving this or is this just some initial contracts driving that and maybe where you stand versus your competitor in those markets with regards to any tenders that have occurred?  For Gardasil in the US just to clarify, do you expect the vaccine for children sales to continue to be front half loaded going forward or is that really just an effect of what you're mentioning of the initial roll out?  And then finally if you can just give us an update on potential timing of FDA sign off for new batches of varicella bulk, please?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take if I can the second one, which was the vaccines for children dynamic and supply chain.  Good question.  We don't anticipate this to be an annual cycle at all.  This is very much an artifact of the approval and the new contract that was established in late 2006.  And so then the market reaction is picking up the supply and so forth, so this is not an annual cycle we had expected.  It is much more related to if you will an approval and change in conditions since the market reacted to that.  I don't think that there will be any expectation of seasonality per se in the supply dynamics for the public sector.</p>
          <p>Related to the Gardasil international markets, in some ways &#x2013; or the international rollout, first of all, I think it's way too early to have a lot of input on tenders and so forth.  What I would say is that we don't see anything that's an unusual bias at this point relative to any of the markets rolling out.  Typically, you do see certain markets pick up vaccine rollouts internationally a little more rapidly than others but in some of the bigger markets, obviously you are planning a role, but I don't think there is anything really that's a strange dynamic let's say in the rollout at this point.  In fact, I would say that all the numbers are relatively early days, and so we're just beginning the rollout and expect 2008 to be an interesting year to watch.  Maybe more specifically, Dick, do you anything you can comment on?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the bulk issue with the FDA for varicella, it's too early yet to tell exactly when we would finalize our submission and it would have approval.  As I said on our last call, we continue to see excellent progress and excellent potency out of the lots that are being manufactured, and so we are putting all of the required data together and the submission for the FDA.  We can't give the date yet for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Just a couple of quick questions, can you give us a little bit of visibility on when the 30-month stay expires on Nexium and how &#x2013; any possibility of a Nexium patent settlement would impact the contribution to Merck from AZLP?  If there were a settlement, it's unclear to me how that would be booked into the overall scope of the partnership.</p>
          <p>Just a second quick question, Peter, you mentioned new competitive threats in asthma and allergic rhinitis.  Can you just give us a little bit more of a sense of what those new competitive threats are in your view?  And also last year we had a very, very strong allergy season and the seasonality in Singulair was high.  Can you just give us a sense &#x2013; do we have a any visibility right now on whether or not that season is expected to be equally strong this year or not?  And then just a last question quickly on Q4 costs related to the vaccine recalls that we saw, were those material in any way and can we expect those to recur or not recur in the first half of this year?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you get the award for the most comprehensive set of questions and let me quickly go through them, but I'm afraid if I miss one we need to recap so I'm may get a little group help here.  So first, let me start back with Nexium and basically the stay goes through April of this year, so that's the date where you would see the 30-month stay would expire.  Quite frankly after that, we have no idea what might happen.  However, obviously we are going through normal legal steps right now and working on that.  If there was some sort of a settlement, it's unclear what that settlement would be but it's unclear that it would really affect 2008 anyway.  That would be something that would all be in the works; so it would be way too early to comment on that.  But I'd say at this point, we're following normal steps and normal legal processes related to that, so nothing really new to report nor any sense of anything new that would happen really in that situation.  Bruce Kuhlik is with us.  Bruce, do you have any other comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Peter; thanks.  I mean the stay does &#x2013; the initial one expires in April but the fact that the stay expires does not have any bearing &#x2013; meaning actually that a generic would launch at that time and we are continuing actively to defend the litigation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the asthma season, I think it is a little bit too early to start reading into the asthma season.  As the CFO, I would love to have that crystal ball but at this point, I just don't have it so we just have to play that season as it goes.  So, we really don't have any leading indicators and in fact, I'm not sure there are.</p>
          <p>On the competitive threats relative to Singulair, really what I was referring to is just new brand entrants in 2008 that we are anticipating.  It's the normal list.  I think we're pretty confident in the guidance we've given for 2008 on Singulair; so I didn't mean to create any concern. I just want to highlight it.  Singulair has just been barreling ahead, as you mentioned partly because of the asthma seasons we've been experiencing and so forth.  And to have a $4.3 billion drug growing 19% full year in 2007 is something that is pretty great.  On the other hand, what we're just highlighting is there are other factors.  As you say, we're not sure we'll have only have these vaccines in asthma season and there are new competitors coming into the market.  So that was all I was highlighting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Seamus, with regard to your question on the cost of the recall during the quarter, it wasn't material in any particular way.  So let me just give you some perspective.  The total cost of the recall was approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter.  Approximately half of that cost was associated with sales credits to customers; and the other half was associated with inventory that we had to write down that we had in the supply chain so we didn't consider the PedvaxHIB com [Comvax] recall to be a material event to our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think that covers all the points that were asked.  So, good list of questions, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Graeme, and thanks for joining us on the call today.  As we have already stated, we are very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2007 results.  We are not wasting any time looking in the rear view mirror and congratulating ourselves.  We're proud of how far we've come, but we have tremendous amount to do before we hit that finish line.  2008 represents the halfway point towards our long term guidance and new challenges pop up everyday.  We begin our 2008 with a sense of urgency and a sharp focus on what we need to do.  We'll continue to work hard to grow our pipeline and reengineer our business to deliver sustained revenue and earnings growth beyond 2007.  I think it is also important to note that in addition to all the activities we are talking about, we have 150 country launches in 2008 for our products and vaccines.  That's 150 new product launches.</p>
          <p>So thank you again.  We appreciate your interest and participation.  Operator, thank you very much for your assistance.</p>
