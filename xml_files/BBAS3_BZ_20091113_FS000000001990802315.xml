      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Ivan Monteiro speaking, good morning to you all.  Welcome to our third quarter 2009 results conference call.  Before passing the floor to Geovanne, who will give us more details about the R$6 billion results in the first nine months of 2009, I would like to drag your attention on some important points.</p>
          <p>The third quarter results show us that the strategic decisions, that we have made forward the opportunities present in 2009 have seemed correct.  We have included our market share and consolidate our leadership in important segments of the banking industry, despite the positioning of our peers.  As a consequence in the credit market, we have grabbed more than 20% market share surpassing R$300 billion credit granted supported by an impressive growth in our funding base.  Banco do Brasil has retained its leadership in the banking industry with total assets amounting R$685 billion.</p>
          <p>During 2009, in addition to the winning strategy for organic growth, we have made important movements towards acquisition and its <mark type="inaudible" />.  The acquisition of Banco Nossa Caixa has already presented results to be highlighted.  We initially closed the deal in March 2009.  Its loan portfolio came from R$13.8 billion to R$19.3 billion as of September.  Just considering payroll loans, Nossa Caixa has grown 66% since the end of the first quarter, reaching R$10.6 billion.</p>
          <p>In September, we conclude this strategic alliance with Banco Votorantim, through which Banco do Brasil becomes an important player in car financing.  Despite the achievement in the banking segment, we have challenges to guarantee a sustainable generation of non-financial revenues.  Geovanni will show us that we have continued to present an impressive increase in car and insurance business, not forgetting to mention the increasing revenue in capital markets operations. Regarding the insurance business, we've recently announced we intend to reinforce that business, restructuring our company.  Along with devoting our efforts to important business fronts, we have been always trying to identify opportunities to increase our productivity gain.</p>
          <p>We have been able to extend operational revenues and to keep administrative expenses under control.  Following the trends of earlier years, Banco do Brasil's cost to income ratio has accounted an improvement.  Banco do Brasil's performance mostly confirms the guidance we have for the market.  We are confident that we'll reach our goals on the back of the good prospects of the Brasilian economy and banking industry.</p>
          <p>We will also like to highlight, as announced into the market, that the SEC rated Banco do Brasil registration of its level I ADR program.  It is an important step to increase our access to investor's interest in our company.  It is a measure to increase our liquidity including in the local market.</p>
          <p>Well, now I will hand over the word to Geovanne.  At the end, I will work on any questions you'd like to pose.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ivan.  I wish you all a good day.  Moving forward to slide number three of the presentation.  We bring you some macroeconomic information about the Brasilian economy.  You can see in the top left graph that the price index measured by the twelve-month IPCA achieved 4.3% below the rest of the 2008 and below the inflation target of 4.5%, established by the Monetary Authority for 2009.  Therefore, the Central Bank was able to maintain the reduction in the Selic rate, a reduction of around 500 basis points.</p>
          <p>In September 2009, the Selic reached its lowest level ever registered at 8.75%.  On the bottom left graph, we can see the Brasilian payroll index, which is a good reference for the economic recovery in Brasil, one that has a direct relation to the purchase power of families, which affects economic activity.  It is important to observe as well, the unemployment index in Brasil shown on the bottom right graph. As we can see it did not have a strong variation during the crisis.  In the post-crisis world, despite the turbulence, Brasil was able to prove it deserves the world's confidence.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I would like to go to slide number four; where we have a picture of credit in Brasil, reflecting the direct consequences of international crisis.  As shown in the top left graph, loan to GDP ratios reached 45.7% as of September 2009, when the total loan portfolio on the banking industry reached 1.3 trillions of reais, with an increase of several percent market share in the total balance of credit from 33% in the second quarter of '09 to 38% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Credit disbursement also confirms that the activity movement has maintained its pace.  As we can observe on the top right graph, the disbursement of credit to individuals and businesses has been increasing steadily for the past years.</p>
          <p>With regards to individuals, on the bottom left graph, we see the evolution of the main three lines of credit with an impressive increase in mortgage loans in the first nine months of 2009.  It is also important to observe on the bottom right graph that despite the increased volume of deposit loans, banks have reinforced the provisions coverage.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number five, we see that Banco do Brasil's counter cyclical behavior proves to be correct.  In the first nine months of 2009, led by the expansion of 27% loan, especially in consumer finance, which grew 75.6%, Banco do Brasil's total assets grew 31.5% and achieved a total volume of R685.7 billion, and this includes the total assets, assets worth the same by the growth now in our deposits space, a growth around 20%.</p>
          <p>I'll remind you that Nossa Caixa is consolidated &#x2013; is being consolidated since the second quarter of '09 and from this quarter on we also have this consolidated balance sheet of Banco Votorantim on a proportional basis.  And information of Banco do Brasil's standalone will be highlighted during the call.</p>
          <p>On slide number six, we can see that despite the challenges brought by the crisis, Banco do Brasil kept an ROE above 20% and also maintained efficiency gains.  From January to September, Banco do Brasil's recurring net income amounted five billion reais corresponded to an annualized return on equity of 21.6% in the same period.</p>
          <p>Net interest income reached $R23.8 billion and the global spread remained at 6.8%.  Fee income amounted $R9.9 billion and the tax control on that administrative expenses which totaled $R13.7 billion led to efficiency gains that is stated 43% in the period.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number seven, we can confirm that the success of the strategies adopted by Banco do Brasil was supported by its distribution network and its technology infrastructure.  At the end of the third quarter of '09, Banco do Brasil had more than 904,000 employees, more than 17,000 points of service, almost 44,000 ATM and 92.2% of customer's transactions were done through automated channel.  Definitely, the step forward taken by Banco do Brasil anticipating the recovery of our economy, opened new business opportunities, at the same time it consolidated Banco do Brasil's market share.</p>
          <p>On the slide number eight, we can observe that Banco do Brasil's main leadership are basically in total assets, in the total funds including total deposits, demand deposits, savings account, time deposits, assets under management.  But I would also like to highlight the amazing performance of Banco do Brasil in the credit market.  For the first time now in our history we have achieved more than 20% market share in the domestic loan market.  Regarding this point, I would now also like to highlight that the maintenance of the leadership in the credit markets was supported by the anticipation in the consumer finance book which also registered a historic market share of 22.3% as a result of Banco do Brasil's strategic decision of focusing on this segment, that as far as back in 2005 and was boosted during 2009.</p>
          <p>On slide number nine, we can see the evolution of Banco do Brasil's net income and return on equity.  For the first nine months of this year net income amounted almost R$6 billion corresponding to an annualized return on equity of 25.9%.  If we do not consider the one-off the recurring net income reached R$5 billion and the recurring return on equity was 21.6% annualized, close to the higher range of our 2009 guidance.  In the quarter, net income reached R$2 billion and the recurring net income was R$1.764 billion.  The recurring results in the quarter corresponded to an annualized return on equity of 23.1%.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about the recurring results on slide number 10, we can observe the evolution of the net interest income which grew 36% in the nine months comparison lead by the expansion in the loan book.  It is important to notice that in the third quarter of '09, net interest income touched the level achieved in the previous quarter, totaling R$8.3 billion compared to the second quarter of '09 it decreased 2%.  However, compared to the third quarter of '08 it increased 38%.  We can also see that in the third quarter we saw some relative stability of our financial expenses and an increasing volume of credit loan revenues.  This expansion in loan revenues was supported by the increase in the average volume of operation, which compensated the behavior of spreads, due to the reduction on the Selic rate.  Loan revenues grew 4.7% in the quarter and 18% in one year.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 11, we see that the expansion of the net interest income was followed by the evolution in Banco do Brasil's total funding.  Here we can also observe the behavior of the funding cost over Selic.  While we see an increase of 52.5% in Banco do Brasil's total funding balance in 12 months and 16.5% in the quarter we can also observe that the total funding cost when compared to the Selic rate grew 420 basis points in the annual comparison and 280 basis points in the quarterly comparison.  This behavior was due planned by the reduction of 500 debt in the Selic rate which impacted mainly the time deposits slide.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, time deposits help in increasing in the cost of funding over the benchmark interest rates. However, due to the consolidation of Nossa Caixa, which added significant volumes of judicial deposits to the total funding. There was an increase in the fixed rate cost on the funding side, besides that the relative cost of savings deposits also increased since it's duration is also fixed at 6% plus TR. Anyway even with the changes in this scenario, Banco do Brasil will still have a very competitive funding cost due to the stability of growing these liabilities in the higher phase than the banking industry.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 12, we can observe that in the yearly and in the quarterly comparison, the behavior of the global spread in each portfolio, the spread in each portfolio, we can also see that the focus in consumer finance is guaranteeing more resilience to Banco do Brasil spread besides the reduction in the Selic rate. Global spread is keeping its downward trend. Business portfolio spread reached 7.2% in nine months due to a higher share of working capital in that portfolio. Regarding the spreads in the individual loan book, which reached 19.8% in the year and 20.6% in Q3 '09. We see a steady decrease due to the concentration of loans with lower risk and a lower margin such as payroll and auto loans. The reduction in the agribusiness's spread, which came from 5.1 to 4.9% in the quarter, is explained mainly by the changes in the portfolio mix with the reduction in the relative share of operations of individuals and with equalized resources, which have better margins.</p>
          <p>On the right hand of the slide, we can see the behavior of Banco do Brasil's global spread calculated by the net interest income over earning assets and which came from 7.3 in Q2 '09 to 6.7% in Q3 '09. In the nine months comparison, this global spread reached 6.8% and if we compare &#x2013; if we look to Banco do Brasil standalone, it would have been 6.6%.</p>
          <p>Another way to analyze the global spread is to compare it with the Selic rate. You can see that Banco do Brasil is increasing its financial intermediation revenues in relation to the accumulated benchmark interest rate. While, in 2008 when the annualized Selic rate was at 12.5. The ratio of global spread over accumulated Selic was 56.9%. In the first nine months of 2009 this ratio went up to 65.2% and the trend is to maintain &#x2013; to be maintained at a higher level as long as the Selic rate remains stable and as along as Banco do Brasil continues to grow faster its individual loan book.</p>
          <p>Once again, it is important to remind you that Banco do Brasil has been very successful in compensating the drop in the Selic rate by the changes in the mix of the portfolio and by the growth in the volume of loans.  There is also a difference between the timing of funding and credit generation.  The increase on funding is faster than on credits, which drives the excess funding to operations with lower margin such as securities and repos.</p>
          <p>Going to slide number 13, we bring you a breakdown of our loan book. The balance of R$285.5 billion of loans of Banco do Brasil represents 41.2% growth for the past 12 months and 60.1% increase in the quarter. As I mentioned on slide eight, this performance allows Banco do Brasil to surpass 20% market share and this is a very outstanding mark. We are still growing more than the banking industry and the highlight here obviously as this expansion is definitely in the individuals loan book, which grew more than 97% over the quarter of, over the third quarter of '08 and 24% in the quarter. What I wanted to say here is that as we have anticipated the individual loan book is gaining relative shares in Banco do Brasil's total loan portfolio, especially over the agribusiness book. This individual loan book came from 21.5% in September '08 to 30% in this quarter as a percentage of the whole loan book.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the slide 14, we bring you a breakdown in of our loan book segregating what is Banco do Brasil's standalone and the loans generated by Nossa Caixa and Banco Votorantim.  Looking at Banco do Brasil standalone, Banco do Brasil had an organic growth of 21.5% in 12 month, above the 60.9% achieved by the banking industry and a growth of 4.4% in the quarter below by 100 bps roughly, the industry growth.  However, it is important to remind you that our growth was impacted negatively by the relative stability of the Agribusiness portfolio that remains flat in the quarter.  Regarding acquisitions, it is worth to mention that the quarterly increase of 13.2% seen in Nossa Caixa's portfolio already reflect Banco do Brasil's synergy expectations with this acquisition.  Regarding the partnership with Votorantim, the volume of R$20.5 billion of credit that was added to the Banco do Brasil's portfolio coming from Votorantim also comes from our expectations with regard to this deal.</p>
          <p>Going to slide 15, we have the breakdown of our consumer finance operation, which grew 97% in 12 months allowing Banco do Brasil to achieve a 22.3% market share.  This performance was boosted by the extension on payroll and other loans.  In 12 months we increased the payroll loan portfolio by more than 130% and the performance in the quarter was quite impressive as well around 15%.  Banco do Brasil, Nossa Caixa and Banco Votorantim together have R$34 billion in payroll loans more than 30% market share.  The other loans business was also boosted by the partnership with Votorantim &#x2013; increasing more than 135% of volumes in the quarter and 242% in one year.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we have the business loan portfolio that reached R$117 billion, which highlights here to the medium and large-sized company, which even with the exchange rate variation grew 42.2% in one year and 18.8% in the quarter showing the confidence of Banco do Brasil in the production sector in our country.</p>
          <p>Operations with SMEs increased 28.5% in the last 12 months and 4.2% in the quarter.  We must say here that we took advantage of our relationship with business clients in order to supply their credit needs in the crisis.  And this is a strategy guaranteeing, besides the growth in volume, the improvement in profitability with those clients as we saw on slide 12.</p>
          <p>Moving onto slide 17, we can observe that loans granted to SMEs through the so-called Fundo Garantidor de Opera&#xE7;&#xF5;es, the acronym is FGO, which is a private collateral fund which we source it from its partners comprised by the National Treasury and public and private financial agent.  These funds aims at guaranteeing part of the credit risk contributing to the SME's access to credit.  FGO is a strategic to Banco do Brasil to increase even further credit supply to companies with annual turnover up to R$15 million.  Nowadays, at Banco do Brasil, the lines in which the FGO can be used are those for working capital line and the maximum amounts guarantees is in range between 60 to 80% of the total volume of the credit depending on the kind of guarantee limited to a maximum guarantee of R$150,000 per loan, depending on the operation.</p>
          <p>The coverage is for the whole maturity of the loan and the company faced to FGO and the guarantee granting fee.  This fee is attached to the kind of operation any proportional to the maturity and the amount of the loan granted.  In more than two months, Banco do Brasil has achieved more than 37,000 SME clients through the FGO.  From the R$1.1 million granted in this, for use in this fund, R$795.8 million are granted by the funds.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we have the balance of the foreign trade and FX Operations which portfolio reached R$24.3 billion in September '09, an increase of 19.3% in 12 months.  Here I would like to highlight that the exchange rate valuation that reflects directly the balance of those operations.  We can see that the balance of this growth remains actually flat.  However, if we look at the dollar denominated balance, you will realize that the U.S. dollar's balance had an increase of 28% in 12 months and 14.2% in the quarter.  Banco do Brasil is the leader in imports and exports financing with market shares in the FX markets of more than 31 and 73% respectively and disbursements of more than $3 billion and $2.8 billion respectively as well.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we can see that Banco do Brasil is still the largest lender to the Brasilian agribusiness with a balance of R$68 billion in the portfolio, a 12.4% growth in 12 months. And that corresponds to a 60% market share in the total rural of credits in the country.  In the 2009, 2010 crops, Banco do Brasil expect to disburse R$39.5 billion to this segment.  It is important to highlight that we have already disbursed R$15 billion in the '09 same crop.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, we bring some information that allows us to be very confident about the other business book, about the quality of the agribusiness book.  On the left side of the slide, we have the working capital loans contracted with insurance for the 2009/2010 crop.  From the $R5.6 billion already disbursed in working capital loans to the sector, 66.7% were insured, higher than the 61.6% insured during the previous crop. And from this amount insured, it is worth to mention that 90% is being reinsured by the insurance companies as can be seen in the table on the bottom left hand side of the slide.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side of the slide, we have a geographic distribution of the rural insurance per region.  Southern and Mid-West regions have the highest insured coverage, while southeastern part of Brasil has the smallest coverage due to some kind of crops that are planted in that area that do not allow insurance, such as the sugarcane.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, we see in the left graph that the provision expenses decreased 4.9%, the ratio between those expenses over average growth is already at 4.7%.  Past due loans over 90 days shown in the yellow line in the right &#x2013; left hand &#x2013; sorry, the left hand side of the graph, came from 3.3 to 3.6%.  However, delinquency ratio continues to be even better than the average industry that is about 4.4%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 22, we can see that over the last years Banco do Brasil's delinquency has been substantially below the average industry.  In the last quarter while past due loans over 90 days in the individual portfolio in the banking industry had an increase of 45 coming from 8.6 to 8.2%, Banco do Brasil had a decrease of 50 basis points dropping from 5.7 to 5.2%.  Reflecting years of growth in payroll loans mainly.  But it's important to highlight the gap between the delinquency number in the individual loan book and the average delinquency for the whole industry.  And we could use that delinquency for both in individuals and business portfolio has already picked.  And going specifically to analyze the business portfolio, you can see that that the quality of this book is better than the average industry, past due loans more than 90 days in the business book in Banco do Brasil now sits at 3.1%.  It has reduced when compared to the previous quarter. While in the industry, the delinquency kept on increasing, going up to 4%.</p>
          <p>On the slide 23, we bring you some vintage information from our individual loan book. I believe that Banco do Brasil is the only bank that is disclosing this information.  And what we can picture out of this slide is that the newest vintages are very much better rates, much lower delinquency.  These gray boxes here shows all the credit sale that we did and that's why you see this huge drop here in the curve.  I believe that the important message here is that newest vintages like 2008 and 2009 are much better risk situation and these vintages, they do not show huge deterioration.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 24, we would like to highlight some information about Banco Votorantim.  Although impact of the prices over the credit quality are well known in the industry, it is worth to highlight that the credit quality of Banco Votorantim is without any doubt much better than the quality from its peers.  Votorantim's expertise in this segment is clear when you see the delinquency ration of 3.4% in a portfolio that is comprised more than 83% by used cars.  And Banco do Brasil expects to benefit from this partnership improving even further the quality of this auto loan book, which the interest in nowadays is close to the 5% collateral.</p>
          <p>Going through to slide number 25, we bring you some information about our fee base businesses.  Fee income has amounted to 9.9 billion reais from January to September an increase of 13.1%. If we look Banco do Brasil on a standalone basis this percentage &#x2013; this increase was around 6% total in line with our guidance that is between &#x2013; and it was between 5 to 8%.  I would like to remind you that in the second quarter of '09, although we had a growth in our fee income base quite below the average guidance range, we decided to maintain our estimates because we believe we would be able to recover our fee income, and the capital market business was very important to this recovery.</p>
          <p>But I would also like to highlight the performance of our credit card business whose total turnover increased by more than 34% and that is an important fee income to our base. I would like also to mention the performance of our insurance business. Insurance business as you can see in the right bottom part of the slide has increased each year in the total Banco do Brasil's net income from 10.8% as of September '08 to 15% for the nine months of 2009.  Our long-term goal is to make this year of insurance business as a percentage of the total net income to increase to 20% for the next four years.</p>
          <p>Going to slide number 26, I would like to talk now the performance of our administrative expenses; administrative expenses grew in line with the business growth and also with the acquisitions.  The reason why our administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2009 grew by 24% was mainly <mark type="inaudible" /> consolidation of not the actual number.  But I would like to call you attention to the third quarter numbers, as you can see here our total administrative expenses remained practically flat.</p>
          <p>I would like to call the attention to the increase in personnel expenses as a consequence of the salary raise <mark type="inaudible" /> all bankruptcy in Brasil.  The due date for salary negotiation was September and it has already impacted partially our third quarter numbers.  However, the management of Banco do Brasil took a very strong decision to reduce cost and we can see the performance of this decision in other admin expenses that in the quarterly comparison was decreased due to this decision and other administrative expenses dropped by 3.3%.</p>
          <p>And on slide 27, we tried to figure out what would be Banco do Brasil's administrative expense performance excluding Nossa Caixa.  As you can see here in this slide excluding one-off expenses and Nossa Caixa expenses our administrative expenses would have grown around 11%, total in line with our guidance that is between 9 to 12% growth for the full year of 2009.</p>
          <p>On slide 28, it is important to highlight that the performance of our BIS ratio already reflects our business growth and acquisitions.  We ended the quarter with a BIS ratio of 13%, already consolidating the year Banco Votorantim balance sheet on a proportional basis as we had already stated, but I would like to mention that Banco do Brasil has recently issued a perpetual bond of $1.5 billion in October and a subordinated debt of 1 billion reais in November, and once these two debt operations are approved by the Central Bank, Banco do Brasil will be allowed to add them to our Tier I and Tier II respectively, and on a pro forma basis our BIS ratios would be increased 13.9%.</p>
          <p>Definitely this business growth strategy was very important to allow Banco do Brasil recover its assets leadership and we have recovered this leadership in the last quarter and we have maintained an even increased the gap between us and the <mark type="inaudible" />; Banco do Brasil has increased its size three times over the past seven years roughly. And I would like to highlight that for the past 12 months due to this organic growth and acquisition strategy Banco do Brasil was able to grow its asset base by almost 50%.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, finally I would like to mention our guidance. The performance we have posted in this for the first nine months of 2009, it has confirmed almost all of our guidance and we are maintaining them for the full year of 2009 and then making no adjustments and this guidance considers only Banco do Brasil on a standalone basis.</p>
          <p>And finally, I cannot forget to mention that this consistent performance of Banco do Brasil has been priced by the markets, Banco do Brasil have outperformed the benchmark in Brasil and also its peers in the <mark type="inaudible" /> with more than 100% appreciation of all the shares. However, we are still being traded at a discount when compared to our large &#x2013; to our private peers despite the consistent performance of Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Well, these are the major points I would like to highlight during this call and before opening the floor to the Q&amp;A session, I cannot forget to mention that Banco do Brasil will host its first Banco do Brasil Day in our head office in Brasilia. We will start this Banco do Brasil Day on Monday 23rd November, 23 on Monday with Aldemir hosted by our CEO and we will spend the whole Tuesday, November 24 with meetings between investors and the Board of Officers and all the remaining Directors of Banco do Brasil to discuss our strategies and what are the perspectives of Banco do Brasil for the upcoming year.</p>
          <p>So I would like to invite all of our investor base, domestic investors or foreign investors, we will also make this by today available in our website review, webcasted in Portuguese and make the translation to English as well. I forgot to mention that in our Portuguese conference call, but I would like to highlight and invite everybody to participate and for further information please contact the IR department.</p>
          <p>So now we can go for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Hello everyone. My question is related to your capital base even after incorporating the subordinated debt and perpetual bond, your BIS ratio on your Brasilian guidelines is 13.9% is well below the levels of your private sector peers. May be you can highlight how you feel about that particularly given the rapid rate of growth of asset growth that you've been showing.</p>
          <p>And secondly we saw in the quarter a significant increase in the operational risk and I believe this already incorporates the acquisitions of Nossa Caixa and Banco Votorantim, but if you can confirm that and give us a sense if that should change significantly going forward in more than double I think, the R$2.5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jason, for your question. I would like Ivan to address your first question about the capital base and the growth perspective and ask our Risk Director, Mr. Ren&#xEA; Sanda, to address your second question about operational risk increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. About the BIS ratio, we are comfortable that we can increase or we can, we don't have income strength, we grew our credit portfolio and continued focus on our condition strategy because as we disclosed, we forecast our BIS ratio, and when it's close to 13% we start some actions just to put in place and return for a level that is over the minimum &#x2013; the minimum that the regulator in Brasil requires, that is 11%.</p>
          <p>But now we are focused just to put in place these ADR programs. We believe that the ADR will start to increase <mark type="inaudible" /> our share and we are focused on the addition of this and I believe that during 2010, if we're still running the bank in the same pace, we believe that the competition is going to increase and we don't believe that we continuously increasing our credit portfolio at the same pace that we did in 2009, but we are focused and we pay attention on this. If we believe we've got to take the measures necessary to increase the capital structure, reinforce the capital structure of the bank.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jason, this is Ren&#xEA;, Risk Management Director. Regarding your question of operational risk requirement, the main reason is the change of the percentage ratio from Central Bank of Brasil. We calculate an increase of 1.3 billion reais because the requirement changed the percentage from &#x2013; if I don't mistake, from 50% to 80%. So this is &#x2013; the ratio is based on &#x2013; is a basic approach to corporational risk. It is the same for all marks in Brasil. The increase regarding Banco Votorantim and Nossa Caixa is minimal in this regard. The main reason was the increase in the percentage. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's was circular &#x2013; I think it was 33, 83, went from 50% to 80%, so the impact from the acquisitions was small?</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning everyone, congratulations on the results. I have one question regarding the insurance business. I mean, in terms of your strategy going forward, do you have an expectation of how much you expect the insurance to represent of your earnings in the future, and what are the areas that you'd be focusing on in terms of growth? And also on the Banco Votorantim acquisition, what is the expectation in terms of revenue synergies for Banco Votorantim for next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to ask Ivan to answer your second question, and I will address your first question, helping the original manager that is responsible for the insurance business.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned during the quarter this conference call, our long-term goal is to make the insurance business represent roughly between 20 to 22% of Banco do Brasil's net income; and we believe there are tremendous opportunities, not only in the life insurance business and in the car insurance business, but also in the P&amp;C insurance. We have the acceleration development program of Brasil that are opening very good opportunities in the P&amp;C insurance business. We expect that the World Cup will also increase opportunities in this business, and also the Olympics.</p>
          <p>So we know that this market tends to increase considerably in the upcoming years and this is a very strategic part of our business we would tend to focus on. I would like to pass to Ivan to make additional comments, if he wants, and to answer your second question regarding synergies with Banco Votorantim. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you <mark type="inaudible" /> Marcelo, I believe that the JV, which Banco Votorantim was focused on to increase the car finance, to increase the participation of Banco do Brasil in car financing in Brasil. That was a very good decision, and you can see the number that we disclosed that we are improving a lot in this area.</p>
          <p>Another synergy we can capture is in the payroll loan. The payroll loan we are the leader, but I believe that we will increase this participation because of this JV with Banco Votorantim.</p>
          <p>Another important thing that you need to see is that we create with this partnership an important stability in the funding basis of Banco Votorantim. Therefore, we have a lot to increase the generation of the new assets in Banco Votorantim, especially in the car financing. That's why it's the main reason that adding today to the car finance, the payroll and I believe in customer markets, we are able to capture some synergies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, everybody. Good morning. So, I'd like to make two questions. The first one related to your ADR programs. I have seen a migration onto similar stocks with ADRs after the implementation of IOF taxes, onto international capital flows. How much do we expect to add in terms of ADTV with your ADR level 1, recently approved? And for when do you plan to have ADR levels 2 and 3?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to margins. We noted a significant compression on that interest margin this quarter. And as a matter of fact, you're below your guidance on global spreads. Despite growing faster onto retail, you also mentioned that higher contribution of lower EBITDA portfolios have harmed overall margins. Would those lower EBITDA products have lower spreads than corporate loans, and would you point out in which products outside auto and payroll, you have observed the most significant spread compression? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. We are focused on the Level 1. The decision was to increase the liquidity of the share. We don't forecast any &#x2013; any numbers, specific number. And we didn't make any decision about Level 2 or 3. We are now focused on fully place the ADR Level 1 as soon as possible, and we believe that in our opinion, we increased the liquidity of our share, but we don't have any specific number for ADTV, and as the same for the decision about the Level 2 or 3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't know, but it seems that my line was broken also here, I didn't hear what Geovanne told me. I just like to understand what we expect outside auto and payroll, landing other, I know many of those margins who be heavier going forward, and in which products we have been exerting the more significant margin compression?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ivan de Souza Monteiro. We don't believe that we're going to see much more &#x2013; I believe that the competition especially came in from the capital markets. We have put a lot of pressure on margins, especially in quarter three, but we didn't see this behavior for the retail. We have the payroll loans that you know that the margins is small, but it's a very good margin because of the NPL is so small. And you don't see the compression on the middle markets and revenues that the competition came in from our peers, that came in from the capital markets, we put a lot of pressure on the margins for the large &#x2013; especially for the large corporates. But we are pretty confident that we're learning if the participation continues <mark type="inaudible" /> participation of the retail and the total credit and that would prevent Banco do Brasil to keep our profitability especially for ROE below &#x2013; sorry, above 20%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. I have a few questions, if I may. The first one is what would have been the impact on your net income if your consolidated return came in the income statement this quarter?</p>
          <p>Second, can you give us an update on cost synergies for Nossa Caixa; what is the current estimate of what cost savings may be and the timing to extract those? And, finally if you can share with us your preliminary views on 2010, what do you think volume growth is going to be on the expenses, fees, and kind of like the key line items? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're forecasting that our &#x2013; the competition is going to increase in Brasil, but we believe that the GDP, the forecast of the GDP is now is a kind of consensus, really creates a lot of opportunities not only for Banco do Brasil, for the other banks. With the acquisition of Nossa Caixa, with the acquisition of Banco Votorantim we're not forced to running to agree that we can &#x2013; you can see on the numbers that we disclosed, the participation on the car finance and the participation on the payroll business.</p>
          <p>Nossa Caixa, we will capture the synergy we disclosed on our website, a report talking about the synergies, and we believe that the majority of this is going happen in 2010. But we keep what we forecast on our websites. Talking about the competition again, we believe that that will create a lot of opportunities because of this forecast, the increasing of the GDP. We do not see any possibility at this moment to increase the inflation in Brasil. The inflation is under control. The benchmark rate, we still keep it below 10%, and the conditions for the improvement, and especially the internal markets in Brasil, the consumer in Brasil, I believe that's maybe too late for the question as to what is going to happen with the revenues, but I would like that on average, we're pretty confident about the performance of the Brasilian economy. That is very good for us. That help us to reduce the NPL and to reduce the provisions that it will be able to continue as we're going to do. I am sorry, I didn't get your first question. Can you repeat, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, the first question is what would have been the impact on your net income if you have consolidated Votorantim in the P&amp;L statement this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may add, this is Roberto. Jorge, we have a specific table in our MD&amp;A related to P&amp;L of Banco Votorantim; probably we can check in table 151. The net income of Votorantim in the third quarter was R$93 million, and nine months was R$493 million. So please check table 151, okay, our MD&amp;A. We have a income statement with reallocation.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Great, thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks Roberto. And so regarding my third question, on your preliminary outlook for 2010, what's today is the thinking of loan growth on, Banco do Brasil only basis? You are growing credit at around 20% consolidated for all of the different businesses that you've bought; you've grown around 40%. Where do think loan growth can be in 2010 for the total bank, and how do you think fees will perform in 2010? What are your expectation on margins and taxes? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Talking about the fees, we believe that you can see some stability. Talking about the loan growth, we believe that it is less than what we are facing in 2009. But it's difficult to forecast. We believe that the environment is very good in Brasil because of the forecast, and now there is a kind of consensus about 4 and 5%, GDP growth that is very good for us.</p>
          <p>And again, Banco Votorantim and Banco Nossa Caixa, especially Banco Votorantim, they deal with Banco do Brasil, they create a very &#x2013; stability on the funding basis and they are very good to generate, especially on the car finance and the payroll loan. That will add a very good portion for our &#x2013; that creates a good stability in our ROE, because we are continuously increasing our participation on consumer under total  guise of Banco do Brasil. We believe that if you add all of these and summarize the stability of the fees, we don't believe that we keep the same path in growth, the loan book in 2010, and the continuous focus on to get all the synergies with Banco Nossa Caixa and to continue increasing the assets in Banco Votorantim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  I am sorry, if you could try to put some numbers to that, less growth than 2009, does that mean less growth in the Banco do Brasil basis, less than 20, or is it less than 40? Stability of fees means flat fees, same growth as 2009, I am just trying to get a little bit of a magnitude sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add, this is Geovanne, I was disconnected from the room. Jorge, we're still working for what would be our 2010 guidance, okay. But roughly, in terms of numbers, considering the 45% steady growth, fee income we believe that 5 to 8% increase could be feasible. Loan growth between 20 to 25, overall loan growth is also feasible. But once again, we are still working on 2010 guidance; and once we disclose the fourth quarter numbers, we will announce formally what is our expectation with regard to Banco do Brasil's performance for 2010, and probably we will be disclosing a guidance including all of our acquisitions, not attached in Votorantim, the rest Ivan mentioned are very good assets generators, and we are very confident on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, thank you. I have a question on asset quality, in the quarter we saw decline in the H2H loans' risk ratings that drove a &#x2013; which is a driver of non-performing loan provisions, however we still see an increase in trends in terms of NPLs on 15, 30 and 90 days, so the question here is, what explains this divergence in terms of the evolution of these asset quality indicators, and where we could see a sustainability in decline of the 2H risk ratings and lower operations going forward, or this is a one-off that probably would not be repeated going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question that I have is again regarding your capital ratios. You have a total balance, on your balance sheet of around 12.5 billion, in goodwill, intangibles, and deferred assets. And my question is in the transition to Basel II, is there any indication when we could expect the Central Bank to start deducting these assets from your Tier 1 capital base, or your core capital? They represent approximately 200 basis points. So, just to get an idea what the Central Bank has indicated to you, when we could expect the capital ratio calculations in Brasil to become a little bit more consistent with international standards?</p>

        <plist>

And you will realize that the increase in B to H rate was really focused in the commercial portfolio, okay.</p>
          <p>So basically, we have here the impact of some companies. And we believe with regards to fund that was created by the government, we would be able to start improving the risks. As long as the quality of these commercial book starts to improve, we can change this ratio figure, okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. Can you please give us an update on what are the individual BIS ratios of Banco do Brasil, Nossa Caixa and Votorantim on a standalone basis? My understanding is that Votorantim's capitalization ratio is a bit more stretched than Banco do Brasil. So if I'm correct, what are your alternatives there to address this having in mind that you guys have an aggressive loan growth plan there? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, sorry. My question was a follow-up on BIS ratio. I just wonder if you could tell us what was the BIS ratio at Votorantim on a standalone basis because my thoughts are that the BIS ratio there, I know, is a bit more stretched than Banco do Brasil and then maybe if you could tell us what are your alternatives there having in mind that you have an aggressive loan growth plan at Votorantim? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The impact of Banco Votorantim capital ratio was a reduction of 107 basis points. This is related to an increase in the equity required &#x2013; capital required of more or less R$3.7 billion and an increase in their extra requirement of R$600 million. The increase in the capital required was related to subordinated assets. That's a Votorantim issue. And when we consolidated the requirements at Banco do Brasil, was seized 60% of this amount.</p>
          <p>The impact in terms of capital ratio is that the leverage of Banco Votorantim is more or less the same as Banco do Brasil. So we are not using this capital or vice-a-versa. We have guidelines that Banco Votorantim has to have a capital required minimum of 13% and this is the same as Banco do Brasil. So we do not believe any big change regarding the strategy of both banks.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually, we ended up at September '09 with a capital ratio of 18. &#x2013; I am sorry, 11.3%. But it's important to consider that we have already issued subordinated debt that had been recently approved by the Central Bank, so correcting the effect of the subordinated debt now that &#x2013; actually for September, the correct capital ratio would be 12.4%. We also expect a second part of the equity that &#x2013; dependents of the equity that we've brought by Banco do Brasil for beginning of the next year. It's an amount of R$450 million or so, we're going to raise the capital ratio of Banco Votorantim 13.1%.  Just to finalize I'll consider that in our strategic planning we are &#x2013; we keep forecasting the increments in our loan portfolio and this has &#x2013; we have been saying that we are quite able to keep our capital rate of 13% on this.  Okay?</p>

          <p>Hi, yes, just looking on the asset quality question, in particular the agribusiness portfolio, we saw probably big increase in the NPL ratio, in particular for the extended portfolio which doubled on the quarter.  And I just wanted to ask actually what's going on there, given that the dynamics in agribusiness, and agriculture generally had been quite strong and fertilizer costs have been coming down, so margin should have been good and yet we've seen that very big increase in more than 90 days' NPLs.  Coverage is also down, down to 200%.  It's still very big, but it's down on a three quarter basis from 1,000%.  Do you expect this ratio to get worse again forward especially in the extended portfolio and if so, at what point do you think you'll need to start bolstering up provisions or are you comfortable with this level of provisions?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you, Victor.  With regards to the agribusiness portfolio, I would like to highlight here that first of all the impact in the delinquency ratio was the re-tax of the loans that were restructured. A part of those loans, the 42, a specific authorization from the monetary authority.  We were not downgrading them because they will be re-negotiated and this authorization went so and once this authorization ended, the roles that were not restructured they, how can I say, they have their rates increased.  And that's why when we look to the delinquency ratio of the agribook, it went up.  It is important to mention that those loans were already being ranked in those higher risk categories.  So, the volume of provisions we had to account was small, was not relevant. However, it ended up harming the delinquency ratio because of the grace period that they were experiencing during the re-negotiation period, okay? And this re-negotiation period ended in the third quarter.  So, that's why we saw this pickup in delinquency but this is related basically to those old half step restructured and we will try to renegotiate them, okay?</p>
          <p>And with regard to coverage ratio in the overall book, Banco do Brasil is confident that we will maintain a high level of coverage.  It was &#x2013; there was a drop definitely but we believe that we will maintain that coverage at that level.  We do not plan to start writing that provision.  Definitely once the risk profile of the book starts to improve, instead of writing that provisions we will reinforcing our additional provisions and this is according to our credit policy.  And this is important because decreasing additional provision are just reinforcing our capital base according at the Central Bank's legislation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks.  Just a quick follow-up on write-offs. I mean, again we saw the write-offs increase overall for the agribusiness book, almost doubled quarter-on-quarter and the highest of the history series that you put in here in the MB&amp;A.  Do you expect that to maintain at this high level, Geovanne, or do you think this could start coming down into Q4 and into 2010?  I know it's hard to tell, but any guidance would be helpful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'd like to look at the net loss.  Net loss ratio went up about 100 bps and I think it tends to stabilize at that level.  Definitely the volume of laptops increased but we are increasing also the volume of recovery, and we recently nominated a new recovery director to help us to step forward.  So, I don't think you should be concerned about the write-offs.  Look at the net loss and I think that is the best ratio you could get in your estimate, okay.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning thanks for taking my call.  I am going to keep Ren&#xEA; Sanda very busy and ask another question about capital.  In your response to an earlier question, you said that during 2010, you would be monitoring, especially in light of your ADR you would be monitoring the situation and take appropriate action.  Should we interpret that as meaning you're seriously considering raising common equity, and the reason I ask that is that currently your BIS ratio even if that give you credit for the perpetual preferred in the subordinated debt is 13.9% and notwithstanding any questions about the quality of the capital which is a separate issue.  Your risk based on your guidance, your risk weighted asset growth is growing much faster than your equity than your capital, at your current profitability level.  So, it would seem to me that your BIS ratio is going to turn right back down towards 13% very soon.  So, just want to get a sense for whether you feel and when do you feel like you're going to have raise to additional Tier I in common equity specifically.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ren&#xEA;, Saul wants you to give him some <mark type="inaudible" />.  Could you answer this please?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Ivan already told a little bit about the strategy of ADR and the capital level one, may I pass to you Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are continued &#x2013; with our decision as we didn't create any cost range for the growth talked about Brasil and with this subordinated debt we did this for peso and we've already passing in our credit book and our acquisition strategy of the bank.  And we'll continue monitoring the BIS ratio, that I can tell you now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I to add, Saul, I am here with my controlling Director and he has explained to me that debt performed BIS ratio takes into consideration not only the subordinated debt and the perpetual bond but also the expectation of asset growth and funding growth as well.  So it's a performance that considers not only the rates in Tier I and Tier II, with these debts but also volume growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  But if I just &#x2013; I mean where I am wrong then if you're guiding towards 20 to 25% loan growth defending your share, you risk-weighted asset growth should grow faster than your capital base, if you have a 40% payout and an ROE of 12%.  So I just and if you feel, if you think that a 13% BIS is going to the floor, it seems on the surface of it like you're going to get right back down to that number pretty soon, unless something is wrong with my math?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, I don't know if your math is wrong or not. Ours points out to this level of BIS ratio, not necessarily, and if by any chance we need to boost our BIS ratio, we have shown a very good performance in raising really rapidly perpetual bonds and coordinated effects.</p>
