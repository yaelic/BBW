        <plist>
          <p>Well good morning, everyone. I'm Paul Adams, Chief Executive of British American Tobacco. With me this morning are Nicandro Durante, Chief Executive Designate and Ben Stevens, Finance Director and Chief Information Officer. Also in the front stools are a number of my colleagues, including Richard Burrows, the Chairman; and John Daly, Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for coming to this results presentation, which will be my last before Nicandro drops the designate part of his title and becomes Chief Executive next week. And as always a warm welcome to those of you that may be listening to the conference call or watching via our Web site, bat.com. After taking you through the results presentation there will be an opportunity for people in the audience to ask questions.</p>
          <p>How should I describe 2010? Well, although it's been a tough year, we've performed strongly, achieving or exceeding most of our strategic targets. We didn't get the recovery we had hoped for in some parts of the world, but there was evidence in the latter part of the year that trading conditions are improving in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Consumer confidence and disposable incomes have been under pressure. And this is reflected in lower industry volumes across our markets. Never the less, we have grown the volume of our Global Drive Brands and overall market share in our top 40 markets.</p>
          <p>Currencies were favorable. Remember that our top five markets are commodity-based economies and collectively accounted for just under half of the group's operating profit. In fact all of our top 10 markets recorded profit growth with the exception of Italy which suffered from the euro's weakness.</p>
          <p>On an organic basis, at constant rates of exchange, both revenue and profit were in line with our long-term targets to achieve the high single figure earnings per share growth, with revenue up 3% and profit up 6%. The leverage between the revenue growth and operating profit growth illustrates the success we have had with our cost saving and productivity initiatives.</p>
          <p>The operating margin has improved 2.1% to 33.5%. We have achieved the &#xA3;800 million per annum cost savings target two years earlier than planned. And we're on track to at least achieve the 35% target operating margin by 2012.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the benefits of exchange, good performances from our Associates and lower finance costs, which Ben will take you through later, have resulted in a 15% increase in adjusted earnings per share. And in accordance with our stated dividend policy, the 65% dividend payout ratio means that the proposed dividend for the year will also rise 15%.</p>
          <p>So despite the last three years of recession, British American Tobacco has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 15% in earnings and 18% in dividend growth since 2004. This shows that the strategy is clearly delivering even in these challenging times and it is underpinned by the right geographic spread and strong innovative brands.</p>
          <p>The 15% growth in earnings per share is supported by a 23% growth in free cash flow. And the ratio of free cash flow per share to adjusted EPS has risen from 86% to 92%. The balance sheet is strong. Net debt has fallen by &#xA3;1 billion during the year and is around 1.5 times EBITDA. The board has decided to resume the share buyback program, which was suspended at the end of 2008 in the light of the economic uncertainty at the time as well as the funding requirements for the Tekel, ST and Bentoel acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Resuming the share buyback program up to a value of &#xA3;750 million is an indication of the board's aim to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders and its confidence in the future of the business.</p>
          <p>Given the difficult environment, we were encouraged that price mix grew by 6%. And so far the signs are that pricing discipline is continuing into 2011. But there's more to these results than pricing. If we look deeper, we have grown our share of top 40 markets from 25% to 25.3%.</p>
          <p>Our Global Drive Brands grew 7%. This is one of the best indicators of the vitality of our business. Even if you exclude brand migrations, and I don't think you should, the Global Drive Brands grew 3%. And that's a better performance than most in the industry.</p>
          <p>Last year there were 25 innovation launches across all regions. This could be seen in our share growth in the second half of the year, and it means we have real momentum moving into 2011. I am confident that as a business we are stronger coming out of the recession than we were going into it, and more importantly, better equipped to take advantage of the growth opportunities that come with recovery.</p>
          <p>And on that note, I'll ask Nicandro to give you some more detail on the 2010 performance.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with volume and revenue. Group volumes were down 2%. However, after adjusting for the loss of Gauloises Blondes in Germany and the acquisition of Bentoel Indonesia, organic volume was 3% lower. Across our top 40 markets we saw lower industry volumes in Turkey, Pakistan, Romania and South Africa, often driven by rising illicit trade. Our competitive performance was strong, with share rising 0.3 percentage points to 25.3% and share of the other 30 segments up by one share point. Pricing momentum continued with organic revenue at constant rates, up 3% on lower volume. The worsening Europe organic volume was decline. It was 6% excluding Gauloises, and although there was a marginal loss of share in the region over the year, share recovery was promising in the second half. The region's organic revenue was down 1% and profit was 10% ahead, reflecting the excellent work that has been done on the cost base.</p>
          <p>Each of the regions grew profits on organic basis at constant rates. Eastern Europe's profit at current rates was affected by adverse exchange rates, mainly Uzbekistan. On an organic basis at constant rates, group profit was 6% higher on organic revenue growth of 3%, in line with our medium- to long-term targets. This illustrates how our productivity initiatives are contributing to our operating margin growth.</p>
          <p>As per reported earlier, the global drive brands grew 7%, and they now account for 29% of group volume. Dunhill grew both volume and share in 2010 on the back of innovation. The innovative relock packaging has been rolled out to many more markets including Malaysia where Dunhill performed well despite a change in regulations. In Brazil, the Carlton to Dunhill migration was completed, and Dunhill now has more than 8% share.</p>
          <p>Kent volume was 1% lower due to the industry declines in Romania and Japan. However, Kent grew share across the top 40 markets as Kent Convertibles were launched in South Korea, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. Nanotek continues its excellent progress with volume 16% higher. Kent now has achieved 5% share in Russia and stabilized share in Japan.</p>
          <p>Lucky Strike volume grew globally with a stable share across our top 40 markets. In the Americas volume and share grew due to the launch of Click &amp; Roll variance. Share grew in Spain and France but was slightly lower in Germany.</p>
          <p>Pall Mall's volume and top 40 share also saw growth globally. Germany, Uzbekistan, Italy, Spain, Pakistan, Nigeria and Chile all contributed, partly offset by lower volumes in Russia, Romania and Turkey.</p>
          <p>Turning to the regions, in Asia-Pacific, adjusted profit was up &#xA3;184 million to &#xA3;1.332 billion as a result of strong performances in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh. Favorable exchange rates and the acquisition of Bentoel were also contributing factors. At constant rates, profits have increased by &#xA3;47 million or 4%. Volumes were 2% higher at 188 billion due to increase in Bangladesh and Vietnam and the additional volumes from Bentoel, although these were partially offset by lower volumes in Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Pakistan, driven by industry declines.</p>
          <p>Market share in Malaysia was up due to the market share gains by Peter Stuyvesant and the resilient performance by Kent and Dunhill were only partially offset by the impact of down-trading. In South Korea, we closed the year at an all-time high for market share following the successful launch of Kent.</p>
          <p>In Americas, profit rose by &#xA3;196 million to &#xA3;1.382 billion. This was mainly due to the strong performance from Canada, Brazil and Chile, and in profit product mix an exchange rate benefits. At constant rates of exchange, profit had risen by &#xA3;62 million or 5%. Volumes were down 1% at 149 billion, with the small decrease experienced in Brazil and Venezuela as a result of industry declines almost offset by higher volumes in Canada and Chile.</p>
          <p>Profit in Canada was higher with the effect of reduced illicit trades, price increases and exchange rate benefits more than offsetting continued down-trading. Leadership was achieved in all segments of the market which contributed to a significant market share improvement of 51.6%, driven by John Player Standard.</p>
          <p>In Mexico profit was higher, as a result of improved operating margin and volume stability after many years of decline. Market share has stabilized over the back of the good performance from Pall Mall and Montana, and the launch of Dunhill in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>I have already referred to the margin improvement in Western Europe. Profit increased by &#xA3;60 million to &#xA3;1.054 billion, mainly as a result of strong performances in Germany, Belgium, Spain, Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands. Regional volumes were 8% lower at 119 billion as a result of declines in Poland, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. And just before the launch of the Gauloises Blondes volume in Germany, regional volumes were down 6%. However, in the second half of the year we saw much stronger share performances from Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Vogue across several key markets, giving us real momentum going into 2011.</p>
          <p>With effect from January, some Eastern Europe markets will be merged into Western Europe, and the others into Africa and Middle East, forming the new Eastern Europe and Middle East and Africa EEMEA. The 2010 results are presented on the basis of the old structure, but we have also restated the numbers based on the new structure.</p>
          <p>So for the last time, as a separate region, Eastern Europe saw profit decrease by &#xA3;51 million to &#xA3;358 million, principally due to the adverse impact of exchange rates, mainly Uzbekistan, and lower volumes. At constant rates of exchange, profit would have increased by 5%. Share grew in the majority of markets and regional share was higher. In Russia price increases have improved product mix, resulted in higher share and profit, despite flat volumes. We achieved leadership in the premium segment, and market share leadership in Moscow as a result of continued excellent performance by Kent and Dunhill.</p>
          <p>In Ukraine, market share increased strongly and volumes were up. Excellent profit growth was achieved as a result of our improved product mix led by growth in Global Drive Brands. Market share in Romania was up strongly, with an impressive performance by the market leader, Kent. However, numerous, large, excise-driven price increases meant industry volumes declined significantly and profit was lower.</p>
          <p>Profit from the Africa and Middle East region grew by &#xA3;134 million to &#xA3;858 million. At constant rates of exchange, profit would have improved by &#xA3;69 million or 10% mainly driven by Nigeria and the GCC. Volumes were 2% lower following declines in Turkey, Iran and South Africa, partially offset by increases in the GCC, Egypt and Nigeria. In Turkey the aggressive excise-driven price increase in January 2010 led to an almost doubling of illicit trades. However, profit rose as price increases, favorable exchange rate movements, and reduced costs offset an impact of lower volumes. The brand portfolio acquired in the Tekel acquisition particularly suffered from the growth in illicit trades and competitor pricing. Therefore, we have impaired goodwill in the Tekel training markets by &#xA3;249 million and &#xA3;44 million respectively.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, volumes and market share continued their impressive growth trend, despite the excise led price increases in July. However, profits was adversely impacted as some of the excise increase was not recovered through higher prices. Rothmans has had a particular good performance expanding its leadership position among international brands. I'll now hand over to Ben, who will take you through the rest of the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nicandro, and good morning, everyone. Each year with the preliminary results we report on the progress we've made with our productivity program.</p>
          <p>The first part of our productivity program ended in 2007 achieving annual savings of just over &#xA3;1 billion. Another five-year target of &#xA3;800 million was announced three years ago, &#xA3;245 million delivered in year one, &#xA3;239 million in year two, with a further &#xA3;327 million in year three, we achieved the target two years ahead of schedule. Here is where we are focusing our supply chain efficiencies, back office integration, and similar management structures.</p>
          <p>The group's operating margin in 2007 was 30%. I've stated that the current cost saving program should produce a margin of at least 35% by 2012. As you can see from this slide, with 33.5% we're on course to achieve the 35% operating margin. If we can reach 35% earlier than 2012 we will set a new target, but we'll focus on margin expansion rather than set a new growth cost savings target.</p>
          <p>As Paul mentioned earlier, our productivity initiatives have contributed significantly to operating margin growth of 2.1 percentage points. On an organic basis, operating margin grew 1.4 percentage points, with improvements in all regions apart of Eastern Europe which was affected by adverse exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The sale of the Lyfra distribution business in Belgium and the loss of Gauloises Blondes in Germany have enhanced the Western European regions margin. Excluding these businesses, the region's underlying margin on a like-for-like basis has grown from 29.8% to 32.9%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the income statement, adjusted profit from operations grew 12% to &#xA3;4,984 million. Restructuring costs were &#xA3;311 million for the period, and mainly related to initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the group, together with costs related to the integration of Bentoel. There was also an amortization charge of &#xA3;62 million in relation to trademarks acquired with Tekel, ST and Bentoel, and the impairment charge of &#xA3;293 million in relation to Tekel, discussed by Nicandro earlier.</p>
          <p>I'll cover the reduction in net finance costs on the next slide. Associates were 14% higher at &#xA3;550 million. For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation, the adjusted contribution from Associates was &#xA3;81 million or 15% higher at &#xA3;622 million. The adjusted contribution from Reynolds American was 5% higher at &#xA3;409 million. At constant rates the increase was 4%. ITC continued its strong profit growth, and its adjusted contribution rose by 42% to &#xA3;204 million. At constant rates the contribution was 32% higher than last year. Profit before tax was 8% higher at &#xA3;4,388 million. Net finance costs were &#xA3;24 million lower at &#xA3;480 million, reflecting lower net debt and net interest gains on derivative contracts. Gross interest cover remains strong at 10.5 times, and we are resuming the share buyback.</p>
          <p>The underlying tax rate, based on adjusted profit, is 30.2% against 30.3% last year. Our guidance for the current year is an underlying tax rate of between 30% and 31%.</p>
          <p>Profit for the year rose 6% to &#xA3;3,140 million, and the Minorities charge rose 7% to &#xA3;261 million. The adjusted earnings per share is 175.7 pence per share, which is up 15% over 2009. Here are the drivers for adjusted earnings per share growth. Profit from subsidiaries at constant rates of exchange increased earnings by 6%. The other drivers worthy of note were the excellent performance from Associates, which added 2% and favorable exchange rates, which added a further 5%.</p>
          <p>Moving onto cash flow, operating cash flow rose &#xA3;584 million to &#xA3;4,901 million reflecting the growth of the underlying operating performance. The free cash flow benefited from the higher dividends from Associates thanks to a special dividend paid by ITC in India at &#xA3;91 million. Free cash flow at &#xA3;3,240 million was up by &#xA3;610 million or 23% over 2009.</p>
          <p>We target the ratio of free cash flow per share to adjusted EPS to be somewhere around the mid-80%. At a ratio of 92% we're well ahead of expectations. I'd remind you that free cash flow is after adjusting items and dividends from Associates whereas adjusted earnings is before adjusting items and includes profits from Associates.</p>
          <p>Dividends paid to shareholders rose 16% to &#xA3;2.1 billion. Net cash flow after other net flows was &#xA3;1.07 billion. And finally net debt, which at the start of the year was &#xA3;8.8 billion was &#xA3;1 billion lower at the end of December, the principal movements for positive net cash flow of &#xA3;1,070 million and slight adverse foreign exchange movements of &#xA3;63 million. That's the end of the presentation, and so I'll hand over to Paul who will start the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. David Hayes from Nomura. Just on the pricing, second half pricing, I guess it was about 8%. I just wondered if you could talk about the outlook for 2011 PMI. I think you made a comment last week that that's 60% in the bag already. I just wondered if you could talk about it in that context.</p>
          <p>And then secondly in terms of the shape of profits, a close call say between 27, and organic profit growth of about &#xA3;300. Obviously you've got organic sales growth as well. That conversion on the sales growth is a bit light. I was wondering if you talk about certainly the second half whether there was any kind of one-off expenses in there that might make the conversion of the sales growth into profit with a little bit since you know that reversed in 2011. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There were two basic questions. Could we talk about the outlook for pricing for 2011. If you can pick that up, Nicandro, and the shape of profit to sales in the second half of 2010 and whether there is any one-offs that shifted the shape of that. Ben, if you can pick that up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding pricing, and yes, we have a good momentum in pricing in 2011 as you can see what's going on around the markets, which is very pleasing. We are confident that we will achieve our expectations for 2011. We had a very good year in pricing last year as well, and we are in good shape is all I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we drove the cost savings throughout the course of the year. We always tend to spend slightly more in marketing on the second half of the year anyway, so you expect to see a slightly reduced margin second half of the year, but organic revenue grew quarter on quarter last year. We did have some innovations launches, which were sort of stacked up at the station at the half-year results, and they've been launched in the second half of the year, and you can see the benefit of that coming through in the improving market share forecast, market share performance in the second half of the year, so slightly more spend in the second half of the year, but no particularly unusual one-offs in there.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes? Jon?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. A couple of things, I think the mid to long-term on margin improvements is it's 70 basis points, which must have been the average the last four or five years, a reasonable expectation of what's still achievable in the business. And given that you've got &#xA3;150, &#xA3;100 million in restructuring charges in the numbers every year, just as you're moving to a margin target, will you start to include restructuring costs within unadjusted profit from operations and EPS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question was looking at our margin improvements or forecast margin improvements going out. I think the question is are we being a little conservative in our targets? Ben?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think we've grown margins by 0.7%, 0.8% points each year. We've had a particularly good year this year. Some of it was helped by the disposals of Lyfra as we said, but this year we had a 1.2% point growth in operating margin organically with another 0.2% on top of that from FX. We will, if you &#x2013; there's a very helpful table, actually, at the end of the results, which gives our organic turnover and profit. If you do a calculation on that, you'll see we've got a very healthy organic profit margin this year. You add on the 0.7%, 0.8% increase and you get quite close to the 35%. If we hit the 35% next year, or this year rather, then we'll announce a new target, but it won't be a target we announce in terms of gross cost savings, because much more useful is how much is actually falling through to the bottom line. So we'll announce a higher operating margin target at that point, but I'm very confident we'll hit the 35% by 2012.</p>
          <p>If you look at restructuring costs, if you calculate EPS excluding restructuring costs and including restructuring costs over the last five years, you get exactly the same growth rate. So we're left with the slight dilemma  of whether we leave them in and then explain to you what happens if we take them out, or if we take them out and explain to you what happens if we put them in. Either way you get the same result. So we'll probably leave it just where we highlight the restructuring costs coming out at about &#xA3;300 million a year on restructuring, and we just show that separately. I think that gives more information to the results.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a question about the -- how do you feel about the size of the tail growth brand portfolio?  After many years of good growth of Global Drive Brands, how do you feel about basically your portfolio of brands that basically don't meet your, probably your scale criteria to hit your profitability targets? This question is probably more trying to understand if in the next few years we should expect the pace of decline for this portfolio tail that is lower than what we have seen in the last five years or is that not the case, we should still expect a drag from your portfolio tail in the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the question there is, what are our expectations for our tail brands in the course of the next five years? Do we see the decline of the tail brands accelerating or staying at roughly the same pace, or will we be able to do something about them over the next five years? I think &#x2013; yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have been very successful in terms of growing our international portfolio, let's start from here. So if you take the Global Drive Brands nowadays, they are around 29% of our portfolio. You go back five, six years ago, they were less than 20%, so quite successful. And if you take the international brands, what we call the key regional brands, and add it to the GDBs, it goes over 50% already, so it's quite good shape. If you compare this as well with five years ago, was less than 38%, 37%, so quite good performance.</p>
          <p>What doesn't mean the other 50% are not important brands. There are some local brands that are quite important in our portfolio, and you take those brands in places like Canada, South Africa, Brazil and even Russia. They are very important brands in our portfolio despite not being named as international brands. So you keep investing in those brands because they come in some price segments that are key for our future growth strategy.</p>
          <p>But yes, we have some tail brands in our portfolio, the ones that in the past usually migrated to international brands, and then ones that you don't put so much spend behind those brands. And it's declining every year. I wouldn't be able to tell you what's the percentage now, but it's much smaller than it was five years ago and ten years ago, and I would expect the same rate of decline as you saw in the previous years.</p>
          <p>But I'd like just to point out that we talk about the GDBs and you think that all the brands are tail brands. They are not. We have another 29% of GDBs, 22%, 23% of these international brands, key brands in our portfolio such as Winfield in Malaysia, Peter Stuyvesant in South Africa, Rothmans across Africa Middle East, or <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil. And those brands are key in our portfolio, we keep investing behind them. So it goes over 50 and still have some local brands in some price segments that you keep supporting. So the level of the brands that are really, really tail, the ones that you don't put many investments behind is much smaller than in the past, and I don't see this acceleration going forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Three questions, if I may? One, very quickly can you confirm that you will continue to publish that Appendix 1 in the results, the organic breakdown, because it's very helpful for analysts, and we'll see that on a regular basis? Secondly, on marketing margin, did that rise? Fall? Stay stable in the year? What's the outlook for that for 2011?</p>
          <p>And then finally talking about your M&amp;A strategy, obviously you've had a big write-off in Turkey, you've had a smaller one with STC, you've lost market share in a lot of -- sorry, STK, you've lost market share in a lot of the Scandinavian and Polish markets as well as Turkey. I was wondering, obviously that's gone, maybe the write-off says that you may have overpaid in Turkey and maybe not, but I'm interested in what that means to a future acquisition? Will you be less likely to acquire local heritage portfolios that then seem to be in decline once you buy them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me see if I &#x2013; can we confirm that Appendix 1 will stay in or are we going to whisk it away and deny you this very useful information in the future, having given it to you this year? I'll let Ben do that.</p>
          <p>The marketing margin, has that risen or fallen in 2010? What, if any, outlook are we prepared to give for 2011 on the marketing percent of sales? And then the M&amp;A strategy, Adam seems somewhat unimpressed with our M&amp;A performance so far, and are we going to continue doing this M&amp;A performance going forward, or are we going to be a bit more selective? Maybe you can handle that one, Ben. Do you want to?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The good news is we will be publishing the organic table. We like it. It's a good table. We've often quoted from it in the past, but I think it's very helpful to actually just lay all the figures out. So the answer to that is, yes.</p>

          <p>Marketing margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marketing. We spend about &#xA3;100 million a year or more on marketing. That's as true this year as it was last year as it was the year before. So no significant increase in marketing spend but we continue to spend behind innovations and they continue to be successful and we've grown market share. So marketing margin broadly the same as it always was. Acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding marketing margins I just want to add that there are a lot of opportunities for us to be more selective in the way that you spend your money behind your brands, which brands, which market, which segments, so despite it not going up we can be more selective and can be more efficient. So there are some opportunities there. So I think that 2010 was good example of that in which it didn't go up, but you saw the market share growth and it's driven by good spend.</p>
          <p>Regarding acquisitions, is a good question. I think that -- let me start by saying that in case of STK acquisition, the results that we have now is exactly broadly expected when we acquired the brands. So we expect that in Poland we will have to lose some volume that was not a profitable volume, so it didn't come as a surprise for us. So I think that it was a good acquisition. It gave us in markets like Denmark an outstanding position to grow, not only some of the key brands that we acquired like Prince, a premium brand, a very important brand now in our portfolio, but also our Global Drive Brands. So it was a very good acquisition.</p>
          <p>Regarding Turkey, let's not forget that if I had &#x2013; if I could go back at that time that you acquired Turkey, I would have made the same decision. Don't forget that you were nowhere in Turkey or just 8% &#x2013; 7% or 8% market share at that time. Nowadays, we are a very strong number two in the eighth biggest market in the world.</p>
          <p>Yes. We had some issues in the end of 2009. If you look at the acquisition during 2009, you would have said that was an outstanding acquisition. Now we are very prudent as a company. We decide to take the impairment, but I hope that in five years time we look back and say it was an outstanding acquisition. It is very important to be in those &#x2013; in these markets.</p>
          <p>And we use our scale to launch our innovations. And we launched the innovations behind Kent last year and it was working quite well. So I think that going forward in terms of acquisition, we use the same criteria that you have today. The criteria is that it really should be a financial attractive acquisition, a strategical attractive acquisition and we keep using the same criteria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We shouldn't forget in Turkey there's been a 50% price increase as a result of two massive excise increases, there's been a doubling of illicit trade, and there's been some price repositioning by competitors. I don't think any of those were things that we could confidently predict when we made the acquisition, which was an open bid as well actually. So we were bidding marginally more than other people were prepared to bid at the time, so.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Erik Bloomquist, Berenberg. Two questions on countries. Firstly, on Russia, could you discuss how you see that evolving both in terms of volume and also price segments? And then secondly, on Canada, where you had such strong growth in 2010, have we kind of had all the benefits of the crackdown on illicit trade that we're going to see, or is there more yet to come from that source? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One is the outlook on volume in Russia and price segments. And secondly, on Canada, obviously a lot of benefit in 2010 from the crackdown on illicit trade, is there more to come on that or have we now had it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of Russia, I'm glad you should say that the market is recovering, yes. Last year the overall market was decline around 4% and then believe this year can be half of that or even less. And the beauty is, the good news is the markets are trading, we see some up-trading happening in Russia. So the prospects for Russia in 2011 is very encouraging. Talking a little bit about BAT, how we are doing in Russia, we are doing extremely well. We came from a very tough 2009, but if you look at the exit share in 2010 against exit share in 2009, we grew about one share point, 1.2 share points. Even the year 2010, because the first half was not that strong, we had share growth 2010 against 2010. And the beauty is now we have the leadership in the Premium segment since September last year. And now we have the leadership in Premium segment and, after five months, three share points leadership in the Premium segment. And Kent now is a five-share brand in Russia which is an outstanding result. With the up-trading in Russia, I think there are portfolio benefits from that. So I see good prospects for Russia for 2011.</p>
          <p>And regarding Canada, yes, we had some good performance in Canada in terms of volume, mainly driven by the reduction of illicit trade. Let's not forget that 18 months ago illicit trade in Canada hit something like 33%, 34%. Now we think it's around 18%. The question that is there more to come? Why we have 18% of illicit trade? We had stabilized in the last six to seven months, but there are some opportunities to reducing illicit trade even more. That's not something that the industry can sort out by itself. That's something that the governments have to work on that one, and the government in Canada is working very strongly against illicit trade, and they have achieved very good results how we illicit trade in Canada. And the business is well in Canada. Now we have leadership in all price segments in Canada, and we grew last year not only volume, but we grew market share. So Canada is doing very well as well. So...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just wondering, I see the progression in margins you've had for the past four years and more, and we know there are a number of influences on this margin progression, and you could allocate that to certain ones of the influences. I was just wondering how specific you can be behind the portion of your business or portion of your volume that's in the Drive Brands behind margin increase? Is there any part of a formula or any sort of magic number that as that percentage goes up that that would be associated with a specific margin? Or is it just part of a large number of contributions to that margin increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the question there is we've seen margin improvement over the last several years. How big an influence is brand mix in that margin improvement, amongst all the other influences on margin improvement? I think that was your question. Do you want?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Obviously the Global Drive Brands are the majority premium brands, so as our proportion of volume in Global Drive Brands increases that helps the margin. That tends to get offset by geographic mix, because we're growing quite strongly in emerging markets, which tend to have lower margins than developed markets. So net, net that comes out as a wash. The real driver of the margin improvement is the cost saving program. We've been closing a significant number of factories over the last few years. We are slimming down management structures. We're putting more and more back office overhead into shared service centers, and we're putting in a common SAP spine throughout the company, the benefits of which will come after 2012. So we see the margin improvement really being down to very good, tight cost control or improving cost control, and that going on well beyond the 2012 date.</p>

          <p>Jon Leinster with UBS. Can you just sort of get back to costs, can you give some comment on the cost increases you faced last year and what the outlook is for next year? And just why there was quite an acceleration in cost savings during 2010? Is that going to be the new run rate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're being asked about costs, mostly input costs, what happened on input costs in 2010? What's the outlook on input costs for 2011? And has there been some kind of acceleration on cost savings in 2010? And is that the new run rate for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Costs went up by inflation plus a bit, which takes account of the extra costs of the innovation strategy going through last year. We had slight higher increases in leaf prices last year, but we see those moderating, coming down to about 5% this year going forward. We wait to see what happens to wrapping material costs with the oil price. Obviously those will go up a bit as the oil prices go up a bit, but we think that's very manageable in our overall cost base for 2011. So not particularly worried about cost inflation for 2011. I think that's very much under control. Margin improvement, well Jon said it all with sort of 0.7%, 0.8% a year. We won't be publishing a new cost-saving target, so there's not gross cost saving level for the future years, but yeah, I'm confident that margins can crank along at that rate, albeit any individual year it may be different, because you get the impact of currencies coming through, you get big closure costs coming through, you get big savings programs coming through as, say, a large factory closes. But on average over the years, that's not a bad rule of thumb.</p>

          <p>Robin Asquith, JPMorgan Asset Management. A question about plain packaging, what the management currently view this threat? And to what extent your legal department are exercising their minds over this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perhaps I'll pick that one up. The question was about plain packaging and how much of a threat do we perceive that to be? And are there late night lights burning in the legal department as a result of it? In my view, I think the view on plain packaging has been overstated in a number of cases. Firstly, I think the health overstate the impact that plain packaging will have. I don't think that plain packaging will help them to achieve the public health goals. I don't think plain packaging will reduce the amount of smoking or reduce the take-up of smoking. So I don't think it has &#x2013; will have an impact on smoking rates, and I don't think there's any proper evidence that would suggest that. That's the first point.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think if plain packaging comes in Australia, the main impact will be to reduce competition. I think that it will have an impact if it moves out of Australia on illicit trade, and that is a concern. But the main impact in Australia I think will be to dampen down competition. I don't think packaging impacts smoking rates, but I think it may influence choice. And it will I think dampen down competition. We have about a 42% share in Australia, so dampening down competition is not horrendous on that basis. I can live with 42% market share. We don't &#x2013; we assume that the Australian government is still going to go ahead with this, but obviously they're focused on bigger priorities at the moment in Australia. So we wait to see what the legislative agenda will be and what indeed the legislation will be. We will lobby hard against it. And I think the legal department is indeed prepared to have a very good look at this if our lobbying efforts are not successful. But we do need to see the legislation first.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Nico Lambrechts, Bank of America. Two questions. First, is your &#x2013; the trading so far in Japan, do you stick to your view that the market will probably be down in the order of 15% for the full year, volumes? And then secondly, on M&amp;A, I think, Ben, yourself, has been quoted on record with respect to M&amp;A and Imperial specifically. Would you mind clarifying exactly the comments on Imperial, the potential for future consolidation in the market, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, yes, opportunity to clarify some things there. Thank you, Nico. Question is, do we still have the view that the market decline in Japan will be 15% in 2011. I don't think we ever said it was 15, so we can clarify that. And also, M&amp;A, what views do we have on consolidation in the industry? Do you want to handle Japan, and you handle consolidation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Japan, what we said when you have this huge excise increase and a 40% price increase is that volumes will go down in 2011 between 15% to 20% is what we said at that time. So nobody knows. How can you know when you go to a country which has not seen a price increase for years and get a 40% price increase. So we gave a range, 15% to 20%. But if you ask if you have better range now, what I can tell you is that if you look at the date in the last 45 days in Japan, the decline is around 17% or 18%. So it's been going on what we said, but I think it's true that you call the rate of decline. We have to wait three or four months, but for what we say in the last 45 days is around 18%. But I think that, as I said, we have to wait a little bit to confirm the decline. What is &#x2013; is it a 15% to 20% rate and I believe that is the right size.</p>

          <p>I doubt that it's going to improve that much from that level. I think that it's going to be between 15% to 20% this year, my guess. And as I said, at 18% it should be around that for the year. That will be my best guess, but we have to wait three or four months.</p>

          <p>Good morning. David Alty from Pramerica Investment Management. Two questions, really. Firstly on Canadian litigation, I wonder if you could give a brief update there and do you see MSA type agreements being the likely outcome? And secondly in terms of organic volumes, do you have any targets over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have two questions. Can we update on Canadian litigation and do we see sort of MSA type agreements being a potential solution to that. If I could ask Neil, just one second, Neil, and organic volumes what's the outlook for organic volumes in 2011 and indeed years beyond that. Just going to ask Neil Withington, our General Counsel, to answer the question on Canadian litigation, just before he gets up are there any other questions on legal matters, because then he can handle them in one go. All right. It looks like Canada.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seems like it's always Canada. Update on Canadian litigation, there is no trial date that's been set for B.C. The trial date that was due later this year has been vacated without another date being set. The only other date in the trial Canada that relates to the Canadian industry are a couple of class actions to be tried in Quebec starting in the third quarter, probably around October time. That's in preparation. That trial itself will take a considerable amount of time, and a considerable number of years before it's resolved. But other than that, most of the things are at very early stages, and there's a lot of noise and a lot of activity, but not much movement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's very difficult to predict the volume coming out from the biggest recession since the 1930s, but you always have to consider that cigarettes is always the last in, last out in the recession, but my outlook for 2011 would be a decline, organic decline excluding China of around 2.5% is my expectation in the short term. And I expect BAT can do better than that, because we came from 2010 very strongly. We grew share from 25% to 25.3% in our top-40 markets, and I don't see any reason to have this as slowing down. So I expect that we can do a little bit better than the overall market decline. If you look at the next five years, I think it's too early to call how the volume is going to unfold if you think in a longer period, because you have to wait until unemployment starts coming down and disposable income starts coming up. That's not happening in big parts of the world, but in the future there is no doubt that you'll see some growth coming from developing markets, driven by economic growth and demographics. And you'll see some flattening consumption in the developed markets. So I think that you have to wait a little bit to start estimating what's going to happen in the next 5, 10 years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We've got time for one more question, someone who hasn't asked one before? Chas, you're all right at the back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chas Manso from Evolution. Three questions, two financial. One, on the distribution policy, trying to get a feel for whether the &#xA3;750 million is sort of like an ongoing rate now? What's your thinking behind setting that level? Are you trying to sort of maintain a sort of net-to-EBITDA or something like that? What do you think about when you set that level going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second financial question is on the cash conversion ratio, which in 2010 as you say was higher than usual. On an underlying basis do you think you've had a step up in conversion that's sustainable or not? And on the operational side, just a bit more color on Mexico, please? And I think in Nicandro's Cantos interview you talked about perhaps this year being the year of Mexico? You stabilized things? Obviously there's a big excise move there, perhaps you could give us a bit more color on Mexico for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just repeat those. I think Chas has got questions around going rates, one is around the share buyback, the &#xA3;750 million, what were the criteria to arrive at that? And does that imply some kind of consistent going rate going forward? Also on the cash conversion ratio, what would be a sort of underlying going rate for that? And then can we put a bit more color on how we see Mexico, which appears to be stabilizing? Ben, do you want to handle the financial questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. On the buyback, we've got a credit rating of Baa1/BBB+, and we'd like to keep that credit rating. So we always look at free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net debt. For that level of rating you need a ratio of sort of 15% to 18%, so we keep an eye on that. We're comfortable with our dividend payout ratio, 65%. So I see that going forward. And we'd like to keep a little bit of firepower available for any tuck-under acquisitions that are out there. So we keep an eye on that.</p>
          <p>But having said those three things, we like returning cash to our shareholders. It's your cash after all. We'll be returning about 100% of free cash flow this coming year. I wouldn't see the &#xA3;750 million as guidance for future years in terms of buybacks. It's the right level for this year and we'll review it at the end of this year to see what we should do next year.</p>
          <p>On the acquisition side of things, or sorry, on the cash conversion side of things, we've always said that we see a ratio of the mid 80%, so 85% is a mid range of that, as a good ratio to achieve in terms of cash conversion, free cash flow to adjusted earnings. You've got to remember it's very hard to hit 100% on that because of the inclusion of adjusting items in one of the majors and not in the other and because the earnings is profits and the cash is dividends from Associates. So you're never going to get to 100%. And I think 85% stays at about the right level. So we had good cash conversion this year which makes it slightly tougher, of course, to hit a good cash conversion the following year, but I think 85% is about the right level to think of for that.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that you remember one year ago when you were presented results here. I was talking about a turnaround plan in Mexico and allow me to be optimist about Mexico because after years of decline we have five quarters of share stability in Mexico and the guys have done an outstanding job with migration, launching a premium proposition,  that's Dunhill, and launching some innovation behind the brands. So the market has stabilized in the last five quarters and despite year against year with decline share is still 0.2%.</p>
          <p>It is a very small decline because you remember you're declining Mexico around 0.81% so it's just 0.2%, but because we have a stabilization of the share in the last five quarters, and I'm optimistic that in 2011 we can have a good performance in Mexico. Production was higher, quite a good production increase. Volume was stable and share was stable across the year. So I'm confident that you have the right brands, plans and people in Mexico to deliver the business.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that draws our hour to a close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before you wrap up I think <mark type="inaudible" /> would like to say a word or two.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>A small North African moment going on, don't worry I'm not going to protesting for long, and Paul I can guarantee you there's regime change this weekend. Paul, you said at the start this was your last results meeting. I've totted up, I reckon you've done about 30 of these now and so thank you for your good grace largely on most of the questions throughout that period, although it was nice at the end of this period to see a return of litigation questions, absent for such a long time.</p>
          <p>And also a question about M&amp;A because you might remember that in one of your first presentations you were asked about speculation regarding Gallaher to which you were a little bit too forthright in your answer which prompted a call from the takeover panel to Cazenove and a telling off from David Mayhew. Yes, Over the years though, Paul, it's been fantastic ride for shareholders as you said, 15% earnings growth, 18% dividend growth, 23% compound annual return from the share price. It's worth bearing in mind on the day when you were appointed as Group Managing Director, the market cap was &#xA3;13.4 billion, so less than revenues last year, which is an impressive performance by any standards. And the market cap over &#xA3;47 billion, provided that you've all been nice about him today.</p>
          <p>It's been a great pleasure to have known you over the years. I remember my first meeting with you in a bar in Twickenham in 1999 when you were head of Europe and the up and coming young thing. And rather scared to have heard about the Q1 results, which had come down that week, and with the entire cost of British American racing, the Scalextric kit for big boys, had been charged against your division for the first quarter and your division was loss-making as a result. And for anyone that's going to spend the afternoon slaving over a hot spreadsheet, you might to bear that story in mind when you get into the last million or so by division.</p>
          <p>Obviously since then your stock rose with the share price, Managing Director from 2002, Chief Exec from 2004. To me the standout moment I think was the Italian trip and the presentation of the corporate strategy on the second day to the analysts on the night before over dinner written out on a napkin, which is probably not the source of many corporate strategies, but it's a wonderful one. It's rewarded shareholders greatly and we wish you all a very long, very healthy, very happy retirement.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Thank you. Can I just say my farewell to you lot. I've mostly enjoyed the experience. It has been good fun. I've been enjoyed the sparring. I've learned from you. That's not something I would readily admit to, but I have learned from you over the years and I appreciate that. And it has been fun. Thank you very much.</p>
