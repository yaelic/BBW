          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Eni's 2011 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call hosted by Paolo Scaroni, Chief Executive Officer and Alessandro Bernini, Chief Financial Officer. For the duration of the call, you will be in listen only-mode. However, at the end of the call, you have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to your host to begin today's conference call. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our 2011 fourth quarter and full year results presentation. 2011, we made exceptional progress on our medium and long-term growth prospects. We had some remarkable successes in exploration with important discoveries in the Far East, with the discoveries in Jangkrik Northeast which have almost doubled our resources in the area.</p>
          <p>In the Bering Sea, we have Skrugard, and in recent weeks, Havis, and opened up a new hub with 500,000 BOE of recovery reserves. And of course in Mozambique where we have today announced the results of our second well, Mamba North and raised our estimate of gas in place to 30 TCF. We are very excited about the block's further potential and have expanded our exploration and appraisal plan with eight further wells to be drilled in the next two years.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have added 1.1 billion BOE of resource in 2011, building on our excellent track record in exploration over the past four years. We have also made good progress on our key projects for medium term growth, signing the GSAs and taking final investment decisions for Perla in Venezuela and from our field in the Yamal Peninsula in Russia. We are pleased with the technical and commercial progress on these developments, which alongside with the other FIDs will contribute 140,000 BOE a day of new production by 2015.</p>
          <p>Another highlight of Eni's performance in 2011 was the quick operational recovery in Libya. While the turmoil in our largest producing country affected both volumes and results last year, our consolidated local relationships and experience helped to contain the impact of the crisis. We were the only IOC to maintain some level of production in Libya during the revolution, with local employees continuing to work at Wafa, and gas production for domestic power generation exempt from international sanctions. And since the liberation of Tripoli in September, we have restarted all of our fields and reopened the GreenStream, ramping up production faster than even we had anticipated. Today we are almost back to pre-crisis level and expect 2012 production from Libya of around 230,000 BOE to 240,000 BOE per day, compared to the 110,000 BOE per day reported for the full year 2011 and the 273,000 BOE per day in 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Gas &amp; Power, R&amp;M and Petrochemicals. For all these businesses the market context in 2011 was difficult, and we saw a deterioration in the fourth quarter of the year as the sovereign debt crisis started to affect the European and particularly the Italian economy. This crisis spread across all our Italian businesses. In Gas &amp; Power demand was down 11% in the quarter, also due to mild weather. In R&amp;M consumption of refined products declined by 5.5% in the quarter, and for Petrochemicals the second part of the year was the worst in the last ten years. In this context, we have taken steps to strengthen our competitive position in each sector.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, we continue our strategy of reviewing our supply costs and have already closed an agreement with Sonatrach. However, it is worth reminding you that Gas &amp; Power results will not yet include the expected benefits of the Gazprom negotiation, which is progressing constructively and will be retroactive for the whole of 2011.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we have strengthened our position in the most resilient retail segment through organic growth in Italy and selected acquisitions in France and Belgium. In Refinery &amp; Marketing, we are concentrating our efforts on efficiency. In 2011, we exceeded our target with over &#x20AC;150 million of savings. In Petrochemicasl, alongside cost cutting, we have been focusing our business on more profitable niches. An example comes from our innovative project to convert a structurally loss-making basic chemical plant to biochemicals, giving us a foothold in this fast growing market.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and I will now hand you over to Sandro for a closer look at our fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paulo. In the fourth quarter of 2011 the market environment was mixed. The Brent price averaged $109 a barrel, up 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Meanwhile the average European refining margin Brent-Ural was $2.50 a barrel, well below historical levels and showing an 8% decline year-on-year. The euro-dollar exchange rate was broadly in line with the last quarter of 2010 at $1.35 per euro.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results, Eni's adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2011 was &#x20AC;4.3 billion, a decrease of 10% from the fourth quarter 2010. This result reflects the operating losses recorded by the downstream businesses against the backdrop of a recessionary environment and the increased competitive pressure on Gas &amp; Power Marketing results, which only partially include the benefits of supply renegotiations. These negatives were some to extent offset by the improved operating performance in E&amp;P, where operating profits were up 4.3% year-on-year, reflecting higher oil prices and the effort made to recover Libyan production after the suspension of much of our activity in the country during the crisis.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net profit for the fourth quarter of 2011 was &#x20AC;1.54 billion, down 9.5% compared with a year ago. This decrease reflects lower operating results and higher Group consolidated adjusted tax rate. The Group tax rate was approximately three percentage points higher due to the higher contribution of E&amp;P to Group profits as well as the upward revision of the so called Robin tax.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2011, Eni's hydrocarbon production amounted to 1.678 million BOE per day, a decrease of about 14% compared to Q4, 2010. The decrease was mainly driven by the Libyan crisis. However, the extraordinary efforts made in the last part of the year to restart production and reopen the GreenStream pipeline helped to reduce the impact of force majeure.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter production from Libya was over 160,000 BOE per day, compared to the third quarter production of around 50,000 BOE per day. Furthermore, the sharp increase in oil prices compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 negatively affected entitlements on the PSA contracts, with an estimated impact of 20,000 BOE per day. The division's adjusted operating profit was supported by higher oil prices and amounted to &#x20AC;4.2 billion, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of reserves, we added 827 million BOE through organic promotions, a result driven by the important FIDs taken in 2011, amongst which the first two developments in the Yamal Peninsula in Russia, Samburskoye and Urengoskoye, and the super giant Perla field in Venezuela. Overall reserves at the end of 2011 were 7.1 million BOE, a figure which rises to 7.2 billion BOE, excluding price effect, compared to 6.8 billion BOE at the end of 2010. Our organic reserve replacement before price effect was 160%. Even assuming full Libyan production in 2011, it would have been in the region of 120%.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, overall gas volumes sold, including consolidated and associated companies, totaled 24.7 bcm, a decrease of around 9% compared with last year. The decline is mainly attributable to weak demand in Europe, growing competitive pressure and the effect of force majeure in Libya on off-takes by importers to Italy.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased by 50% compared to the same period of 2010 due to the sharply lower results delivered by the Marketing business. It is worth reminding you that fourth quarter Marketing results reflected the benefit of the finalized renegotiation with Sonatrach, backdated to April 1, 2011, and do not yet reflect the benefits of the pending negotiation with Gazprom, although this will also be retroactive to January 1, 2011.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2011 was &#x20AC;671 million, compared to &#x20AC;921 million in the same quarter of last year. International Transportation results showed a 42% decrease, mainly due to the divestment of Eni's interest in the gas pipelines from Northern Europe and Russia. The Regulated businesses generated &#x20AC;389 million, in line with the corresponding period of last year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted pro forma EBITDA in the Marketing and Power business was negatively impacted by a recessionary environment and the increasing competitive pressure in Italy and Europe, as well as unusually mild weather conditions. Increased competitive pressure was partially offset by the positive outcome of the renegotiation of long-term supply contracts with Sonatrach and other suppliers as well as by portfolio optimization strategies.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the result doesn't yet reflect the benefit of the pending renegotiation with Gazprom whose effects will be retroactive to January 1, 2011. Furthermore, the lower production in Libya reduced volumes to shippers and affected margins, owing to the substitution of recently renegotiated Libyan gas with other sources of supply.</p>
          <p>Turning now to R&amp;M, in the fourth quarter of 2011 the division reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;271 million, versus a loss of &#x20AC;39 million in the same period of last year. This decrease reflects the worsening result of the Refining business with unprofitable refining margins due to rising costs for feedstock and plenty utilities, particularly fuel oil.</p>
          <p>Eni's complex refineries were also impacted by the reduction in the spread between light and heavy crudes. These negatives were partially offset by efficiency enhancement measures, designed integration of refineries and the optimization of supply activities. Meanwhile, operating profit in Marketing were impacted by declining fuel consumption for transport and industry in the recessionary environment and by increased competitive pressure.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Petrochemical business reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;154 million, compared to a loss of &#x20AC;74 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The business was negatively impacted by a fall in margins and a substantial decrease in demand. Saipem delivered an adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;390 million, up 3% versus Q4, 2010. Other activities in corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;88 million, compared to a loss of &#x20AC;129 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decline is mainly related to a year-end adjustment of insurance costs thanks to improved injury frequency rate and other one-off items.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was &#x20AC;14.3 billion in 2011. Proceeds from divestments amounted to almost &#x20AC;2 billion, including the sale of Eni's interest in gas transport pipelines from Northern Europe and Russia, gas distribution activities in Brazil and non-strategic upstream assets, cash outflows related to capital expenditure of &#x20AC;13.4 billion, and dividend payments of &#x20AC;4.3 billion including dividends paid to Saipem as non-minorities.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt at year-end amounted to &#x20AC;28 billion and the ratio of net borrowings to total equity, the leverage ratio stood at 0.46, compared to 0.47 in 2010.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, and now I will hand you over to Paolo for his final remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sandro. And now, our outlook for 2012. Our upstream production will grow by around 10% net of PSA effect, driven by the recovery in Libya, and startups in Algeria, Angola and Russia. This guidance factors in reduced growth expectation from Iraq, where bureaucratic difficulties have slowed the ramp up in our entitlements.</p>
          <p>Turning to Gas &amp; Power, as you are aware, the Italian government has issued a decree which includes the proprietary separation of Eni and Snam, a move which is coherent with our medium term strategy. The timing and shape of the disposal are yet to be determined and our guidance refers to Group structure as it currently stands.</p>
          <p>Regulated businesses will continue to perform well, although International Transport results will reflect the sale of our European pipelines completed in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Marketing activities will benefit from the recovery in the Libyan supply and continued renegotiation of long-term contract, which will have a material impact on 2012 results and provide the basis for a more competitive commercial strategy.</p>
          <p>Following the agreement reached with Sonatrach, we expect to close negotiation with Gazprom in the first part of 2012. At the same time, our Merchant business will face additional market pressure. Expected regulatory changes will impact our Italian Retail business. And while the economic and climate effect remain volatile we see a weak 2012 on the back of the deterioration experienced in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In this context, we will continue to grow sales in our key markets and increase LNG volumes, investing in our market position, coherently with our view of a longer term tightening of the market. In R&amp;M, in the context of continuing weaker Refining margins, we will further improve the efficiency of our operations.</p>
          <p>Consolidated CapEx will remain in 2012 broadly in line with 2011 and will be mainly focused on the development of our new major projects. This will continue to fuel any growth in the future, a theme which we will discuss in our strategy presentation next month.</p>
          <p>We will now be pleased to answer your question. I have here with me, apart from Sandro Bernini and Claudio Descalzi, Umberto Vergine, who as you probably remember has replaced Domenico Dispenza as the Chief Operating Officer of our Gas &amp; Power division. He will be ready to answer your question as well.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Mr. Nitin Sharma from JPMorgan. Mr. Sharma, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, if I may. First one on Galp. What is the update on the CLS stake in Galp, is there a price threshold that you want to achieve before progressing with this divestment? Second one on R&amp;M and Chemicals, both these segments have been consistently reporting operating losses in the last few years, and I do hear the plans and progress that you are looking to make. Is downsizing the company's exposure in these businesses also an option on the table, especially given your cautious view and outlook for Refining margins? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well on Galp, I will give you a general view then maybe Sandro, who is running the negotiations around the stake of ours, will add some, few details. But let me tell you first of all, this has been a business which has been a very good investment for us. As you may remember, we paid our 33% or34% stake roughly &#x20AC;1 billion. We got back more or less the same amount in dividends and in tax benefits and our stake is worth something around &#x20AC;3.7 billion to &#x20AC;3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>We are considering the sale of this business, but as you may remember, from now to 2014, more exactly March of 2014, every divestment of our stake should receive an approval from our strategic partners, which include Mr. Amorim and the CDP, the &#x2013; essentially the Portuguese government. So every divestment should receive its approval. As far as price is concerned, we would consider a price, which take into account the market of course, and we will not be ready to sell below the market price.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to R&amp;M and Chemicals, and did I forget something, Sandro?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, perfect. The situation that you have described is exactly where we are today in order to get the approval from our reference, the other two references that already are discussing with them, and I have only to add that the discussions are progressing very, very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, as for your second question around R&amp;M and Chemicals, let's say, we look at the future of these two businesses in somewhat a different way. R&amp;M has been a profitable business for us until 2008. So, not a long time ago, we were making good profits. Now, today the main reason why this business is not profitable is that the refining margins in the Mediterranean, which is the market of our competence have been extremely low. And in fact the drop in demand for petroleum products is certainly not helping.</p>
          <p>Our view is that the amount of refining capacity in the area has to be reduced in order to balance the reduced demand. We expect some closure of other &#x2013; of some refineries in the region. We will look closer to our business to see if we can improve our market position, let's say managing better our capacity. You might be aware that, for example, right now our refinery in Venice is not working and the main reason is to match with a decline in demand.</p>
          <p>On Chemical, the story is more different, this is a business in which there is no reason why we should not be making reasonable returns. We have a plan of improvement of our activity of moving from commodity markets to specialty products, which we are progressively implementing. The first step has been the transformation of our Porto Torres plant into new green chemical products. We have several ideas about that, we progress in this business and we target for 2014 to go back to much more &#x2013; with result which would be much more competitive with our peer group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask one additional one on Gas &amp; Power. Assuming the successful conclusion of your ongoing negotiations with Gazprom, could you give us an EBITDA guidance for this year, please, as you've done historically? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I would prefer to give it to you after the conclusion of the negotiations, and I am hopefully, although it does not depend from me, to be in that position at our strategy presentation.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I just had a quick question following up on Mozambique and the results today in the guidance for an eight well campaign over the next two years. I was wondering if you could offer any color on, at this stage at least anyway, when you hope to sanction a development. I'm guessing sort of early 2014, any more color there would be great. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The well is finished and the well added 8 TCF, so now totally we have found 5.4 billion of barrels, so much more than what we expected. The well has been tested. We got core, we test and also the production result has been very, very positive. And now we have to drill other eight wells in the next two years. We have more than four structure &#x2013; three, four, maybe five structure, it depends on the result of the next well, all exploration wells. So we, by the end of this year we will have all the data necessary to go for an FID. I think that 2013 could be a good year to have the first FID, at least for the first two structures.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Mr. Demichelis, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, if I may. The first one is Claudio was mentioning having all the data by the end of this year on the structures. So maybe you can comment on how the unitization discussions are ongoing. The second question is regarding your renegotiation with the contracts with Gazprom. Why that you are more confident this time than last year? And the third one is how we should be thinking about the dividend going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, Claudio....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unitization. Unitization is, we start talking with the government about unitization and also with Anadarko. We are just in a preliminary stage. Unitization will involve just the first two discoveries because most of the structure are completely only in the Area 4. So, we don't need any unitization. So, the time to market &#x2013; our time to market will not be linked just to unitization because we have also enough reserves in layers and the reservoir that are just only in the Area 4.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are confident that an agreement with Gazprom will be reached soon because, first of all the negotiation is proceeding constructively. This has been based on our longstanding relation with Gazprom and the negotiation is along the lines of agreements that we have recently concluded also with other suppliers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the dividend, I would prefer to discuss about dividends once a year at our strategy presentation and which this year will take place on the 15th of March. For the time being we are pleased to confirm a dividend of &#x20AC;1.04 per share.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please. Firstly just on 2012 CapEx, could you talk about the moving parts in terms of what assumptions you've made in terms of exploration spend for 2012 cost inflation, and then I assume there is a retreat from the reduction in CapEx at site then? Secondly, very quickly, Sandro, what sort of assumption should we make on the tax rate for this year? And then lastly, a question I think I asked in the Congo, but I was just wondering, you've clearly got a very big position in Mozambique with a very high interest, I was just thinking about are there any plans to reduce that stake? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So CapEx for 2012 outlook for exploration we increased our CapEx with respect to 2011, about &#x20AC;350 million increase. And that is due to the big discovery that we did in Indonesia, Mozambique, Angola and in Norway. So we increased the number of well and to review the time to market and to appraise the area and to get the FIDs as soon as possible. So that is more or less the increase that we are going to have in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For sure, then just to give a comfort and to confirm what the reason why we have already stated that we expect to face a CapEx expenditure for 2012 broadly in line with 2011 is because, as you have already stated, we expect a significant decrease in spending made by Saipem since they have almost completed the announcement of their drilling fleet, predominantly. As far as the 2012 tax rate is concerned, we expect that in 2012 the adjusted tax rate will be slightly higher compared to what we have incurred in 2011, and this is because we expect an higher contribution of the E&amp;P pre-tax results, also due to the restart of the activities in Libya. We expect to have the full contribution of the economic results from Libya.</p>

          <p>Mozambique, well as you are aware we hold 70% of the block.</p>
          <p>Now, Mamba raised a huge interest from everybody, and we have been approached by, I would say, almost everybody in the industry asking to be part of this huge development in the area. Our view is, but first of all we need to complete the exploration because we don't know exactly what we have, not yet. And then if, let's say probably the, our first hypothesis is to decrease slightly our stake, probably keeping it in the region of 50%, in that region, and attracting new partners, particularly in the area of consuming, say buyers of gas, because this will ensure a contract in order to sell the gas when we will be able to start the exports.</p>
          <p>Okay, another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I just follow up one, just after Mamba North, in terms of your expectation on the resource base, I think maybe a few months back you talked about the gas in place numbers potentially doubling. Where do you see that sort of, let's say bull case scenario for gas in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said last time was that at the end of the exploration campaign our expectation was to double the gas in place. Now, I've seen that the result of this well is better than what we forecast. So, now we have to see because each well is a different well, it is really a wildcat. But we are still thinking that we can double what we have found with Mamba South. So, we're in the order 40- 45 TCF of gas in terms of resources.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yeah, thank you very much. First, on really, just back on Libya, I was curious if you could give us some Libyan export numbers on top of the production numbers, how much oil are you actually receiving out of Libya or was there any under lift in the fourth quarter? And then maybe tying into Iraq for a second question, what exactly is happening there? You talked about some of the bureaucratic issues, do you think these are going to get worse? And some of your other companies talking about potentially exiting Iraq, is that, just I would like to hear your thoughts on that or do you have any intentions to move potentially up into Kurdistan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first Libya. Libya we are exporting oil in November, so November, December, so we don't have under lifting in Libya at the moment. The oil production is not yet at the top, so we are seeing as equity about 25,000 barrels per day, 30,000 barrels per day. So that is the rate and I think that it will take all the 2012 to go back to the oil production. Gas is going quite well.</p>
          <p>For Iraq &#x2013; that's all, I think, as a question on Libya. For Iraq, Iraq, I think the situation is improving. They are doing quite well, at least for us, for our operation, and better than in 2011. And so, our intention is, first of all, to remain in Iraq, our intention is to participate in the fourth bid round. That will be, should I say, in the next month. For sure, Kurdistan is very interesting from a geological point of view, but we don't want to make any move that can jeopardize our position in the south Iraq.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everybody. A couple of questions for me, the first one is on Snam Rete Gas and the potential disposal of your stake. I was wondering if you could provide us some more details on the timing. And the second question, if the deal will be concluded positively with the entire disposal of the stake, are you considering the opportunity to pay an extraordinary dividend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let me start by saying, we are not planning to divest from Snam Rete Gas, we are planning to divest from Snam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry for the confusion, but probably we made confusion with similar names for the two companies. But we're talking about Snam, which is the listed company, which controls Snam Rete Gas, Stogit, Italgas and GnL Italy. So this is what we are talking about.</p>
          <p>Now, it's very early days to tell you how and when this divestment will happen. It will not depend from us, of course, it will depend firstly from the decree &#x2013; well, firstly from the Italian Parliament, which has to convert the decree of the government. And then there should be a decree, a specific decree of the government which will clarify the procedure in which this divestment may happen.</p>
          <p>Just let me tell you what are our objectives on that, how &#x2013; the objectives that we will protect and defend at any cost. Now, first of all, we want to make a transparent disposal which will be shareholder friendly in front of the Eni shareholders. Second, we want to protect Snam shareholders because we should not forget that we have been bringing this company into the market. We have been putting together all our activities in regulated gas just a couple of years ago and therefore we feel responsible that the interest of Snam shareholders will be protected. And thirdly, we want that at the end of all this process Eni will be a stronger company and not a weaker company.</p>
          <p>Now, giving you these three objectives, and particularly the third one, you will understand that we are not planning an extraordinary dividend.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My first question is on Gas &amp; Power. Could you give us an indication on the impact of Libya on profitability of the division in 2011? So, what could have been a normalized profitability in Gas &amp; Power in 2011? And the second question is on Snam. How will you manage the financing of Snam currently present in case of a disposal, there is any issue on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look on the first, I'll give you an answer because it's a quick one. It's &#x20AC;300 million &#x2013; the impact of Libya on Gas &amp; Power. On the second, Sandro Bernini will make a few comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, you know that the entire Snam group is engaged in a type of business, which the market considers to be a very low risky business. And as a consequence even in so difficult financial environment, we do not see any problem for Snam to refinance entirely their financial exposure when this will happen. I remember you, but just because it has been already anticipated by the CEO of Snam during his conference call. As soon as there will be a change of control of the company of Snam; the financial support provided by Eni will be immediately redeemable. But, of course, since we don't want to create any problem for the company, we will accompany Snam in refinancing, their refinancing process in order to preserve as much as possible the value for the company. So, all in all, we do not expect, we don't foresee any problem in refinancing the financial exposure of the company.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You've been very clear that a key part to improving profitability in Gas Marketing relates to renegotiating your purchase contracts. But I mean looking beyond that, can you perhaps talk about what other strategies you're pursuing in that business to attempt to recover both volumes and margin?</p>
          <p>And the second question, based on you reference oil price and your assumptions on the outlook for the Italian gas market this year, what kind of take-or-pay liabilities, if any, do you expect the Gas &amp; Power business to incur in 2012? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let Bernini answer the second question while Umberto prepares to your first one, which is a very wide question. Now, on &#x2013; first of all, we do not pay the take-or-pay on the basis of the Italian market, but of our European market because we buy gas for all our sales in Europe and I would like to remind you that we sell more gas outside of Italy than in Italy. So, for us it's the European market which counts on that.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of take-or-pay, I have to tell you that among the items that we are &#x2013; which are under discussion with Gazprom is also &#x2013; there is also the take-or-pay levels. So, at which levels we can give up on some purchases of gas and still not be liable for paying the gas &#x2013; or prepaying, rather, the gas. Therefore, it's not easy to give you a number because the number would be the result of the negotiation. Let me just say that the number in total would be fairly reduced. We are speaking about the number of around &#x20AC;200 million, &#x20AC;300 million in total for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, on the more strategic issue, let me just give you the ballpark in which we move, no. The crucial issue when we look at the gas market is that this market has never been so complex, so difficult as it is today. It is enough to tell you, which certainly you do know, that 1 million BTU of gas is sold today at $2.50 in the U.S., at $11 in Europe and at $18 in the Far East. This gives you an idea of how difficult is to draw a strategy in such a complex environment, but we've done so and Umberto might try to give you some element, although this would be an item that we will develop more in our strategy presentation in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you said, our Gas Marketing business experienced tremendous volatility in terms of economic scenario, demand and also weather conditions. So the point of renegotiation, that means to remain market reflective in terms of the price at which we buy gas is the fundamental first solution of this problem and this is where we are putting all our efforts.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we also plan to continue our strategy for growth, particularly in the European market, both in terms of capitalizing on the experience that we have in the Italian market in the oil segment and first in the retail, and by expanding our appraisals, also through acquisition if commercially these opportunities result being viable.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions left. First, on gas renegotiations again, you've talked about Libya, Algeria and Russia. Could you perhaps comment on Norway? And then just secondly, with regards to the Snam disposal, you talked about it being a transparent process. Could you perhaps reassure Eni investors other than the government that, whomever you sell to, you wouldn't sell for less than, for example, the RAB of Snam? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Norway we haven't entered any renegotiation so far because the terms of the contract will give us the first opportunity at the end of 2012 and we are preparing for that.</p>
