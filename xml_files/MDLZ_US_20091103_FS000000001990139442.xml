          <p>Good day, and welcome to Kraft Foods' Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Kraft's management and the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations for Kraft. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on our conference call. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Tim McLevish, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release was sent out earlier today and is available on our website, kraftfoodscompany.com. We've also made available on our website a set of slides that we will refer to during our prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>As you know, during this call we may make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today, so they contain an element of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, so please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Some of today's prepared remarks will include non-GAAP financial measures, and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our news release. Also in connection with the possible combination with Cadbury plc, whether or not we chose to proceed with a formal offer, we may be filing certain documents with the SEC in the future. I would encourage all investors to read these because they will contain important information. Those documents can be found, if and when filed, on the SEC's website.</p>
          <p>I will also note that as a result of the possible combination announced on September 7, we are now restricted by the UK Takeover Code in what we can say, particularly around financial guidance, whether in the current year or on a longer term basis. As a result you will find important disclosures from our reporting accountant and financial advisors in our Form 8-K that was filed today with the SEC. These disclosures relate to the profit forecast and unaudited profit information in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me remind you that the UK Takeover Code severely restricts comments we may make on a possible offer for Cadbury, therefore we would appreciate at the Q&amp;A session of this conference call to focus on the Q3 results and outlook for Kraft Foods as a standalone entity.</p>
          <p>With all of that out of the way, I'll now hand it off to Irene.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we reported another quarter of solid results, results that built further on our strong operating and financial momentum. Once again all geographies contributed, and we did this despite the very challenging consumer environment.</p>
          <p>On the topline or organic growth of 0.5% reflected the impact of three important factors. First, our strategic decision to discontinue less profitable product lines and to forego some unprofitable volume. This reduced topline growth by about one percentage point. Second, consistent with our adaptive pricing model, we lowered prices to reflect the impact of lower dairy costs. This reduced our topline growth by about 1.6 percentage points.</p>
          <p>And third, we faced difficult Q3, year ago comparisons with a highly successful merchandising program at a key North American customer. Considering all of these factors, our organic topline growth would have been almost three points higher. Importantly our topline results continue to reflect the transition from growth based on price to growth based on volume mix.</p>
          <p>In fact volume mix again improved sequentially as it has in each quarter this year. In Q3, it was up 0.7 percentage points despite the significant headwinds I just mentioned as well as weakening economic conditions in certain Western and Eastern European markets. I feel especially good about our solid vol/mix gains in the face of these headwinds, but I am also encouraged by the fact that the focused investments in our priority brands continue to pay off. In fact, the strong growth of these brands fueled our vol/mix gains in the quarter, and these gains in turn drove a 70 basis point expansion in profit margins.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line, our performance was outstanding. EPS from continuing operations grew 62%, and about half of that growth was driven by operating gains. In addition, we delivered a significant improvement in our discretionary cash flow. Year-to-date we've generated approximately $2.7 billion; that's up 67% due to working capital efficiency as well as disciplined management of our capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Based on these results and our strong operating momentum, we are raising our 2009 earnings guidance. At the same time, we're continuing to take actions to stage the business for strong growth, on both the top and bottom lines in 2010.</p>
          <p>We've raised our 2009 diluted EPS guidance by $0.04 to at least $1.97. This outlook reflects two things. First strong year-to-date operating performance, up nearly $0.20 year-over-year. And second, our conscious decision to reinvest part of our operating gains into incremental marketing programs to drive future growth. Last year our advertising and consumer spending as a percentage of net revenue was 6.7%. For 2009 our A&amp;C spending will be up high single digits to approximately 7% of net revenues, even though advertising rates have declined considerably.</p>
          <p>Our guidance also reflects the benefit of a lower than expected tax rate, but that will be partially offset by about two to $0.03 of anticipated expenses related to the possible combination with Cadbury. On the topline we've revised our forecast for 2009 net revenue growth to about 2% from about 3%. This change in our near-term revenue outlook reflects three things: smaller contribution from pricing as a result of lower than expected input costs, primarily meat and dairy, which represents more than half of the adjustment; second, our decision to forego unprofitable volume, primarily in Europe; and third, weakening economic conditions in certain countries in Western and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Overall I'm highly confident that our business is well positioned to deliver top-tier performance. We're driving higher quality organic revenue growth, as we said we would. And we're executing against a strong pipeline of cost savings initiatives. In fact, we will spend more than $200 million this year to jumpstart the significant near-term opportunities we outlined in September.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we'll generate substantial savings in procurement, manufacturing, customer service and logistics. We'll use our scale to better leverage our overhead costs. And these savings will drive incremental investments in quality, innovation, marketing and sales. That's our recipe for success.</p>
          <p>It has served us well for the past three years as we have changed the trajectory of our business and staged it for sustainable long-term growth. Looking ahead we continue to target the following: restoring profit margins to industry benchmarks, achieving the high-end of our seven to 9% EPS growth target and growing cash flow in excess of EPS growth.</p>
          <p>Before I hand it over to Tim, I'll make a few comments about our possible combination with Cadbury. Frankly there's not much new to say. I think you're all well aware of the UK Takeover Panel's so-called put-up-or-shut-up deadline of November 9. By that date, we'll have to state our intentions, whether we will make a formal offer or walk away. At this time we continue to review the opportunity by speaking with shareholders of both companies and accepting potential financing options.</p>
          <p>But make no mistake, we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach in line with the following parameters: accretion to cash EPS in the second year, delivering a return on investment well in excess of our cost of capital and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as well as our dividend.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there's been a lot of speculation about what we can afford given these parameters. But as we've said before what we can afford is not relevant. What is relevant is what Cadbury is worth, and that will guide our actions going forward. Finally, let me underscore once again, with or without Cadbury, Kraft Foods is well positioned to deliver top tier performance.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Tim.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Let me start by saying that our Q3 results demonstrated continuing progress &#x2013; progress on the topline, the bottom line and in cash flow.</p>
          <p>On the topline, growth was modest but of higher quality as vol/mix became the key driver of our organic growth. As you can see in this chart, organic growth in the quarter was 0.5% including a positive vol/mix contribution of 70 basis points. As Irene noted earlier, the vol/mix number included a negative impact of 80 basis points from the discontinuation of less profitable product lines, it was also affected by our decision to walk away from some unprofitable volume. Absent these, vol/mix would have been about 100 basis point higher.</p>
          <p>Pricing was essentially flat. Carryover pricing was fully offset by about 160 basis points from applying our adaptive pricing model to lower dairy costs in the U.S. and a negative impact of 20 basis points from a value-added tax credit in the year ago quarter. So on a normalized basis, organic growth would have been much closer to our 4% long-term revenue growth target.</p>
          <p>Over the course of this year, we've talked about our expectations for sequential improvement in vol/mix as a more important component of our topline growth. This chart shows how vol/mix has indeed improved sequentially through the year. And the trend is even stronger when you adjust for the impact of product line discontinuations and the Easter shift that we've noted at the bottom of this page. The chart also shows that we expect a considerable step up in vol/mix growth in the fourth quarter. Vol/mix will be the primary driver of organic revenue growth in Q4. It's expected to contribute at least three points to our topline performance.</p>
          <p>Turning now to earnings per share, we continue to build operating and financial momentum, and that's demonstrated in our EPS. While there are a number of contributors to our EPS, both this year and last, the year-on-year improvement from operations was $0.09 in Q3 and $0.19 year-to-date. In fact, despite various puts and takes in the third quarter, the $0.09 gain from operations by itself represented strong double-digit improvement in earnings.</p>
          <p>The momentum we're seeing in operating gains is being driven by improvement on three fronts: the leverage benefit from sequential improvement in vol/mix driven by the growth in our priority brands, the positive impact from our conscious decision to discontinue less profitable product lines and walk away from unprofitable volume, and more effective management of our cost base.</p>
          <p>As this chart shows, we've improved our year-over-year OI margin each quarter this year. In Q3 we delivered OI margin of 14.5%; that's up from 11.8% in the year ago quarter. A significant contributor to this margin expansion was vol/mix, which drove 70 basis points of the upside. The gains were broad based with margin expansion in every one of our business segments. More importantly, we're generating margin gains while continuing to invest in incremental brand building and future cost savings initiatives. This in turn will fuel future gains in vol/mix and margin expansion. In short, the flywheel is turning.</p>
          <p>We also continued to make excellent progress on cash flow. Year-to-date we generated $2.7 billion in discretionary cash flow. This incremental cash flow has been driven by our focus on working capital efficiencies and carefully managing our capital expenditures. Through nine months, we're already ahead of our previous full year expectation of $2.6 billion. As a result we now expect to deliver over $3 billion of discretionary cash flow for the full year. I'll take a few minutes now to share some highlights of our business segment results starting with North America.</p>
          <p>As you can see, organic revenue growth in North America declined 1.8% overall. This was entirely due to a 3.5 point decline in price levels. Lower dairy costs and the related adjustment under our adaptive pricing model represented more than 2.5 percentage points of the decline. Vol/mix was up 1.7 points fueled by growth in priority categories. This growth occurred despite significant headwinds which included the negative impact of about 60 basis points from product line discontinuations and a difficult comparison with a strong merchandising program in the year-ago quarter at a major customer. I'd note that the impact of comparisons with the merchandising program was felt most in our Beverage, Grocery and Snacks businesses.</p>
          <p>In contrast to the Q3 topline profile of total North America, revenue in our priority categories grew solidly. This once again demonstrates the success of our focused investments in product quality, innovation and marketing.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line, North America delivered a 290 basis point increase in operating margins to nearly 18%. Improved alignment of input cost and pricing, the completion of the restructuring program and vol/mix gains drove the margin expansion. It's also important to note that margins rose even as we increased our investment in A&amp;C double-digit.</p>
          <p>Before we get to individual North America segments, let's take a look at market share performance in the U.S. There is no question that our 52-week share numbers continued to be challenged. As we've said before, we believe the 52-week number is the best ongoing measure of our franchise health. However, 52-week numbers can include periods of temporary dislocation. For instance our rolling 52-week figures shown on the right include data from late last year and early this year when we took the lead on significant price increases just as consumers hit a crisis of confidence in the face of economic recession. And you can see the significant impact of that temporary dislocation in the 13-week numbers on the left.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the latest 13-week data indicates we are picking up momentum, and the improvement trend is strong. Indeed our Q3 market performance was solid, with half of our revenue holding or gaining share, and that's despite difficult comparisons with the highly successful merchandising program in Q3 of 2008.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect to see this positive trend continue, most notably as we lap the two quarters most influenced by the pricing actions and decline in consumer sentiment.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at results by segment. In U.S. Beverages, organic net revenue grew 1.5%. Focused investments in innovation and marketing continue to pay off. Kool-Aid powdered beverages and Capri Sun ready-to-drink each delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Vol/mix was lower due to the impact from the discontinuation of less profitable product lines and the timing of the merchandising program. OI margins rose 640 basis points to 17.6%. The completion of the restructuring program and the improved alignment of prices to input costs contributed to the margin upside, and we continued to invest in incremental marketing, behind our priority categories.</p>
          <p>In U.S. Cheese, organic net revenues fell 10.3%. This is entirely due to a 17 percentage point decline in pricing, as dairy input costs have fallen dramatically versus prior year. However, incremental marketing investments in priority categories drove strong volume growth and market share gains. Kraft Singles were up double-digit, and Philadelphia Cream Cheese grew nearly 20%. Price caps are in good shape, and our gross margins reflective of a healthy price costs balance.</p>
          <p>We achieved a 12.2% increase in operating income that reflected the impact of improved vol/mix, which was partially offset by a double-digit increase in marketing. This profile demonstrates the success of our adaptive pricing model. It's a model that adjusts for input cost volatility and allows us to grow vol/mix and drive profit margins.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to U.S. Convenient Meals where strong momentum continues. On the topline, organic revenues grew 5%. Our focused investment on priority brands and new products drove improvements in vol/mix. This in turn contributed to strong revenue growth and margin gains. Some key drivers: DiGiorno Pizza was up more than 20%, the successful introduction of our DiGiorno and CPK flatbread melts drove incremental revenue, and Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh cold cuts grew double-digit.</p>
          <p>At the profit line, operating margins jumped 390 basis points to over 11%. Better alignment of price to input costs and strong vol/mix gains drove the improvement, overcoming a double-digit increase in marketing investments. In U.S. Grocery organic revenue fell 3%; however, our investments in innovation and marketing continue to pay off. Investments behind Miracle Whip and Kraft Mayo drove growth in spoonable dressings, and Jell-O dessert continued to deliver strong growth behind value oriented marketing.</p>
          <p>But vol/mix was negatively impacted by difficult comparisons to the prior year, including a 1.6 point impact from the discontinuation of less profitable product lines. The negative impact from the timing of our merchandising program versus prior was also a factor. Operating margins, however, rose 380 basis points to 33.2%. Margin benefited from better price to cost alignment and vol/mix.</p>
          <p>In U.S. Snacks, organic revenues fell 3.3%, entirely due to lower price levels. Price levels reflected reduced input costs as well as fixing our price gaps in snack nuts. Revenue for our top five biscuit brands were up about 5%, and snack nuts began to rebound. But these gains were offset by the negative impact from comparisons with strong merchandising programs in the prior year. Looking forward, we expect to report solid vol/mix gains in Q4. At the profit line, margin rose by 100 basis points due to better price cost alignment and the timing of marketing investment.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Canada and North America Foodservice. Our business in Canada continued to perform well. Successful marketing investments and customer programs fueled strong organic revenue growth and market share gains. For the segment overall, however, organic revenues fell by 1% as declines in Foodservice more than offset strong gains in Canada. Revenue growth in our Foodservice business remains challenged, facing headwinds on three fronts: the continuation of an industry-wide slowdown in restaurant traffic, our decision to discontinue a less profitable product line and lower prices of Foodservice cheese products.</p>
          <p>Segment operating margins rose by 100 basis points, which reflected better alignment of pricing to input cost and the completion of our restructuring program. These benefits were partially offset by increased marketing investments, higher overhead costs and unfavorable vol/mix. Now I'll turn to our businesses outside North America.</p>
          <p>In Europe, revenues were down slightly as we've taken actions to improve the profitability of this important business. The planned discontinuation of product lines and our decision to forego profitable volume resulted in a negative 1.7 percentage point impact on vol/mix. In addition, the economic slowdown has continued to negatively impact consumption, with Iberia mostly acutely affected.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult economic conditions, our priority brands led by Milka, Carte Noire, Philadelphia and Mikado grew around 2% and gained share, particularly in chocolate and coffee. While we expect these near-term headwinds on organic revenue growth to remain, we are making progress on our profit margin, progress that will continue.</p>
          <p>Q3 operating margins more than doubled to 10.2%. Improved product mix was a key contributor adding about 150 basis points to margin. The improved alignment of prices with input cost added another 150 basis points. The rest of the margin upside was related to the completion of our restructuring program and the absence of asset impairment charges.</p>
          <p>This is partially offset by higher investments and cost savings initiatives and increased marketing investment to support our priority brands. Finally, developing markets where organic revenues grew 8.1%. This is driven by more than 15% growth in our priority brands. And despite softer than anticipated category trends in Central and Eastern Europe, we delivered strong growth largely by expanding market share.</p>
          <p>More specifically, the priority brands in Latin America and Asia Pacific grew about 20%, and in CEEMA more than 9%. I'd also note that revenue growth was negatively impacted by about one point from the absence of the Brazilian value added tax credit that was booked in the prior year.</p>
          <p>On the profit line, operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14.6%. Improved vol/mix, the timing of A&amp;C spending, overhead leverage and the completion of the restructuring program all contributed to margin expansion. Going forward the economic environment, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, will remain challenging. However, we will continue to invest in incremental marketing behind our priority brands in Q4 to emerge from the difficult economic conditions even stronger.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand it back to Irene for some closing comments.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Tim. To sum up, our Q3 results continue to reflect the strong operating and financial momentum we've been building over the past three years. We've raised our full-year EPS guidance to at least $1.97, and our discretionary cash flow target to at least $3 billion. At the same time we're taking actions to stage the business for strong top and bottom line growth in 2010. We are well positioned to deliver a top tier performance, with or without Cadbury.</p>
          <p>Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>So I feel very good about the state of our price gaps and I feel very good about the results of our marketing programs and our investments in our market share, particularly in the U.S. But as we discussed, around the world, we're feeling very good about the health of our share performance.</p>

          <p>Hello, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Evening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that in North America, adaptive &#x2013; the combination of adaptive pricing and the pass through businesses accounted for, I think, 2.5 percentage points of the 3.5% sort of negative pricing. And I guess that leaves another 100 basis points or so of negative pricing in other non-pass through kind of businesses.</p>
          <p>And I'm curious, first off, that sounds -- I guess that's promotional spending to some extent, but I'd be curious if there's any list pricing actions in there. And that seems maybe somewhat higher, perhaps, than we're hearing from other kind of branded packaged food companies. But I guess the most puzzling thing is it didn't seem to lead to much improvement, obviously, in volume sequentially. Or at least I don't think it did because we don't have exact clarity on volume versus mix. But maybe you could kind of address that because I just get the feeling that's clearly one of the bigger sort of overhangs on the stock right now, understanding the headwinds that you have around SKU reduction and all, but you've had that for the last couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that the &#x2013; you can certainly see the impact on volume in our Cheese business, which as we said was the single biggest contributor to the price reductions. And so I'm quite pleased with the performance that we're seeing in processed cheese and cream cheese. We've talked a lot about our revitalization of those businesses, and I think you're starting to see that play through not only in the volumes, but as well in the shares on those businesses.</p>
          <p>Similarly another key contributor was Meat, and I feel very good about the performance of our Meat business in this past quarter. So I think you're seeing it play through. The other business that was impacted by pricing, as Tim mentioned, is our Snacks business and there is two parts there. The one is the nuts business which we've talked about the &#x2013; our desire to get our price gaps in better alignment there, and we actually are starting to see a moderation in the performance of that business. So I think we certainly saw &#x2013; we're not quite seeing the growth we'd like, but we definitely had a lesser decline on our nuts business in this last quarter.</p>
          <p>And lastly biscuits, in response to the drop in wheat. We executed those actions through promotional changes as opposed to through list price reductions. So I think we've described to you the various places where we chose to make some changes. We made the bulk of those changes through impacting them through our trade promotion as opposed to through list price reductions, but I feel quite comfortable where our pricing stands today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it &#x2013; did volume improve sequentially in the quarter? I think it was flat last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as &#x2013; we've talked about vol/mix, and you see a significant improvement, and I would say volume as well. We obviously had some mitigating factors that we alluded to: the combination of really the pruning and as well as the fact that we had a significant change in our promotional timing year-over-year, particularly in North America. But we are definitely seeing sequential improvement in vol/mix as we've said we would, and we anticipate in the fourth quarter, that we will continue to see further sequential improvement in its contribution to our overall revenue performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last thing, and that was a good segue into the fourth quarter. If I think about where your current full-year guidance would imply for the fourth quarter, it looks like an earnings number that's either flat or down a bit versus last year, and yet, when I think about, I guess where maybe an EBIT estimate might be for the fourth quarter, it's pretty similar to where maybe you were on a restated basis back in the fourth quarter of 2006, but you've obviously got almost $2 billion of incremental sales.</p>
          <p>And so I'm thinking about, despite Wall-to-Wall and restructuring and improving the brand equities and the pricing power, and yes, you've had higher costs across the board. But I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of &#x2013; in a bigger picture sense, why are we not seeing any kind of profit leverage on that higher sales base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andrew, what you're seeing, if you look at 2009, I mean, I think we've said, first and second quarter that 2009 was going to be a little bit unusual year in terms of the seasonality of it. Typically, we're fairly balanced across the fourth quarter, and the first two quarters of this year as a result of the financial &#x2013; the financial crisis in the market out there, we &#x2013; we gated a lot of our spending to make sure that we had especially plenty of liquidity and we had a healthy financial profile.</p>
          <p>And so, we reduced a fair amount of the spending, some of the A&amp;C for instance, was a little bit back-end loaded. We're going to see a lot of that pick up in the fourth quarter. That may be a little bit why you're not seeing some of the volumes and vol/mix pop as much as you might expect, because we have a fairly heavy fourth-quarter investment there. Also the investment in some of the cost savings initiatives is also pushed into the fourth quarter. So, we're doing pretty heavy spending in the fourth quarter, again to stage the 2010.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, Alexia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And couple of quick ones. On the product discontinuations and the trade promotional spending changes last year, are we going to be up against much easier comps next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Alexia, as we've told you, the &#x2013; North America, we should have most of that behind us. It was a big factor through the third quarter, and we will now start to be clear of that in North America. Some of that in Europe and the developing markets will spill over into the first quarter of next year. But our expectation is that we will stop having to call it out as we move through next year. We clearly have made the right economic decision for the long-term health of the business, but it should not be as important an impact in our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then on the pricing outlook going forward, it seems as though, I guess the reduction in the organic sales growth guidance for this year was primarily reflecting lower than expected prices this time, and we've started to see them get negative year-on-year. As we go out through the first half of next year, are we going to see that continue to be a &#x2013; I guess, a hangover on organic sales growth, is that &#x2013; that will likely continue to be negative in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; as we've said, we expect vol/mix will be the key driver going forward. You'll start to see &#x2013; you started to see it in this quarter as you saw the pricing impact in our third quarter was negative, and that will continue into the fourth quarter. And then as we move into next year and going forward, vol/mix will be a much more significant driver of our revenue performance. So, we're not anticipating major changes from a pricing standpoint in response to input costs assuming all other things being equal. But the key driver of our revenue going forward will be the strength of our vol/mix, and I feel quite confident given the health of our business and the strength of our brands at this point in time, that that will play through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And a just quick one for Tim, on the operating margin line, do you know how much the restructuring easier comparable sort of drove operating margin improvement this time around, i.e., if we included the restructuring charges from last year, what would the operation margins have looked like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's about 90 basis points worth of impact from restructuring in the third quarter last year that is removed from this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two quick things, one on the pricing, I guess, like Alexia, I'm a little bit confused there. It looks as though -- I understand the adaptive cheese pricing model, it looks as though you may have dropped pricing a shade, frozen pizza, bacon. And I guess as I'm looking into next year, I mean obviously, we're expecting dairy costs to be up versus where they were this year.  I heard what you just said, Irene, but does that apply kind of a steady-state negative pricing as we move through next year? I'm a little confused on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Terry, this is Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one thing to keep in mind, as it relates to the fourth quarter &#x2013; as you look at the fourth quarter and the impact of pricing, what you're up against was really historic highs in barrel cheese costs in the fourth quarter of '08. So you're going to see that play through in the fourth quarter, but then as you move into the New Year the comparisons starts to meter out a little bit better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that was what I was kind of aiming at is next year rather than the fourth quarter it would, I mean, it would appear that pricing would solidify next year, would it not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would expect, I mean again we had some additional pricing, particularly as Chris pointed out, with cheese. Remember, cheese, fourth quarter last year was 2.30 a, barrel cheese, a pound. This year it's obviously trading at the $1.50 range, so there's a considerable drop there, and that will be reflected in the fourth quarter. I would expect across most of our input cost, as we go into 2010, we've got kind of stability. I mean I can't predict exactly what's going to happen, but our prices and costs are pretty much &#x2013; they're pretty much aligned with our costs at this point. And I would expect considerably more stability so kind of pricing being a very small, positive or negative impact on our topline growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we feel most comfortable about, Terry, is that as a consequence of the adaptive pricing approach, we don't have to forecast the market, we will essentially be able to move with the market and protect profit and margins in the process. And that &#x2013; I think you've seen that play out in the performance of our Cheese business over these last couple of quarters, and I feel very good about that performance and I'm quite confident about the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one quick thing on Europe. Europe is obviously in terms of your overall margin development plans been kind of a challenging area. As we look here you're getting rid of some unprofitable volume, obviously. If you forget about Cadbury for a second, if Cadbury weren't in the picture, would we be looking at kind of a consistent elimination of a lot of unprofitable product over time? Would you be essentially slimming down in a meaningful way the European operation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I feel pretty comfortable that we've gotten a lot of that heavy lifting from a pruning standpoint out of the way, so we will continue to have some businesses that we will want to take out. I think we can do it in a planful way, and that's one of the reasons that we are willing to accept less growth on the topline in Europe because we believe that those decisions that we're making are right for the long-term economics of that business. And you're seeing it play through in our bottom line performance.</p>
          <p>So you saw our margin up significantly in this quarter, we will continue to focus on making progress on improving our margins and a piece of that is shifting our mix to our priority brands where we have the most attractive margin. So there will continue to be some pruning, but as I mentioned the &#x2013; heavy &#x2013; most of the heavy lifting should be behind us as we exit the first quarter of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that &#x2013; I would reiterate, what Irene just said. I would say, think about it as being after the first quarter of next year kind of being background noise. I wouldn't expect us to be talking about it as a carve out item after the first quarter next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Hi, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my first question is how much of the issues in the fourth quarter because it seems like it's a little bit weaker than I would have expected, is structural and will bleed into 2010? And then I have a follow-up question on 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; I mean &#x2013; the what you're seeing for the first quarter &#x2013; for the fourth quarter I don't see as any weakness. So I'm not concerned about carrying over into 2010. Again we're investing fairly heavy &#x2013; the seasonality was distorted this year because we &#x2013; we're light in the first half of the year, probably got more normal in the third quarter, and then we're spending a fair amount &#x2013; both in terms of cost saving initiatives, in terms of investments and marketing, et cetera, in the fourth quarter. So you are seeing additional spend but I wouldn't consider the fourth quarter as a weak quarter from an operational standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Ken, one other thing to keep in mind, one  of the things that we called out in the update on the guidance was the two to $0.03 of additional costs related to the proposal on Cadbury. That's going to primarily fall in the fourth quarter, so  again from a year-on-year comparison perspective I think you have to keep that in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We put our guidance up $0.04, Ken. I'm feeling quite good about the performance in the quarter. I think there's a lot to feel good about as we look at our topline performance as well as our bottom line performance, and we have a very positive outlook on the balance of the year. So as we said there's a couple of one-time items, a little bit of spending gating that impacts the seasonality here, but we feel quite good about the performance of the business and the outlook for the balance of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And some of the investments we're making in the fourth quarter should stay just very well going into 2010. So we feel quite confident about that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I Irene, I think you said in the commentary that you are targeting the higher end of your seven to 9% EPS growth going forward. I'm assuming that's &#x2013; the implication is for 2010 that you are setting yourself up for that, is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ken, we're not prepared today to provide guidance for 2010, but we had made the commitment that we would &#x2013; we expected to see 2010 at the top end of our range given particularly the strong pipeline of cost savings initiatives that we have. And we have a clear line of site to the key programs that will drive that, and so we feel quite comfortable despite the fact that we've taken up our 2009 EPS that we will continue to target the upper end of the range in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a little bit of a better sense of what really changed just since last quarter on the organic growth line relative to what you were expecting, especially on the pricing side? Tim, if I remember correctly, you did state last quarter that you thought pricing could turn negative in Q3. So was it that much different than what you had thought in 90 days ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean cheese costs continued to be a lot lower than we would have anticipated, and that's relative to what we thought coming out of the second quarter. The rest &#x2013; the rest really is largely to do with softer vol/mix in international markets and as we talked about some of the, walking way from unprofitable business and weaker than expected consumer environment, particularly in Eastern Europe but it extends some into Western Europe as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>And would you also mind giving us an updated number on what you expect in terms of year-over-year change in your input cost?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for your expectation for 2009 as a whole, but if you have the third quarter number as well that would be helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the number has come down. If you remember, I think we said at mid year, it was about 500 million of pressure. Third quarter was a little bit better than that, but I would say we're looking at 200, 250 million versus 2008 at this point, still $200 million higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then just last question, was hoping may be you could just elaborate a little bit on the comments about the weakness in Europe business, just since most of us are little less familiar with that region in terms of what you're seeing on the consumer behaviorally, and how that's changing, over the last few months?</p>

          <p>As you know, we're seeing the impact of the recession hitting Europe a little bit later than what we had seen in North America, and we are seeing the impact in a number of markets, particularly France and Spain, are the hardest hit, and I think it's been true pretty much across the industry. And so we expect that that's going to continue for some time. I am very pleased that even in the face of some of those challenging economic conditions, our businesses have held up well. We are continuing to grow share in most of our core categories, and I think it's been helpful that we have a diversified portfolio to help us there. But I will say that we've taken a cautious planning stance on some of these markets and we are not expecting a quick rebound anytime soon, and we're backstopping our plans accordingly.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to circle back to the question of volumes and elasticities. I guess what gives you the confidence that there hasn't been a change in the elasticity models or in consumer behavior here? It does seem that despite all the one-off items that you talked about that constrained your volume growth this quarter, it really seemed that the &#x2013; you really only had up volumes and materially up volumes in two of your segments, one of them being Cheese. So, I guess could you provide some basis as to why you think that there hasn't been a change in consumer behavior or elasticity modeling, because your pricing was down pretty significantly, even excluding Cheese?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess &#x2013; there's a couple of things, Eric. First of all, I feel very good about the performance of our vol/mix. In this quarter it improved sequentially, as we said it would despite the tailwind of a fairly significant amount, almost a point of pruning in those numbers. So, it was an important contribution to our overall performance, and it &#x2013; we were able to see that impact despite the challenge of the offset of some of the pruning</p>
          <p>The other reality is particularly North America, we've alluded to the fact that we had a very significant program a year ago with one of our major customers, and that had a very significant impact on our overall performance. But as we look category-by-category I feel quite good about how our brands have held up, our ability to continue to improve vol/mix even at these higher price levels. And I feel very good about the outlook as we think about the fourth quarter, because we've got &#x2013; we are &#x2013; had very strong programming as we look, at the fourth quarter, supported in large measure by the fact that we're continuing to invest in A&amp;C I mentioned.</p>
          <p>We will exit the year at about 7% of revenue, despite the fact that the cost of media have come down considerably, and we also will have lapped the discontinuations as I mentioned in North America. So net-net, we feel very good about the performance of the underlying vol/mix performance of the portfolio. I think it has responded &#x2013; our business has responded well to the investments that we've made, and we have &#x2013; we feel very good about the outlook as we look forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just to follow-up on that. When you look at the incremental volume that you &#x2013; or business that you stepped away from because of the margins or overall profitability wasn't attractive, why should we look at that as anything different from you not being able to price owing to the competitive or consumer environment in those regions?</p>
          <p>It seems kind of, yeah I know you're calling it out as a incremental factor, and I could see why you would call out incremental factors like the deliberate pruning that you &#x2013; that's been going on for the past year, but it seems that the incremental decision to step away from volume was really &#x2013; why was that not really just a function of inability to realize the pricing and margins that you needed, given the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you look at what it was that we chose to prune, and we've talked this through with you. It's things like, one of our Foodservice &#x2013; our Foodservice Cheese business. It's businesses like our Handi-Snacks pudding business, and I believe we shared with you at CAGNY the combined revenue of these businesses was about $0.5 billion. That's somewhere between 300 million and $500 million, and it actually &#x2013; those businesses were losing money. And so part of our strategy here is to make sure we are not chasing empty volumes but we are focused on volume that we believe is sustainable and is the right &#x2013; enables us to make the right long-term investment decisions, not only in A&amp;C but also in terms of our assets. I mean we actually were able to make some plant closure decisions, some plant department closure decisions as a consequence of some of these discontinuations.</p>
          <p>So our intent in the pruning is to ensure that our volumes &#x2013; that the volumes that we are investing in is sustainable volume, and it has the right profit profile. And it's one of the reasons we talk a lot about the performance of our priority brands because it's going to take a little bit of time for some of this &#x2013; these empty pounds to work their way through the system, but where the end is in sight, as I said earlier, and I feel quite comfortable it is the right long-term decision for our business.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a housekeeping item for Tim. How much of the 200 million in productivity investment or upfront costs, whatever you guys want to call it, did you spend in the third quarter and year-to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year-to-date we're about &#x2013; we're about 100 million for the three quarters year-to-date, and so we have in the fourth quarter anticipate it being a little bit over 100 remaining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just lastly, and I will pass it on. The very successful merchandising program that you alluded to that led to the tough comps. Is that being repeated this year at a different time? Has it, did we see that in the second quarter? Is it coming in the fourth quarter, and if not, why not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's actually been spread out over the course of the year. I think the reality is that as a consequence of that program, we had some very significant merchandising presence on a number of our core businesses, as we mentioned Snacks, Grocery were two of the businesses that were impacted, and our Beverage business were three of businesses that were impacted most significantly by the change.</p>
          <p>But it has no impact on our full year guidance so what has essentially happened is it's a big hit in the third quarter, but it's essentially been spread out and still we &#x2013; some benefits from the merchandising will accrue to us in the fourth quarter as a consequence.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Judy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hello, everyone. If I look at your EBIT margin year-to-date, you guys are already running at 14.6%, which is pretty close to your long-term or 2011 target of mid teens level. I mean the fourth quarter I think is probably going to be not as favorable, but it just seems like you've already hit a lot of the strides in terms of making the margin improvement so I'm just trying to understand thinking out two years from now if there is even a greater upside to sort of that mid teens margin target goal is my first question?</p>
          <p>And then related to that, if I think about your outlook for earnings growth of higher than or at the high end of seven to 9%, it seems like your revenue growth over the next couple of years could be a little bit below that 4% plus long-term target because if that's not the case, it seems like your earnings growth could be even stronger than kind of the high end to the seven to 9%. So I'm just wondering if I am thinking about all these moving parts in the right way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll tell you, Judy, we feel very good about the margin performance of our business, both in this quarter as well as year-to-date. I feel very good about the path that we've laid out to be at or above industry margins in the next couple of year, and I think we're well on our way. And we are obviously continuing to execute against that objective. I would suggest it's a real too early to declare victory. I think we have clear visibility to the programs that will generate those margin improvements, and I think we're executing them well. But I suggest that we should get ahead of ourselves.</p>
          <p>So I feel very good about the margin performance is a key contributor to the strength of our business, and I have great confidence that we are on the path that we have laid out. But I think it would be just premature to get ahead our self.</p>
          <p>With respect to topline, we feel &#x2013; we continue to feel quite comfortable that the 4% plus target for revenue growth is the right target to lay out. If you look even at these last two years that we're at 4%. It's not going to be in any given year, you are not going to necessarily hit the number precisely. But we feel quite comfortable that even the investments that we have made in our brand equities, the appropriate pruning that we have done of products and product lines that were actually a drag on our mix, that we are well staged to be able to &#x2013; to continue to drive a 4% growth on a sustainable basis.</p>
          <p>So we remain confident that that is the right long-term target. As I say in any given year, we may see some puts and takes, and I would suggest, particularly with respect to dairy pricing, these last &#x2013; this last year or so has been unprecedented in terms of the swings that we've seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on the margin question though. I mean, if you looked at your performance year-to-date a lot of the benefit has comes from more favorable commodity cost and then some of the pruning processes, which really seem to be additional factors to the factors that are likely to drive the margin improvement going forward. So I'm just wondering how much of those factors had you built in previously in thinking about the mid-teens margin goals, and are there potentially upside to those numbers just given some of the commodity behaviors and the fact that you've had the pruning process that made the base business a bit more profitable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer is we feel very good about the impact of our actions on the performance of our &#x2013; of the mix of our portfolio, and I think that will continue to be a positive going forward. You've seen the beginning of that impact in the third quarter, and it will be a significant driver going forward.</p>
          <p>But let me just remind you there are number of moving pieces in the third quarter that contributed to our margin performance. Obviously the completion of the restructuring program certainly helped us. Less than half of it though came from pricing in excess of cost. So I think the most important takeaway is that the investments that we've made in quality and brand equity and in our marketing activities have enabled us to take pricing that in fact really just catches up with the last couple of years of cost increases. But it is not a critical component going forward. As we've said before, we believe that our recipe for success here, is for volume and mix, to continue to be the key driver of revenue, which will then provide the overhead leverage to helps us to expand margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just in terms of your market share performance, I know it's an improvement versus what you saw in the earlier part of the year, but I mean you're still gaining share in half of your categories. So, and despite a lot of the investments that you've made in a lot the businesses. So I'm just wondering why you feel actually pretty good about your market share performance when you're not gaining share in your half the categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in this past quarter, we were, and I'd say, not suggesting that we're resting on our laurels here. We are still not satisfied with our 52 week share as Tim mentioned, but our trend is clearly improving in the U.S., and you can see that in terms of our progress in the last two quarters. And don't forget we're looking a dollar shares at a time that we had some significant price declines. So, actually if you look at our volume shares, they are even stronger than that.</p>
          <p>So I mean, I think we &#x2013; we feel quite good that we are seeing good progress, but we are not where we need to be. So I don't want to suggest that we're satisfied with our share performance. But I think there's ample indication that we are making good progress, particularly on our priority brands, against key competitors, and we expect that that will continue to be the case moving forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd point out a couple of things in addition. Again within U.S., there are some categories in which we have very high market share to start with. And in that &#x2013; for those particular circumstances, we're all better served to &#x2013; we're better served to be promoting growth to category rather than less necessarily focusing on share performance. And there are a couple of those categories where we have very significant share, and they're nice sized categories. The other thing I'd point out is, unfortunately, because of the better precision of the data, we focus our conversation on U.S. market shares. If went internationally, you would find a much better picture in terms of our market shares and in our developing markets as well as in some of our EU markets, we're growing very nicely in our market share.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question just, Tim, two point &#x2013; almost $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, that's I think it's almost four times more than you had in the third quarter last year and it's more than twice where it was at the beginning the year, so you talk a little bit about, how your &#x2013; what you are doing to accumulate that kind of cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I mean some of it is strong cash flow and that is a good thing. I'll tell you, there is couple of things, we have as you know a $750 million bond maturing I think next week or the following week. So we are staging for paying that down, and as a result of the transaction &#x2013; the proposed transaction, the rating agencies put us on some watch, and we were very careful to ensure we had sufficient liquidity. So we build a little cash in concern that there may be a little bit dislocation in the CP markets. So we built a little bit there. We're going to manage that appropriately. Being a little bit heavy in cash, as we're looking at this transaction, it's probably not a bad place to be either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then just &#x2013; just a clarification. I think Irene in response to Andrew Lazar's question about volume mix, did you say that the volume improved, that the volume component improved sequentially from flat in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, Bryan, what we've said is vol/mix is the right metric to look at for our business, and so we're not providing specific metrics on volume. What I did say is that it's moving in the right direction. Our Q3 volume 00 the trends are definitely moving sequentially better, that is correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the reason, once again we &#x2013; we had a lot of empty pounds in our volume forecasts and in our numbers, and it's just taken up some time to work our way through it, but you're seeing the impact on our profit performance and on our margins.

          <p>Hi, just I guess just two left here. My first question for you is just to be clear on how much of an incremental hit you have from walking away from unprofitable volume? What's new to that from what you told us earlier in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think really just the addition, we've been talking about the pruning and we've been be very clear about when we would lap that. So no new news there. The new news is what we talked about in terms of the that fact we did choose in this quarter to walk away from some volume and some geographies. As you might imagine there's a fair amount of customer pressure around the world in this recessionary environment, and we've chosen to stand firm in a number of cases if we don't feel that the opportunity is in our long-term interest. And so that had a fairly material impact on our revenue line in Europe in particular, and then in aggregate as we told you it was a fairly significant impact to our total performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the last shot here. Fourth quarter volume, you've put it up 3% plus. And I think that's volume mix. Last year you were down 5.2%, I believe in volume, but I think that was just volume. Can you give us some sense of what the comp would be on your new basis of volume mix and whether you think of that as growth or just kind of reclaiming some of the lost volume from the price increase last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, we feel quite comfortable that you will continue to see sequential improvement in the vol/mix contribution to revenue as you saw over these last couple of quarters, and we've given you a number of about 3% plus. And it reflects the underlying momentum in the business, that is versus &#x2013; a downside &#x2013; the comp is about down five from the year-ago.</p>
          <p>Part of that is the fact that we do have some markets around the world, and I gave you some specific examples, where we are continuing to see challenging economies. It's Western Europe, we've talked about France and Spain. It's Eastern Europe, Russia, Poland is just having a challenging time, and even in Latin America, markets like Venezuela. So it reflects the fact that there will continue to be some economic challenges around the world. As I said we have backstopped our plans accordingly, but it will have some impact or on our topline.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi this is Jackie Ingelsby standing in for Vincent. Just a clarification on Judy's question. You said that four &#x2013; the three to 4% organic revenue target is kind of more of an average goal and maybe not a rate that you'll hit every year. So I guess my question is are you suggesting that you might not hit this growth goal in 2010? We're kind of looking at the reduction to your 2009 revenue guidance, some of your pricing moves, the pruning of volumes, Western Europe problems, market share weakness, so we're sort of wondering if that three to 4% number is realistic for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jackie, you should take no implications from what I'm saying today about what our forecast is for topline in 2010. We feel quite comfortable about the underlying operating and financial momentum of the business, and I feel quite confident that it will continue. We &#x2013; as I mentioned earlier the &#x2013; the comparison of 2008, 2009 from a topline standpoint, we went from a wealth of riches of 6% last year to a forecast that we have given you today of about 2% because of the fact &#x2013; primarily because we've seen some significant swings in dairy year-over-year. We are not anticipating that that will carry on going forward so we still feel quite comfortable with our forecast of at least 4% on an ongoing basis for the business, and I think the investments that we have made in our franchises are paying off and will carry us forward.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hard to believe there would be another question, but there is. I have a question about fourth quarter '08, in that market share chart, you said you only gained share or held share in 26% of your categories. So that looks like a very easy comparison as we head into fourth quarter of this year. Now that you've gotten cheese pricing where it should be, and I guess you're taking share again, shouldn't that be just a very easy comp, and could you blow out that number, if you're also raising A&amp;C in fourth quarter, and wouldn't that drive market share? And then maybe you could just tell us, what will A&amp;C as a percent of sales look like in fourth quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue &#x2013; it will be, our average for the year, we're very modestly behind in dollars year-to-date, ahead in terms of percentage of revenue. We're anticipating that both numbers will be increased &#x2013; will be above 7% full year is our expectation. When you look at market share though from the fourth quarter, again we're focused, our primary focus is on the 52-week number.</p>
          <p>Yeah, you're right, relative to -- we just look at the 13-week number, fourth quarter 2008 to 2009, we should do &#x2013; we should do quite well. But again when you factor a 52-week, remember that is looking at the prior 52-weeks versus the previous to that 52 weeks. So we'll still have in our 52-week number the pressure from the first quarter of this year. It will make it an easier comp for the fourth quarter from the prior 52 weeks, that it's agreed. So yeah, we would expect that we would have good market share position in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess I would say about our spending, as Tim mentioned we've gated our spending this year to just ensure that we understood the state of our business as well as the economic environment and we will have some significant spending in the fourth quarter of 2009. But much of that benefit will really start to hit us and help us in 2010. And once again it's why we feel quite encouraged about the future performance of the business as well as the contribution of vol/mix toward our revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And judging from all the questions on the call, Irene, it sounds like there's a lot of skepticism about the degree to which the discontinuations are accretive to your margin or accretive to profits and shareholder value. Can you speak a little bit more about how long &#x2013; we've had two discontinuation kind of mentions now in the last nine months. How much more of your portfolio do you think still needs to get pruned here, and when you look at that, is there still a lot of empty volume still in your portfolio to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, when we laid this out, and I believe we laid it out over a year-ago we told you that we felt that this was the right long-term decision for the business. We were pretty clear about what it was we were going to pruning and how long it was going to take and we're on that path. So there's no new news here other than it is &#x2013; it continues to be an impact, a significant enough impact that we feel the need to call it out at this stage, because we have an impact in North America, and we do have an impact in Europe and developing markets.</p>
          <p>As I have said, we will lap North America as we head into the fourth quarter, and we will lap most of the heavy lifting in the other markets through the first quarter of 2010. So it is not our intent to continue to have to call out pruning. We will continue to do pruning because we believe it's the right thing to do for the business, but we had some very significant housecleaning to do as we got started here, and as I said this is just the execution of that program that we told you about playing out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You may recall earlier in the year we identified some of the metrics okay where we said we had pruned $300 million that had a cumulative or combined operating income of negative 14, so you can see that it's clearly the right thing to do and had a margin impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I guess what people are responding to now is that there is more walking away from business in Europe specifically. Maybe you could speak to the -- how profitable was that volume that you're walking away from? I mean was that negative previously or flat previously? And then it became really negative when the pricing got tough?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Let's talk about Foodservice, can you give us an outlook for your Foodservice business and the health of your customers. Are you seeing customers still exit the business or is that slowing down, any kind of outlook update there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the big picture for us is that overall as people are eating more at home, they are coming home to our products and coming home to Kraft. So I'd say has been &#x2013; the Foodservice, the slowdown in Foodservice has been a net positive to us. Of course it has been a negative impact to our Foodservice business, but that's less than 5% of our revenue, so I think it's been in aggregate for our total company, it has been a net positive. So there &#x2013; we continue to see weakness in our food away from home business, both domestically as well as internationally and not a lot of signs that's going to recover any time soon. But the good news is we're able to pick it up because of the strength of our retail business around the world.</p>

          <p>Can I go back for one second to the very first question that Jonathan Feeney asked to just make sure that our answer was clear. With respect to our criteria for the transaction or the proposed transaction impact on our dividend. Our criteria would suggest that we would &#x2013; would expect to hold our dividend per share constant, not &#x2013; not the aggregate dollars associated with it. So obviously the aggregate dollar would increase to the extent we have more share is outstanding.</p>
