          <p>Greetings and welcome to the Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Third Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kevin Mannix, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Mannix, you may begin.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rob. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Teva's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Results. I'm joined today by our CEO, Shlomo Yanai, our Chief Financial Officer, Eyal Desheh, Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva Americas, Dr. Gerard Van Odijk, President and CEO, Teva Europe. Shlomo, will begin by providing an overview of the third quarter performance; Eyal, will then provide additional details on our consolidated financial results. Before turning the call back to Shlomo, we'll provide an updated outlook for 2011. We'll then open the call to question-and-answer period.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Teva's 2010 report on Form 20-F and in our report on Form 6-K. Also, the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Teva's earnings release issued earlier this morning, which can be found on our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Shlomo. Shlomo, if you would, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today to review Teva's results for the third quarter of 2011. Overall, our efforts in the quarter yielded mixed results against a backdrop of important strategic moves, both on the branded and generic fronts. We saw sales increase by 2% year-over-year to $4.34 billion, which produced quarterly operating profit and net income of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion respectively. This brought us to an EPS of $1.25. All of these metrics will present sequential growth compared to the first and second quarter, as we have guided.</p>
          <p>A combination of strong performances from multiple business units have enabled us to exceed our guidance for the third quarter, despite reduced sales in the U.S. generic business. There were positive contributions from the majority of our business units, especially from our branded franchises, but also from our generic businesses in Europe and the emerging markets, which continue to exhibit strong growth. Their performances were extremely important in providing balance in the face of significantly reduced generic sales in our largest market, the United States. Here, the business continued to struggle to replace expired $180 billion exclusivities from the year-ago period, which, as you know, were not only significant contributors to sales but to our bottom line, as well.</p>
          <p>I would like to discuss the U.S. performance in greater detail than I normally do because it is important to appreciate the difficult comparison. If you look at 2010, our generic version of Effexor XR, Hyzaar, Cozaar, Mirapex <mark type="indiscernible" /> (04:08) generated revenues totaling almost $1.4 billion, including $560 million in the third quarter of that year alone. Now, fast-forward to 2011 and the combined sales of these same products will total just $350 million for the entire year, including $58 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Replacing these sales from 2010 has proven to be a challenging task, one which has been compounded by the fact that we have been missing an important undisclosed launch due to timing of FDA approval. We are hopeful that this product will be launched in Q4.</p>
          <p>The U.S. remains a key market for Teva and continues to be the largest generic business in the world. The dynamics of the U.S. generics market are changing. However, we still see great potential for growth, starting with the recent launch of Olanzapine and continuing through next quarter, which we expect to be a strong quarter for the &#x2013; our U.S. generics business. We are pleased by the significant progress we made at both the Irvine and Jerusalem manufacturing facilities, as we put the quality issues experienced at these facilities behind us. Quality is our top priority and we are working diligently to take the system improvements we have made at these facilities and implement them throughout our network of manufacturing facilities around the world.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to turn to some of the more positive highlights in the quarter. Europe and emerging markets continue to display impressive growth, benefiting from a level of diversity that has eluded other operating in these regions. Europe was especially impressive, growing sales by 24% in local currency, $1.344 billion. Our organic growth rate for the Europe business was 9%, while in our five major European markets sales grew organically by an average of 14%. And this September, for the first time, Teva became the number one generic pharmaceutical company in Germany by both volume and value. We attribute the strength in this region to our unique position as a true pan-European company. We have diversity throughout the 27 countries that make up this region, which reduces our dependency on any one country.</p>
          <p>In other ex-U.S. regions, Latin America posted 22% organic growth, reaching more than $200 million in sales. I include the progress we have made in EMEA, which, as a business, exceeded $350 million with organic growth of 16% for the quarter. This was largely due to record generics sales in Russia, which grew organically by 27%. In Japan, pharmaceutical sales reached $195 million for the third quarter, and I'll provide additional information on that country shortly.</p>
          <p>All of these markets and others are important to our long-term strategy, which includes growing our leadership position in the global generics market. We strive to be the global dominant generic player and we want to do this across the globe, whether it is in the GGx, the generic generic market, the BGX market, the branded generic market, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:15) market or the <mark type="ph" /> momentum of us (08:16). Whichever model, Teva's size and scale as the global generics market leader represents a significant competitive advantage as we continue to diversify our generic business not just by form, but also by geography.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our branded businesses, Copaxone led the way in a 26% increase in in-market sales that totaled more than $1 billion. Our flagship product continues to lead the U.S. and global multiple sclerosis market in both sales and market share, including a 3.5% year-to-date growth in U.S. prescriptions, as patients and physicians seek treatment with proven long-term efficacy and safety. We believe this will serve the product's growth even as the market awaits the introduction of additional MS therapies, which will certainly expand the market.</p>
          <p>Last week, we held a meeting with FDA to discuss the NDA for laquinimod. Following the meeting, we now believe that it would be premature to file an NDA at this time. We will continue to study laquinimod and are pleased that FDA has offered to work with us to determine the best design for</p>
          <p>conducting an additional trial.</p>
          <p>Part of Teva's long-term strategy is to build on our branded and specialty pharmaceutical business for diversification and expansion of our product portfolio and pipeline, while enhancing our position as the worldwide leader in generics. Given this quarter, we saw 30% year-over-year growth in our U.S. respiratory business. The addition of Theramex to women's health helped to offset the loss of patent protection on Seasonique in the U.S. in this quarter. We expect to see continued growth in this area over the coming years.</p>
          <p>We further expanded our specialty branded business on October 14 when we closed on the acquisition of Cephalon. Our newly expanded portfolio in CNS, oncology, respiratory and women's health, together with our robust pipeline of more than 30 late stage products, position us as a leader in specialty pharma. We are very excited about opportunities that lay ahead.</p>
          <p>As a result of the combination of our branded businesses under the leadership of Kevin Buchi, who will be supported by Dr. Lesley Russell, Head Of Global Branded Research and Development, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:06), Head Of Global Branded Marketing. In fact, Kevin and Lesley are here in Israel this week meeting with their staff as we speak.</p>
          <p>Since the announcement of this acquisition in May, the work that was done by the integration teams and the bond that they formed were unlike anything I have seen before. This positions us to have our most successful integration to date.</p>
          <p>2011 has been a challenging year for Teva, somewhat overshadowing the excellent progress we have made on our strategic initiatives. We have diversified our generics businesses by acquiring Taiyo and Teva-Kowa in Japan, the second largest market in the world, thereby laying the building blocks for our planned future growth in that country. These moves solidify our position as the true leader in the top generic market in the world. We are number one in North America, both United States and Canada; number one in Europe and number three and rising in Japan.</p>
          <p>As I discussed earlier, the acquisition of Cephalon further positions Teva as a world-class specialty pharmaceutical business, and our alliance with P&amp;G further expands our footprint in another dimension of pharmaceutical care. OTC pharmaceuticals are an important part of the healthcare system, not only in the U.S., but even more so throughout the world. Thank you for your attention and now, let's turn the call over to Eyal, for a more detailed financial update. Eyal?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day, everyone. I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today. The results for the quarter were dominated by strong performance in our European and International businesses, as well as our major branded businesses, which managed to offset another challenging quarter for the Europe generic business. This demonstrates the strength of Teva's balanced business model.</p>
          <p>Before I will delve into the numbers, I would like to touch on two topics. First, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation, we have excluded the following items this quarter: amortization of purchased intangible assets amounting to $161 million, of which $151 million is included in cost of goods sold, and the remaining $10 million in selling and marketing expenses. I'd like to remind you that we started recording amortization of Ratiopharm intangible in Q1 of this year; restructuring and acquisition expenses and impairment of assets of $52 million related primarily to the acquisition of Ratiopharm and Taiyo; costs related to regulatory action taking in facilities of $35 million, which relates primarily to quality issues in Irvine in our animal health business; an inventory step-up of $19 million related to the acquisition of Taiyo; purchase of research and development in process of $15 million; income of $1 million in connection with the provision for legal settlement and reserve and the related tax effects of $86 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP results for the third quarter of 2010 are not identical to those in the current quarter. Please review our press release and related table for reconciliation to our GAAP numbers and more complete information.</p>
          <p>As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we, the management team and our board, look at our financial results. And second, foreign currencies continue to have an impact on our results this quarter, influencing our P&amp;L as well as our balance sheet. In the third quarter, foreign currency differences had a positive impact of approximately $148 million on sales and $15 million in non-GAAP operating income as compared to Q3 2010.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, foreign currencies had a negative impact on our equity. The strength of the U.S. dollar on September 30 compared to June 30, primarily relative to the euro and other European currencies, will boost our equity by approximately $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at our consolidated results for Q3, sales totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of 2% compared to Q3 last year and an increase of 3% compared to Q2 this year. Sales in North America declined 20% from Q3 2010 <mark type="ph" /> with generic unit, (16:11) which had another particularly soft quarter because several products that were major contributors to sales in a comparable quarter of 2010, most notably Venlafaxine, had little or no sales this quarter and at the same time, there were no significant launches in the quarter to offset this.</p>
          <p>We continue to expect the fourth quarter will be stronger than each of the first three quarters in 2010, following the launch of Olanzapine last week. Sales in Europe grew 34% in U.S. dollars and 24% in local currency due mainly to the consolidation of Ratiopharm results, but it is important to note that we again show organic growth in generic sales in Europe beyond the consolidation of Ratiopharm, calculated <mark type="ph" /> against (17:06) Ratiopharm and Theramex who are a part of Teva in Q3 2010. Generic sales in Europe grew 7% organically compared to Q3 2010, and Germany continued to perform well with generic sales growing 8% organically.</p>
          <p>Sales in our emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, and Asia, grew 56% in U.S. dollars and 49% in local currencies due to strong organic growth and the first-time inclusion of sales of Taiyo. In addition, we continue to see double-digit organic growth in Latin America and Russia.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP gross profit margin, which exclude amortization of purchased intangible assets, costs related to regulatory action, taking a facility and inventory step-up, was 56.4% in the reported quarter compared to 62.5% in the quarter last year, resulting primarily from the significantly smaller contribution of high margin generic products in the U.S. Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin were $1.3 billion and 30.3%, down from $1.4 billion and 33.9% in Q3 last year. The decline in operating margin resulted from the decline in high-margin generic products in the U.S. and was offset by significantly lower G&amp;A expenses in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion, down 6% compared to $1.2 billion in Q3 2010. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share were $1.25 compared to $1.30 in Q3 last year. The weighted average share count used for calculating fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was 890 million shares.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss operating expenses. Net R&amp;D expenses totaled $227 million, or 5.2% of sales, slightly lower than the $239 million in Q3 last year. The decline in net R&amp;D expenses is attributable mostly to lower legal expenses in connection with our generic R&amp;D and timing of projects, and does not reflect a cut in R&amp;D investment. Gross R&amp;D in Q3, which includes participation of third parties, totaled approximately $248 million or 5.7% of sales. Selling and marketing expenses, excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets, totaled $796 million this quarter or 18.3% of sales compared to &#x2013; was 17.5% of sales in Q3 2010. Higher selling and marketing expenses resulted from the consolidation on Ratiopharm and Taiyo.</p>
          <p>Further G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $112 million, or 2.6% of sales, compared to 5.5% of sales in Q3 last year. The significant decline in G&amp;A expenses this quarter resulted primarily from a gain reported in connection with the acquisition of Teva-Kowa and of an additional interest acquisition in CureTech, totaling together $135 million. In Q4, we expect G&amp;A expenses to return to regular levels of approximately 5% of sales.</p>
          <p>We recorded $67 million in non-GAAP financial expenses in Q3 2011 compared with $48 million in the comparable quarter of 2010. Higher financial expenses resulted primarily from higher interest expenses due to the debt incurred to finance the Taiyo acquisition and expenses incurred in connection with hedging activity.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax expense for the third quarter was $119 million of pre-tax GAAP income of $1.249 billion. Our current estimate of the non-GAAP annual tax rate for 2011 is 10% compared to 13% for 2010. The lower non-GAAP tax rate for 2011 resulted from a particular mix of products that are manufactured in geographies where Teva benefits from tax incentive. The estimated GAAP tax rate for 2011 is 4%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look at our cash flow. Cash flow in this quarter was not consistent with our typical run rate and resulted from the combination of events, which we do not expect to repeat. Cash generated from operation this quarter total $482 million compared to $1.2 billion in Q3 2010 due to lower collection, inventory build-up and actual payment of legal settlement and restructuring expenses reserved in Q2. Our free cash flow, excluding net of capital expenditure of $276 million, and dividend payment of $204 million amounted to only $2 million. Cash flow in Q3 was weak relative to a record high Q2 of $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, and it is expected to revert to strong typical levels in Q4.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we bought back 6.1 million shares at an average price of $42.30 per share for a total of $254 million. Since we started this buyback program in December, 2010 we have repurchased 17.9 million shares for a total of $848 million, reflecting an average price of $47.47 per share.</p>
          <p>On September 30, cash and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion, essentially flat compared to June 30. Our total outstanding loan bonds and convertible debenture stood at $8.2 billion, up approximately $1.8 billion from $6.4 billion as of the end of June as a result of the additional debt incurred, primarily in connection with Taiyo. During the close of the Cephalon acquisition, our debt stood at $14.7 billion. Our financial leverage as of September 30, 2011 was 26% compared to 21% at the end of June. The increase resulted from additional debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of Taiyo, as well as the negative impacts foreign exchange had on our equity.</p>
          <p>DSO, or days sales outstanding, declined to 36 days this quarter compared to 41 days in the previous quarter and 42 days in Q3 2011. We calculate DSO after netting out from receivables our sales reserved and allowances. Inventory days stood at 198 days, up from 178 days in Q3 2010. The increase in inventory days compared to last year, resulted from foreign exchange differences, as well as preparing for volume growth in the &#x2013; generics expected in Q4.</p>
          <p>Gross capital expenditures was $276 million this quarter compared to $224 million in Q2 2011. The increase in CapEx resulted from one-time expense in connection with a site purchase in the United States.</p>
          <p>Dividend. On Monday, Teva's board approved a quarterly net dividend amounting to approximately $194 million. On a per share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekel, is NIS 0.80 per share. Based on yesterday's rate of exchange of the shekel to the U.S. dollar, this translates into approximately $0.219 per share.</p>
          <p>Before I return the call to Shlomo to discuss guidance for Q4, I would like to say something about disclosure of information. Following the acquisition of Cephalon, we intend to modify our presentation of information and the level of detail to be provided. We will provide more product-level sales data for our branded business, as well as additional sales information by market. Shlomo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eyal. The closing of Cephalon transaction provides us with an opportunity to update our guidance for the year to reflect its conclusion. The company now projects 2011 full-year revenues to be approximately $18.3 billion to $18.6 billion compared to the previous range of $18.5 billion to $19 billion. The company also expects non-GAAP earnings on fully diluted per-share basis to be in the range of $4.92 to $5.02 compared to the previous estimated range of $4.90 to $5.20. The new full-year estimates now include a non-GAAP EPS contribution of approximately $0.15 from the consolidation of the Cephalon acquisition.</p>
          <p>The full-year 2011 range implies fourth quarter performance of revenues of $5.7 billion to $6 billion and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.53 to $1.63. The range for the fourth quarter primarily reflects the uncertainty about the timing of the regulatory approval and all the dynamics of commercial conditions of launching the undisclosed generic product in the U.S. that I referenced at the beginning of my remarks.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2012, as we mentioned previously, we plan to provide updated guidance prior to the end of this year once we have had more time to integrate Cephalon and review our combined <mark type="ph" /> work plan (28:00). I would be happy to open the call for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question this morning is coming from the line of Randall Stanicky of Canaccord Wealth Management. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, guys, very much for the question and the color. Maybe Eyal and/or Bill, can you just help us just to be clear on the fourth quarter guidance, did you rank-order the two or three key drivers sequentially that we should be focusing on? And then maybe just help us maybe reiterate with respect to the commercially-sensitive product, exactly what is in and what is not in fourth quarter. And then have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Randall. I'll start with some numbers and Bill will follow up with the business aspects, but as you saw, this quarter is expected to be a different ballgame from Q3. We see basically growth in all parts of our business with &#x2013; of course, the U.S. generic business with the Olanzapine launch, which are already started and some other improvements built in, shed some light on that. Europe, we believe will continue to grow with a stronger Q4, same for our International market.</p>
          <p>We're beginning to take back Copaxone in Germany this quarter and a number of other smaller country. Respiratory business should have a stronger fourth quarter, so basically almost in every point in our business, you see addition and, of course, the addition of Cephalon that as Shlomo mentioned, we expect to contribute $0.15 of sales. And then there's a core product that we cannot disclose with an upside that is an upside for the quarter, and Bill can provide more details on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question, Randall. Just a couple of points, the fourth quarter really is an opportunity, it's the time when the U.S. generic division will return to an accelerating position, it begins to accelerate. It's led, of course, by the launch of Olanzapine, which should contribute about $300 million, which was shipped last week. We will also get a few other new products that should launch. I think the main one that you would think of would be Combivir.</p>
          <p>And then, with the lifting now of the &#x2013; the Jerusalem warning letter being behind us, it's really putting us in a position now or the right position for us to seek share and get share and volume and gain. So if you want to think about the business in the fourth quarter, you think about this base business that's about $850 million, with Olanzapine it should be approximately $300 million.</p>
          <p>New products that &#x2013; other new products that will come in the quarter, about $100 million, and then we should get potentially an impact from the price increases that begin to roll through, as well as some share gain. And all of this, of course, what I just laid out doesn't include this important undisclosed product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which would be upside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is &#x2013; upside to the numbers I just gave you, I think, it needs to be very clear with respect to the range, that the low end of that range reflects not having that product. The high end of that range reflects having some level of that product.</p>

          <p>Got you, that's helpful. And, then, let me just follow up. As we've looked the last couple of quarters now, the U.S. generic business has come down to probably where it's at its low water mark from here. We've seen gross margins come down with that, 100 basis points to 150 basis points. So, Eyal, directionally can you help us think about as that U.S. generics business picks up, should we think about the gross margin moving higher, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you remember at Q2 last year, we generated a record high gross margin of over 62%. I don't see us returning to that level. I'm putting Cephalon aside, because Cephalon will have a positive impact on our gross margin. It comes with a branded gross margin and, of course, that will elevate the margin. But on the Teva standalone business, as you know today, our gross margin for the fourth quarter should be anywhere between 59% to 60%. As a result of the changes in the mix of product and the rebound in the U.S. generic business, Olanzapine, of course, as a Paragraph IV exclusivity product and a few other improvements, that's where I believe we'll see it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Firstly, for Bill, understanding that comps were tough in the U.S. generic business, is that business overall performing like you thought it would? Or are there some changing dynamics underneath that that we should understand? Again, separate from sort of the chunkiness of big launches. And my follow-up is for Shlomo.</p>
          <p>Can you confirm and put some rumors to rest that there are any changes in &#x2013; to your management and the board being considered? And maybe separate from that, would you say there's more discussion these days at the board level about the prioritization of a buyback versus dividend versus business development? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gregg, this is Bill Marth. I'll start out. I think your reference to the U.S. generic business, it is basically down to &#x2013; it is down to the base business. If you think about what Shlomo said in his talk about the &#x2013; about $560 million of exclusive products that were missing to the quarter, that's an extreme amount of money. What I think is also different is in 2010 alone, we had one point above &#x2013; $1.4 billion in exclusive products in that plan. In the 2011 plan, we knew it would be a sort of a dry year, but it's been a very dry year and we've only &#x2013; look at this point in time, and at this point in time expect about $350 million of exclusive products. So that's a real extreme change.</p>
          <p>But we are anticipating a return to some of our previous trends as we begin to pick up share and do all those things that I mentioned earlier to Randall's question. And, again, the launches in 2011, we had &#x2013; we've only had 13 in 2011 in total and just five in Q3. So we've been right on the launches, right on the exclusives and we've had a bit of an impact because of the warning letter in Jerusalem, and now we see we're putting that behind us.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Gregg, to your question about the buyback, let me say that first of all, at these levels that Teva is a compelling value. And Teva is today is a different company. With the sale approaching almost $20 billion, we are evaluating what is the best way to create value for our shareholder, and especially on the question of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:13), or i.e. how much of cash we would like to return back to our shareholders. And definitely, this is on our &#x2013; we are considering and we are discussing it, but at that point of time, I prefer to stop here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shlomo, maybe I can add some bearing on returning cash to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we returned almost $2.5 billion to shareholders by way of dividend payment, share buyback, redemption of convertibles and we will continue to evaluate the right way to allocate our capital without, of course, ignoring the need to maintain strong balance sheet and accelerate debt service. So, all this is &#x2013; are definitely things that we are taking into consideration.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks. Just wondering in Europe, you seem to be gaining share and performing a little bit better versus your peer group, so wonder if maybe Gerard would discuss some of the trends he's seeing there and some of the costs as we move forward into 2012. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry, Ken. There's a bottle falling over here &#x2013; happy to do so. Listen, I think we had a great quarter, organic growth and, as you know, as Shlomo has alluded to, we had a &#x2013; on a comparative base, we grew 9% in our major five European markets or grow 14% if you take it organically, which I think is really great. And with the exception of Poland, perhaps Portugal, Hungary and France, that was flat, every market was doing very, very well in Europe. And as you also know, each quarter has its own dynamics. The launch is standard, <mark type="ph" /> spread (38:21) dynamics, or M&amp;A activities, and that's why every quarter is slightly different.</p>
          <p>And I think, for us in Europe, the quarterly fluctuation that we see in our 27 different European countries are there, but we are so nicely spread that as a net-net result, our European business has been positive quarter-after-quarter. So it could be raining in one particular country in one quarter, but there is also range of other countries where in that same quarter, we have a lot of sunshine.</p>
          <p>You may remember that in Q1, we grew in every key European market except for Germany, where we declined, and in this quarter our major five, including Germany, grew sales organically with an average of 14%. So it just shows you that I think our business model is making us more resilient and more resistant towards these different models and different dynamics we see in the European market.</p>
          <p>I think we can stick to what we said at the beginning of the year, we expect every quarter a slightly better quarter than the quarter before and I think we continue to see that, if you compare quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. And for next year, I believe that with all the price dynamics we're seeing in Europe, there will be a little bit more pressure, but growth might be a little bit more under pressure, but we're still expecting mid-to-high single-digit growth numbers to be possible for the European business.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got a couple of questions. Bill, for you, I'm wondering if you could kind of take a step back and help us to think about what you see as the organic growth rate of the North American generics business going forward. Recognizing that this year was a particularly challenging year, you've got obviously some opportunities in 2012, but if you were to sort of take a step back and look at the long-term organic growth, can this business recover to the levels of growth to which investors have become accustomed? Or should we all sort of recalibrate our expectations on that?</p>
          <p>And I also have a question for Shlomo. You are out with pretty aggressive long-term 2015 revenue and net income guidance, and just wondering just as it relates to the earlier capital allocation question, what is more important to you? Is it more important to you to hit those targets, which now seem even less achievable given the revenue miss this quarter, or returning cash to shareholders? And just apologies here, last question relates to the gain that you took this quarter on the acquisitions of Teva-Kowa and CureTech, just wondering what the revenue impact was -- revenue and earnings impact was from those acquisitions this quarter. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take that. It's Eyal. I'll take the revenue question on Teva-Kowa, <mark type="ph" /> the table addition (41:24) of the revenue that Teva-Kowa in this quarter is marginal or hardly <mark type="ph" /> an issue (41:31) because we just closed the deal very close to the end of the quarter. But going forward, it will add something like $25 million for to Q4 in the run rate since we recognize part of the revenues, we were 50-50 with such a unique Japanese structure and we recognized something like two-third of the &#x2013; or 75% of the revenues to begin with, in our revenue recognition. So, the addition is not going to be big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jami, this is Bill Marth. You asked, I think, a really great question about the long-term view of generics in the U.S. And the way to think about Teva's generic business is it's about a $5 billion business that will move up and down on an annual basis depending on exclusivities. It's a great business, it still remains the largest generic business in the world and will so for quite some time, and so, we're very excited about it. But there's changes happening in the U.S. business.</p>
          <p>If you think about &#x2013; if you think about our ability to grow, you've got about a $300 billion branded business in the U.S., they attribute about $50 billion of it on IMS to generics, and then there's about $40 billion reflected in IMS on &#x2013; if you think about biologics, which we're also chasing, but we're chasing in a different way. It leaves you about a core business of about $210 billion of branded value for us to go after, and we're excited. I mean, we're filed against $117 billion of that <mark type="audio gap" /> (43:25). The fact is Paragraph IV has changed. The ability with more NCEs, the ability to get first to files where you're exclusive or semi-exclusive is much less.</p>
          <p>So we see value coming from the more complex products. Products like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:34) and other products that are &#x2013; Lansoprazole ODT that we marketed for a while. Products like that, that have complexity and we see more value coming from that. We see a bit more commoditization happening with &#x2013; and more volume coming with strength in managed care, but a great business. A little tougher to get some of that sustainable value, but we believe we have the edge to be able to do that. But, again, when you think about the business, think about that $5 billion base business kind of moving up and down, largely on those exclusivities and those technically challenging products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jami, it's Shlomo speaking, again I would like to thank you for the question and giving us the opportunity to pour some light on our long-term thinking. So let me first remind you that in 2007, we came with the long-term strategy or plan, which was called that time to 2020, which actually said by 2012 we are going to be a $20 billion company and a 20% net profit.</p>
          <p>And I remember at that time, not many people believed that we can do that. In 2010, and I don't have to be long here because you see the numbers and you see where we are going to be next year even without giving you the guidance for next year now. My point is that long-term plans are actually giving you a kind of roadmap and a kind of a goal that you would like to achieve and to make sure that the company, especially a big company like Teva, everybody understands where are we heading. But we are doing it in a smart way, and we are not going to do anything just because that we put the number there. We believe that this is achievable target and a reasonable target, and I'd be more than happy in a separate occasion to share with you the full business environment and the full reasons why we believe there is a huge opportunity out there.</p>
          <p>At the center of that is about &#x2013; it's actually about one rule, which is diversify. We need to diversify Teva's business in the coming year. You just talked to Bill about the U.S. generics. Part of the long-term strategy is to take the generic business to the global part of the world where we have more opportunities for growth and for generating the growth. Same goes for our specialty pharma business. We have one Copaxone, we have to diversify our specialty business and this is what is the rationale on the Cephalon acquisition.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about your more specific questions on returning cash to the shareholders, in the coming year from now on, we're expecting to generate about $15 billion in cash. So, first of all, we have the source, but I do also believe &#x2013; but also do believe that we have already the assets, so as far as I see it now, we don't need a mega or a big additional acquisition.</p>
          <p>And as a matter of fact, we would like to talk with especially in the coming year, in integrating and digesting the 2011 acquisition, the Cephalon, the Taiyo and of course, to drive more value for the partnership with P&amp;G and some other activities that we are focusing on right now. But really, the OTC idea or the OTC joint venture, which I believe is a unique opportunity for Teva's future, was not on the radar screen when we announced the 2015.</p>
          <p>Just to show that we are living in dynamic, changing world, sometimes we're going to come with additional creative &#x2013; or we initiate new business ideas, sometimes we are going to get bad news as we had on the laquinimod. But this is the world we live in, and we believe we have enough chiefs and enough business segments that we can, at the end of the day, create what we believe is a balanced, growing business model.</p>
          <p>More specific on the cash, as I said before, let me repeat, we understand that as a $20 billion company, we have to think different, we are a different company and part of this is, of course, how much of cash we would like to return to our shareholder, management and board are considering and discussing it. At that point of time I don't want to elaborate more on that, but it definitely is part of our thinking and part of our overall question of what is the total <mark type="ph" /> weight (48:31), or the total shareholders' return and what is the right way to do it?</p>
          <p>So to sum up, I don't see a big acquisition on my radar screen unless we talk about some complementary few hundred million dollars in growing a part of the world. Cash is under consideration, cash return is under consideration and we still strongly believe that we can make this number and time will tell.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions, I just had a few. First question I had is on the undisclosed product opportunity. Is this something that has been discussed as one of your general opportunities before in the past? Or is it something we've never heard of before? And then second question is just on the Cephalon pipeline, I don't know if it's too early, but could you give us any sense of what are some of the key products that you're excited about in the pipeline?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, just on BG-12, now that all the data is out there, do you still feel confident about your previous comments about Copaxone and its ability to maintain market share? And why do you feel confident about that? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the first one was on the undisclosed product opportunity. I was just curious if it's something that's been mentioned before as one of your general product opportunities, or is it something that's going to be completely new if it is announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Bill will take the three parts of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Louise. Let me start with the last part, BG-12. I think the way &#x2013; when I think about this, absent a cure, the best thing you can do is to provide patients with options in the MS space. We believe that oral therapies are important for patients, and from the data we see thus far, the MS market is expanding, so we're happy with that. And orals appear to be helping them. And we're bringing patients either into the market or they're bringing them back to the market. But either way, they come to the market, we're excited that we're growing Copaxone and we're being able to share in the patients that come into that market.</p>
          <p>With respect to BG-12's results, I think it's premature and it's a bit difficult from my vantage point to evaluate the results of DEFINE or CONFIRM, but again, we think that orals do have a place in therapy. Your other question was with respect to the undisclosed product. I would just reference you to our last call where we did talk about commercially sensitive opportunities, and I think that we will probably not want to say any more than that. And then there was a third question that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cephalon pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cephalon pipeline. The Cephalon pipeline, what I would tell you right now is we're right in the middle of that evaluation right now. Kevin and his team is doing extensive work where when we actually put the two pipelines together. I think there are a lot of exciting things in that pipeline from <mark type="ph" /> roads (51:46) that are more challenging, such as Revascor that will have potential to really be transformational in the market place, to products like Hydrocodone that we think are maybe a little bit easier to get into the market on, although they're very important products to get in to market.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot there, there's a lot for us to go through. I think at this time, we would reserve discussion of that pipeline and potentially, we'll be able to talk to you sometime in 2012 about how we see the whole pipeline for Teva.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And I guess the first question for perhaps you, Bill. With respect to Copaxone and growth trends in the U.S., certainly no secret that historically pricing leverage has been one of the key drivers of growth of that franchise. And it's been quite a while since you guys have taken a price increase on that product, and I'm just sort of curious what you think may have changed about that market, despite the obvious transition newer therapies that may in fact curtail your ability to grow the product, the price increases alone, going forward.</p>
          <p>And then, as a follow-up question for you, Bill, and all the members of the team, just stepping back and taking a look at Teva and specifically the U.S. generic business, one can't help but sort of opine that if anything has changed over the last couple of years, certainly I think it's fair to say that the company's risk aversion with respect to Paragraph IV product launches seems to have increased and it seems to coincide around the Protonix launch. So, maybe going forward, we shouldn't be thinking about probability of success on a lot of these Q4 launches as being so high relative to historical norms, and I know each one has to be judged on its own merits, but maybe you guys can just sort of comment on that general observation. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elliott, this is Bill Marth. So let me start out with that last part first. With the U.S. generic market, you're right, I mean it is transforming and there are &#x2013; we took out a lot of Paragraph IV, but you find a lot of NCEs. So the desire for me to necessarily bring that litigation to the finish line only to share that exclusivity with a half a dozen other generic companies is &#x2013; there's certainly from economic standpoint, there isn't a great value for me to do that. But I think you're making a connection that just because of the Protonix decision, which isn't a final decision at this point in time, that for some reason we wouldn't launch at-risk.</p>
          <p>And I would just point you to a couple of products that we actually launched after Protonix with respect into where we are for at-risk launches. I think they're still a part of our business. What you find is different is we're not getting the cases that get us to that point that put us in a position for an at-risk launch.</p>
          <p>So if the situation is right &#x2013; and every drug is different and every litigation is different; if the situation is right and the litigation is right, we think we're on the right side of the law. Certainly, we would still with reasonable review within Teva because we are not reckless, we're certainly &#x2013; we are cautious, but we are careful and we are calculated. If the opportunity presents itself, we will still do it.</p>
          <p>With respect to Copaxone, the point I would make there is the year-to-date prescriptions are up 3.5% and we're doing very well then with 2.5% over the same point in 2010. They're doing very well, and that market is growing and we're enjoying that. And we're the leading share, of course, at 40.5%. So the share is growing and we did take a price increase earlier in the year. Now, I don't want to signal, obviously, on this call or any call when our next price increase will be, but we're always reflective of what's going on in the market.</p>
          <p>So if the price increases in the market begin to slow down, we obviously will consider that. What I don't want to do is, like I've said many times before, we are the leading therapy in this particular area in multiple sclerosis and I believe our pricing should be reflective of our place as the standard of care. So when I see the opportunity for a price increase and I see that it's appropriate for the business and for our shareholders, we would certainly recommend that.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; one other point is that the franchise continues to expand and we are still looking at GALA and lots of <mark type="ph" /> ELCI (57:06) opportunities. So we look for the Copaxone franchise to last a long time.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, so I've got a few, but the first one is your original guidance for 2011 did not include Cephalon and now you seem to have added $0.15 of Cephalon, yet you are guiding to the very low end of your original range. And if I back out Cephalon, I get the top end, with your mystery product would be $0.47. Can you just explain to us how &#x2013; I guess, what was not here, maybe, as you enter the year that made you bring down guidance this quarter so drastically? And then I have a follow-up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Shibani. It's Bill Marth. How are you? I just wanted to &#x2013; with respect to your question, the guidance change is reflective of the fact that certain things didn't happen within the business and caused us to make this change. This particular product that we're talking about, which was one-level commercially sensitive and today it's been un-yet launched in certain products, actually was much &#x2013; contemplated much earlier in the year. In fact, we thought we had an opportunity where we could have launched this product as early as early Q3.</p>
          <p>And that would have made a substantial change to this year's plan. That plus some of these other launches, of course, within the generic business we didn't get and a bit of the slowdown because of the warning letter in Jerusalem. All of those types of things led to the situation that we have today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second, when you first announced the Cephalon acquisition and we were all trying to work out the accretion for next year, I think the best kind of estimate we were getting is $0.25. Would it be different now, given you've done $0.15 for the quarter, would be it fair to extrapolate that quarter and make it higher for 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shibani, it's Eyal. When we announced the acquisition of Cephalon, we said that in Q4 we see $0.10 to $0.15 contribution, and we also said that next year we see $0.20 to $0.25, and 2012 in Cephalon is completely different from Q4 of 2011, and this is the major reason for the differences. So you can't take the run rate of Q4 and apply to 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then can just &#x2013; squeeze one in. When you say Irvine is behind you, does that mean that the issues are resolved? Or is it product-by-product and is it going on track as you planned?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Shibani. It's Bill Marth again. Irvine is making great progress and it's ramping up its operation. By the end of 2011, all 18 products on our line six will be manufactured and that represents about 44% of our oncology products. Our second line does also come up by the end of the year, and the other final two lines come up by March of 2012. We anticipate full operation by April to May of 2012, but remember we're back at the full run rate; we'll be back at full run rate of about $100 million on an annual basis at the end of the year. And again, full operation should be in May of 2012. And of course, this relates to only to the injectables that are out of Irvine because that's all fluid bearing injectables.</p>
          <p>And I think the last point is that we continue to work diligently with the FDA drug shortage division to alleviate issues wherever we can be helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First for Bill, just can you clarify a little bit about this $100 million? We can see a nice ramp-up in the IMS where you say about $100 million giving you $120 million at the end of this year or next year, and if it's not at the end of next year by May when you're fully ramped up, what type of run rate are you thinking the injectable business can generate?</p>
          <p>And second, I don't know if Lesley is on the phone, but can you give us a little bit of a run-down on the branded Phase III programs, where they stand today and where you expect the key programs to come to market over the next year and a half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronny, this is Bill Marth. With &#x2013; let's do your second question first. Lesley isn't here, and so we're not in a situation today where we're ready to talk about the pipeline because we're &#x2013; really, we talked earlier about some of the things that we think are exciting, but we're not really here to talk about the individual products. That review, actually Kevin and Lesley and the whole team are going through that right now. And hopefully, we can get sometime after the first of 2012, we can get back and do more of an innovative pipeline review. So, we'll see what we can do there.</p>
          <p>On the Irvine question, that's $100 million run rate starting at the end of 2012. There's a lot of products to get out there, there was 51 products manufactured at that site, about 10 of those products have been discontinued. That leaves us 41 to run on four lines and we don't really get up to full steam until May.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. A number of my questions have been asked already, but regarding your expectation for a strong U.S. fourth quarter, Bill, I was just hoping that you could sort of frame what type of year-over-year growth you expect, whether that's if strong means double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, excluding that product that may or may not launch in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And then, Eyal, I was just hoping you could frame for us your one-time item accounting policy for non-GAAP EPS. At least, I wasn't aware that the one-time gain was going to subtract from G&amp;A in the quarter, so if you could just comment on your accounting policy and, also, whether your fourth quarter EPS guidance for non-GAAP EPS includes any one-time items that we should be aware of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, maybe I should start from the last question &#x2013; it's Eyal &#x2013; and start from the end of your questions. We currently don't have anything like that in our guidance, but we think these transactions are come-and-go, and they might &#x2013; we might have something like this, not of the size that we've seen this quarter. Basically, yeah, you're right. This is indeed included in our G&amp;A line as an accounting treatment, which reflects the value created as a result of this transaction. It's pretty regular accounting practice to include it in G&amp;A. In fact, in the past, we included capital gain as reduction to our G&amp;A, and but given the size, we gave particular note in our press release for complete disclosure of that.</p>
          <p>Given our business model, we will see more of these in the future. The Teva portfolio of partnership and investment in company &#x2013; in one-molecule companies and the Cephalon portfolio, we'll have more of those in the future, so this is not one-time and probably not the last time.</p>

          <p>Yeah, David, just to answer your question, frankly, I don't remember the 2010 generic numbers off the top of my head. But let me just take you through the way we think about it one more time, which is you think about our base business, which is about $850 million, I would think about an Olanzapine launch that's in the range of $300 million, additional new product-launch opportunities about $100 million and then there's some contribution from price increase. And all of this, of course, does not &#x2013; or share gain by the way, and all of this does not include what we talked about as this important undisclosed product.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much. First question is for Shlomo and thanks for some of the comments on the long-term guidance earlier. Just following up on that, you have a $31 billion top-line target for 2015 that obviously includes future business development. Can you just comment how close you would be to that 2015 target, based on the assets you have in-house today?</p>
          <p>I guess, are we fairly close to that number if we were just to kind of use that today and go forward up to 2015? And following up on that, is there any thought on providing longer-term guidance that does not include future business development? Just to help investors better understand your expectation on the core business and the assets you have in-house today and leaving future business development and share repo, et cetera more as an upside driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the first one. As I said before, I think that right now we have the basic, let's call it, assets to make our future numbers. If you skip the what I called complementary acquisitions of market share in attractive growing part of the world, or if you wish some molecules to enhance or strengthen our specialty pharma, which is the two type of kind of complementary kind of acquisition when I talk about &#x2013; when I'm saying complementary, I'm talking about few hundred million dollars at most. So, just to make sure that we are on the same measurement or scale.</p>
          <p>Like any other things, acquisitions and things are very opportunistic <mark type="ph" /> tied to time (1:08:22).  So, if in the future, we'll see some additions very attractive from the business, from the strategy point of view, make a lot of sense on the economics, which are the two major criteria for Teva acquisitions, then of course, we will follow this rationale. But as we see it now, we are not expecting it to &#x2013; we are not expecting more of that in the coming year. That means we can get there by the current asset that we already acquired. That should add to that something I mentioned before that was not in our plan, which is the OTC very attractive, our new business segment for Teva, which I believe will take Teva to a different kind of business with different numbers and level.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, I think that we are equipped for that kind of exception as I mentioned, regarding the potential future acquisitions. And what was the second part of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess you kind of answered that. But it was, is there any thought of providing maybe a longer-term guidance number that is not inclusive of future business development, share repo, et cetera? And leaving those more as upside drivers to numbers versus our current target today that kind of includes everything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that right now we are going to be more long-term. I think that this is probably, as far as I know, the only company in our industry that gives this kind of a long-term projection or guidance, if you wish. It's not a guidance, it's actually, as I said before, it's growth and roadmaps, how to go there, how to get there. But we try our best to share with our investors where are we heading and what is the rationale beyond our activities and our operations.</p>
          <p>So, we will come to conclusion, but that deserves this kind of more long-term perspective, of course, we will definitely we share with you. I believe that the more you understand our business and where are we heading, the better for our shareholders, as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. Thanks very much. And then just a quick question for Bill, can you just give us a little bit more flavor on what the rate-limiting factor is on this undisclosed product for 2011? Is it something you're dealing with a competitor blocking an approval? Is this a legal issue at FDA? Is it some complexity with the product that's hanging up approval? I guess just give us any more color on that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Buck of Buckingham Research Group. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted first to clarify just some of the expectations for fourth quarter that you're implying; for Bill, if I look at your different drivers, it looks like you're targeting without the mystery product or the undisclosed product, about $1.25 billion, so kind of a flattish U.S. generics business, and then maybe the new product adds to that.</p>
          <p>For Gerard, can you talk about what type of the pricing and volume growth you're expecting in the European business in the fourth quarter? And then, if we look at just the Cephalon acquisition, can you just confirm that the Revascor, Mesoblast <mark type="ph" /> and Cyncle (1:11:41) molecules are still in the pipeline? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I'll try to take a couple parts of that. First of all, with Cephalon, I think you said Mesoblast and you broke up there. I'm not sure what else -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the Mesoblast, Revascor product opportunity, is that still part &#x2013; you said you were excited about it, but is it &#x2013; I assume it's still part of the pipeline and actively being developed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is still part of the pipeline at this time. The comment about the U.S. generic piece, I think I've been about as specific on what I expect as I could be for the fourth quarter, which is I think a great improvement. We're moving on in the right direction and all the &#x2013; what I've talked about, the dates, the Olanzapine, new products, price increase, all of that puts us in a great position for Q4 and a nice acceleration and that will contribute significantly to our guidance. I guess the last question there would be for Gerard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, just the European expectations in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for the question. I think it's difficult to be precise on the quarter, but I'll give you the dynamics there. As you know, it's &#x2013; as I described before, some markets go up, some go down in terms of we've got launches, we've got products leaving the market. So that's why it's a bit difficult to give you the overall, but let me tell you the following on the numbers that we're expecting.</p>
          <p>Price erosion in Europe, on average, ranges between minus three and minus eight, through the year, through the month and that depends a bit on what government takes what action at what time. So that's roughly what you see happening. On average, we're sitting somewhere at around 5%, yeah, but you have &#x2013; somewhere just above 5%, but rounded is five, and the volume growth was 7% on existing products and 3% on launches. There are no dynamics in scope today that make me think that these numbers are going to be much different in the coming quarter, or in the running quarter as we speak, so I think the overall market should be growing somewhere between &#x2013; net-net, between 3% and 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So you're looking at this quarter, for the September quarter, you actually had some acquisition benefit, but you should still see some, call it low to mid  single-digit revenue growth, it sounds like, is what the expectation is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we continue like we did. If you normalize for the acquisition, so you would assume that it would've been part of our business for the full quarter, the Ratiopharm and the Theramex or what have you, then our numbers are described in the paper and in the press releases as organic growth, that's in Europe, 7% or 8%; 14% for the major markets. And we do not expect to see, at least for the overall European number, a different number for the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Bill Marth, I just want make sure you got what you needed. There was confusion on this side that it wasn't clear with respect to our guidance. Again, with U.S. generics heading in the right direction, we're very &#x2013; we are very sure we will be on our lower end of our guidance, if we are not to get our important undisclosed product. And what would cause us to be in the upper range of our guidance would be those &#x2013; certain conditions under which the launch of that important undisclosed product.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Few questions. First, Bill, can you elaborate on one of the comments you made earlier, which was is in the U.S. generics business, you said the Paragraph IV business is not as good going forward. I was a little confused by that. So that's number one. And number two, I'm curious in the emerging markets just over the past month or two, as things have really slowed and a lot of these markets our out-of-pocket to pay for drugs, if you've noticed the business slowing since the end of the third quarter, just October, really just the past month is what I'm asking about.</p>
          <p>And then the third question is for Eyal and there's two of them. One is I'm a little confused on the comments you made about Cephalon. Why would you have $0.10 to $0.15 of accretion in the fourth quarter, but only $0.20 to $0.25 for the full year of 2011? And then the second question has to do with this $135 million gain. I'm still not &#x2013; I don't quite understand what exactly happened and maybe you can point to a few times in the past where this has happened before and exactly what's going on here. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marc, Shlomo speaking. I'll take first the emerging markets and then Bill the Paragraph IV question and Eyal will close with the third part of your question. We are not seeing any problem in the emerging market, or, let's say, Teva's emerging market countries where we are operating.</p>
          <p>Regarding any payment or collection letters, the business of Q3, including the beginning of this quarter is as &#x2013; it used to be before, and I can tell you that, at least from our point of view, there's not any problem in that area &#x2013; that respect. Of course, in certain countries that you see right now, a part of it is because we are not operating there and part of it is because this is a different segment in the industry or in the other macro economic situation in a given country. But to make a long story short, we are not having any problem in that respect as we see it now. Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just make a couple of comments on Paragraph IV. I think what we really &#x2013; you want to think about on Paragraph IV is it is more challenging today than it has been in past. When you have large amounts of NCEs and you can have multiple first filers on it &#x2013; the desire for us as a company to want to necessarily press that case all the way to the finish line, oftentimes it's just &#x2013; it's not there.</p>
          <p>And so, we'll take a settlement or we'll exit the case. It's just one of those issues that Paragraph IV has been a great opportunity, but there's been fundamental changes, more NCEs, more difficult patents. In years past, we were able to enter oftentimes by filing on secondary patents, but now the secondary patents have gotten more difficult, we're challenging compound patents. And the compound patents themselves are very robust and so, to get a win there is much more difficult.</p>
          <p>So, that doesn't mean Paragraph IV goes away. It just means Paragraph IV begins to change, there's not as many opportunities, there's a lot of opportunities in more technically challenging products, there are absolutely a ton of products to pursue, as I'd mentioned earlier, about $210 billion in innovator value. And we're filed on about $117 million of that. And we still pursue Paragraph IVs where they make sense, and to our knowledge, we've got the largest portfolio of Paragraph IVs and first-to-files in the market, worth $55 billion.</p>
          <p>But, again, it's different than what it was just five years ago. And so, you seek value in different way and that's what we're doing. And I think of all the things we should capture was the beauty of what Shlomo put together, with respect to our strategy. Because we needed to diversify from the U.S. market because we don't like the U.S. market. We don't want to be in the U.S. market. No, it's a great business, a $5 billion business that will grow and go up and down in that range &#x2013; one year, it'll be six, maybe it'll be a little bit less, all depending on the technically challenging products and Paragraph IVs when we can get them.</p>
          <p>So, it's great, but to diversify away from the U.S. and into Western Europe and then into Japan and into Latin America becoming a global concern is that is excellent strategy. And I think that often what's not appreciated when you can think about Teva as being the number one generic player in North America, the number one player in Western Europe and soon, hopefully, we'll be the number one player in Japan, the largest markets in the world. And then having substantial positions in high-growth markets like Latin America and Russia. I think those things have been absolutely tremendous and that's been driven by Shlomo's strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Marc, it's Eyal. On the Cephalon, Q4 our $0.10 to $0.15 estimate of contribution to profit Cephalon in Q4 2011 is running full steam ahead. Next year, in April, we're losing Provigil. The cost synergies will take time &#x2013; takes time to build up. There are some sales synergies, negative sales synergies of business that we are losing. Of course, the financial expenses right now are &#x2013; bridge loan, but we're going to replace it long-term, which will cost more. All in all, that is how we calculated this about $0.20 to $0.25 contribution to profit next year. The following year, this number, of course, will double.</p>
          <p>On the $135 million in G&amp;A, let me try to explain what is the accounting treatment, if I understood your question. And basically, when a company gains control and the company that it owns a part of, which has a minority interest, the accounting treatment requires you to reflect the value of the company being acquired as a P&amp;L entry. This is the accounting practice. It's a new standard for a little over two years ago, and that's what every company in the market is doing. But it's not always provided &#x2013; providing all the disclosure. We chose to disclose it because it's a little large and notable, and this is why we had &#x2013; we executed, exercised an option that moved us from 20%, or 19%, to 75% ownership. And the value there was very, very conservatively calculated, that Teva-Kowa are moving from 50% to 100% ownership requires us to report a gain, and this is what we've done.</p>
          <p>These two deals were in our original plan for the year. We just didn't know when this was going to happen and it happened in Q3, and I hope that clarifies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Shlomo, could you talk a little bit more about the additional trial for laquinimod? I know you mentioned that earlier in the call that you talked with the FDA about that product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Bill to provide more on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think at this point in time, we just want to say that we're going to continue to study laquinimod, as we believe it is important for patients to have a therapy option that positively impacts disability with a high degree of safety. It's got a great profile, and so I think that that profile yet needs to be explored. We will do that. We believe that the FDA is as enthused about looking into this disability issue as we are, and so therefore, they're going to help us as we look forward on looking at a design.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just a follow-up for Eyal. Eyal, is there any sort of free cash flow guidance you can provide for the fourth quarter, given the variability that we've seen on free cash flow the last couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't provide cash flow for directional guidance, but basically, Q4 will be in line with Q1, Q2 cash flow. The quarter &#x2013; already are a month into the quarter, started very strong, so we're going to have to get back to those levels. About $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Eyal, one last question. You mentioned the debt, post the closing on the Cephalon deal around $14.7 billion. What's the average cost of debt for you right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, we're &#x2013; most of this is on a bridge loan at LIBOR plus 1% or so, but we'll go to the bond market and we'll pay whatever the market will charge us, but given the current rates, we hope to get a good deal on the bond market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a couple. First, you mentioned lower receivable collections. I just want to clarify, are you seeing any issues with customers? And particularly, as you grow in emerging markets, should we be more concerned about collections, or is this more of a timing issue in the third quarter?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just back to your 2015 goals, you previously mentioned several billion worth of revenue from additional acquisitions needed in order to get the $31 billion top line target in 2015. So, I guess the question here is if you're targeting more dividends and buybacks, how can you be able to make the kind of acquisitions to hit the long-term target and what does that mean for your debt levels longer-term? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the first one on the collection. The lower collection we had basically suffered from a very strong collection effort we had in the previous quarter and we're not seeing any slowdown in the emerging markets, or the other parts of the world, collection there is fine. We extended some payment terms in Q2 and during the beginning of Q3 that cost a little bit the timeline of the quarter and it was, by and large, collected at beginning of Q4. So, it's really a one-time singled out event and it's nothing to do with market conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you repeat, please, your second part of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, on the aspirational target of $31 billion of revenue for 2015, the question here is, I think you had mentioned previously that you need roughly, I think, $4 billion to $5 billion of acquired additional revenue to get to that target in 2015, I think you had said earlier this year. So, the question is, with the additional buybacks or dividends that you're contemplating, how are you able to do both, and what does that imply for your debt level over the long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I don't remember that we said the one that we need more acquisition loan to get there. I think that in 2011, after acquiring Cephalon, Taiyo and after acquiring the greater share Ratio, we have the assets that we need in order to go forward. And therefore, if you take what I mentioned on what I call complementary acquisitions for both segments of the business, we don't see any more big acquisition on our radar screen going forward. So, we believe that with these assets and with the organic growth and with creative business initiatives, like the P&amp;G and Teva JV, we can get there.</p>
          <p>And for the rest of your question, what we are going to do with the cash generation, I think that I covered already in my previous questions we are considering, we are definitely at that size as an evolving, dynamic company, when you wish to <mark type="ph" /> sell your $20 billion (1:29:25) you should think different when we are a $10 billion company on how you should get back your shareholders' cash and so, that respect we are considering it and in due time, we of course will share it with you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Frank Pinkerton of SunTrust. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you for taking the question. The first question, I think, is for Gerard. Gerard, because I'm really kind of ignorant of the European business overall sometimes, could you please just run through a scenario that if the current situation we have with the European Union disintegrates and that becomes multiple countries, or maybe multiple geographic areas, how does that ultimately impact Teva's business across Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whoa, Frank, that's a big one. It's a question that many people are trying to answer today. I think the monetary system under which Europe is running is to a certain extent an environmental factor for the healthcare. Healthcare is being organized at a European level and a country level, and there is very little European integrative work going on there other than regulatory compliance elements that are being steered from Brussels. Most of the implementation of the economic arguments that you see in managing healthcare budgets in Europe is local policy. That has always been anchored like this in the European Treaty and that hasn't changed in the last 10, 12 years since the signing of the Treaty of Maastricht.</p>
          <p>So, the effect of all of the economic turmoil in Europe is all going to be indirect through austerity or other measures that may be taken by governments to manage their deficits in their budgets and when they do that, when they look at healthcare budgets.</p>
          <p>Within that, Teva is pretty well positioned to take advantage of that. Our portfolio of products allows us to be part of the solution rather than part of their problem. If prices are lowered and its prices are lowered on the branded, on the reimbursed level of it, they're never on the level of the transaction that we are having with our customers for our generics product, that's one.</p>
          <p>And two, it's &#x2013; you see that very often when price interventions are taken or other interventions are taken, it stimulates the utilization of generic product across Europe. And I think those two elements, if you see these austerity and these savings measures being rolled out in Europe, so far in every incident, proven to be net-net in our advantage. So, there is no connection one-on-one with the economic turmoil in Europe with healthcare, but it's &#x2013; as a fall-out of that, you'll see austerity measures and within that, I believe generic companies of the size and the presence at Teva will benefit more from it than they will suffer from it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And then &#x2013; and just as my follow-up question, and I'll throw this one out, but can you please quantify for me a dollar impact on management compensation that the shutting of the Irvine facility and the delays in manufacturing at Jerusalem had? And if there's no actual dollar impact, what's the lesson ultimately that Teva has taken away from those two facilities and the steps that have gone into making sure this doesn't happen at other facilities in the future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, this is Bill Marth. I didn't get the first part of the question, but I got the part about what are we doing. I think that &#x2013; what have we learned &#x2013; I think Shlomo said it well in his discussion where he said that quality for Teva is the number one priority. It absolutely is. And we seek to pursue it in that fashion. Whenever we get a 483 at any facility, we take that 483 and we respond to it. And those are responses aren't just that for that facility, those responses are for the Teva network, and that's a very large network.</p>
          <p>So we've taken this to the level that all facilities need to be compliant and we need to share the best practices in the industry. And that's what we're implementing. There absolutely are no shortcuts with respect quality and with &#x2013; our lessons learned here is that we have to stay vigilant and proactive because with this many sites, it's something to keep up with. And I think that's probably our lesson learned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Shlomo, let me follow on Bill. If you look toward lessons learned, our lessons learned is that we, as the largest pharmaceutical producer on earth, next year is going to be almost about $80 billion strong, just to understand the volume of our <mark type="ph" /> production (1:34:41), more than 65 around the world. When you have such a big infrastructure and such a big responsibility, you have to live in that area, as well. And what we are really doing is something I almost call a kind of turnaround.</p>
          <p>As Bill said, after every inspection, whether it's FDA, EMA or the others, regulatory agencies in the world, we try immediately to implement it around the world in all facilities to create the highest quality standard that we can. We believe that this is our first obligation and there is not anything that is stopping us to do that beside the time that is needed to implement in such a huge infrastructure around the world. This is our commitment to our patients, to the FDA, and we are going to do it as our first priority.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from John Boris of Citigroup. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. For Bill, just a couple residual questions, on the Olanzapine $300 million that you called out, does that include sales of the 20-milligram? I think you have an agreement in place with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:35:58), the 20-milligram, I think, accounts for a significant portion of revenue. And then with the <mark type="ph" /> Antisphor (1:36:03) and Watson preliminary injunction in place, can we get an update on the regulatory status on your generic Lovenox application and is this still an opportunity for you? And then I have one follow-up for Shlomo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, John. With respect to the Olanzapine, the value I gave is all strength, and so that includes the 20-milligram as well. With respect to <mark type="ph" /> Antisphor (1:36:29) and their situation, I really can't comment too much on <mark type="ph" /> Antisphor (1:36:33) and as far as the update on our product, on continuing situation where we would say that there is no update until we produce an update.</p>
          <p>That said, I think enoxaparin still provides a compelling value. We're still excited about the product and so, we're continuing to pursue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. And Shlomo, certainly through the acquisition strategy that you've had over the last 24 months, Ratiopharm, Cephalon, Taiyo, also the P&amp;G joint venture, geographically you've diversified the business, however, I think your Form 20-F clearly indicates that on a product basis, you don't want to be heavily concentrated in any one product. You certainly lessened the dependence on Copaxone pretty significantly. We estimate it accounts for mid-20% to upper 20% of your earnings in 2012. Is that a satisfactory level for you, or is there a certain level of product diversification that you'd like to see going forward for Copaxone to be contributing as far as less of your earnings, and how do you plan on doing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we are doing it in the global level, we would like to do it in the branded business, as well. And by the acquisition of Cephalon, which is the triggering reason for that was exactly to diversify our branded business, and if you do only a pro forma before and after the acquisition, you see immediately the impact on reducing the Copaxone share in our overall sales of branded portfolio. So, we believe, as I said in my script, that about &#x2013; we have right now, a very interesting pipeline of about 30 product in the late stages, Phase II, Phase III in different area, different therapeutic areas that some of those products, of course not all of them, you will know this on the likelihood of getting product to the market.</p>
          <p>But I believe that these are going to provide a very good future for the Teva specialty pharma business. We believe that there are &#x2013; it's &#x2013; that we actually having all, as I said, all the assets in this area, right now pro forma wise, our 2010 numbers the branded business is $7 billion. We targeted by 2015 $ 9 billion, so I believe that we have all the needed assets here to get there. Of course, this is also an opportunistic area and if we see a kind of a very attractive molecule, we'll go for it right away. Just in Q3, we have a very good example for that.</p>
          <p>We acquired a stake in CureTech, a small company but a very interesting and very great future for &#x2013; in a breakthrough kind of a molecule. Of course, it will take long time to develop, but at least that's why we went there. So, if we see there are some other attractive opportunities on that level, we will proceed.</p>
          <p>But all in all, as I said, I think that we are having the right assets that we need in order to do it &#x2013; the diversification in our branded business. And please bear in mind that beside these two business segment, with the generics and the branded, we also have another two pillars that are relatively young, but have a very interesting future, which complete the overall strategy. One is the OTC and the first one is the biosimilar that we are going to see, of course, in the longer-term, longer than the 2015 time, or milestone, but definitely part of our future.</p>
