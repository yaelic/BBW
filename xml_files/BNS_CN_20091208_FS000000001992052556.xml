          <p>I am Luc Vanneste, Chief Financial Officer. Rick Waugh, our CEO, will lead off with the highlights of 2009. Next, I will go over the financial results, including a review of business line performance. Brian Porter, our Group Head, Risk and Treasury, will then discuss credit quality. Brian will be followed by our business line heads who will provide an outlook for their respective businesses. Rick will finish the prepared remarks by discussing the all-bank outlook and targets for 2010, and then we will be glad to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to refer you to slide number two of our presentation, which contains Scotiabank's caution regarding forward-looking statements. Rick, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc. Well, clearly the global economy slowed in 2009. This led to higher loan losses and a slowdown in volumes for banks globally. We were not immune. However, we have been successful in managing through this challenging environment, so we are pleased to report strong financial results for 2009, with net income of $3.5 billion after tax, or $3.31 per share. Results benefited from record revenues, which were up 20% year-over-year, and we delivered a very strong, industry-leading return on equity of 16.7% this year. This reflects a level of high and consistent profitability achieved by very few banks in Canada, or indeed the world.</p>
          <p>Each of our three business lines had record earnings in 2009, and credit risk continues to be well managed. As expected, our provision for credit losses have increased significantly year-over-year, driven by global economic conditions. However, our credit portfolios are performing within our expectations, within our risk appetite, and better than in previous cycles. Our capital position remains strong. Our Tier 1 capital ratio is now 10.7%, versus 10.4% last quarter, and our tangible common equity is now 8.2%. Our solid profitability and our internally generated capital have enabled us to continually strengthen our balance sheet and our capital ratios.</p>
          <p>It's very gratifying to see that our common shareholders' equity was up $3 billion, without significantly issuing any equity at low prices <mark type="inaudible" /> would have diluted our shareholders' interest going forward. Strong capital also allows us to continue to invest in our businesses, yet at the same time provide our shareholders with consistent high-quality dividends.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, each of our three business lines had record results &#x2013; impressive given the weak environment. Canadian Banking had a strong year, net income of 1.85 billion, up 7% from the prior year. It benefited from substantial volume growth, a wider margin, and good expense control. International Banking earnings were 1.3 billion, up 11% from last year. Record earnings were achieved notwithstanding the impact of the global economic slowdown in our various geographical locations. Scotia Capital earned 1.5 billion, up 84% over last year. This exceptional performance this year was driven by record revenues in both our global capital markets and also Global Corporate and Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>Partly offsetting the strong business line results was a negative 1 billion in the Other segment, and this reflects our higher funding costs and our higher security writedowns.</p>
          <p>We were able to achieve our strong results by executing on our key strategic priorities: sustainable revenue growth, strong focus on expense control and risk management, prudent capital management, and leadership development. As a result, we were able to meet all of our financial targets. Our earnings per share growth was 8.5%, within our target range of 7 to 12%. Return on equity was 16.7%, also within our range of 16 to 20%. Our productivity ratio at 53.7% was a significant improvement from 59.4% last year and well ahead of our target of 58%.</p>
          <p>So now I'll pass it over to Luc to discuss our financial performance in more detail, and at the end I'll  be back to give you our outlook and how we see the future unfolding.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. Slide eight. You can see that Q4 was a solid quarter with net income of $902 million. This quarter's earnings were much higher than Q4 '08, which included significant writedowns. Q4 '09 also had higher trading revenues and positive contribution from acquisitions. Partly offsetting were increased specific provisions, higher expenses, and a negative impact from ForEx.</p>
          <p>Compared to last quarter, earnings benefited from lower PCLs &#x2013; specific PCLs, there was no general provision; significantly lower writedowns of AFS securities; and higher Wealth Management revenues. Offsetting were lower trading revenues, which were still very strong, but were lower than a record Q3; higher expenses; and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our ROE was 16.4% for the quarter. As Rick mentioned, our full year ROE was 16.7%, and remains very strong by both domestic and international standards. Productivity came in at 54.2%.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, we have disclosed items of note for this quarter and for all of 2009. In Q4 we had writedowns relating to CDOs and CLOs of $13 million, and writedowns of AFS securities of $49 million. As you can see, the $62 million total is much lower than prior quarters.</p>
          <p>Also this quarter, in accordance with CICA Handbook Section 3855, we reclassified some available-for-sale securities to loans, which is detailed in the Appendix on slide 56. 94% of the reclassified securities are investment grade. The result was a $595 million increase to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which increased shareholders' equity and reduced ROE by approximately 50 basis points. There was no P&amp;L impact.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we have shown the Q4 versus Q3 impact of foreign exchange by business line. As you would expect, the largest impact is in international banking, where FX lowered net income by $16 million versus Q3. In total, the impact of FX on the bank's net income was $30 million quarter-over-quarter, or $0.03 per share. In fiscal 2009, the Canadian dollar averaged $0.86. Given that it is currently hovering around $0.95, it has the potential to impact 2010 earnings for some of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 11, fourth quarter revenues were significantly higher compared to last year, as Q4 '08 included $958 million in market-related writedowns. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenues were down slightly from a record Q3. Net interest income decreased 3%. The positive impact from asset re-pricing was more than offset by lower loan volumes, FX, and a negative impact from financial instruments used for asset and liability management.</p>
          <p>Other Income was up 2% compared to Q3, driven by three primary factors. First, net gains on investment securities resulting mainly from lower AFS security writedowns in Q3; second, record mutual fees and higher credit and underwriting fees; and thirdly, partly offsetting were lower trading revenue compared to a record Q3, and FX.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide12, average assets decreased by 2% versus Q3. The decline was predominantly in business and government loans, which fell by $13 billion or 11%. This decline was due to three factors: the negative impact of FX; the pay-down of bridge loans in Scotia Capital, which we mentioned in Q3, and which had a full quarter impact on average balances in Q4; and further loan pay-downs in Q4. You can also see that underlying mortgage volumes increased by $3 million &#x2013; $3 billion, sorry, during the quarter. This is after adjusting for the impact of converting mortgages to mortgage-backed securities, which we intend to hold to maturity.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 13, the margin was down slightly versus Q3 by two basis points. On the positive side, our margin is benefiting from asset repricing in both Canadian banking and our corporate lending book in Scotia Capital. As well, we have lowered non-earning assets. However, these factors were more than offset by a negative quarter-over-quarter swing in financial instruments. We expect the 2010 margin to increase, benefiting from higher spreads on floating rate assets in Canadian banking, wider spreads in U.S. corporate lending, and lower funding costs.</p>
          <p>Looking at expenses, they were up 5% versus Q3. Higher performance and stock-based compensation, increased advertising and development &#x2013; business development costs, as well as higher professional fees &#x2013; categories which typically peak in Q4 &#x2013; and a $23 million provision relating to Visa reward points. Given the economic downturn, some customers are conserving cash by redeeming the reward points at a quicker pace than historically. These increases were partly offset by the positive impact of FX. Most of the increases in expenses were driven by growth initiatives and seasonality.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital on slide 15, you can see that our Tier 1 and TCE are higher this quarter. The increases reflect solid internal capital generation in our DRIP plan. Risk weighted assets were flat versus Q3, as a decrease in underlying business loan balances was offset by downward credit migration. Overall, risk weighted assets and FX had a minimal impact on our capital ratios. It is important to highlight that we have adjusted our definition of tangible common equity to conform to GAAP common shareholders equity. We now include all components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Prior quarters' TCE ratios have been restated.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the business lines beginning on slide 16. Canadian Banking had its second consecutive record quarter with net income of $503 million. Compared to Q4 '08 earnings increased 8%. Strong revenue growth and good cost control produced positive operating leverage, which more than offset higher PCLs. Revenue growth was 5% quarter-over-quarter, benefiting from three factors. First, an increased margin due to asset repricing and funding mix; secondly, asset growth, which was predominantly in residential mortgages; and third, increased wealth management revenues.</p>
          <p>Provisions increased $21 million or four basis points, mostly in Visa and unsecured personal loans. Expenses increased 6%. Excluding the provision relating to the Visa Reward Points, expense growth was 4%, underlying expenses due to higher stock and performance based compensation as well as spending on growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, International Banking's net income was $283 million. Compared to Q4 '08 net income was up a strong 25%. The increase mainly reflected $102 million of writedowns last year and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of FX and higher PCLs. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, International Banking's net income was down 9% partly due to the impact of FX. Revenue were down 2% versus Q3, however excluding the negative impact of FX and financial instruments, revenues increased 9%, mainly reflecting higher securities gains and higher fee income in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Provisions were down $12 million versus last quarter, reflecting lower retail provisions partly offset by higher commercial provisions. Expenses were up 3% versus last quarter due to higher professional fees and seasonal expenses.</p>
          <p>Scotia Capital had another strong quarter, with net income of $353 million. Compared to last year net income was significantly higher, as Q4 '08 included $305 million after taxes and writedowns for Scotia Capital. Q4 revenues were also the second highest ever, albeit down 18% from last quarter's record. The decrease was due to lower trading and lower loan volumes. Partly offsetting were record credit fees and investment banking revenues. Provisions were down $43 million versus last quarter, reflecting lower provisions in U.S. and Canadian portfolios. Expenses were up 7% versus last quarter due to increase remuneration and professional fees, partly offset by lower performance-based compensation.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the Other segment, which incorporates the results of Group Treasury, smaller operating units, and certain corporate adjustments.</p>
          <p>The first component we have highlighted is Treasury's funding net interest income, which includes the bank's term funding as well as our short-term foreign currency funding. It mainly includes the negative or positive carry on funding positions. Quarter-over-quarter, net interest income was essentially flat. However, year-over-year, the gap between the cost of fixed term funding and short term rates has increased as a result of the year-over-year decline in short term rates.</p>
          <p>Moving down a line, net securitization revenues are comprised of the gain we earned from securitizing our mortgages and the reduction in mortgage net interest from removing these assets from the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter, net revenues declined $43 million, mainly due to significantly lower securitization gains as we securitized relatively few mortgages in the quarter. Year-over-year the decline primarily represents the reduction in net mortgage interest earned, as securitization volumes has increased over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Writedowns in the investment portfolios in Group Treasury totaled $49 million this quarter, a significant improvement over last quarter and Q4 '08. The next line represents other valuation adjustments and losses incurred last year.</p>
          <p>Moving down, the impact of accounting for financial instruments was not material quarter-over-quarter, but was favorable year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In summary, the Other segment reported loss of $237 million in Q4, an improvement compared to last year and to the third quarter. We expect the loss in this segment will moderate going forward, as we expect the level of investment writedowns to improve. Also, the bank's funding is positioned to benefit from rising interest rates, as a portion of our long-term funding has been locked in at fixed rates. While this has a short term cost, it is both prudent and will benefit us in the longer term.</p>
          <p>This concludes my review of our financial results. I'll now turn it over to Brian, who will discuss risk.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc. I will now review the key dimensions of our risk profile. I am pleased to say that I have fewer slides to speak to than in the past several quarters. As you may recall, I indicated a year ago that the major focus for us in 2009 would be to manage our risk positions very closely. This was indeed the case.</p>
          <p>We believe that the risk in our credit portfolios remains well contained and manageable. We are now beginning to see our portfolios stabilize. Although this recession has been worse than many previous downturns, our portfolios have performed better than in previous cycles.</p>
          <p>This quarter saw some improvement in our credit numbers. Our specific provisions were 424 million, down 9% from 466 million in Q3. We did not add to the general allowance this quarter. Our general allowance stands at 1.45 billion or 65 basis points of risk weighted assets. And our gross impaired loans decreased by 54 million in the quarter to end the year at 3.9 billion. On the next slide, I will discuss our provisions in more detail.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 shows the trend in specific and sectoral provisions, as well as changes to the general allowance over the past five quarters. As you can see, the decrease in specific provisions this quarter came primarily from Scotia Capital, 65 million versus 117 million in Q3, with a further small decline in International Banking. Canadian Banking reported a modest increase in provisions of 4 basis points this quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking in more detail, first at the retail provisions on slide 23. The overall retail provisions were flat quarter-over-quarter. In International Banking, the retail provisions were lower across the division in Mexico, Peru, Chile and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Retail provisions in Canadian Banking were 22 million higher this quarter, primarily reflecting higher provisions in our unsecured revolving credit portfolios. In addition, provisions relating to our acquired auto businesses are right in line with our expectations. The retail portfolio remains well managed, the Q4 loan loss ratio was 37 basis points, a 4 point increase over Q3.</p>
          <p>Looking next at the specific provisions against our commercial and corporate portfolios, the overall provisions were down 40 million quarter-over-quarter. Scotia Capital was down 52 million, with lower provisions in both Canada and the U.S. Provisions in International Banking were up 12 million, with higher provisions in Asia, Peru, Caribbean and Central America were partially offset by lower provisioning in Mexico and Chile. The provisions for Canadian commercial were unchanged at 33 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows the trend in specific provisioning over the past 13 quarters. Clearly, we are seeing signs of specific provisioning stabilizing. Looking ahead, we are seeing signs of stability generally returning to our portfolios. We expect this trend to solidify with continuing economic recovery and modest reductions in unemployment levels. Similarly, the overall pace of credit migration is moderating.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2010, we expect our retail provisions to stay at elevated levels, given the current economic environment. However, we expect provisioning in our corporate and commercial portfolios to decline gradually in 2010. Overall, we expect provisions to remain high, but they should show some downward trend in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>That concludes my comments on risk, and I'll now turn it over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. 2009 was a record year for Canadian Banking. The effects from volatile global financial markets and weakened credit quality did impact us, but we were able to earn through it. In 2010 we will continue to invest selectively with a focus on leveraging our recent investments and controlling operating costs. Key areas of focus will be wealth management, insurance and commercial banking. We will also continue to strengthen the Scotia Bank brand.</p>
          <p>In wealth management we are very well positioned to benefit from our past investments, improving market conditions and industry growth. And in 2010 we will continue to leverage our acquisition and rebranding of Scotia iTRADE by consolidating ScotiaMcLeod Direct Investing and TradeFreedom into one industry-leading platform. We will also enhance our offering in service to all of our channel partners by leveraging our capabilities from the newly combined Scotia Asset Management.</p>
          <p>We will continue to grow our presence in the mutual fund business through Scotia Funds, which was the industry leader in net mutual fund sales last year, and through our investments in DundeeWealth and CI Financial, which were among the top sales performers. And we will further develop our advisor networks in ScotiaMcLeod and Scotia Private Client Group.</p>
          <p>In insurance, we will build on our newly rebranded Scotia Life Financial business with its expanded range of consumer insurance product lines. We will leverage prospect databases from our retail branches and SCENE loyalty program which has now reached more than 2 million members in 2009, 70% of whom are between the ages of 18 and 40.</p>
          <p>In commercial banking the strategic priority is to accelerate our business development efforts as we position ourselves for an economic recovery. Although we expect PCLs to remain elevated in 2010, we do see opportunities in key commercial segments. We are also seeing our commercial flow of business picking up as our existing customers who have successfully withstood the economic downturn have started to reinvest in their inventories, and are again starting to slowly expand their businesses.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we will continue to build on the strength of the Scotiabank brand. This includes building on our successful sponsorship portfolios, including our partnership with the NHL, the NHL Alumni, Canadian Women's Hockey League, and the over 1,500 minor hockey teams we sponsor coast to coast. We'll also continue to lever the SCENE loyalty program and our new strategic initiatives in Scotia iTRADE and Scotia Life Financial.</p>
          <p>Finally, with these investments we will continue to focus on maintaining positive operating leverage in 2010. We will selectively focus our resources on our strategic growth segments, improving our sales channels and introducing innovative products for the small business and retail units. We expect that continued asset and deposit growth combined with stable margins and a strong expense management will help us grow net income in 2010.</p>
          <p>So in summary, while 2010 (sic) [2009] was a record year, we believe the investments we've made in our Canadian Banking business will in an even stronger year in 2010. And with that I'll turn it over to Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. We are pleased with our results in 2009 and how well our international franchise has performed through the year relative to our competition. The slowdown in the world's developed markets has had a global impact, and our markets were not immune and growth slowed over the course of the year. This combined with the dramatic rise of the Canadian dollar and lower recoveries impacted our earnings and will continue to do so into early 2010. This is a short term situation and does not change these markets' very attractive economic, demographic, and industry specific fundamentals. Our core numbers reinforce this conclusion.</p>
          <p>Despite these headwinds our banks are performing well in absolute terms and against the competition. We achieved strong results in all key performance areas; net income was up 11% from last year, revenue growth 14% despite lower asset growth, positive operating leverage. PCLs performed better than our expectations. We rolled out important new platforms to drive future growth, and we completed important integrations in Chile and Peru. So in a year that tested our franchise as never before, we delivered solid results, strengthened our market presence and positioned ourselves for growth as the markets recover.</p>
          <p>Our markets did lag Latin America and Europe going into this downturn, and some will lag coming out. In 2010 Mexico's economy is expected to expand by 3%, Peru 4%, and Chile 5%. Asset and revenue growth &#x2013; as economies rebound, we expect stronger asset and revenue growth. Some markets will resume growth faster than others, and so we expect to feel the turnaround in the second quarter of 2010 and into 2011.</p>
          <p>Clearly, credit risk management remains a key priority for us. Our retail account management and pricing platforms in Mexico and Peru will permit us to manage risk at a truly world class level, and we're rolling out these platforms across the division. We're getting paid for the risks we're taking. Loan loss provisions are expected to be marginally higher next year entirely due to, significantly lower loan loss recoveries and reversals.</p>
          <p>While our focus is on organic growth in our retail and commercial franchises, we will continue to build out alternative businesses such as wealth management and insurance, our wholesale banking initiative, and seek opportunities for acquisition and investments in key markets. So in summary, we expect 2010 will be a year of good, solid growth.</p>
          <p>And I'll turn it now over to Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. This was a record year for Scotia Capital with net income of 1.45 billion. The strong performance was driven by record revenues in both Global Capital Markets and Global Corporate Investment Banking. Strong revenues were delivered across all our businesses. We were not dependent on any one area for extraordinary results. This underscores the strength of our diversified platform.</p>
          <p>In both Global Capital Markets and Global Corporate Investment Banking, we see signs that markets are stabilizing and that competitors are returning. While we expect performance in 2010 to be strong, it is unlikely we will match the record results achieved in 2009. In Global Corporate &#x2013; in Global Capital Markets, I'm sorry, we have seen that markets have normalized somewhat since Q3, and the fourth quarter does not present as many opportunities to take advantage of market conditions. The trading businesses are likely to continue to face this more normalized environment in 2010.</p>
          <p>Client driven activity represents the majority of our trading revenues, as opposed to proprietary trading. Our relationships provide the opportunity to cross-sell other products and the strength of our sectoral approach gives us a competitive advantage. Global Capital Markets should benefit from growth in the product areas and sectors in which we have invested.</p>
          <p>In Global Corporate and Investment Banking, our lending businesses benefited in 2009 from higher spreads and fees, reflecting much better pricing on transactions. So far about 50% of our lending facilities have repriced. While we expect to see some further improvement in 2010, the pace of repricing will not likely be as pronounced going forward, as the higher proportion of shorter-term facilities have already renewed. Also, as competitors return we may see some downward pressure on pricing.</p>
          <p>Lending volumes have been trending down as many companies have been prompted to pay down debt in the current environment of low interest rates and open capital markets. Coupled with the relative lack of M&amp;A activity, particularly in the U.S., there has been a lower demand for new loans. However, those same market conditions of low interest rates, wide open and stabilized capital markets, and low growth suggested the level of M&amp;A activity should pick up in the coming months. Our pipelines for M&amp;A related transactions look promising. Increased M&amp;A activity will not only benefit new issue and advisory fees, but also provides opportunities for additional financing and to cross-sell other products and services.</p>
          <p>Provisions for credit losses increased significantly during 2009, which was not unexpected given market conditions during the year. As Brian mentioned earlier, our PCL performance has been better than in previous downturns. This performance underlines the successes of prudently managing credit risk over the past several years: increasing the proportion of investment grade borrowers, reducing single name exposures, and exiting leverage lending in United States and Europe. Provisions for loan losses in the corporate credit portfolio are expected to improve in 2010.</p>
          <p>Our relative strength throughout the market upheaval compared to many global financial institutions meant that we were able to invest in the fundamental parts of our business and attract and develop top talent. We will benefit from our strengthened equities platform, sales, trading and research, and underwriting. We have enhanced our fixed income platform to take advantage of opportunities in the markets, selectively add products, and expand geographically. We have expanded our infrastructure platform to increase market share in this increasingly important market sector, and we will continue to expand our energy trading business.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, in addition to the wide range of products and services we offer in our home market and in Mexico and the United States, we also offer select products and services to niche markets in Europe and Asia. We will build on our strengths in these markets, and in partnership with International Banking we will optimize delivery of wholesale products to clients outside the geographic markets in which we already operate.</p>
          <p>As a result of these initiatives, we have a broader base of stable revenues with opportunities for sustainable and diversified growth. Our focus in 2010 is on the effective execution of our strategy, and to continue to grow our core businesses in a prudent manner, while carefully managing risk and expenses.</p>
          <p>Now I'll hand it back to Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Steve. So, our 2010 outlook and our assumptions. Looking forward, a number of positive growth factors should continue to support a gradual strengthening of the global economic recovery. The U.S. dollar is expected to remain under pressure and that's a headwind we will need to continue to earn through. The regulatory environment continues to evolve and will have an impact on business model, capital, and compensation. More stringent financial regulatory requirements are expected in many nations, including Canada. However, Canadian financial institutions are expected to be impacted much less than many of our global peers, as the Canadian system is already very sound and very well capitalized.</p>
          <p>We are planning continued earning growth in 2010, but at lower recovery levels from past cycles due to the less robust macroeconomic growth. We anticipate this growth will be from solid contributions from all three of our business lines, and should accelerate towards the second half of our year. Net interest income is expected to increase, driven by moderate asset growth and a wider margins, which should more than offset any unfavorable impact from a stronger Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>We expect increases in most revenue categories, fewer security writedowns, although trading and investment revenues are likely to be somewhat lower compared to the record performance in 2009. Expense control remains a key strength of this bank, and operating leverage is expected to remain positive in 2010. And as Brian has commented, provisions for credit losses are expected to remain elevated, but with a downward trend that should accelerate in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect earnings growth next year, and hence have left our targets unchanged. But we all appreciated and have benefited from the spectacular rebound in markets. I am becoming more concerned about the dangers of returning to some past practices which have hurt our industry. Several insti &#x2013; financial institutions in Canada and globally have worked very hard at improving their risk management and capital positions. However, there are some indications that a few institutions are now assuming we are back to the old ways of the past. This is a dangerous assumption. Mistakes were made; risk management and incentive had to be changed. And I am convinced many banks are making these necessary changes.</p>
          <p>As well, we were cautious that world economy has now return to growth, this growth will be more limited than in the past, at least for the next several quarters, perhaps longer, as a result of excess economic capacity in the world and high employment &#x2013; unemployment levels. However for Scotia Bank, given our proven strategies and demonstrated competitive advantages, we believe this scenario will result in many opportunities for us. But at the same time, we will never lose sight of our financial and our risk management discipline, which has done so well over this past cycle.</p>
          <p>So specifically, looking at our targets for 2010, we are maintaining our earnings per share growth objective of 7 to 12% over 2009. Our target range for return on equity is 16 to 20%, also consistent with last year. And we are maintaining our productivity ratio target at less than 58%, and of course we will continue to maintain strong capital ratios and dividends.</p>
          <p>With our clear focus and executing effectively on these strategies, we are confident we'll be able to achieve our goals and objectives both in 2010 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions please. Looking at the slide deck on page 12, we talked about the business and government decline in assets, and I know Steve had &#x2013; was keeping his fingers crossed with respect to M&amp;A activity &#x2013; investments to help in the -- in 2010. But I'm wondering if you can talk about the near term trends in terms of business growth? Should we see continued decline at this level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from a Scotia Capital perspective, we are seeing modest continued decline in volumes currently. As we've said all along, we really need to see M&amp;A activity pick up. It really does drive loan volumes and fee generation. And we are expecting to see that activity in early 2010 &#x2013; calendar 2010, but &#x2013; and we're trying to get in as much traffic as we can around the world. We are being quite aggressive about that. So we've gone from a defensive mode to an offensive mode fairly quickly there, just in the last three to six months, to address that issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, while you're taking this proactive stance, are the loan &#x2013; sorry, are the loan pay-downs still occurring in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what you're seeing is the product of a very strong capital markets environment. So corporates are hitting the fixed income market very aggressively, paying down their revolver term loans with banks and positioning themselves well for the future. So we are seeing that, but as I say, it's &#x2013; the pace is lessening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. And my second question is for Brian Porter. Brian, I'm looking at page 16 of the sub-pack and the segment that I was probably most worried about in terms of international commercial seemed to be this &#x2013; the significant bright spot with only 5 million in classifications. With that trend, we're looking for recoveries in Q1 2010. Maybe you can kind of give us some guidance in terms of what you're thinking of some of the regions here. Has something changed? Has there been a sea change where this is going to be lumpy going forward for the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, it's really a question of timing. We classified some loans last quarter, and clearly that number was smaller this quarter. I wouldn't get too carried away and look for recoveries in the next couple of quarters. But I think Rob talked about it in terms of these particular economies recovering, you are going to see Peru and Chile first out of the gate. Mexico is going to lag, and the Caribbean will be behind that.</p>
          <p>Our biggest concern as it sits right now in international and commercial is our hotel exposures in the Caribbean, which you've heard me talk about before, which are about 1.8 billion in total. And that's going to be dependent on the tourism season this winter. The visibility on that season is not as good as it would be in a normal year. It's good at the high-end of the market. It's okay at the lower end of the market. The middle part of the market is somewhat mixed, and there is some price cutting and things like that going on, to attract tourists. But that would be our biggest concern in the international and commercial book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks very much, Brian. I just wanted to ask Rick quickly, Rick, you had made some pretty bold statement saying that you've seen banks returning to the old ways of the past in a very short order. Can you give us a sense of where you are seeing that? Is it a particular region, is it wholesale, is it retail, pricing, credit? If you could elaborate on that, that would be really helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; and it's some banks, I wouldn't say banks. I would say &#x2013; or let me say financial institutions. That'd even broaden it out, though. And look, we've had this great, somewhat spectacular return in a lot of markets in a very quick period of time, and that has incentivized, I think, a few participants. So it's on the global &#x2013; I don't see it in the Canadian markets to any visible extent in that. But I think in a lot of these global markets, the New York and London and what have you, there is evidence that there is sign that it was like before the last two years.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's short-lived because I do know and I see it in many regards that a lot of these risk management and compensation things have to be implemented over time, and that will probably <mark type="inaudible" />. But of course there's a large unregulated market that's also out there. So strong markets produce different results in different situations. I am a little cautious on that, but leave it at that, I think.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Good afternoon. I am just trying to get a little more understanding about the forward-looking targets and some of the comments that you made. And I thank you for them, because it is helpful to have a little bit more granularity. Some of the other banks are shying away from that kind of stuff. But I guess first, Brian, when you're talking about credit next year, and potentially for it to remain elevated and flat to down and that kind of stuff, are we thinking from a total provision perspective, or were you discussing specifics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I break it down by business line, and I'd say that we're quite comfortable in terms of the transparency we see in our Scotia Capital and commercial portfolio. As Steve said, we high-graded the portfolio some years ago. We've stuck to the discipline of single name exposure limits, that type of thing. We think we are largely through the issues in auto. The financial sector and media is better than it was. There is probably a little bit work to do there.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the international commercial book, which I made a comment about earlier, the international retail book, these portfolios by the nature of the business and the countries they are in are going to be bumpy. So next quarter the provisioning level, and I am not forecasting, could be up a snick, could be down a snick, but it's too early to declare victory on these portfolios, and still we &#x2013; until we see some stabilization in the economies and some downward trend in unemployment rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just Rick, I guess one, I know that the comments you made really were relating to the upcoming year. But I am curious, just to follow on Jim's question I guess. Can you comment in terms of what a longer term growth rate might be for your business as we exit the downturn? I know you were targeting 7 to 12 for next year. But is there any damage from the downturn? In other words, is your longer term growth rate lower going forward than what it might have been, how you might have answered that question say two or three years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I wish we had crystal balls to go out in the longer term. But I think that &#x2013; and there will be a new norm. I think global growth rates and economies, to start out with, and certainly in the developed countries, Europe and let's say the United States, I think the next couple of years are going to be growing, but not at their potential. And they will be sub-potential. And then you get to the longer part of the question, what is the potential? And I think there the emerging markets is where you will get above-average growth rates, and, of course, guess what, that's where we are.</p>
          <p>So I think, in putting this, we have done our assessment on own businesses and where we see it. And we do have leverage, of course, in the U.S. market on the corporate side. But that's going to be in a pretty good spot to be, because as we have said the loan losses are low, the number of participants are lessened, there will be new risk management policies put in place, I assume, and that will make for a pretty good return on economic capital, but perhaps at a little bit lower volumes. But for us, we have good confidence, after say in the next several quarters, in the Canadian economy and the economy does seem to have turned, but we all have the correlation to the U.S. and other developed markets.</p>
          <p>So I think, and it's hard to look &#x2013; I would say in the next couple of years, developed markets will be less robust, depending on where you are, and I think emerging markets &#x2013; and I obviously believe we have chosen well, because we are in the Latin Americas. We are not in, say, some of the Central and Eastern European nations which will suffer from some of their issues. So, long answer but in the short term less than normal growth rates in the past, but I don't see the &#x2013; our growth rate being certainly not less than the targets I have given you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. This question is for Brian. I had a question on the reserve release this quarter, with the net write-off of above the provisioning level. It looks like the big increase in the write-off was driven by Scotia Capital. Is there are anything sort of non-recurring in that line item that would cause the view for a reserve release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would characterize it as housekeeping. You are talking about the 210 million of write-offs in Scotia Capital, which this quarter was done largely as a function of, we had some companies that we had classified that had gone through a prepack bankruptcy proceeding. So instead of going through a prolonged bankruptcy proceeding of a year, year and a half, they were in and out of bankruptcy in two to three months, debt to equity conversion in some cases, so we wrote off the balance of the loan in combination with some amount of recovery. So I would view that as more a one-time item than a consistent practice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And my second question is for Chris on the net interest margin on the Canadian Banking business, up 10 basis points Q-over-Q. Can you talk a little bit about the nature of the assets that were repriced over the quarter? Is any of it that to benefit from the line of credit reprice, or should that mostly come next quarter? And then &#x2013; so is it really more asset repricing in the quarter, or lower cost of funds driving the increase this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is predominantly the repricing of the portfolio, which we did about six months ago, and it was a significant portion of our lines of credit. So we did benefit from cost of funds, but to a smaller extent. We also repriced our commercial portfolio, so it was a large increase in margin. I would suggest that in terms of looking forward into next year, we expect that margin to stabilize, and I think that's an important point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, to what &#x2013; we expect some increase margin in this business because of the repricing, but I'd be careful on extrapolating that 10 basis point increase. We will look for increased margin over the course of 2010, but this was a particularly good quarter because of some of the things <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'd like to follow up on credits, so &#x2013; now, just looking back over the year, your total net formations were about $3 billion on a loss provision of 1.7. So your net NPLs weakened by about $1.3 billion during the year, to the $1.1 billion net NPLs at year-end. Do you think that you can get through 2010, can you talk about the dynamics in the formations that you foresee, and what impact this &#x2013; you think that this will have on that net non-performing loan level? Do you think you can get it down from the $1 billion plus that it's at now? And can you do it without increasing your loss provision for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll go at it this way, Michael. I think that if you look at the top 10 gross impaired loans in the bank today, six of those that are classified would amount to a total amount of over $320 million and the provision &#x2013; the cumulative provision for those loans would be less than $10 million today. And that's a function of, we're very comfortable with the credit. These are largely hotel properties that we've lent to for a long period of time. Loan-to-values are very conservative, in the 40% range. And we are very comfortable in terms of the progress being made on a restructuring, new equity owners, what have you.</p>
          <p>So if we weren't comfortable, we would have provided for them and the provision would be higher. So what you are seeing too, if you extrapolate that, it has an impact on our coverage ratios as well, specific coverage, which is at 35% in terms of gross impaired loans. For classifying a loan and not taking a provision, it's going to drive that ratio down. But we are very comfortable in terms of our classification of these loans and the progress we are making in terms of restructuring.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to add a little bit to it. We always have this rule we have where we put our, sort of our watchful waiting classification, and certainly that's an earlier trend and it's improving in our watch list.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In slide 13 you say that net interest margin overall was impacted by financial instruments. Explain, when you tie it together with the amounts shown in slide 19 for financial instruments, because it looks like the contribution for instruments actually increased in the latest quarter, and certainly on a year-over-year basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, slide 19 financial instruments, that's only the impact on the other segment, Michael. So that that's only one component of the overall impact of financial instruments, that it has impacted the interest margin for example, in International, it's also impacted the other business lines to a lesser extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But can you quantify the overall impact of financial instruments? You know, there's a number of banks that report financial instruments as non-interest revenue, why is it that it gets included in your net interest revenue but for other banks it's in their non-interest revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Financial instruments, there is two components to it. The impact in terms of interest revenue this quarter, Michael, was a negative five basis points. And that's because it relates to, specifically to the interest component. The remainder is in Other Income, and that was in fact the larger share this quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Steve McDonald certainly talked about the fact that we'll probably see some &#x2013; let's use the word normalization, in trading revenue, and perhaps the investment banking line as well. One line item that seemed to come back for Scotiabank, historical source of strength for BNS, is the securities gains line. This bank certainly isn't as aggressive as some of your peers in the items of note, but I think both of those go through the securities gains line this quarter, which puts us at about 80 million positive compared to where we've been earlier in the year, big negatives. What are you thinking about here with that unrealized balance back at a formidable level again? What are you thinking about here in terms of the contribution we could get from this business in the targets you've given us today?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think for 2010, if I deal with the writedowns part first, which was quite substantial in 2009. We would expect that to moderate substantially in 2010. On the gain side, again, I think we expect some improvement. But again, our view of in particular the equity markets, is expecting some continued volatility. So some of the larger gain years in the past, is not what we're expecting for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's fair to say a positive contribution, but perhaps not at the levels we were seeing in, let's say 2006 just to throw a year out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a fair comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And for Luc, just lastly here, on the mutual funds line, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this. Obviously wealth management, nice quarter on the revenue side, up 10%, and I know you keep your &#x2013; or you book your Dundee and CI contributions to the mutual fund revenue line. Just on a timing situation. I mean, CI had a lower profit this quarter because of the Blackmont sale. Do you guys pick that up, or do you make an estimate before they report? How exactly does this work? Because your mutual fund line jumped by a pretty good amount this quarter regardless of what happened with CI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If there is a significant event, we do pick it up, assume it, but otherwise we take it into income in arrears, it's I think one month in arrears.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this quarter you wouldn't have picked up the &#x2013; whatever CI booked, it will &#x2013; that will get adjusted in Q1, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that's right. I will double-check that and get that back &#x2013; get back to you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Not the biggest item, obviously, I was just kind of curious as to how that works. Thanks for your time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mario Mendonca with Genuity Capital Markets. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could you help me piece together a few things that were said throughout the call? I think reference was made to the bank being positioned for rates to move higher. First, do I have that right? And was that the explanation for why the loss in corporate might not be as great as it has been in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am going to ask Jeff Heath to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at, maybe look at the Other segment, which is slide 19. So net interest income, what's called funding net interest income, was fairly flat, quarter-over-quarter. So the change in that Other segment was really due to other factors which are noted on that slide. To the question in terms of the rate view and the impact on net interest income, our balance sheet is basically positioned for rising rates, and so we would expect that funding net interest income will show some improvement in 2010, partly as a result of that and partly as a result of some of the higher-cost fixed-rate funding rolling off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; that was helpful. What &#x2013; the reason I asked the question is, Chris Hodgson also made the point that you figured margins in retail would improve. If we did see rates increase, and have that desired effect on the funding net interest income, would that not then necessarily bring the margin down in domestic retail? Or Chris, are you suggesting that the re-pricing would overwhelm that effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; we're expecting a fairly benign rate environment over the course of the next year. So, if rates move up marginally, I think that the margin pickup that we would get in the balance of the re-pricing of our book will more than offset that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the bank may have a view that rates are going to increase, maybe &#x2013; just help me understand that, Chris, but you're not incorporating that into your outlook, then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have incorporated it, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have incorporated the outlook that rates will increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But more towards the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a roll-off of prior assets, which do include the mortgages, so you have to go back and take a look at the roll-off and the re-pricing, and then whatever margin improvements we can get on counterparty risk, and that certainly happened in the number of the portfolios. So while funding rates can move in opposite directions, as to your re-pricing of your assets for those two factors, old assets coming off and increased pricing on new assets on the add-on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is the take-away then that the re-pricing should be more important, as it was this quarter, than anything you might assume in terms of what happens to interest rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a correlization you got me, but maybe somebody else has it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is yes in the shorter term. But as &#x2013; depending on the magnitude of rate increases, that will certainly bite into the book. There is no doubt about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Cash up about $11 billion in the quarter, it seems like it came through some huge business deposit. I don't normally pay too much attention to this, but does this mean anything for next quarter as that cash gets invested in higher yielding securities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you are looking at is, those are deposits we have with the Fed, Mario, in New York. I wouldn't draw any conclusion from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's nothing that will be taken away from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally on the transferred securities, I think about $11 billion. What securities were these, first of all? And secondly &#x2013; maybe it wasn't 11 billion, I am sorry, it was 9.5 billion. 11 billion was another bank. 9.5 billion was the accrued amount. The market value was 8.5 billion; if the market value is $1 billion less than the carrying value or the accrued value, does it make sense that there wouldn't be any impairment gross &#x2013; any sort of gross impaired loss associated with those securities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, it's Luc. 94% of those securities are investment grade. We looked at them very carefully on the transfer and none were impaired, so there was no P&amp;L impact in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But with interest rate &#x2013; with credit spreads coming in so much, is &#x2013; does it even make sense to refer to the environment as being the reason why the market value &#x2013; because I remember that was always the explanation as you went through the crisis, that there's nothing wrong with these securities, it's that credit spreads are so much higher. But credit spreads have come in a lot, so what are these securities? Why do they still have such low market value on them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a quite been &#x2013; been quite a difference between the beginning of the year, when they were effectively transferred, to the end of the year. So that's reflected in that. It's less than half, it's less than 300 at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes a lot more sense to me. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. A question for Rob Pitfield. Rob, I'd like to get your perspective on lending growth. I was a little surprised to see the loan book drop off as much as it did in the International. So how are you feeling going into 2010, given a bit of a leveling off in credit experience this quarter, on the prospect of beginning to grow the loan book &#x2013; well, not necessarily aggressively, but to get loan growth moving in a positive direction? So should we start to see lending balances rise anytime soon, or will there be more paring in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the last month or so, we've seen the lending start to rebound, and we're being circumspect with it. I think the countries themselves are being circumspect, and we're being circumspect on the <mark type="inaudible" /> so it will be very reasoned growth, and that's baked into our plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A quick follow up for Chris, if I might. Any update on the potential to explore a distribution agreement with CI? I know that came up last quarter. And might we see anything on that in the new year?</p>

          <p>We have ongoing discussions with the management of CI and also other companies to expand our white-label banking, and we've got good opportunities to do some things with CI. I won't get into some specifics on that. We are &#x2013; over the next 12 to 18 months we will roll out an All-in-One account which we expect will expand our whole platform in that area, and we would expect to bring on two to three new partners in that area.</p>

          <p>We have time for one more question. Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Andre Hardy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Probably for Luc, just the tax rate in Scotia Capital for the last two quarters has been higher than it normally is, and the opposite has happened in International, so has anything changed in those two divisions that would suggest, in the case of Scotia Capital permanently higher rates, or lower in International, or this is just the timing of tax assets being utilized or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of the tax assets, as well as where the income is earned, Andre. If a greater percentage of Scotia Capital's income is earned on a go-forward basis in the U.S. and in the U.K., we will see that particular tax rate go up, relative to if it has stayed the same with the amount earned in Canada. Because the tax rates in Canada are significantly lower than where we have operations in the U.S., as an example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the International side, where the tax rate was 10ish percent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we realized a tax asset this quarter that wasn't previously realized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is 20 to 25% a good range to use for International?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that that that's not a bad rate to use. I would like to think that in the near term, 2010, it would be at the lower end. But at the &#x2013; as we look forward, we see a number of emerging economies actually looking at their tax rates that will drive that up when we go to 2011, 2012. And as well, some of those tax assets that we had, tax attributes are getting depleted, and won't repeat on a go forward basis, unless we do more acquisitions potentially.</p>
