          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter Carnival Corporation Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, March 23, 2010. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. With me this morning in Miami is Beth Roberts, David Bernstein and Micky Arison, Chairman and CEO of Carnival. And what we'll do is as we normally do is I'll throw it over to David and he can give you the full color on the first quarter of 2010 and then he'll come back to me and I'll give you &#x2013; I'll start to discuss the outlook situation going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard. I'll begin the conference call by reading the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which may cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Carnival to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter our EPS was $0.22 per share. The first quarter came in above the midpoint of our December guidance by $0.12 per share. This was driven by a few things; first, the $0.05 per share gain during the quarter from the sale of P&amp;O Cruises' Artemis; second, revenue yields that came in better than expected, declining 2.3% in constant dollars versus our December guidance of down three to 4%, which was worth $0.04 per share, which came from higher than expected pricing on last minute bookings; third, a variety of cost saving measures and timing of certain expenses which benefited us to the tune of $0.05 per share. All of this was partially offset by higher fuel prices costing $0.02 per share. In addition there were other small items going both ways that netted out to zero.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our first quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 9.6% for the first quarter of 2010 with a majority of the increase going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 14.5%, while our North American brands grew 5%. As I previously mentioned, overall net revenue yields in local currency declined 2.3% in the first quarter versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the two components of net revenue yields. For net ticket yields, we saw a yield decline of 4% in local currency. Our North American brands were down 2.6%, driven by declines in all itineraries. Our European brands experienced 6% lower local currency ticket yields driven by a challenging winter season in the Brazilian market which had significant increases in capacity this past winter. If you exclude the six ships we had in Brazil, the European brands only saw a yield decline of 1% in local currency on significantly higher capacity for our Continental European brand.</p>
          <p>For net onboard and other yields, we reported a yield increase of 3% in local currency. The increase was driven by minimum guaranteed payments for calendar year 2009 and a one-time other revenue item related to a litigation settlement. Without these items the first quarter onboard and other yields would have been essentially flat. This is a trend which we anticipated and we are forecasting for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>In summary, because our advanced bookings, we all know that there's a time lag between the price changes and our reported yield &#x2013; revenue yields. So let's keep in mind that as a result of this time lag, for the first quarter of last year our net revenue yields in local currency only declined 5.2% as the quarter benefited from bookings that were taken prior to the financial crisis in late 2008. However, in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year, we experienced revenue yields that were down about 10 to 12% thus feeling the full effect of the economic crisis.</p>
          <p>Therefore we are very encouraged by the 2.3% decline in the first quarter of this year. I say this because if you combine this year's decline of 2.3% with the 5.2% decline from last year, the combined decline of 7.5% is less than the 10 to 12% decline in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year. We also expect the sequential improvement that we saw in the first quarter will continue throughout the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison you need to exclude the 44 million reduction in other ship operating expenses for the recognition of the gain on the sale of P&amp;O Cruises' Artemis. When you do that, our cruise costs per lower berth day excluding fuel and in local currency were down 4.5% versus the prior year. However, because of the timing of certain expenses, the best measure of cruise costs are on an annual basis, which I'll touch on in a moment.</p>
          <p>The strength of our revenue and cost performance in the first quarter 2010 was clearly masked by rising fuel prices. Fuel prices this quarter were 80% higher than last year and that cost us an additional $176 million or $0.22 per share. However as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce fuel consumption, I'm happy to report that our fuel consumption per ALBD declined 3.1% in the first quarter, continuing our multiple year savings trend.</p>
          <p>Turning to our 2010 outlook. I'll skip the net revenue yields as Howard will discuss that shortly. On the cost side, net cruise costs per available lower berth day for the full year again excluding fuel and in local currency are projected to be down two to 3%. The decline is driven by the gain on the sale of P&amp;O Cruises' Artemis, lower dry-dock costs and tight cost control. Based on the current spot price for the fuel, the fuel price for the full year is projected to be $507 per metric ton for 2010 versus $363 per metric ton for 2009, costing an additional $483 million or $0.60 per share. So in the end fuel is driving our costs up and therefore in current dollars an including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 3.5 to 4.5%.</p>
          <p>At this point I will turn the call over to Howard.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. As we indicated in the press release, as a result of the continuing strength of the booking pattern during wave season, we have been able to increase revenue yield guidance on the local currency basis for 2010 to a two to 3% range from a flat to 1% increase from our previous guidance. Current dollar revenue yields are so forecasted to increase in the two to 3% range as a result of the weakening sterling and euro currencies.</p>
          <p>During the last nine-week period on a fleetwide basis bookings for the next three quarters are up 8% with pricing for these bookings running 17% higher on a year-over-year basis. Breaking this down by markets, North American brand bookings are higher by 7% with pricing up 26% on these bookings. And European brand bookings are higher by 10% with local currency pricing up by 6%.</p>
          <p>As we indicated during the last quarter call, our cumulative level of bookings had essentially caught up with historical booking levels, and during the late fall we started to selectively raise pricing. During the wave season we have been able to more broadly increase pricing and still achieve booking volumes consistent with our capacity increase for the remainder of 2010. North American brands which have a 3% increase in capacity over the next nine months, pricing on bookings for this last nine-week period has been higher for all itineraries with particular pricing strength in Europe and long and exotic cruises. As a result of the reduced capacity in the Alaska market, Alaska pricing is showing some improvement but is still will behind pricing we achieved in prior years. The current strength in the booking pattern for all itineraries is a very positive development for our seasonally strong third quarter.</p>
          <p>All North American brands with the exception of Seabourn are forecasting increased yields for the year with more significant yield increases forecasted for our premium brands. However I should remind you that the premium brands took the biggest pricing hits last year, so it's not surprising to see the stronger comeback. Seabourn, our six star luxury brand which has a 57% increase in capacity is forecasting lower yields for the year, so given the attractiveness of Seabourn's pricing in the market it's a good time for all of you out there who are listening to book a luxury Seabourn cruise.</p>
          <p>For our European brands, our capacity is up 11% over the remaining three quarters. Pricing for bookings during the last nine-week period is higher for virtually all itineraries with pricing for European cruises which makes up the majority of European brand itineraries running nicely higher year-over-year. With the exception of costs to N. AIDA which have a significant capacity increases, the remaining European brands are forecasting flat pricing in 2010. Pricing for costs to N. AIDA is expected to be slightly lower for the year but given the continuing softness in European economies, this is not a surprising result. Indeed most of the pricing erosion for the Continental European brand will be in the first half of the year with costs to N. Ibero being particularly impacted by a challenging winter season in the Brazil market that &#x2013; which is what David pointed out, which had a significant increase in capacity in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite the continuing softness in Spain's economy, our Spanish cruise company, Ibero Cruises has begun to show improvement with stable revenue yield forecasted for the remainder of the year and that's with the 31% increase in capacity. Although the Spanish market continues to be a challenge we believe this is a market has great potential and once the economy recovers Ibero will be a very profitable business for us.</p>
          <p>To provide some perspective on our European business it's important to remember that the decline in European revenue yields in the 2009 year was far less than what we experienced for our North American brands, something in the neighborhood of down 6% for Europe versus down 13% in North America. So looking at our yield performance over the two-year period, our European brand revenue yields have held up far better than the North American brands, and the European brands have had more capacity, far more capacity during this period.</p>
          <p>On a fleet-wide basis since our previous guidance last December we have raised constant dollar revenue forecasts by approximately $170 million for 2010. We are also forecasting net costs and expenses including interest and other items will be lower by approximately 120 &#x2013; $112 million. Offsetting these positive variances from our December guidance is increased forecasted cost for fuel for the year of $117 million and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar which amounts to about $85 million. The net result of all these changes from our previous December guidance is a positive swing of $80 million, so we are increasing our December guidance by $0.10 a share to $2.25 to $2.35 for the year or a midpoint of $2.30.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you some color on each of the quarters for the remainder of 2010. For the second quarter on an overall basis our fleet-wide capacity is up 8.3%, 4% for our North American brands, 13% for our European brands. At this juncture flee- wide occupancies are about level with last year, slightly higher in North America and slightly lower in Europe, which given the 13% capacity increase in European brands is well within our expectations. We have experienced continued pricing strength in second quarter bookings done during the last nine weeks and as a result we are now forecasting local currency yield increases in the range of one to 2%.</p>
          <p>With respect to our North American brands for the second quarter, Caribbean itineraries represent 57% of capacity and long and exotic cruises 26% with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing for North American brands is slightly higher than a year ago and continues to improve, but of course there is still &#x2013; there is very little inventory left to sell. We expect second quarter North American revenue yields to be higher by approximately 2%.</p>
          <p>European brands' capacity is 57% in Europe and 35% in long and exotic cruises with the balance in other itineraries. At the present time local currency pricing for European brands is slightly lower than last year's levels. Similar to North American brands, there is a very little inventory left to sell. European itinerary pricing and occupancies are slightly lower than last year, and we are forecasting local currency European yields also to be slightly lower for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As I previously mentioned for the second quarter fleet-wide currency &#x2013; local currency revenue yields are forecasted to be up one to 2% and on a current dollar basis 2.5 to 3.5% versus last year. However fuel costs are expected to be higher by $176 million versus last year or approximately $0.22 a share. Based on these factors we are guiding to a 0.26 to $0.30 earnings per share range for the second quarter versus $0.33 year ago second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the very important, seasonally important third quarter. On a fleet-wide basis capacity for the third quarter is up 6.2%, 3.7% of that is for our North American companies and 8% for our European companies. Fleet-wide occupancies in the third quarter are nicely higher, more significantly higher for North American brands but also higher for our European brands despite the 8% capacity increase. North American brand capacity in the third quarter is 40% Caribbean, 25% in Alaska which is down from last year and 16% in Europe which is also down from last year.</p>
          <p>Currently pricing and occupancy are higher for virtually all itineraries with solid pricing improvements in Europe for North American brand European programs and more modest pricing improvement for the Alaska programs. While we are seeing pricing improvement in Alaska because of the reduced capacity, Alaska cruise/tour business is down again from last year and continues to be a challenge for us. Pricing for Caribbean and all other programs is higher and booking momentum over the last nine weeks had been strong. Because of the strong booking environment and currently higher year-over-year occupancies, we have been able to raise ticket pricing and are now forecasting significant increases in the North American brand yields in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>As you know our forecasted yield guidance includes both ticket prices and onboard and other revenues. But because of the wide dispersion of forecasted pricing in the two revenue streams for our North American brands in the third quarter, I will provide guidance estimates for our each revenue stream. Our forecasted ticket revenue yield for the North American brands is now expected to increase in the low double digits level in the third quarter, reflecting the stronger than expected comeback from last year's deeply discounted prices. And our onboard and other pricing is currently forecasted at flat on a year-over-year basis. Combining the two revenue streams, we are forecasting revenue yield improvement in the high single digit levels for the third quarter. And this is for North American now I'm talking about.</p>
          <p>European brands which are substantially in European itineraries in the third quarter, currently on a combined basis European brand pricing is slightly lower than a year ago, but the pricing gap continues to close as booking demand remains strong. Based on the current booking pattern we are forecasting flattish to perhaps slightly lower local currency revenue yields for our European brands for the third quarter. As previously said, this is an entirely satisfactory result given the capacity increase in our European brands combined with the sluggish European economies. On a fleet-wide basis for the third quarter combining North America, Europe and our Asia-Pacific brands we are now forecasting a local currency revenue yield increase in the mid-single digit levels for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the fourth quarter. On a fleet-wide basis capacity for the fourth quarter is up 6% &#x2013; 6.1%, 1.7% of that is for North American brands and 10.6% for European brands. The fourth quarter booking picture is encouraging, but it's still early in the booking cycle so I caution not to read too much into the early picture that I will provide you. For North American brands we are 50% in Caribbean itineraries, 28% in long and exotic cruises with the balance in various other itineraries. Pricing is higher in virtually all fourth quarter itineraries, but with currently lower occupancies. However, fourth quarter booking demand is strengthening at significantly higher pricing and the occupancy gap has closed over the last nine weeks.</p>
          <p>For European brands there's 73% in Europe, the balance in various other itineraries. European itinerary occupancies and local currency pricing are higher year-over-year and booking demand for European brands is holding steady at pricing well above last year. While it's still early to have a more precise picture for fleet-wide fourth quarter pricing, we are forecasting that local revenue yield will be nicely higher in fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And with that summary of the outlook, I will turn it back to the operator for questions from everyone. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys; excuse me. Good morning. Hey, David, just a quick housekeeping, when you had talked about the 19 million settlement and the impact it had on your onboard yields, can you just combine that and just let us know what the impact was on your overall yields, just if you combine ticket and onboard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for the first quarter it was probably 0.75%. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were &#x2013; we would have &#x2013; instead of being 2.3 it would have been 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then David, you talked about costs and the benefit that you got in the quarter, some of it had to do with timing. I was just wondering if you could just walk us through in more detail what exactly that meant. And then I'm just wondering with costs what you didn't know when you gave the guidance in December versus what you ended up knowing today, or as you reported the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think more broadly in December we talked about costs being down one to 2%. Now the cost guidance is down two to 3%. So we've increased the reduction by a full percentage point. About half of that has to do with the gain on the sale of the P&amp;O Artemis, and really the other half has a lot to do with the fact that we perhaps underestimated the favorable impact of all the actions that we had taken to reduce costs. When you go through and you try to plan out some of the fuel consumption savings or what we've done with the port negotiations or the impact of e-ticket documents and a whole bunch of other things, I think when you get into the detail you find that some of our operating companies just simply underestimated the favorable impact and we're now actually starting to see that flow through. So we were able to increase the cost guidance reduction by an additional 0.5% over and above the gain on the sale of the ship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felicia, I think &#x2013; this is Howard. I think broadly speaking our operating executives will tend to hold back on reducing cost in their forecasts and budgets until they actually achieve them because they don't want to come back to us with a negative surprise, especially in the cost area. So this tends to be on balance a tendency to perhaps overestimate cost, not by a whole lot but by some amount but it all adds up if you added up all the companies because they want to &#x2013; they'd rather be safe than sorry at the end of the day. So there is that tendency and I think this is a track record we've had for a few years now with these guys. It's okay, we're okay with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is okay. Thank you, I just wanted to understand that. And then just on finally Micky, in Alaska there's been some press, the governor seems to be getting more I guess positive in terms of helping rectify the situation there with the head tax. Obviously it's probably a long road politically. I was wondering if you could make some comments, but more specifically if something were to happen this year say and with the capacity that you have there, is there any way that we should think about the potential cost savings that you could get from the ships that are already there, if there were some kind of legislation change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all we were clearly encouraged by the fact that the governor devoted time to come down here and learn a little bit about the industry. I think it's the first time I've ever met a governor from Alaska, and so we viewed that as a &#x2013; as clearly very positive. The meetings went very well. I think we came away learning some political realities in Alaska and I think he came away with a better understanding of our industry. So I think all of that is positive. If what he is proposing passes the session it's going too late for this summer to affect pricing. My guess is, although we haven't really discussed it, is we would get the money back to the passengers through onboard credits which hopefully would have some minor impact on our onboard revenue for the Alaska season. But then of course it will affect pricing for 2011. So if his proposal passes it's a great first step in turning the situation around in Alaska and very encouraging.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line Janet Brashear from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As I understand it you were saying that there's net revenue yield pressure on your European results for very good reasons with capacity growth through Q2 and Q3 and then you're going positive perhaps in Q4. Is that correct? And if so do you see that positive trend continuing given the capacity has largely been absorbed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Janet, I think broadly speaking we're saying it's flattish to slightly down in each of the quarters. Fourth quarter is still early to tell but it probably will be in the same range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Similar to what we had in the first quarter ex-Brazil, I mean we had down one ex-Brazil and we only have Brazil in the first quarter. There is no Brazil in the following quarters. So it's pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are you seeing any signs of a turnaround in Spain? And given the strength we're seeing in the UK in the hotel side, are you seeing that same strength in the UK in the cruise side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've added capacity, we've added another ship into the Spanish market in &#x2013; for beginning this spring and we're pleased that it seems to be, everything seems to be booking okay, we're &#x2013; and that we're hopeful that we will have flattish yields for the remainder of the year including a 31% capacity increase from this additional ship. That's for Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've seen it &#x2013; we're seeing a turnaround in Spain. I think the reason why Spain has stabilized is you have to remember that we only took full control of the operation a year ago last March which was clearly too late to affect last year. Up until that time, the operation was totally in control of Orizonia in Spain. We believe that the team that we put together in Spain now are doing a much better job and have stabilized the situation. We also believe that once the economy turns in Spain, that new management team is going to be able to take advantage of it and we're going to do very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the UK market, I think we've been very pleased with P&amp;O and Cunard's performance, despite a very weak economy in the UK I think a large measure &#x2013; a lot of that business comes from a demographic that's not as much affected by the economic cycles and unemployment issues and so forth. And even in the UK unemployment is not at the same levels as they are in the U.S., they're somewhere in the mid-7% I think. So basically business is holding up quite nicely in the UK. We are adding the P&amp;O Azura, which arrives in April, starts to sail in April. And at the end of the year, I think in sometime September, we have the Queen Elizabeth that's added to the Cunard fleet. So we've got a lot of new capacity coming in, but overall I think we're quite pleased with what we're seeing in the UK.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I could just ask one more quick clarifying question, you said that your higher priced brands were having a stronger comeback as might be expected and only Seabourn was forecasting lower yields. Could you just explain a little bit why Seabourn isn't following that pattern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to understand that Seabourn -- first of all it's our highest priced product. And second of all for two decades Seabourn capacity was only 600 beds. And by this summer the capacity will go from 600 beds to 1,500 beds. And for a brand that has been that small for that long, it's going to take some time for them to absorb that capacity. Unlike our premium brands that have very little capacity that they have taken on this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had a couple questions. One is a follow-up to Felicia's question on the Alaska head tax, given that for instance Holland America, the Carnival Spirit, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, everyone has suspended 2011 itineraries. Would you expect some sort of action by the legislature in Alaska over the near term, and Micky, I'm sure you may have an answer to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would I &#x2013; the question is would I expect some action? I &#x2013; all I can tell you....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very quick action.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the session I believe has only four or five weeks more to run. So if there isn't action in the next four or five weeks, there won't be action this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I can say is that the governor has made a proposal and whether that passes or not, I have no idea. I would think based on what has happened the understanding that the governor now has on the way the industry operates and the impact, the huge impact, the negative impact it's had on Alaska, that there's a, I think a likelihood and this is a guess on my part, that it will pass. But I don't know. I obviously don't know the sentiment of the legislature. I do know that the governor is the fully supportive of the bill he has introduced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but I think that the gesture by all the major cruise brands and the two public companies is significant enough to help push the legislature along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure what you're referring to. The only thing that we have agreed to do is to drop our lawsuit in exchange for this legislation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's also no pricing available for 2011 Alaska cruises, the itinerary may be subject to modification and the number of ships that might be operate there, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I can't speak for all our competitors but our itineraries are in place for 2011. We explained to the governor that would be impossible for us to make any changes at this time and he understood that. When this initiative passed, the backers of the initiative, one have no skin in the game and two, have little understanding of our industry. And so after one year when nothing happened they claimed victory. And the reality is that for something to happen it takes time, it takes lead time. And now they're feeling, years later they are now feeling the full impact of the initiative. It will take a similar if not longer amount of time to recover. And there are a number of ways to recover and it's not just additional capacity, but also as Howard pointed out our cruise tour business which is what, from an economic point of view is the best business for Alaska because it's into the interior, it's on the motor coaches, it's on the railcars, it's into the hotels in Alaska, that business has been really very, very highly impacted. And to get those jobs back and to get that economic engine going again, it's not just beds but it's cruise tours that have to be sold and marketed. And we need to work together with Alaska to do that. And I think as I said, this is a good first step to head in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it seems that even with the 33% reduction that was being proposed at this point and given that Alaska is about 20% of your capacity in Q3, that just purely doing the math would help you by about 2% in yield in Q3 and probably help EPS by about $0.10 a year in 2011. Is that roughly...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all in our numbers and in our forecast as well. I would point out that the guarantee items are not necessarily one-time items. This is a reconciliation that goes on every year. The reason why it falls into our first quarter, and because it really relates to the prior year is because all of our agreements are calendar, which means the reconciliations are done in January. And normally, in a normal year or a good year the number is too small to even footnote. But because we had down onboard revenues, the number grew much higher and that &#x2013; therefore had to be footnoted. But it is a reconciliation on every year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, nice numbers. Can you talk about the behavior of the two premium brands, since they serve different demographics, is Princess behaving differently than Holland in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really Rick. They both have made a very strong comeback. I mean you are right that they do have a slightly different demographic, but both brands seem to have made very strong comebacks. The number &#x2013; the comeback numbers are very close to each other actually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that's good news. And then can you comment on fuel efficiency assumptions for the full year? A 3.1% saving in the first quarter, but you've got initiatives that I imagine are rolling out as you dry-dock ships, et cetera. So what's &#x2013; is there a progression to that number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we did our original December guidance we had talked about 1.5% for the year. And so we had indicated at that time that that was a conservative number. And we really are still probably have a conservative number within the balance of the year at this point.</p>
          <p>We're still working with the operating companies to try to take every dollar out of their fuel consumption but we could see a little bit more than we're currently forecasting.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions. One, can you just talk about selling and building more ships? Sort of what are you seeing on the asset sale front. Is there more to look forward to? And how do you view that? And then on the building side, just it sounds like the shipyards are clamoring for more business and what are you seeing on the pricing side of that?  And then just, Howard, on second, third and fourth quarter what percentage of volume is booked right now or some measure of that if you could give us that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll let Micky go on. I'll let Micky talk about the ship situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, as you know, we've been talking about this Princess deal for a very long time, and actually we've been working on it for almost two years. Because of the financial crisis, because of the fluctuation, huge fluctuations in steel and component parts as well as dealing in a prototype and negotiating based on getting the kinds of returns we require in a very tough yield environment, it has taken two years to do this deal and it's not done yet. I mean we're very hopeful that the final contracts will be signed by April, but we're still working on it. And because of that, and because we don't have another deal right behind it, or we put all our focus on finalizing this Princess deal, it's going to take awhile before you see anything else. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't do another deal this year. Although it's possible, particularly for a sister, but for a prototype it's going to take the kind of time that it took to do this Princess deal. So I don't expect anything very quickly after the Princess deal is finalized hopefully in April. As far as the competitive landscape, we understand that there is some move in now as you're right, the prices are more attractive and some of our competitors are looking at potential projects, but like I said we have nothing. Beyond the Princess deal, we have nothing that's hot right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Steve, as far as the future quarter bookings are concerned, we don't give out the detailed numbers by quarter, but we've always said that historically at the time of the conference call typically the next quarter, which in this case is second quarter, is 85 to 95% booked, the following quarter for the third quarter would be historically 55 to 75% booked and for the fourth quarter historically 30 to 50% booked. So that's what we have said historically and this year falls within those ranges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other point I'd like to make about ship build, and I thought a little bit, is that yes prices are down from where they were 18 months ago or two years ago but these are obviously very, very big capital expenditures. They are for a long-term assets and if the price is down 10 or 15% from where they were two years ago, that is not going to entice us to build the ship we wouldn't have otherwise built. Clearly we'd be happier with lower rather than higher but we're not going to build ships we don't need.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Micky, to be clear you still think that you're underpenetrated, especially in a lot of markets, and at some point you do have to add that capacity in order to stimulate that demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and we've said that two or three ships going forward beyond '12/'13 is probably a reasonable estimate to model from. But some years maybe one ship less and some years maybe one ship more. But overall we think two or three over the long term is probably the right number for us.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. David, just a little bit more of a housekeeping item. Could elaborate a little bit on the costs that you said from a more timing perspective? And then the litigation and tax gains that you recognized in the first quarter, was that baked into your initial guidance in December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far the litigation was concerned, we knew about that early in December so that was baked in. But when it comes to the tax gains that was not baked in, but remember there were also some ship incidences and other things that we weren't aware of in December. So some of these other extraneous items netted out as far as the guidance was concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And as far as the cost items, in the first quarter we really &#x2013; the timing of the some of the expenses is always very difficult by quarter, particularly on the SG&amp;A side. So we did see some timing and some of our operating companies pushing out some of the things that they had originally forecasted to be spent in the first quarter, which is why we saw a 4.5% reduction in the first quarter versus what I was talking about two to 3% for the balance of the year. The timing of the expenses is very tricky. You're talking about $6 billion of net cruise costs. Trying to project all that into the perfect timing by quarter does get difficult at times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very fair. Very fair. And then finally on the E.U. side, any colors you can give us? I mean historically the onboard spend in the E.U. is trailed out of North America but you guys have been working on that for several years and have narrowed that. But just any color to how the current state of trends are going onboard in the E.U. versus the U.S.? And just, I guess, the mix of the E.U. of the ticket versus the onboard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our European brands are still currently below our North American brands. Basically, broadly speaking, the Europeans drink more and gamble less than the North Americans. But overall on balance they are spending a bit less onboard, and that's been pretty consistent the last &#x2013; as far back as I can remember and it still remains the same.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Jeff Hans actually speaking on behalf of Greg. A question on fuel. I guess with some encouraging signs in the industry and your business and oil prices moving above 80, just want to understand you're thinking about potentially reimplementing the surcharge at this point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we put out a statement a while ago that basically we're standing by. We reserve the right to reinstate the save the fuel charge, surcharge, but at this point we have no present intention to do that. We'll continue to monitor the situation, review it, but we have no present intention to reinstate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just any update you can give at all on booking windows? Have you seen that extend further out versus where you were back in December?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're being very patient in terms of making sure that we yield manage appropriately to get the price. We could always extend the window but it may not necessarily be the right thing to do. And so we're being patient and looking for the price increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean clearly when I talked about the fourth quarter where our occupancies are down year-over-year, that's pretty much on purpose. I think the feeling is in North America I think the feeling of our yield managers in North America is that there's enough momentum in the booking pattern right now to close that occupancy gap and to maintain pricing, which is what they're focused on doing. So really it is now &#x2013; everybody's focused on pricing as opposed to volumes. It's fair to say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Micky, you said before on some of the previous calls that you thought it would take longer in this downturn to get the yield deduction back. And based on what you've seen this calendar year would you stick to that or do you think you could cover the yield drop within the sort of normal historical two-year timeframe?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I confess, Jamie, I made that statement. This is Howard. I think that at the time of the financial crisis I was a little bit &#x2013; I just think it's going to take awhile to get it back. But I think we've been surprised, to be honest with you. I don't want to be overly optimistic here, but I think we're surprised at the strength of pricing that has come back this year. I don't think we &#x2013; obviously we &#x2013; when we forecasted it we didn't expect this to come back this dramatically. It has come back. Whether we can sustain this kind of levels as we increase pricing, whether we can sustain the booking volumes is the next question. I don't think we're going to know that for a while, but clearly that's the focus of our revenue managers. And &#x2013; but it does look like it is coming back a lot faster in North America. Europe never tailed off all that much and it looks to be flat to down slightly this year, so we're kind of pleased with what we see in Europe, and that's with all that additional capacity. So combining the two, yeah I think it is better than we originally thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, just to re-emphasize, we offer the best vacation value or holiday value in leisure. And because of that we should have a lot of upside in the yield and hopefully one day we're going to get it. But the reality is the value relationship is strong or stronger than ever, and therefore the opportunity for higher pricing is there and the opportunity for great vacation values for the consumer is there now and they should be taking advantage of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just the other question, on the permission and transport costs which were down about 3% despite ticket prices revenues rather being up 6%, that can't all be airfare. So I mean what is happening to commission levels? And is this part of the changes you've made to your search engine policy example in somehow increasing the direct sales elements in your mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll comment on the air/sea mix, it was down considerably. It was down 25%. So in the first quarter of last year 16% of people purchased air from us whereas 12% of people purchased air from us in the first quarter of this year, and that is a material difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it was primarily that. I think there's a misunderstanding on this whole search engine thing. There was nothing in that policy change that would affect direct business. The reality was the only thing we were trying to accomplish was to stop competition in places like Google for our trademarks. The reality is all of us were competing with our distribution system for our own trademark and pushing the cost up. And all we wanted was to bring the cost down to buy our trademarks, and we succeeded in doing that. That's all it was about. It is ridiculous to have to pay a premium to find Carnival or Princess in Google because six or seven other guys want to buy Carnival or Princess in Google. And so all we did...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We own the name and we don't want to pay a premium and compete with other people to buy our own name. That was all it was about. And I think it was misunderstood by a lot of people and there was a lot of media follow-up with agents who never bought our name. I mean only five, six, seven agents have ever bought our name. And yet we had agents complaining about it who really didn't understand what we did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, I think the great majority of agents had no problem with it because they thought it was leveling the playing field which we were trying to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, because they couldn't compete with the five or six agents who could afford to buy our name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the vast majority of agents found that they were on a level playing field with those five or six agents. So &#x2013; and all it did was lower our search cost significantly. We're very pleased with the outcome.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. Just wanted to get some clarification on your onboard revenue guidance, and I understand there were different items in Q1, but your full year guidance saying that you expect it to remain flat, it seems like historically as ticket prices have moved up nicely that that higher paying customer also spends more onboard. And I guess I'm just wondering if your guidance for flat, if you're just being conservative or if it's that there's a greater mix of, I know you've talked about in the past about the European brands not having as high an onboard spend. Is it that mix impact that's keeping it flat offsetting what you would expect to be an increase from higher paying customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in part it might be that. But I mean I think there just -- this is the first year or 15 months where we've had flat for awhile. So I think our -- the operating companies that forecast their onboard revenue I think have a tendency not to get overly aggressive in that area, because it's one thing that -- it's hard to predict. We have a good ability to predict ticket pricing because we get -- we have bookings way in advance of recording the revenue. But the onboard of course is at the moment, and it's hard to know. In theory what you're saying should be true. I mean I think once a -- once the ticket prices go up or you're getting a slightly different customer buying that that -- or they're feeling better about spending money, you'd expect to see some increase in onboard revenues. But to be honest with you we haven't put that into the estimates, into the forecast right now. And if it happens, all the better.</p>
          <p>There's also some changes in the dynamics of onboard revenue. People are spending money differently, we've -- there's less -- there's a challenge in the casino areas because casinos have become so popular on land and that sort of thing. So -- and we're constantly looking for new ways to increase onboard revenues and we've had some good successes. But where it all comes out at the end of the day, we'll know. We'll have a better sense of that I think as we get through the year, Robin in terms of whether onboards are now starting to pick up. But you're right, for the year we just focused more or less flat. I mean it's slightly up, slightly down depending on which brand you're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think you make a good point, and sometimes it's forgotten that as we grow our European brands faster than our North American brands, there's a number of factors including what you described as the mix factor for onboard. There's also the seasonality. The European business has higher seasonality and therefore our earnings will by the nature of that growth be lower in the out quarters and higher in the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Ian Rennardson, Banc of America. Back in December I think you said the oil -- the increase in fuel costs would cost you about $0.46 but that foreign exchange would be an $0.08 benefit, so your net cost of fuel and oil was going to be $0.38. And I calculate now you're looking at the cost being about $0.70, that being $0.60 on the oil and a $0.10 hit on foreign exchange. Is that correct and therefore you've got a $0.32 swing in your guidance based on the new FX and the new oil assumptions?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; good morning. Most of my questions have been answered but I'm curious on the rate at which you've held the costs down and particularly the selling and admin expenses, and I guess I'm just curious as we go forward and we're looking at a rebounding environment, is there an element of cost to that rebound? Are we going to see some of these line items grow at a faster pace in an absolute dollar sense going forward or I guess a rate of growth perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hard to tell. Obviously if you look the overall adverting environment in a normal year you may say, well, they spent less on adverting so they're mortgaging the future. But the reality is we're probably getting more for our advertising dollar this first quarter than we have in the past. Because there's no question, one, our search costs have come down dramatically based on the discussion we had earlier; advertising costs for magazines, as you know, magazine industry is really struggling and so we're buying advertising more efficiently than we probably ever bought before. And so the costs can go down and the effectiveness can go up, which is unusual. And whether &#x2013; how long that will continue to stay you'd have to be an analyst for the advertising industry to really predict that. But right now it seems to be the trend that we can buy eyeballs cheaper than we were able to buy them before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing is and &#x2013; it's hard for us to predict what inflation will be. And at the moment you know the numbers as well as I; there's really no inflation broadly speaking out there today. But going forward, we've been talking for a while about our various operating companies working together and getting tremendous cost opportunities, whether it be things like negotiating port charges collectively or shore excursions collectively. There's a lot of things we are working on. So to the extent that there is inflation, we expect to be able to offset some or all of it with these cost opportunities as we continue to attack these projects collectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe phrasing it a different way, given what might be a structural shift in fuel costs over the last five years, do you think as the yields rebound and we're looking at something better three years from now, is there a structural impediment to getting EBITDA margin north of 30% again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll be more of a yield revenue situation than it would be a cost situation. I think we manage the cost side of it very well. The revenue part is something that just, it's just hard to know three years down the road. But clearly if we &#x2013; if our revenues continue to go up, you could get back to close to historical levels, sure. No, I don't see any reason why not.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Two quick questions from me. Firstly, just with regards to what you've experienced in Brazil during the first quarter are you likely to therefore alter your deployment plans for next year and on the back of that? And then the second question is just when you tend to look at the performance of your European brands, clearly you don't have sort of premium brand in Europe per se in the same way you do in the U.S. But within your European brands whether it's more expensive cappings or itineraries are you seeing similar consumer behavior in Europe when it comes to recovery in the more higher price segment?</p>

So I don't &#x2013; and while there are high priced cabins in those &#x2013; in the categories, I really couldn't answer the question of whether the &#x2013; how well, how strongly they're selling.
