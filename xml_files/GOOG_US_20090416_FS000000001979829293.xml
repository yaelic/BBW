          <p>Good day and welcome everyone to the Google, Inc. conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn you the call over to Ms. Krista Bessinger, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google's first quarter 2009 earnings follow-up conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer, and Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management.</p>
          <p>I will quickly cover a few housekeeping items and then we'll open the call immediately to your questions, so if you could please limit yourself to one question and one follow-on. Also please note that this call is being webcast from our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our website for important information including our earnings press release and related slide deck, and a replay of this call will be available on our website in a few hours. Please note that we routinely post important information or our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. We encourage you to make use of that resource.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, the purpose of this follow-up call is to give participants the opportunity to ask more detailed financial and product questions in an efficient Reg. FD compliant manner.</p>
          <p>And now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, and these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.</p>
          <p>Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as EPS, net income, operating margin, and operating income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.</p>
          <p>So with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Heath Terry from FBR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. I was just wondering; as we look at the operating expense lines, we obviously saw pretty big declines in R&amp;D and sales and marketing, and we know from the head count number in those areas that there wasn't as much of a decline. Can you talk to us about how you're getting those kind of cost savings without using head count as a reduction? And then just from the increase that we saw in G&amp;A, is there anything outside of the charges related to the change in the stock-based compensation that's driving that up this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer that question. Overall, what you have seen &#x2013; as we mentioned on the prior call, the biggest change from quarter to quarter if you wish in the trajectory of our costs, as we mentioned on the prior call, was this issue of the bonus accrual in Q4 which was higher than we had originally planned because our results were better. And now we're resetting the plan as what is a typical plan for the year, so we're starting again fresh. And those bonus accruals which are tied to labor flow into different categories that do include R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>It's also fair to say that across many of our categories of costs, we've continued to be quite diligent about our trajectories, and we see them &#x2013; that also is a part of our results in a number of categories. So we continue to be prudent and that is essentially the biggest element that would have flowed through the Q4 to Q1 expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just for the follow-up side of that, is it fair to say that looking at that delta and the bonus accrual is a reasonable expectation of what your plans are for the level business needs to be at for outperformance to happen and us to see the same thing that we saw in the fourth quarter last year for the necessary bonus accrual catch-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understand the question. If your question is will &#x2013; like we have now reset our plan at let's say that it's 100%, right, whatever 100% is. And so now we're running this year with the expectation of 100%, and we hope to beat that in terms because you always hope to beat your plan, but that's what we're running with right now. And if between now and the end of the year, we see a big ramp up in our performance, as we see that, we will take appropriate accruals at that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, that was my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Jim Friedland from Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on Google Apps that was indicated early in the last call as a key area for investment. And at this point in the evolution, is the investment more on new features or are you starting to do more in terms of building up an enterprise sales force? And are you seeing additional enterprise wins, especially in this environment, on the cost savings and can you name any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, this is Jonathan. We had some pretty large deployments this quarter. Avago, which I think is the semiconductor division of HP, deployed the Apps suite to several thousand, maybe 5 or 6,000 users. We had some progress in one of the big Mexican states of Mexico too, which we launched in early Q1. We also had quite a bit of progress on the .edu side with I think 60 colleges and universities that we signed deals with. Some of them I believe were Cornell and Georgetown. I know we signed other significant deals with T-Mobile, FUJISOFT, Euromaster, which I think is a subsidiary of Michelin. So I think there's significant progress there.</p>
          <p>The kind of functionality that we're working on are some of the big holes that I think we still had in the suite. Offline support was probably one of the more significant pieces as was better synching with mobile devices. We're seeing pretty strong demand and traction in organizations in the three to 15,000 size range. We're getting a lot of help with the reseller program that we launched.</p>
          <p>And I think your observation about what is the state in a cost challenging environment; I think we are seeing that we've got a number of customers who are using the paid Apps version. I think we're signing on more customers because of the cost savings relative to competitors. There's a big Forrester study that showed that we're a fraction of the price of the competition, even relative to their cloud based offering, so I think we're doing pretty well. There's one category, manufacturing is a spinoff and spinoffs of the large companies seem to make a lot of sense, particularly when a company is building new infrastructure and we've got some examples. I think the Avago example is one of those, and I know there are more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there particular industries where Apps are being better adopted at this point versus others where maybe it's a little more complex and harder to get into?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I could establish any correlation in terms of the categories of industry. I think it's more a function of how the users and the IT departments are set up. Certainly the educational institutions have made relatively quick and robust progress as have companies that I mentioned that have spun out and are out to start from scratch and build and don't have the legacy dynamics that established companies do. But I think that's really the only broad observation that I could make. I think it's more of a function of the size of the enterprise than it is the industry. So it's a few to several or 10, even 15,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we'll go to the next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Steve Weinstein from Pacific Crest Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much. I was trying to understand, you had almost a full quarter still benefit from the DoubleClick acquisition. And so when I look at your US business where you're reporting basically 3% growth, without DoubleClick, was the business in the US basically flat year over year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have those details, so I won't answer it. It is true that we have &#x2013; so if you think of the coming quarters, DoubleClick will be like we're finishing the first year of DoubleClick. So what I can say which is a factual statement is we had &#x2013; in Q1 we're finishing the first full year of recognizing revenues for DoubleClick, but now DoubleClick is integrated in all the Display business, so in Q2 you'll see the effect of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So as a follow-up then, maybe you can clarify one more thing on the G&amp;A expenses. If we back out basically the 46 million in expenses you recognize one time, is that a fair run rate to work on right now?  I guess I'm missing something about how the bonus accrual is going to change throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I mentioned is that the bonus accrual that we took in Q4, that did not get moved into Q1 because we reset it much more than it offset these additional expense pressures that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Richard Fetyko from Merriman and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Guys, if you were to compare the Mobile and the Display initiatives and if you include YouTube within the Display, which one do you expect to be a bigger opportunity the next two to three years?  And then to follow up on that, could you elaborate more on the Display ad strategy?  You have the Ad Exchange. You have also the AdSense for display or for content that you're integrating display into. Just give us a little more color on what sort of strategy or products you're emphasizing within that display initiative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm not &#x2013; basically I mean broadly the story and the strategy is to address the issues and the challenges around the way Display ads are bought and sold. And we do fundamentally believe that those are going to change quite dramatically over the coming years. We're trying to bring much more measurability, the kind of efficiency that we had with Search advertising to Display and make it much more efficient for both advertisers and publishers to offer better ads for users. So it's basically building the largest scale network that we can that's going to give the best ROI to advertisers on the one side and the best yield to publishers on the other.</p>
          <p>So if we get full integration of DoubleClick and Google products, we're going to have the combination of this big leading platform for advertisers to create and manage the most effective campaign, and publishers to on the other side manage and monetize their inventory. So I think it's the combination of being able to do both of those things we expect will be very, very powerful. It's hard for me to handicap whether or not the scope of overall revenue on the Display side or the Mobile side will be bigger. We're obviously very, very excited about both &#x2013; making strong progress in both. So I don't have a sense of what the size of those industries would look like in two or three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide some color, Patrick, on the reasons for the sequential decline in other costs of revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hold on just for a second. I'll just take a look at my notes here. A gain in other cost of revenue, if I just go through my notes, they are still tied mostly to payroll issues rather than equipment issues or machine utilization. And so that's basically it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, you're saying more related to the bonus accrual than to depreciation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to George Askew from Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, George Askew at Stifel Nicolaus. I'm going to address this bonus issue one more time. I'm just trying to get a sense of the size of the bonus accrual in the first quarter. If you look at it as a percentage of sales for example in the first quarter '09 compared to the year-ago quarter, first quarter '08, was it materially different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the answer to that question. But I think the gain in general terms, I think that if you think of your modeling, I think looking at run rates from a year ago may be useful to get a sense of magnitude versus Q4 because Q4, as I said, was sufficiently different that actually it does make a difference between Q4 and Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then secondly as a follow-up, there are media reports hitting us late this afternoon here that YouTube is partnering to stream full-length movies, TV shows, et cetera, a redesign happening there. What can you tell us about this kind of news on YouTube and the redesign that appears to be imminent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan. Certainly what we're hearing from both viewers and advertisers is that they want premium content and the premium viewing experience. And we want YouTube to be as comprehensive as Search there, and we want to attract as much professional quality content as we can and advertisers as we can of all sizes and types. I believe there's a conference or some additional details on the Sony issues coming out directly from the folks at YouTube, so you might want to take a look and watch for that. They should have all of the details about the Sony relationship details and dynamics from San Bruno.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you; okay, fair enough. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one quick financial goals question, in past historic years, I think there was a goal, and I know it was stated at Investor Days in the past, to simply expand pro forma operating income sequentially as long as possible. Is that still a goal within the company? That happened this quarter, but is the way that as you think about the financial goals is just to expand that sequentially going forward, that non-GAAP operating income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So two points, I wasn't there in the old days when whoever would have said that. But certainly under my rule, we don't give any guidance going forward on any of these dimensions. All I think it's important that people understand is we are demonstrating responsible management over our resources. You should consider as you think of your modeling the fact that we talked at length on the previous call that our revenues are seasonal. And you've just got to think of our expenses as much more of a fixed cost. They're not seasonal in a way, right, so our labor is not seasonal and our expenses aren't because we're still growing. So that's the mindset that you should apply to your modeling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Sameet Sinha from JMP Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, a couple of questions. If you can talk about the Networks business, understandably you have begun to take some initiatives over the last couple of quarters to clean it out. When can we start to see improvement in that business whenever you end these initiatives? And then I have a housekeeping follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess could you clarify exactly? Are you asking about AdSense for Search?  What exactly are you asking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The Google Networks business, I'm just looking at that, trying to open it up over here. It was down sequentially a little bigger than it was down last quarter. So I'm talking about that you had some &#x2013; are you getting rid of some arbitrage, players, things like that? When are those activities &#x2013; when do you think that ends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, some of that relates to partner issues. Some of it is the network cleanup. I think that to date, the cleanup has been largely successful, but it's kind of an ongoing cat and mouse game, just like e-mail spam. So I don't think I would necessarily want to suggest that the cleanup issue has been fixed. I think we did start engaging pretty aggressively in those efforts last year, and we've made great progress.</p>
          <p>I think the other piece that you may see is there are probably some FX issues and other partners that we have that are built in there that are seeing the same kind of economic issues that we have, as well as having to understand which partners are in the overall mix, which is a factor. We don't give you the full list of those dynamics.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Sure, and just as a follow-up, can you talk about the correct share count you use?  I mean you repriced some options. Would these become dilutive any time during the year?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You had repriced some options, some underwater options. Do they become part of the diluted share base now that they are in the money, because they were priced at in my sense at 306?</p>

          <p>Just to complement Jonathan on the &#x2013; to come back to the issue of the Network, I mean there is a difference between obviously AdSense for Search and AdSense for Content. And clearly two types of businesses with two different rationales if you think of the behavior. And the Content side obviously branding oriented display campaigns, as I mentioned a bit earlier. So on that side obviously remaining challenging in Q1 because those advertisers typically will shift to more relative to their performance based advertising if they have a chance and tighter budgets, so really a tale of two cities between the AdSense for Search and the AdSense for Content, just to complement Jonathan.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, so just to reiterate on the BPF, so our understanding is that a number of agencies were still getting a fair amount of money, somewhere between 6 and 7% back, as of Q4; and starting January 1, that went down to zero. So you're saying that the year-on-year decline of 9% call it in the UK I guess was not materially impacted by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. For total revenue, we may have had one agency for whom it would have mattered for that agency; but in the total of our revenues, it wouldn't have been material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then a clarification. Why was DoubleClick revenues weaker this quarter? I think on the prior call, you talked about that, but you didn't provide the reasons why.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are two elements on it. One is seasonality because if you think of DoubleClick and Q4 as being a very strong quarter for the Display advertising related to the Christmas certainly in North America, which is a big element of the DoubleClick. And then second is the entire economic environment right now is putting a lot of pressure on that business. So it's a combination of these two things that really we're seeing in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was wondering if you guys could dig into some of the mobile data a little bit more. I guess what I'm seeking is in this vaunted example that you have in Japan, do you have RPF relative to what you're seeing in other markets in terms of increase?  I've listened to your mobile Web and ours where you've guided advertisers to bid maybe 4X what they're bidding on the PC simply because there are fewer chances to be shown. I guess is there any quantification whatsoever that you can provide around how monetization is ultimately different on the Mobile relative to the PC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really too early, it's too early to say. I think that we certainly see the promise, we think. I mean if you're asking specifically about Japan or are you asking...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I'm trying to ultimately do is quantify. I thought Eric's comment was really interesting that you guys are now what was it, 8% mobile browsing share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I said that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or you said it, somebody said it, which is really the first time I've seen this data out of you guys. So again, I'm trying to quantify what this opportunity could ultimately mean. And if monetization all of a sudden becomes even more intriguing and interesting in a mobile context relative to a PC one, then people might get more excited.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I personally think Mobile is going to be very significant. I talked in my prepared remarks about how powerful the phones are and the degree to which search traffic is up over five times in the last couple of years. It is the case that I think nearly 80% of our mobile search queries come from outside the US. So a lot of the lessons that we're still learning at this point are lessons that we're learning from markets like Japan, to some extent China and India.</p>
          <p>But I think the thing you really have to look at is if we've got 100, 175 million smart phones shipping in 2009, and they all have this much, much different, very rich mobile browsing experience, you're basically talking about something that didn't exist on phones a couple of years ago. They didn't have the processing power. They didn't have the battery life. They didn't have the rich display. They didn't have an impact mechanism that worked well. We didn't have the kind of fast networks that we have today.</p>
          <p>And we're now seeing many developers understand that the web is this wonderful platform for these mobile apps, and they can be fast. They can be location aware. They can offer a rich experience and even work offline. And that I think is fundamentally going to change the whole value equation with these devices. And you're going to see that users are much more likely in my opinion in the long run to consummate a transaction against an ad that they were served on a mobile phone because they're probably clicking on that ad or interested in that ad because they're out somewhere and ready to go consummate a transaction.</p>
          <p>So I think there are lots of reasons to think about where the business is going and where these phones are going, which make us very excited. There's not a great deal of data yet on what the pace of revenue growth will be there other than what we're seeing in Japan, which is very promising.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow up on the mobile side. You guys have an investment in Clearwire. Obviously there are broad based concerns there. Would you guys ante up further if they needed additional cash? Is there any plan around that investment?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing I would actually urge you to think about when you look at some of these other markets like Japan is that in some of these markets, there are many users who only access the web through their mobile devices; and that makes the dynamic very, very different. And of course Japan is far ahead in terms of mobile consumption than other markets, so it's an interesting market to look at in terms of where I think the trends are going to be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I apologize if you already addressed this, but one of the things I see really interesting on YouTube is the quantity of searches, and it's becoming one of the leading search engines out there, and I think you've rolled out some new ads. What are the click-through rates on some of those videos advertisements that are showing up in sponsored search results? Are you happy with that, and do you see that as maybe one of the bigger opportunities on YouTube? And if not, what is really working right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're still in the experimental stage on a lot of this. I mean there's no doubt from a traffic perspective, the whole YouTube phenomenon continues. We're definitely hitting on an ongoing basis new playback and upload highs. We're basically at this point looking at multiple different ad formats. We're certainly monetizing hundreds of millions of videos in the US every month, which is more than the total of US monthly views on any other online video site.</p>
          <p>We don't give you the specifics in terms of click-through rates, but we've got a whole bunch of new form and new content. We just launched in-stream ads on long form content. So if you take a &#x2013; if you do a query on YouTube for 'Star Trek Charlie X', which is one of the episodes, you'll see an example of some of the new ads that we have there. Omid mentioned the home page format ad that we have which we're very, very happy with the results on, which basically is a masthead that goes across the top. I think today it's Crank 2, and yesterday it was Volvo. And we've also got the promoted videos which we launched last quarter which are doing pretty well. But I can't give you any more details on the click-through rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you tell us how the engine is doing as far as profitability?  Any thoughts on margins, are they getting better or worse?  And then just to follow up on DoubleClick, are all those revenues going in the Licensing line, and did Display help your overall growth rate, the 6%? Was Display something that grew faster than that and helped the overall growth rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the Display side it does go, right, through the Licensing line, so it does. And then you can back out if it does make our &#x2013; DoubleClick, sorry. Yes, DoubleClick does go through that line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we can back that out and see how it's affecting the overall growth rate?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the large reduction in traffic acquisition cost. This was due to mix shift or is it that you're rolling off expensive deals?  What I'm interested in is how sustainable is that trend. And then if you could just mention &#x2013; I don't know if it's public or not, just how long you've got to run on the current AOL and Ask deals, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the short answer is it is mix. And we obviously don't comment on any deals that we have in our pipeline. I think it's also &#x2013; if you look at our Q4 '08 versus Q1 '09, our Google TAC versus Google total revenue on the Google side, it has gone up slightly. And that's &#x2013; if you think of the mix within the category and then there's mix between categories, and on the Google side obviously, it reflects the growth in our revenue from toolbars and browser distribution agreements. So that's how I'd think about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, a couple questions, and I guess broadly two different questions. But if you adjust for FX and you look at your CPCs, they look like they were still up or flattish on a year-on-year basis when adjusting for FX, but not as much as the <mark type="inaudible" />. I guess can you talk about conversion rate coming off and I guess in particular which regions are you seeing more pronounced changes in CPC or conversion rates out there that could fluctuate the overall CPC trend?</p>
          <p>And then second, I guess it looks like the UK obviously fell pretty quickly in terms of revenue constant currency and then came back. The US seems like a more of a steady decline but holding its own, and rest of the world is a mixed bag. I guess can you characterize where do you think we are in the rest of world camp in general in terms of going through this recession and seeing that impact in some of your regions?  Is it probably early stages, similar to the US trend, or does it look like it will pace similar to the UK?  Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Jonathan. We don't really break out the components of the RPM equation, so I'm not sure I'm going to give you a whole lot of color here. You can't derive price directly from paid clicks growth in the total amount of information that we give you. I think I did say on the call that some of what we're seeing on CPC is mix issues. It's particularly mix issues from the smaller emerging markets. It's certainly an FX component. It's certainly the lower dollar items and the issue of conversions being relatively lower than they had in the past, and as Eric mentioned the auction working and advertisers lowering their bid. So I think that those are components. We certainly had seen a lot of CPC growth in the quarters before the economy collapsed, but I can't give you any more detail than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess in some of the nascent regions that are still ramping, if you open up more distribution or more coverage, are you seeing bid prices improve like you saw over the course of the last couple years here or in some of the more mature markets or is it a different dynamic in some of these emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we're seeing there is different because a lot of those markets are at the more nascent stages of the growth rate. So if you map them against what we saw in the US or the UK, which was actually the leading market, and said they're N years behind us, many of them are on growth trajectories that are strong, but obviously they're being &#x2013; just as we were a few years ago. But obviously that's being dampened by the economic dynamics just like things are here. And of course, you also have the FX effects there, too.</p>

          <p>Hey guys, one high level question and one or two accounting questions. To follow up on the pharma ads issue earlier, it looks like the FDA may actually require all these pharma advertisers to add all the disclosures to their ad creatives. Is that a fairly easy task for Google to increase the available character lengths on those particular ads, or is that going to be a little bit more challenging given the complicated technology?</p>

          <p>I'm not sure what we're actually going to do there. I'm not convinced that we won't be able to come to some agreement in terms of what the right solution is with respect to some of these issues. Certainly it wouldn't be ideal if we had to modify the user interface to accommodate substantially more information. Can it be done, yes. Is it easy, maybe not.</p>

          <p>I believe there are some things that have been shut off, but I don't know all of the details about what subset of the activity there has been shut off. Some of them are I think attempting to change relative to the new standard which they need to try to address. It's not really as big a deal I think as folks are making it. I know that I said that health was a vertical that was doing particularly well and pharma is important, but it's really a pretty small segment of the whole vertical.</p>

          <p>Okay, that's good color. And then Patrick, if we can just get a little more clarification on the accounting around the hedging program going forward; so the way it was explained before was an 18-month rolling forward of these contracts. So why did we see the one-time boost in the first quarter? Are we to expect more of that or is it &#x2013; how do we think about the accounting around the hedging program?</p>

          <p>The fundamental issue that you have is it's not one time. It just happens that as every quarter, we set up another tranche of hedges, some for the immediate short term that we don't have covered yet to cover it more, and all the way to 18-months out. Think of it as you're building the equivalent of a ladder every quarter, filling the pipeline as every quarter retires.</p>
          <p>And so in Q3 of '08, we happened to &#x2013; that's when we actually put originally the first set of town hedges that were built over a couple of quarters and that now will have a full 18-month ladder built over the coming quarter. So we'll just be rolling that entire set of hedges every quarter going forward. But in Q3, we put in a bunch of them for the next quarter and the next quarter and at decreasing rates &#x2013; not rates, but exposure levels all the way down to 18 months. And it happened that the ones we put in Q3 because of where the pound went gave us a substantial gain for Q1. I mean next quarter we'll have more hedges that will come to fruition and we'll have to decide what to do with the options that we got. So it's not a one-time item.</p>
          <p>The real item that happened is the one that we had put in in September because of the wild fluctuation and variability of the pound over the last couple months, we just happened to gain a lot. Had we had, I'll give the extreme other case where assume that the pound had gone nowhere. It had been very stable through the entire period, right, we would have spent the money and we would have had no benefits because there's nothing to capture because there's no volatility. So it really was driven the last six months.</p>
          <p>And in a way I really feel for the investment community and the analysts trying to run these models.  I really do feel for everybody because you have such high volatility in the last nine months and because of that is compounded by the FAS 133 that says if you're in or you're out, you've got to book it all or not the minute that you get a decent amount of volatility. It just swings the numbers all over the place. So what we have to think about from our perspective is we continue to have a very stable hedging program in place. It continues to deliver us the value when there's high volatility, which is what happened. And we because of the forced mark-to-market, you have a decent amount of numbers floating around, but you shouldn't worry about that too much.</p>

          <p>Okay, that's helpful, and then one last question, I promise the last one, on the bonus accrual issue. So a couple years ago, Google used to accrue for bonuses with a progressive growth manner. So 1Q, the accrual was the lowest and it ramped up throughout the year, and 4Q was the highest. And then in 2Q '07 you went to a more of a flat quarterly accrual program. Are we now back to the progressive?  How do we think about just take $100 and spread it out over the course of four quarters. Is that going to be 25, 25, 25, 25, or does it start at 10 and then go up higher on the bonus accrual issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We tried to &#x2013; if you think about it, we tried to &#x2013; when you start the year, you have a plan in place and that plan you accrue according to what you think the year is going to unfold and that's all we do. And then as the year unfolds, we would if we had more information to raise the accrual, we'd do so. So that's how we planned the year. That's why the number has gone down relative to Q4 because I mean if there's a good proof of how uncertain and uncharted territory we live in, look at Q4 and our results for Q4 and the economic activity that was really &#x2013; in all of the turmoil that was happening, we had a very strong revenue quarter in Q4. And that created a bonus accrual that if you had thought even September or August, we hadn't foreseen. So we're really happy with the results and therefore happy to take the accrual and celebrate with all the Googlers. And now we're back to our regular territory of here's the year and here's the plan and away we go. I mean it's not that &#x2013; that's why variability because the world is very uncertain and we're living through it right now, all of us together.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal from Collins Stewart.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Jonathan, one question is we are seeing a little bit higher traction for search engine optimization. And the question to you is does that &#x2013; how does that basically &#x2013; does that mean the ecosystem of paid search is expanding or does this mean there's some potential track to a paid search campaign?  And then I have one follow-up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm not sure what is the perceived threat that you're articulating as a result of search engine optimizers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I'm running a Google AdWords campaign, and then I'm also running search engine optimization there instead of Google receiving the money I'm running more of a highly search engine and maybe optimizing my website, landing pages, et cetera, in that case am I likely to cut my paid search budget and I locate some money for search engine optimization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I honestly don't have any idea. You're basically saying is there going to be a shift in AdWords spending on SEOs, and I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one question, Patrick, is on the sales team side, just one thing. I think I mentioned this happened too quickly. I know Omid tried to address some of those things in the previous call you hosted, but is there any other way to in terms of if there are &#x2013; if this is a &#x2013; should we expect some more changes in the sales structure, sales channel, or anything else of that sort?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no plans right now. I think that the work that was done by the team was very well done. And that's why &#x2013; as you can imagine, for any organization, the last thing you want is an announcement every two weeks of changes. It just drives everybody nuts. And so we had an opportunity in the sales group to do the things that we announced. And so we did announce them a few weeks ago. And right now, we have no more plans. I mean it's obvious that the world continues to be quite uncertain, right, so in that kind of world, you've got to stay flexible, but right now we have no other plans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandeep, I'm just thinking about your original question a little bit, and I think the one comment that I could offer is I don't tend to think of these advertisers that we have as having fixed budgets. And I think it's unlikely that someone who is running an AdWords campaign where they're measuring the ROI on an incremental basis is experiencing positive ROI from each incremental AdWords click. It seems unlikely that they would throttle that back if they're making positive gross margin on each of the AdWords clicks. So what you're proposing seems unlikely to me, but plausible.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Bolan from Sturdivant &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I wanted to touch back on that question or the idea that Eric brought up with the ROIs moving more into Google's favor. As we look at the moving parts in there, we just look at clicks and searches, costs, and conversions. With the market pretty much moving cost lower, isn't that going to be the major factor or what is driving the ROIs up anything more than just the costs coming down as advertisers moving out of space?  And is there anything that will, other than keeping the costs low, allow for advertisers to actually really stage up and spike into the market to push ROIs higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think really the main thing that drives ROI is to the degree to which we're able to develop better ads and ad systems that target more efficiently and are more &#x2013; deliver an ad such that if the user clicks on it, they're more likely to consummate a transaction, I think the conversion rate is probably the most significant component, and that's a function of the targeting of the ad and the creative on the ad, also some of the tools that we offer with respect to optimizing the user's website, which are Analytics and the Website Optimizer, things that allow the advertiser to get higher conversion rates on their site. I think that's basically the kind of things we're going to do that will continue to improve ROI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You talked about the optimizer there. About what percent of customers are using the optimizer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that we've said. You'd have to talk to customers directly yourself. There is a blog post if you type 'conversion optimizer' onto Google, it describes some of the details of the study that we ran with a bunch of advertisers from which I got the percentage improvement in different pieces, but we don't release that number. A pretty large portion of our advertisers are using some of the various &#x2013; some subset of the various tools that I mentioned, the Website Optimizer, the keyword piece, the Conversion Optimizer, and Google Analytics.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our final question from Robert Haley from Gabelli.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I wanted to just ask one question on your paid click growth, and if you could talk about what's driving that growth, whether it's growth in the number of advertisers using Google, or maybe talk about paid click growth on a per advertiser basis and how that's impacted by changes in budgets allocated to Google versus changes in consumer click-through behavior.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make just a broad statement and then let Jonathan complement if you wish. There is &#x2013; I mean our traffic continues to grow. So if you think of general principles of what's going in our favor, our traffic continues to grow and we continue to have paid clicks through our network. There are different effects within that which obviously at the macro level if you're in a mature market like the US versus an emerging market like India, you get mix issues. You get vertical issues, and you get value issues and that's basically how we think about it and manage it. So I don't know if, Jonathan, you have additional information you want to share or if I missed something big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Patrick got the biggest thing. Clearly growth is the primary driver there. And beyond that, I don't think we really go into detail on the other components of the equation. I don't think that there's significant activity with advertisers withdrawing themselves from a budgeting perspective altogether.</p>
          <p>I would echo what Omid said there that to the extent that we are impacted by budget reductions, it tends to be the larger organizations where a CFO, somebody in Patrick's role basically says we want to cut budgets N% across the company, and that impacts the CMO. That's much less a factor in the small and medium businesses. And interestingly it's less a factor even in some very large companies that really understand the concept that Omid mentioned about Google being a sales channel as opposed to a marketing expense. And I would take to heart the comments about the auto industry where I think you're otherwise seeing a relative shrinkage in overall marketing budgets and yet some robust growth in paid search and online advertising. So I think there is still value. I think we're seeing a lot of value in terms of shift in markets like that one from a budget perspective.</p>
          <p>By the way, the one other obvious area there is I don't think you're seeing much budget reduction at all in the pure play online companies who really understand and measure the metrics of a lot of this traffic. I think they're much less budget &#x2013; they're much less prone to adjusting their budgets.</p>
