          <p>Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance followed by the Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance. Anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chandra.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kedar. I am very happy to talk to all of you to report our Q2 results this quarter. Once again, we've had a quarter of exceptional performance across the board. And this is the sixth straight quarter where our incremental revenues are in excess of $100 million.</p>
          <p>To start with, we had a very good volume growth, 6.25% on a sequential basis. Our international revenues grew by 9% on a sequential basis and the overall revenues grew by 7.7% on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>Barring India, all our markets delivered very good sequential growth. Importantly North America grew by 8.8%, U.K. grew by 10.3% and Continental Europe grew by 9.3% and Asia Pacific grew by 9.8% and Middle East and Africa grew by 9.3%, so all our key markets delivered very good results. India had a decline and our Latin America was pretty muted.</p>
          <p>From an industry point of view, except the telecom, all our industries delivered excellent growth. Particularly financial services grew 8.6% sequentially, which was very good, compared to telecom, which is a negative 1.7% all the other verticals, retail grew by 12.2%, manufacturing 10.3%, travel 10.3%, energy 20% and hi-tech and life sciences also grew upwards of 9%. So it has been a well rounded growth with volumes coming across sectors and only from a market point of view, India, and from a sector point of view, telecom, had a negative growth.</p>
          <p>Then from a deal signing point of view, it has been a very, very good quarter. We signed at least 10 deals which are in the range of $100 million or more. And these deals came from major markets, North America contributing five and Europe and U.K. contributing four and one deal coming from Latin America. And with respect to the sectors, two each came from banking and financial services, insurance and telecom and one each came from the remaining sectors high-tech, retail, energy and utilities and pharma. And importantly, the two deals signed in the telecom are strategic customers, new customers who have a long-term potential. So I'm quite happy with the signings that we had in the telecom sector.</p>
          <p>Our customer metrics looks very good. We had an excellent migration of customers across all revenue bands. We added two new customers to the $100 million category and $50 million category improved by three more customers and $20 million category additional three more customers and $10 million category by seven customers more and also a significant addition in the $1 million and the $5 million categories.</p>
          <p>And in terms of pipeline, the pipeline looks very healthy. And I've been traveling significantly and met with a large number of customers over the last two months. And across sectors and across markets and so forth we have not heard any negative news from customers. Our pipeline is very robust. The deal signings are on track. We are not seeing any delays. And though the macro environment continues to be concerning, nervous on the ground, all we are hearing from customers are indicating to us that the outlook is quite positive at this point in time. In terms of the investments, there is a significant amount of effort going on across customers to drive efficiency through transformation of their application infrastructure and technology infrastructure as well as enterprise solutions infrastructure.</p>
          <p>From a discretionary spend point of view, there is a significant focus in preparing their corporations for the digital consumer, for real-time analytics and decision-making using big data technologies. And in terms of innovation for new products in the marketplace both in terms of time to market and the price of the products so that they can attract new customer segments. Also, Cloud, is an area where customers are very keen in order to expand their businesses to emerging market as they do not want to invest and build their own IT systems or transport systems from the major markets.</p>
          <p>These are all some of the areas where there are significant amounts of spending as well as discussions happening. And also for the financial services sector, the outlook is positive. And also there is a lot of effort going on in compliance-related initiatives as well.</p>
          <p>Those will be my opening comments and I'll pass on to Maha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. As mentioned already, our revenue of INR116.335 billion translates into a sequential growth of 7.7% and year-on-year growth of 25.3%. Cross currency movement slowed down the sequential revenue growth in dollar terms. Our revenue of $2.525 billion translates into a Q-on-Q growth of 4.7% and year-on-year growth of 26%.</p>
          <p>However, in constant currency, revenue growth was similar to last quarter. Constant currency revenue was $2.539 billion, that's a sequential growth of 5.2%. The breakup of our quarterly revenue growth in Indian rupee terms is as follows; volume growth plus 6.25%, exchange plus 2.49%, realization negative 95 basis points, effort mix negative 5 basis points, total 7.7%.</p>
          <p>Operational leverage from the strong top-line growth including the currency benefit helped us absorb the incremental cost of promotion on all the hiring in this quarter and expand our EBIT margin by over 0.9% to 27.1%. The impact of different levers on the operating margin are as follows; currency, plus 166 basis points, offshore shift plus four basis points, rate productivity impact 73 basis points minus, SG&amp;A efficiency provisioning for bad and doubtful debts 10 basis points plus, others minus 13 basis points totaling to an increase of 94 basis points.</p>
          <p>We had unprecedented currency volatility in this quarter against last quarter's average rate of INR44.70 against the dollar, the rupee appreciated in July to under INR44 and then swung a bit by approximately 14% to nearly INR50 in September.</p>
          <p>The resulting forex loss as well as reduced income on a smaller cash base ex-dividend impacted our other income this quarter. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% and net margin stood at 21%. Days outstanding for this quarter was 82 days, invested funds stood at INR94.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have seen good growth in these &#x2013; in those very segments, as articulated by Chandra, which we had <mark type="ph" /> concerned mostly (10:36) in this highly uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we continuously &#x2013; continue to closely monitor them for an early signs of stress. The extreme volatility in currency is a different matter that continues to remain a matter of concern. In the meantime, we continue to expand capacity to fulfill the demand we see in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>With that, we can now open it to questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have the first question from the line of Ankur Rudra from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one question on the remarkably slow momentum in ADM, is this a reflection of possibly and actively choosing to look for more transformational work or a reflection of the nature of deals in the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ankur, that's a good question, but actually if you look at it, it's better to take a view over a few quarters out and look at only one quarter; these variations will occur. But this quarter, if you really see we have done extremely well on infrastructure, assurance services and enterprise solutions. We are not consciously looking away from ADM deals. ADM is a very important area. We still feel there is a significant opportunity. It is just that this quarter I think we've had three or four other sectors, infrastructure, asset leveraged solutions, global consulting as well as BPO, everybody kicking in, so it looks a little lower. But I wouldn't read too much into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Just on the hiring side, maybe, clearly it's very impressive levels and maybe if you could comment on the training capacities given incrementally larger proportion of trainees will be used &#x2013; will use those facilities and where do we stand in terms of future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all Ankur, we are operating at very high utilization, 83.1%. We will continue to be operating at high levels. We will increase this a little bit more so that we will give ourselves room for building capacity. We are continuing to hire and will hire more.</p>
          <p>Now from a training capacity point of view, we have the infrastructure in place to be able to handle the kind of volume of associates we are taking. We have designated five locations in India as the key locations for doing the ILP trainings and we have created the associated infrastructure, both in terms of training classrooms and also the employee facilities etcetera. And as you know, we are building a new campus in Trivandrum, but that will take couple of years or more. And also we are investing significantly in terms of digital training and that's something that we are working on. It will take some time, but I think we will change the paradigm in due course, not in short-term but maybe I'm talking about couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just my last question on cash conversion if I can. Clearly, cash conversion has improved quite a bit, sequentially. However, if I notice the DSO and the unbilled days have continued to creep up a bit. Is there any internal benchmark that you keep track of that &#x2013; at, which level you are comfortable with and beyond which you won't be? And also, maybe if you can add color to what led to this rise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See as far as the DSO is concerned, and you know we report it in dollar terms now, and that has actually come down from 84 days to 82 days. So I think from a cash position there are of course &#x2013; the other question that is asked is on unbilled. Unbilled is a matter that happens towards the end of a quarter and so on. We are not unduly concerned with that for the simple reason that all of them are &#x2013; have been scrutinized extensively thoroughly and there is no issue as far as that is concerned. But if I were to take days outstanding in terms of receivable as well as UBR, it was 97 in this quarter as against 100 in the last quarter, so we have done quite a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Congrats on the quarter and best of luck for the remaining quarters. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Melissa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Edward Caso from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my call. Could you talk a little bit about your BFSI space, which continues to do well? What are you seeing? What areas in particular are those clients focused on? And I'm particularly curious as to the regulatory aspect, if you're starting to see some of that work. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, from a BFSI point of view, we see a lot of effort going on in efficiency still. They are called as transformation, sometimes called as reengineering initiatives by the financial institutions, whereby they are looking at systems which are globally efficient. For example, payment is a big area. Securities processing is a big area. So there are specific areas in which significant amount of investment is going on in helping the financial institutions to have efficient systems, both in terms of a single footprint, also in terms of some of the latest technologies coming in to make them real-time. So that's one area we are seeing.</p>
          <p>And then we are seeing a very good growth for our products for custody, for corporate actions, for payments, securities processing and also core banking. All these areas are getting a lot of traction across the board. And we are beginning to see infrastructure optimization deals in the financial institutions. Even though our infrastructure business has been growing significantly, we have done most of the transformation deals in the infrastructure space outside of the financial institutions, but we are seeing traction for those kind of deals as well. And in terms of compliance, there is a lot of discussion going forward on the spend towards compliance and we are working with few banks on compliance initiatives, but I think more to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the United Kingdom, the government cut back and put a lot of price pressure on all the providers a year or so ago, and could you give us an update on what that market is like, the UK Government market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, in the UK Government we are doing two or three very major engagements. I'm happy to report the prestigious engagement which is called the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:10) initiative that is a pensions initiative is on target and went operational last quarter. And the policies are already on the system and it's getting service and we are on track both in terms of revenues and margins. We have not had an impact. The contract has gone through the government scrutiny and I am happy to say that we are on track. There is no issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you and congratulation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Just a question for Chandra. Any feedback or feedback on any discussions you're having with clients regarding calendar year 2012 IT budgets and also maybe your views on when budgets will be finalized for next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have just recently met with the large number of the customers and while I can make comment about what I've heard, I would like to wait till the December quarter to confirm everything or sometime in November-December we can give you comments through informal interactions. But at this point in time, based on what I have heard, the budget cycle is going to be on target. There is not going to be any delays for most of the clients I have spoken to, they said they are going through their budget cycles as per plan. And there will be increases in budgets in some situations. There will be same budget in some other situations and I have not heard of significant reduction in budgets. And so at this point in time we look positive. We are expecting the budgets to get finalized by the end of the calendar year, but you know we just have to be watchful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's good news. And then --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are looking for any specific negative news that may come. We are scrutinizing any delays, any project cancellations or any drop in budgets or any shrinkage of revenue targets from our teams. We are looking at all of those things very carefully to see if there is a pattern and we will continue to watch --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have one last question. On recruiting, it looks like your recruiting plans on a 6 to 12 months basis, is the recruiting work proceeding as planned or is the pace of recruiting slowing a bit given the macro uncertainty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't hear your question. Are you asking if our pace of recruitment is slowing down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm asking looking at your recruiting plans, from a 6 to 12-month perspective going forward, is the ramp on the recruiting side proceeding as originally planned or is the case of recruiting slowing a bit given macro uncertainty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as our recruitment is concerned, we are on target; we announced 60,000 this year and we are sticking to that as far as this financial year is concerned. And for the next financial year we will do the planning when the time comes and then let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I wondered if I could just follow up on the 2012 question. I am wondering new discussions with your clients, is it too early to tell what 2012 is going to bring in? Maybe you could just put it in context with how your discussions this year has matched up with other years. I was wondering just if you could kind of give us a little color on that side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is too early to be giving you a very firm picture on 2012. But having said that, the recent meetings with customers and their outlook on IT spending, outlook on projects, on discretionary spend etcetera, I don't see any change in direction from customers. And I think that they are all working towards doing a normal cycle for their budgets. That's what I'm hearing. But we need to see as we go closer into November and end of November, early December will be the time to make &#x2013; to take a firm view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just following up on that is the tone the same across all your client base and maybe you could just talk about how this entering 2012 feels compared to what you might have experienced in past years maybe even 2009 just from a total spend perspective?</p>

          <p>Surprisingly, I would say that the mood across sectors, manufacturing, retail, financial services, the utility sectors all matches and they seem to be positive. And going into the year at this point in time definitely it is a lot better than the 2008-2009 timeframe. But having said that, every single day, if you read a newspaper or if you watch a TV you get very worried.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one last one, just you said it's better than 2008-2009 timeframe, is that because the type of spend is different? Is it more maintenance work versus discretionary I'm just trying to get a sense of why besides the fact that things were much worse back then, why you're feeling a little bit more comfortable outside of what the clients are telling you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one is the body language, because the customers their attitude is that we are not expecting a sudden recovery in the U.S. or Europe. We know that the recovery or the employment situation is going to take considerably long time. And they also are aware of this sovereign debt crisis. All the things that we worry about, we hear multiple different opinions about, according to them is no new data point, all these are data points that are known. So they are going about spending their money in two ways: definitely getting more and more efficient from their IT platform; and then they all want to grow so they are very careful in where they are spending, but they are spending. They are extremely careful. It's not that the CapEx is going to be just made available easily. There is a lot of scrutiny. But there is a method by which they are going about it, that's why I feel better.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mitali Ghosh from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Congratulations on the good volume growth in the quarter. Just wanted to understand that one often hears of customers wanting to squeeze their maintenance spend in order to fund the discretionary part of the spend; what does that imply in terms of realization for you and how are you really approaching that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mitali, I think that will always be there. Definitely, in some companies, there is an additional budget. In some companies, the budget may stay the same. So, they may try to change the mix of run versus change so that they can get more of the programs in; those discussions will have to be had. So, in those situations you have got to specifically work on all the levers that you have, are you offering a fixed price, are you offering more off-shore leverage or are you cutting down functionality or are you consolidating applications, are you rationalizing them, or can we do a maintenance contract with that transformation contract bundled? So, there are so many different scenarios and so many different options exercised by customers. So, I can't paint a broad-brush picture on that but we're very focused on our gross margins, I would say. And, it's very difficult to get price increase at this point, at least in the near term. So, we are extremely focused on margins and especially gross margins and we will continue to drive that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, overall, what should one expect from a realization trend point of view and just linked to that, Maha, in terms of the margin guidance for the year, any update on that in terms of where you think you can hold the margin given the rupee depreciation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first point, I think you should expect that the pricing will be stable or continue on normal course. There won't be any big jumps or big drops. And, there may be a marginal increase in a quarter. There may be a marginal &#x2013; a few basis &#x2013; few turns of basis points drop in another quarter so it'll more or less be stable. And, Maha?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; Mitali, as you know, we don't give any guidance. I have not given any guidance as far as the margin is concerned. But, certainly we've talked about an aspirational goal of 27% which we believe the cost structure certainly enables us to give that. And that we believe should be in a position to &#x2013; we should be able to reach that. Now, you see the &#x2013; as you know it's a factor of growth and of course reigning in of expenditure and cost controls and so on. Somewhere &#x2013; as I've always maintained around 46 or thereabout, we should be in a position to see this kind of margin. We do not see roadblock coming in the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, given that the rupee is today trading at above 46, so should one expect that you could do better than that level or would you be really looking to invest it back in the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think rupee is trading at 49. I think &#x2013; you said 46 but it is not. It's trading at 49.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I said above 46.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Above 46. You see the basic thing is, our investment strategies are driven regardless of the &#x2013; as we have always said, we continue to recruit. We believe there is a demand, and we can see the demand. There has not been any slackening of demand as we have given commentary so far, so that would continue to go on. So, I don't think I am going to &#x2013; we are going to invest especially just because we have an uptick from a currency perspective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And, just lastly if I can check with Ajoy in terms of the campus hiring, what are the kind of offers that you have made, and are salary levels being offered flat versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mitali, the salary levels are same as what we offered last year, and campus recruitment process is in full swing at this point in time. It will continue next quarter as well. So far, we have given 35,000 offers already for them to join us next fiscal.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of questions; I noticed for the last few quarters, the top 10 clients seemed to have slowed down in relation to the company average. This quarter in particular your top client and your top 2 to 5 clients have grown sub-2%. Is there anything that we should read into this? Is it because these clients are maturing and you'd expect that they will continue to grow slower than the rest of the company in the future as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:54) top clients or the top 5 clients, they are excellent clients with repeat business and they are &#x2013; absolute amount, they are growing. They are continuing to grow, continuing to present opportunities. But, beyond a size, they may not grow at the same average as the quarter. In one quarter they may be low, another quarter they may be same. But, in absolute amount they are growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got that. And, I noticed that in your earlier comment you said that price realizations were down about almost 2% this quarter. Even last quarter, I think, price realizations were a bit down and when I am trying to reconcile this with your commentary that pricing is stable, but we've actually seen two quarters of pricing realization dips, do you expect this to stabilize from current levels, or do you think that as your mix changes you could see this realization dip even though the absolute like-to-like pricing might continue to remain flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing per se has not dipped actually. Most of the things that you see is a combination of service mix and market mix, I think. Last quarter, we had a significant impact due to the market mix. And, this quarter to some extent it is the service mix, applications being lower and some of the applications doing more. So that's the primary reason there is no &#x2013; they're not losing any price on any of the deals and I wouldn't say that that should be a cause of concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just one last question and maybe I'll come for a follow-up after that. Your peer, Infosys which reported last week, talked about an evenly spread momentum &#x2013; revenue momentum through the year. Do you typically see a seasonality, with December being a little weak because of holiday seasons? Do you subscribe to the view this is likely to be an evenly paced out year or do you expect normal seasonality to prevail for your company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, from a TCS point of view, we had an excellent growth in Q1. Our volumes in Q1 and Q2 have been spectacular. On the back of a solid volume performance in Q1, once again we have delivered a 6.3% volume growth this quarter. And, the momentum is good. And, in the third quarter you always have the issues of Thanksgiving holidays, Christmas holidays, and the number of working days you have and Diwali holidays in India. So, all those factors play a role. And, customers &#x2013; going into December, the decision-making will probably slow down. So, you may not have ramp-ups suddenly happening in the month of December. So, those things always will present themselves. And, the other thing that happens in December is the manufacturing and the high-tech electronics companies will always have what we call is a furlough. There'll be shutdowns, one week, two weeks, especially high-tech companies and the manufacturing companies. This has become a norm over the last three, four years. So, from a Q3 point of view, I would say the holidays plus this will be an issue. But, apart from that, I think the momentum <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:13) is good. So, you should factor that from a TCS point of view. You should factor that in your &#x2013; when you make decisions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from RBS. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...all the growth has come from international. We have had a 5% revenue down in domestic business this quarter....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then our lifetime business has been pretty muted. So, if our revenues are 9% and our volume growth for the overall is 6.3%, it will be somewhere very close to the international revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, so, what is the reason in terms of the significant decline in fixed price revenue contribution in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the fixed price is always &#x2013; some projects get ended and some projects get started. You also have to see the fact that for the last year, year and a half, you have always had issues in large scale fixed price signings. We've not had large scale fixed price signings for some quarters. So, some of those projects are running &#x2013; are getting over. So, we will be signing new contracts. The pipeline is good. So, it should go up. We've always said that hold us to 48 or 49 or 50, the fixed rate portion will always oscillate between 40 to 50. That's the range we have given and we have, for a period of time, always been operating 47 to 49 and this quarter it has come down a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, with the closure of these fixed price projects may have some impact in the Q3 or already we have the new deals which would be sufficient to compensate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on how much you are projecting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, sir, just bookkeeping questions; it seems this quarter the short-term borrowings has gone up significantly. What is the reason for the same? And, if I'm not wrong, the invested cash seems down on a Q-on-Q basis from INR105 billion to almost like INR95 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As far as the short-term borrowing is concerned, this is more a question of management of funds. We wanted to make sure that the &#x2013; that we don't break deposits <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:03) the management area. And, as far as investments are concerned, we haven't seen any decline as far as this quarter is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, if I'm not wrong, last quarter was INR105 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, in the opening remarks you said INR95 billion despite we have a borrowing which has increased in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The main thing is that you'll have to take into account, the dividend that we have paid....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...as well as we had paid something like INR2,500 crores in terms of dividend during &#x2013; because there were two dividends, the final dividend from last year, which was done after the AGM, and then the second one was the first quarter interim dividend. And, on top of it, we had also paid for the acquisition of certain Diligenta shares and so on, so both of them put together have resulted in money outflow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, just one last question in terms of the OCI balances related to the forex item outstanding in the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, OCI we've got INR528 crores in OCI. And, as you know, it really depends on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:17) or to translate to the right kind of loss or profit or whatever it is.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q-on-Q movement, there has been a significant jump as far as the OCI is concerned, mainly because of a huge swing in volatility in currency basically.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Chandra, could you just talk about telecom, is it something particular to a particular client or is it something secular you are seeing? Why was it different this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, telecom has been not performing well for a long time, except the last quarter. For about four or five quarters, we have had issues, and last quarter we did well, and then this quarter again we've not done all that &#x2013; done well because there has not been a consistent performance from varying accounts in telecom for some time. But, as I said, I'm quite happy that we have signed actually three deals. One we announced towards the end of last quarter and two we announced this quarter; all three are really large strategic customers for us with a huge potential to grow. And, we are also pursuing some deals in the telecom sector. I am so glad that again the deal pipeline in telecom has picked up. So, I think we should do better from here but, hey, this has been a troubled sector for some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you talked about chasing 10 large deals. Can you just give a profile of where these deals are in the industry segments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Industry segment wise, they are pretty well-rounded, and we are chasing across all the industries, banking, insurance, retail, energy sector, pharma sector. So it's pretty distributed, and in terms of markets, they are predominantly in the North America and Europe, at least four-on-four and then the two deals are outside, well qualified, good deals are being pursued.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, you talked about not finding any signs of cutback or cancellation of projects, specific to Continental Europe what are you hearing? I mean is there any cause for concern there, any red flags you can potentially hear from that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See we have delivered almost a 10% growth this quarter on the back of double-digit growth in Continental Europe last quarter. So I think our pipeline in Continental Europe is good. Our incremental revenues are coming in. But again as you know from a macro point of view, it is one of the most troubled regions, so we just need to see what happens to Greece, what happens to the eurozone? What kind of decisions are being taken? What are the institutions that get affected? We just have to watch. So we are looking for any possible signs of negative deals, so that we can be prepared on the ground to tackle it.</p>

Where do you see the full year tax for FY '12 to go and what kind of CapEx you are expecting for FY'12 and FY'13, if you can throw some light that will be good? And, thirdly, on the utilization side, now your attrition has come down significantly and you have added a lot of capacity as freshers, so probably one quarter or maybe two quarters there could be some <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:30), but otherwise I expect it to go up, so am I right in my expectation or what?</p>

          <p>The first question on this tax rate, we are essentially somewhere at &#x2013; we're at 24% and that is more or less what we are going to have for this year. It becomes a little difficult to say exactly I have been talking about 23%, 24%, it depends on the extent of non-SEZ revenue that we have and all that kind of things. So I think it will be good to factor in about 24%.</p>
          <p>And next year, we will make the announcement later as to what the tax rate is going to be. But I have always maintained that around 25% it'll reach and thereafter come down. But whether it is going to be a little over 25% and so on, I'll make that announcement a little later. As far as the CapEx for '12, '13 is concerned, we have not arrived at it now and we are not making any announcement as yet. As far as utilization is concerned, Ajoy will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as utilization is concerned if you look at last four to six quarters, we have been operating at 82% to 84% in between, and we are quite confident of operating at this higher end of utilization, sustaining that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question essentially relates to if you look at the current demand structure given your feedback you will obviously have multiple margin tailwinds in terms of currency depreciation, as well as attrition is coming down and there does not seem to supply side pressure? So if you can please outline areas where you would like to reap the benefits on from &#x2013; that you get from these?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you also have to look at the kind of investments we are making. Even in this quarter, if you see, on the back of a huge intake last quarter, it's again a huge intake this quarter. Last quarter also we had a significant intake of trainees and all their salaries come for the full quarter this quarter. On top of that, we have taken a 20,000 plus this quarter. So I mean it's a huge employee expense. So that's the kind of investment that is needed in order to be ready for capturing the growth.</p>
          <p>And also, we will continue to investment more in intellectual property in our products, platforms and frameworks <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:08) we have been investing. We have a product business where we are continuing to increase investments, it's doing well. iON, our small and medium business platform, we will continue to invest. And we are looking at a couple of more platform plays, so we'll look at that. So there will be investments for which we'll need &#x2013; we'll need to be building margin cushion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And &#x2013; if I can have a follow up, in terms of utilization it's been obviously a couple of quarters where you guys have been operating at an industry high utilization level, in your client conversations does that come up as compared to your preparedness to service them vis-&#xE0;-vis your peers who are operating at a lower utilization level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see, I think the way to look at it is that it's 83.1% utilization. We have been delivering incredible volume growth. And that is not possible if you cannot service and execute. So we have demonstrated that at this utilization levels because of our size we can bring this size and scale to play and deliver to the requirements of our clients.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Europe side, I think we have delivered two continuous quarters of good growth and we have not seen any specific let-up at this point in time. On the SMB side, the platform is doing very well. A number of our &#x2013; over 250 customers have gone live and deal signings have cross 400. But it's taking time to make the customers operational because of the nature of the current setup they have. But I think the live customers is increasing every day and the rollouts are happening every day, I think we should pick up scale in the coming quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just to have couple of clarifications. Maha, the cross currency impact on the top line is 50 basis points, right, for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think &#x2013; yeah, it is 50 basis points, it is 4.7% and 5.2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Chandra, just a small thing on the realization you said it's because of the service mix. Is ADM billings usually more than enterprise solutions or the products et cetera? Because if I see only BPO has grown or IMS might expand a little bit, but still you have some services which are higher billing services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, see, there are &#x2013; Yogesh, I'm sorry I'm not able to give you a very straightforward answer; it's a little complex. Also the time and material billing has gone up and fixed price has come down. Some fixed price contracts typically have higher realization than time and material. So many factors are playing. It is not that assurance is lower pricing than ADM, so that's a wrong conclusion to make. So there are three or four factors playing in <mark type="ph" /> fixed price time and material, service next, then geography (50:27), all of them are playing and that is why you are seeing this volatility.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. My question is specific to the BFSI segment. As I gather from industry commentary that a lot of contracts are coming up for renewal in this particular vertical compared to what it was three years back. What I've been hearing is, usually in a year you get 5%, 6% of contracts coming up for renewal. This &#x2013; over the next one or two years, you'll have at least 25%, 30%. So given that BFSI is your largest vertical, how do you think you are placed to tackle this and will you be seeing a significant erosion in pricing in such a case?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you yourself pointed out, it is a sector in which we are very strong, so we think that we are well positioned if there is such contracts that are coming up, and I don't see a drop in pricing.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Just an extension of an earlier question about Europe, I mean, it's one of the most uncertain in terms &#x2013; and the kind of negative news flow we have from the region, but this is one of the most performing geography for us. What do we see the key factor driving this performance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very difficult to say. One is you can look at it in multiple different ways. You can look at it the way that our revenues currently are very, very small. You can look at it that way. The second way you can look at it is that companies are now more open to the kind of services that we are able to offer to make them more efficient. You can read it like that. And the third is that our presence in this markets and the sales for us have increased. I mean there are multiple different dimensions in which you can interpret, but the point is that the macro and corporate world there is a disconnect.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, so congrats on a very good set of numbers. Couple of things, one when you had mentioned earlier on the realization part that it was a mix of change in service mix and also your time and material intake, so specific to that, there has been a significant change in your time and material versus your fixed price contracts this particular quarter. So, is there anything particular that has happened this particular quarter because almost a 300 basis points is the difference that is showing on a sequential basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think nothing to read except that some of the large fixed price contracts we signed before are coming to an end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that has affected the portion of fixed price versus time and material. And, this also reflects that there was &#x2013; a few quarters back, there was a slack in the deal signings in fixed price contracts which are predominantly discretionary fund-related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think that's getting corrected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it should go back up. But, we've always said that you should be comfortable to see this number between 40% and 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So, in terms of the deal wins that we have signed this particular quarter, we are back on track in terms of deal wins on the fixed price contract. Have you seen that come back this particular quarter with the robust deal signings?</p>

          <p>No, some we have signed but I can't really tell you next quarter whether we'll be back at the same percentage as this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say that. But, it will slowly inch forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And, just one last &#x2013; just a color on FY '13, I know people have asked this before. But, just on a general understanding and since you're interacting with your clients, is there something that you would view definitely &#x2013; differently right now for the next year vis-&#xE0;-vis how you would be probably six months back because you are still going strong on hiring, but are you viewing FY '13 with a little bit more skepticism, particularly to Europe? Do you see some particular concern that might re-look at FY '13 numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, at this point in time based on what we have heard, we are creating the capacity for growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, even in this quarter we have signed four important deals in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think we have to go by data. We can't go by hunch and market sentiment. We have to go by data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we go by data, we have to prepare for growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And, the forex loss this particular quarter was how much exactly, sir, out of the other income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>INR91 crores</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>INR91 crores worth of forex loss, okay. And, we will continue maintaining our hedge position for the duration that we maintained or are we changing? Are we going more short of &#x2013; in terms of hedge positions or are we going to maintain it at the same level, considering...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the current time, we have got a set of hedges. We have a risk management Board meeting which happens regularly to keep reviewing it. And &#x2013; I can't comment on whether we'll continue to maintain it and so on but certainly our outlook at this moment is &#x2013; time is to look at short term, six months and then we can &#x2013; we will &#x2013; we are continuing with that. But, beyond that, I cannot say anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. Thanks a lot, sir, and all the best.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Chandra, may I request you to give some closing remarks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, all, for joining us for the Q2 earnings announcement. As I said, we are happy with the results that we have declared, particularly happy that we have been able to deliver the volume growth and the international revenue growth and from a sector point of view, happy to see BFSI and a number of verticals doing well, happy with the deal signing in telecom, and happy that the major markets including Europe have delivered; rather disappointed that the volatility of the Indian market continues, which we are paying attention to.</p>
          <p>And, our hiring is on track and going by &#x2013; even though there is a lot of macro nervousness and -about unemployment in the U.S. and about the crisis &#x2013; debts crisis in the Europe, going by the data points that we have, based on on-the-ground meetings with customers, we think there is a very good growth opportunity, and we will continue to prepare ourselves, while at the same time be very careful in listening to any signs that we can pick up. If we pick up any negative signs, we will be the first ones to come back to you and tell you there is something going on; otherwise, we will prepare for growth. And, thank you, all, for your support.</p>
