          <p>Welcome to today's Presentation of the BHP Billiton Interim Results for the period to December 31, 2008. My name is Marius Kloppers, Chief Executive Officer of BHP Billiton, I am talking to you today here from Sydney. Alex Vanselow, our CFO will be presenting from London. And to my left I have got Marcus Randolph, who is the Chief Executive for our Ferrous Materials Group.</p>
          <p>Before I begin today, I'd like to point you to the disclaimer and remind you that reading this disclaimer is important in relation to today's presentation.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start-off today by giving you a brief overview of our results, before handing over to Alex. And Alex will take us through the more detailed aspects of our financial performance. Then I'll give you some perspectives on the macroenvironment, and how this is impacting firstly the industry, and also how it's impacting on us. And then Alex and I will be very happy to take some questions.</p>
          <p>If we go to our highlights, let me as usual begin with safety. Over the period in question, we've maintained a good safety performance as measured by what we call our lagging indicators, most notably our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate. However, we still had four fatalities in the period that means four families left without loved ones, and it goes without saying that any fatality is an unacceptable outcome. We continue to be committed towards getting to zero harm and ensuring that a safety culture is embedded across the entire Group.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to results. There is no doubt that the last half year has been an interesting period, and a challenging period for our industry. The very solid result of which you will get a very clear view today during this presentation, demonstrates that our core strategy unchanged over the better part of a decade of being focused on Tier I assets and diversification across markets, geographies and so on, is a very sustainable one.</p>
          <p>Our underlying EBITDA was up 25% to US$13.9 billion. Underlying EBIT was up 24% to US$11.9 billion. Attributable profit for the year before exceptional items was US$6.1 billion, up 2%. And as I say that, I should stress that Alex is going to take us through foreign exchange that has had a major non-cash impact on the tax line, and we'll get some clarity on that.</p>
          <p>You will also recall that in our December quarterly production report, which we released on, I think the 21st of January, we announced a number of actions. And as a result, our attributable profit post exceptional items, Alex will talk about in more detail. But perhaps to reinforce at this early stage, we said that where demand conditions are weak and we've got assets that are either in a position where they can't sell their output, or where they are cash negative, and set to remain so for some time, we have and we will continue to take action.</p>
          <p>In particular today, I would like to point you to cash flow. Of course we've already noted that we are quite in a period of high volatility, with IFRS there is the lot of non-cash items in our income. And therefore, I'd like to point us particularly today at cash flow.</p>
          <p>Cash flow remains -- from this diversified portfolio remains extremely robust, increasing 74% to US$13.1 billion. More significantly than even this excellent result, and given today's market conditions our balance sheet continues to place us in an absolutely unique position in this industry. And the strength of our balance sheet is illustrated by a net gearing level of below 10% at this stage.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share was up 3% to US$1.101 per share before exceptionals, and importantly given our outlook on which we will talk a little bit more during the course of this presentation, which is uncertain in the short and medium term outlook, we have announced today that we are maintaining our dividend for this period at the same level as the last period, at US$0.41 per share. So that's a very &#x2013; a dividend decision consistent with our outlook.</p>
          <p>But I want to note that this is a very significant 41% increase on the comparable period last year. Obviously for those shareholders, which form a large portion of our shareholder base in London and in Australia, that have seen those currencies weaken against the US dollar, in their local domestic currencies that will be an even higher uplift.</p>
          <p>During the half year, we continued our successful track record on project execution. We, consistent with our commitment to invest throughout cycle, sanctioned four projects during the half year, a very major one in Western Australia in iron ore and thee in oil and gas.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize, that even in these changed conditions our strategy remains unchanged. We want to continue to invest in value adding growth in a prudent and disciplined manner. Perhaps the only change is that, to an even greater extent than before, we want to focus on Tier I assets and brownfield expansions principally in our backyard.</p>
          <p>In the short run, we also want to continue to maximize cash generation from our existing assets and later on in this presentation I will give you some more detail on our initiatives to do so.</p>
          <p>To emphasize up front, we are extremely strongly positioned at this point in the cycle, well differentiated from others in our sector. And on that note, perhaps let me to hand over to Alex to take you through the details of our financial results and then I'll say a few words again at the completion of that. Alex?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Marius and good morning to everyone from a very cold night in London. I'll cover a number of key areas, relating to our interim results. And I'll start with the topline financials, which Marius has just briefly touched on, and then move into some of the exceptional items. I will also give a brief overview of some of the actions we are taking to further strengthen our financial position.</p>
          <p>For the six months to 31 December 2008, we delivered a solid set of results under very challenging, and rapidly changing economic conditions. Both underlying EBITDA and EBIT increased, reflecting our strong performance from our diversified portfolio of low cost, long life and high quality assets.</p>
          <p>The key highlights are undoubtedly the strength of our balance sheet and our outstanding cash flow. Both of which placed us in a unique position in our industry. Net operating cash flow was a record of US$13.1 billion, resulting in a net gearing of just 9.5%. This was achieved through the consistent execution of our strategy, which has enabled us to continue to invest in value creating growth, in a prudent and disciplined manner, with at the same time delivering outstanding returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Marius will talk about our views on the market outlook a little later. But it is worth stressing a couple of points about the current market conditions. As the global economy continues to deteriorate, we are experiencing softening demand for all our products. Accordingly, we have taken a number of hard, but prudent actions with the focus on preserving and enhancing long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>These actions have included the Board's decisions not to proceed with the Rio Tinto offer, production adjustments in line with weaker demand, deferrals on which there are low priority projects, and the suspension of cash negative operations, as Marius referred to.</p>
          <p>These have been the appropriate actions taken at the right time and in the face of a swift and severe downturn in the market. Of course, we will continue to take further actions if necessary.</p>
          <p>We have always said that all our operations are continually under review and this remains the case. The accounting impact of these actions to date are reported under exceptional items and as a post tax exceptional loss of US$3.5 billion, which resulted in an attributable profit of US$2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>They include charges in relation to Ravensthorpe, Yabulu, Pinto Valley, project impairments and deferrals and increased remediation of the provision for the Newcastle steelworks and costs associated with the Rio Tinto offer. The extreme range of economic conditions that led to these decisions also materially impacted at an operating level and this is both positive and negative.</p>
          <p>As we can seen on the slide the changes to underlying EBIT for most CSGs were affected in a material way. Some example is the 500% in metallurgical coal, which was positive and on the other hand you have stainless steel materials at 200% negative.</p>
          <p>The results again highlight the strength and quality of the BHP Billiton portfolio with underlying EBIT margin for the period averaging 46%. Our Petroleum CSG delivered $2.7 billion underlying EBIT, an increase of 36%. This was driven by strong volume growth from a series of successful projects, but also stable operating cash cost and a higher realized price.</p>
          <p>However, EBIT for aluminium, base metals and stainless steel material CSGs, the LME CSGs were all down significantly. In these three CSGs, the unprecedented fall in aluminium prices alone decreased underlying EBIT by US$4 billion. And for the CSGs volume and cost efficiencies were impacted by great declines and production interruptions at Escondida, the furnace rebuild at the Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter and the mandatory reduction in power consumption in South African Aluminium smelters.</p>
          <p>Our steel making commodities contribute US$8.5 billion to underlying EBIT. We benefited from higher realized prices, record iron ore shipments and a favorable exchange rate. We have, however, been impacted by the weak steel market, especially in the last quarter of 2008, when we announced production adjustments both at Samancor and at Samarco. These weaker conditions will have a more pronounced impact in the second half of this financial year.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBIT for our Energy Coal business was up 287% and this was due to mainly to higher realized prices. Significant price volatility had a material and immediate effect in the revenue line. Input costs have also been volatile, but with a delayed impact on cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>In our last results presentation, I had a lot of debt costs, pressures in our industry had accelerated in the second half of 2008 financial year. This has continued into the fiscal year 2009. During this half cash cost increased by US$1.6 billion, compared to the corresponding period. About 13% of this increase is structural. The remaining 87% is either costs that were deliberately incurred to maximize production, one-off incidents, or costs that were caused by the heated market earlier in the half-year.</p>
          <p>Represented in the graph, we have $298 million in one-off costs relating to Queensland Coal flood recovery and the Kalgoorlie Nickel furnace rebuild. We also can see a 592 million of higher cost for fuel, energy and input material such as coke, pitch and explosives. The benefits of the falling input prices will have a lagged effect on reducing costs. And we are starting to see some signs of easing input material prices.</p>
          <p>In addition labor and contractor costs increased by $368 million. Contractor charges increased because of both higher rates and increased activity. In certain cases we delivered and incurred cost to increase production at times with higher prices. We expect this cost to decrease and to reflect the supply demand fundamentals, as well as lower usage rates.</p>
          <p>High economic volatility also had an extraordinary impact on financials below the EBIT line. The tax charge, excluding exceptional items, was US$5.1 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and royalty, our underlying effective tax rate was 30.6%. The foreign exchange impact was approximately US$1.2 billion, and most of this is a non-cash foreign exchange revaluation on our Australia deferred tax balances.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect our underlying effective tax rate, which is excluding royalty and foreign exchange, to be around 31 to 32%. Interest expense was in line with December 2007 half, and we achieved a lower average interest rate due to debt reduction and also to lower benchmark rates. Approximately US$2 billion of debt is due to mature over the next 18 months, most of this being at subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities.</p>
          <p>So we have a situation where we have very low gearing with debt maturity secured towards the medium to long-term and higher margins from a diversified portfolio. And this places BHP Billiton in a unique position to continue delivering shareholder value.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to show that our net operating cash flow, which is after the payment of interest and tax, was a record US$13.1 billion, which is up 74%. This is an excellent result given the current market conditions.</p>
          <p>We achieved this with a disciplined execution of our strategy, which has enabled us to continue investing through the cycle and growing our business organically. Capital expenditure for the half year was approximately US$6 billion.</p>
          <p>Our cash payment of $0.41 per share of dividend declared in August 2008 was about US$2.3 billion. As Marius mentioned earlier, we have maintained the dividend at US$0.41 per share, which is an outstanding achievement in the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>This is in line with our progressive dividend policy that seeks to maintain or increase the dividend in US dollar terms, which we readily assess based on our expectations of future market outlook and the investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>We are very well positioned, but also alert to the fast changing and uncertain economic environment. I just wanted to take a little bit of time now to try to give you some more clarity about the issues that will impact underlying business performance over the next six months.</p>
          <p>This slide provides a summary of the production adjustments we have announced so far in response to this impressive value deterioration in our markets.</p>
          <p>The indefinite suspension of the Ravensthorpe nickel operation and the cessation of mixed nickel cobalt hydroxide processing at the Yabulu refinery, the temporary suspension of two of our iron ore pellet plants at Samarco, the temporary reduction of Samancor Manganese production, the suspension of copper sulfide from the Pinto Valley mine, and reductions in Metallurgical Coal producing during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As we have flagged as well, we expect one-off costs of approximately US$500 million in the second half that are linked to the implementation of these decisions. As we have said, we will continue to take quick and decisive action as market conditions changes.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will now hand you over to Marius, who will go through our views on the market outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alex, perhaps to highlight a few points. Six months ago we started off this section of our presentation with a title -- a slide titled, short-term global challenges exist. On that slide we noted that global economic activity was moderating. Financial marketing stability and inflationary pressures were apparent. And we started importantly to see flow-on effects of these two emerging economies.</p>
          <p>Like most observers, however, we did not foresee the speed of deterioration that we've now witnessed. It's unlike anything I have seen before and it's unlike I think what most people have seen.</p>
          <p>To illustrate, this slide shows commodity prices over the six month period between July and December. In just six months across most of the main commodities that we produce, prices have gone down between 50 and 60%. And some of these commodities have suffered further declines on the order of 10% or so since the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>Today, weakness, uncertainty and volatility in the outlook exist not only in the short-term, but also in the medium term. Demand for our products is being impacted globally because of this we've noted the adjustments we've made in production, maintenance schedules and projects and we will continue to review our projects, operations, capital investments in the context of this fluid demand environment.</p>
          <p>Our view from six months has not changed in one regard and that is that momentum in risk and our view is still probably to the down side. Now just as the world has been too optimistic about the extent of the deterioration that we would see, it's also been too optimistic about the medium term impact and timing of the recovery.</p>
          <p>Growth forecasts continue to be revised downwards and the turning point for any eventual recovery continues to be pushed out. Now just to illustrate, we've put on this slide a consulting company called Global Insights and their predictions -- last five predictions for year-on-year growth -- forward global growth.</p>
          <p>As you can see, there has been a marked change or deterioration in their forecasts, particularly in the last two forecasts. And this picture would have been in structure no different had I used the forecast from any other forecasting consultancy.</p>
          <p>Our sense in talking to many market participants is that on a global basis, which constitutes the markets that we operate in, very few are prepared to give a view of when that turning point will occur. But let's talk about what it will take to improve, particularly with respect to our industry.</p>
          <p>We've spoken about china for a long time. Most in our industry have spoken about China for a long time. And most of us are aware that in terms of raw demand growth, China has outpaced any other country or region. For that reason, China will continue to be very, very important in our industry.</p>
          <p>But we cannot let ourselves forget that we operate in global markets. And demand or consumption outside China, as we show on this slide, still constitutes the largest component of absolute consumption. This chart shows us that between 65 and 70% of most of the commodities that we produce are consumed in the global market outside China, with an emphasis on OECD consumption.</p>
          <p>With only 30 to 35% of absolute commodity demand, China alone, cannot be relied on to support overall global commodity demand. For global commodity markets to perform well, a synchronized improvement in both the OECD and China will be required.</p>
          <p>But let's take a look at China. On the short-term destocking in China seems to be nearing completion. And we are starting to gain visibility of the underlying level of demand for the first time in many months. While growth clearly slowed in China over the last few months of 2008, China has not experienced some of the dimensions of collapse that other more export oriented economies in the region suffered.</p>
          <p>China has also largely avoided the credit and confidence collapses seen in the west. China has got a government that has got the ability to boost infrastructural spending, and with the lack of household and corporate debt, and government debt, we would therefore expect China to be relatively more resilient than the west. But of course standing in against these positives, China's economy has been impacted by the reduction of export demand.</p>
          <p>Over the longer term, while we continue to review this, our story for China is unchanged. It remains at a relatively early stage of its development, its absolute intensity of use of many of the products that we produce remains low. And therefore long-term, our view is not very different to what we've said before.</p>
          <p>But let's take a look at how our industry has been impacted, as we take a look at all of these things that have impacted on our industry. This is a reasonably complex chart, so let me take a moment to explain what it means.</p>
          <p>On the Y-axis, the Y-axis represents return on capital, improving as you move up the scale. So it's an indicator of absolute asset strength, higher up on the scale. The X-axis represents balance sheet strength, improving as you move from left to right. Each of the individual bubbles on the chart represents a company in the sector. And the size of the bubble is scaled to the enterprise value of the company. Just for reference, the bubble in the legend in the top right hand corner, that shows that red bubble is scaled to about $10 billion.</p>
          <p>So what can we conclude from this. BHP Billiton is extremely well positioned with both a quality set of assets, and a quality balance sheet. The majority of other companies in our sector are going into this downturn in a condition of financial distress or weakness. Their asset quality is also variable.</p>
          <p>Balance sheets are highly leveraged and significant amounts of cash will be needed just to service ongoing debt commitments. Therefore many of the companies in our sector have unlike us, no option but to switch their focus from long-term value growth to short -- to managing in the short-term.</p>
          <p>And this change in focus will have an impact on future supply fundamentals. In today's environment for those companies preserving cash is crucial as we've noted. And the industry as a result of the stretched balance sheets has promptly acted to minimize cash outflows.</p>
          <p>Production cuts will be made swiftly and severely across the spectrum of commodities in response to the downturn in demand.</p>
          <p>Particularly, with a view towards the long run, investment in new capacity is being deferred with dramatic capital expenditure cuts announced globally and continuing to be announced. These production cuts, investment delays and cancellations of projects across the commodity spectrum will mean that the future capability of the supply side is being severely impacted.</p>
          <p>Those of us in the industry like us who can continue to invest throughout the cycle in readiness for eventual market recovery, and do not have to trade long-term optionality for short-term expediency, will be perfectly positioned to grow market share and shareholder value when this business cycle upturn comes.</p>
          <p>So our long standing strategy has uniquely positioned us for the events that we are witnessing. On an average the industry has been facing funding pressures and deteriorating credit ratings. Our strongly diversified cash flow, strong asset quality has allowed us to improve our gearing position.</p>
          <p>I particularly want to draw your attention to the 74% increase in net operating cash flow. The fact that our balance sheet has never been stronger, the fact that during the half, we have reduced our gearing from 18% to below 10%, and that our interest cover stands at 87 times.</p>
          <p>In this market, there will be numerous opportunities to purchase assets more cheaply than in the past. Of course very few of these assets will fit our unchanged strategy of a focus on Tier I assets, but when -- if and when these opportunities arise, we have the capacity to act.</p>
          <p>But these opportunities are not mutually exclusive to growth in an organic way. We will continue to invest in value-adding growth throughout the cycle. And in addition to that longstanding strategy of investing in our own business, keeping the balance sheet intact, and returning surplus cash to our shareholders, the strength of our diversified cash flows has underpinned our ability to maintain our progressive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>However being in this strong position does not mean immunity from the strong winds that are blowing. We continue to systematically and methodically review all aspects of our business. And in this regard, you have seen a number of production and project announcements. Most recently, on the 21st of January in our production report, we re-announced a number of sensible, prudent and responsible measures.</p>
          <p>We will continue to tailor the production of our product. If we are unable to sell the products or if any of our operations are cash negative and set to remain so. We've also as I said before refocused our capital spend, which has always had a high bias towards brownfield expansions in our backyard, to an even more increased manner, to reflect the focus on Tier I assets, brownfield expansions in the backyard.</p>
          <p>But I also want to emphasis here today that our business strategy is always to live within our means. And not only on the production side, but also on the capital side, we will continue to review and make adjustments necessary, consistent with the environment in which we operate.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we had a robust first half. Our production to date has been strong, the market outlook has been deteriorating and together with the production adjustments that we've made already, will impact results over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>We don't expect any relief in the short and medium-term from uncertainty and volatility, the timing of any recovery is unclear. But while that global outlook is uncertain, I again want to emphasize the quality of our assets, the strength of our balance sheet and the cash flow that is generated from this diversified portfolio, uniquely positioning us for when this business cycle turns.</p>
          <p>We will continue to, as we've done, act proactively and with a high degree of decisiveness to preserve and grow shareholder value, ensuring that long-term value is not compromised.</p>
          <p>You've just listened to the webcast of our investor presentation, given in Sydney earlier today. I would like to thank you especially for those in London in the snow and I thank you for taking the time to do so.</p>
          <p>We are trialing this style of presentation for the first time and I look forward to your feedback on this after the Q&amp;A session. We will now take any questions that you may have. You can submit these questions either by the Web tool provided, by email or we will take your questions by telephone. Alex is in London, I'm in Sydney and we will first go to the telephones, if I may have the first question, please?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question, in your presentation you talk about the '09 CapEx, 11.3, and that's down from 13.5 you talked about six months ago, when you look at the --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when I look at the -- your results presentation, you detail your projects. And they don't appear to have changed in either CapEx or timing. Can you just let me know, which projects you're trimming? How you're getting that CapEx down? And what it's going to impact in terms of your projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rob. Obviously, the projects that you see are the ones that we've sanctioned and that we are busy executing. Most of the projects that we -- that you're seeing, we've got several investments that were probably in our budget that have slipped beyond that through deferral or have been cancelled.</p>
          <p>And examples include the Suriname development, which while we never released any definitive numbers around that was something between 500 million and $1 billion worth of capital investment. I think the Guinea investment at the beginning of this year, probably would have been on the charts here has been sanctioned earlier, and as you know that that project has gradually slipped out.</p>
          <p>Then there's a number of things that -- where we had pre-sanctioning spend which has come out, and that is things like pearl, the Indonesian nickel and so on. And apart from that obviously we have had on some of our projects, where there is an appreciable local currency component, we've had some currency movements. I think that covers the main items. Alex, is there anything that I have omitted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Marius. You gave a good overview. We never gave a forecast to FY'10, the 13.7 was a forecast for FY'09. And what you see as well is a reduction to some extent on the sustaining capital base and also other minor capital, but also in exploration, because the 13.7 encompasses everything.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I can see sustaining has nearly halved. Is that -- do we expect some lower production as a result of that? Is that the inter-development CapEx? Are you cutting into the bone, I guess is the question I'm asking?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Alex and I, who basically play the role of capital allocation in the Group, have certainly dug into the minor and sustaining CapEx and have asked whether all of these projects are necessary to be done at this time. I don't think that there is any production guidance, outside of the production guidance that we've already given in our results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. May I have the next question on the telephone please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Sam Kefflano from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Marius. Just a couple of questions. First one on your slide on future CapEx and comments about supply being impacted. Just wondering as you look at that and consider that are there any commodities in particular or do you look at amongst the commodities and think that some may or may not be more or less affected in terms of barriers to entry for spending large amounts of CapEx, for example, that make it more difficult for some of your competitors to do so? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, do you have any comment in terms of growing or potentially acquiring businesses, relative attractiveness between acquiring existing production today or long-dated development options where the value is yet to be added?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second one and the question is long-dated options or existing production, our bias is always towards things that are already in production. Obviously you do also want to add from time-to-time long-dated, very, very high grade resources. And I think the potash acquisitions over the last couple of years would be an example. But on balance we always bias towards productive assets or assets that are already in production.</p>
          <p>If we look at the future CapEx and which things have been most affected, haven't really given that a lot of thought in this format perhaps just thinking aloud. There certainly has been in the copper business no material new extremely large mines or even provinces opened up during this upturn. And I think it's fair to say that the current events have taken a lot of, let's call it, expectations for capital deployment, particularly in places like the Congo and so on, has gone out of it.</p>
          <p>Then perhaps a second thought and this is pretty unstructured, on the Iron Ore business, clearly, we are very happy that we are in a position to keep on growing production at a time where some other competitors seem to not be investing in those businesses. Those are just two thoughts, but overall Sam, probably, I haven't analyzed the question exactly the, sorry, that aspect in exactly the format that you've asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. Thanks, Marius.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps one more question from the telephone and then I'll try and take some from the webcast.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our next question --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Marius --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Tobias.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alex. Three questions, if I may. Firstly, you've delivered obviously very strong cash generation, net debt lower than at least what I had expected. Would you be so kind to give us some kind of sense where the year should end for yourself, irrespective of any M&amp;A and other exceptionals which could come during the year?</p>
          <p>The second question is you have through your one book approach, at least, that's what I have always believed, quite a strong insight into the shipping market around the world. We've seen the Baltic freight rates move up quite nicely recently from 663 up to now 1150. Maybe you can tell us what you sense in the shipping market at the moment and what it tells you?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly, and I don't want to dwell on it, but I think it's got some important messages and lessons to learn from it, Ravensthorpe. We can discuss it maybe with Alex in the round table more in detail, what your lessons are from it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tobias. Perhaps taking those is reverse order, starting with Ravensthorpe. Clearly there are always lessons to be learned. The one aspect that I emphasized earlier today on Ravensthorpe is obviously we had a massive change in the Nickel business over the last couple years. Particularly over the last 18 months, in new technologies, nickel pig iron, and so on. Dramatically changing for how you think upside in that business will respond and we've spoken about that before.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I think the -- obviously a lot of debate. I think the one thing that the management team would ask itself today in the -- given the same set of issues, is just whether a focus on absolute Tier I resources wouldn't have screened out this project, on the basis of resource size and quality. But there are obviously a myriad of other smaller lessons to be learned. It is a pity if you've got to learn from your own mistakes rather than purely learning from the mistakes of others. But I think we've said that that's probably not the finest investment out of our portfolio of 44 projects that we've completed since the merger, or the creation of the company in its current form.</p>
          <p>On the one book approach, Alex and I did review just a couple of days ago with our shipping folk, what they're seeing. I think particular &#x2013; while we can't forecast for you where the freight market is going. I think the one thing that stood out for us is given the bulk commodity environment that we've outlined here today. I mean, the one thing that I actually think overhangs the shipping market is a very, very large number of deliveries of vessels over the next two years. And even though, some of those vessels may not materialize as a result of financing, shipyard issues, and so on, it is still a very large proportion of new additional capacity that is going to come on the market.</p>
          <p>So that would probably be the one aspect that we would take into account. Alex, do you recall any other specifics that the freight guys highlighted to us in preparation for today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No Marius, that's basically it was a case of going from chronic under supply to just a dead market. So it was a significant, I think more than in any commodities, the very quick shift in that market. And that's even more pronounced with the new capacity that's coming in, in the next couple of years, as I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the third question on cash generation forecast for the year, Tobias that's probably a very, very difficult question for us to give you more guidance on. We simply can't forecast that, and particularly in this volatile outlook.</p>
          <p>If I could perhaps ask the operator to just read out the first question that has been submitted by email please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The first few questions from the webcast come from Mr. Jason Fairclough of Merrill Lynch. The first question is could you discuss why you haven't restarted the share buyback program? And secondly, could you please discuss the future of your Southern African smelters in the context of low prices and poor outlook for aluminium, and ongoing power restrictions in South Africa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jason, thank you. On the share buyback program, I think the most succinct summary that I can give is that we believe that the optionality that we get from maintaining that cash on our balance sheet, firstly from an outlook perspective, where we don't know what will happen. The option that we've got retaining that on our balance sheet, plus the option to use that capacity in what we believe will be an environment that will deliver additional opportunities. Between those two things the optionality probably outweighs other considerations.</p>
          <p>On the South African smelters, I believe that the -- starting off with the last part of your question, which is the power restrictions. Actually the power restrictions are probably ameliorated by quite a lot of capacity cut downs that have occurred in the platinum industry, which is power intensive, particularly in the ferrochrome industry, and then obviously also in our ferromanganese industry, coupled with other diminished industrial use. So the power availability issue has probably been ameliorated.</p>
          <p>From a profitability point of view, clearly we've got to continue to review, particularly the higher cost capacity, and as you are well aware not all of the capacity is the same. Bayside is a slightly older smelter. We've got to continue to review that, but I would like to point out that as part of the power curtailment, sometime ago we actually closed the highest cost capacity in that region.</p>
          <p>Second thing that I would highlight is that for some of the products sold on the domestic market, particularly in South Africa, there's obviously a value-added premium as well as a logistical advantage, and we capture that. So we don't realize purely just the LME price on sales in that domestic environment.</p>
          <p>If &#x2013; operator, if I may have the next question on e-mail please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Sylvain Brunet of Exane. Are you expecting cost deflation in the second half of the financial year? And secondly, do you think that value accretive opportunities could arise earlier in the oil and gas sector than the metal sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On cost deflation, I think Alex showed a slide that broke down the $1.6 billion in additional costs that we saw. And while I don't know all of those numbers off the top of my head, roughly speaking there was about $600 million in there for raw materials cost inflation, coke, pitch, aluminium fluoride, sulfuric acid and so on.</p>
          <p>Our philosophy on these input materials is to follow the market in the same way that we follow the market on our revenue line, on our interest rates and so on. And so while that is not perfectly possible to immediately move to -- as the market moves shed those costs. Clearly, we expect that as sulfuric acid has decreased, I think, eight-fold in price and so on, those cost decreases will come through.</p>
          <p>Also in that category obviously on a more immediate basis, are things like lubricants and diesel and explosives which are very coupled to the petroleum price. Other categories of cost that will come out of our costs or will be non-recurring are, for example, the $300 million or so in the rebuilding cost of the Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter. And then thirdly, Alex has also detailed there, that we incurred extra costs on additional contractors producing higher margin products particularly at the beginning of the period. Highlighting manganese and coking coal as two examples. Out of those contracting costs, I think that the -- both on a unit usage basis as well as a unit cost basis we are going to see decreases.</p>
          <p>And then on the last one I would like to tie that in to Rob Clifford's question on sustaining CapEx and maintenance costs where you saw that maintenance did indeed, as we saw very high availability in the first -- particularly in the first half of the first half. Clearly, going forward we're going to take -- scrutinize maintenance costs extremely closely.</p>
          <p>So those are the components of how we think about costs coming out of our cost structure. I had a second part of that question if the operator could just repeat that my abbreviation here is now largely illegible to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The second part of the question is do you think that value accretive opportunities could arise in the oil and gas sector before the metal sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably haven't looked at it that way. Typically we don't break out opportunities by end-use product. We typically look at it on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis, so I couldn't really comment on that.</p>
          <p>On that note perhaps let me go back to the telephones and see if there is another question on the telephones. If I may have the first question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from the line of Charles Kernot from Evolution. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. It's just a question really in relation to cash flow -- the cash flow situation. Clearly there is a big increase in reported cash flow, but I suppose in looking through the details, a lot of it relates to -- it was around $5 billion, I think, of $5.4 billion of an improvement in trade and other receivables, which will obviously come down a lot.</p>
          <p>Now, I suppose you talked about the big increase last time in the full year results, because of much higher commodity prices. And in a way isn't it true that actually this cash flow improvement really relates to the high prices that you were receiving in the first half of the 2008 calendar year, rather than any strong improvement in underlying cash flow in the second half of 2008 calendar year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think if we look at cash flow and EBITDA, there are clearly some separations there. Clearly liquidation of the receivables book in a lower price environment is an important contributor. And there are some impacts around provisional pricing and so on, I think, which I don't have any exact detail on. But it's fair to say that there is indeed some cash coming in because of liquidation of the receivables book, with receivables days staying at approximately the same level period-on-period.</p>
          <p>I should point out however, that in the credit environment that we've got, actually brining that cash home and bringing that into bank accounts is a serious management task, and one that we work on very hard. So maintaining our receivables book at a very, very tight level in what is a difficult credit environment is something that we take particular pride on. Alex, I'd know if you can shed a little bit more light?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just like to point to Charles that you are correct in your analysis that there has been an impact from a working capital perspective. But also you should look at the margins that -- EBIT margins that the business is producing. The 46% is quite significant. It is coming down from where we ended last year, which was above 50%. So you have seen the impact of the lower prices on the LME products. But you have also seen the impact of the higher prices on the both products that are coming though. So it is a mix of both.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mike Bedford of BJM. We note today the $508 million Newcastle steel works rehabilitation, are there any other similar obligations that we should be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, good morning. No, the Newcastle steel works remediation project is a complex one. Like another one that we've had to handle in the past, Southwest Copper. It is something that stems out of a legacy operation that was there for the better part of the century, in this case the steel works. As a result it's taken considerable time for us to quantify the exact amount of material. And this legacy really stems from the split out of steel from BHP in perhaps 1999, 2000.</p>
          <p>It's taken some time. I think that we've got 12 regulatory bodies to deal with in New South Wales, and we've got 110 permits to obtain in order to get clarity of what this will cost us. So it's taken some time. We finally have a quantification of volume, method and rate at which we can do it, and we've got that go forward commitment on this. There is nothing similar that has been identified through our risk management process that is insipient here.</p>
          <p>If I may have the next question please from the email, operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Kieran Daly of Investec Securities. Do you envisage building a potash business by M&amp;A as well as by greenfield projects? Given your balance sheet and the sharp fall in equity value of listed producers, there must be some good opportunities for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kieran, obviously there are not that many companies when you talk in the potash space. By me commenting on this, I would implicitly be commenting about one or two specific opportunities, which you'll understand, we can't do.</p>
          <p>Perhaps a couple of comments, we don't see greenfield and M&amp;A activities as being mutually exclusive, is perhaps one comment. And secondly, I note that potash prices have held up relatively well compared to some of the other commodity prices. So there hasn't been the same movement in potash prices as we've had in some of the other commodities, which has obviously affected valuations and so on in the sector. Perhaps I should just stop at that point.</p>
          <p>If I may have the next question from the operator please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Kieran Daly of Investec Securities. On costs you normally have a slide showing the rate of cost increase year-on-year. Can you provide some guidance on first half 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought we provided a fairly good breakdown of the costs in the usual format. I would say that without wanting to make a forecast of exactly what we expect on costs, which we never do, I would restrain my comments perhaps to noting those things that I've already discussed on contractors, raw materials, maintenance costs, and unit usage and non-recurring items, all of which point all things staying as they are today, to probably a net deflationary environment in the second half.</p>
          <p>Operator, if I may have the next question from the email, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Jason Fairclough of Merrill Lynch. Could you please discuss the outlook for volumes on the various steel making raw materials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Jason, we've -- in the appendix material on the release you'll find some guidance. Essentially, we hope to -- in iron ore since the -- we believe that substantial amount of destocking has taken place in China. We hope to sell approximately the same volume of material in our iron ore business over the second half of the year as we did in the first, for a total of about 130 million tons per year.</p>
          <p>On manganese and coking coal the situation is a little bit more complex. These products have different customer regions, where the iron ore is very North Asia focused with 50% going into China. And hence you've got a reasonable degree of visibility with the steel destocking in China and local domestic Chinese production being the main variables there. On coking coal and manganese we have North American markets, we've got European markets, Brazil, India and so on. In addition to that, manganese is a very easily storable product. And hence when destocking is complete is far more difficult to judge.</p>
          <p>So we've given guidance on the coking coal. I don't think we've got any update to that here today. My observation would be that if anything, the risk is probably to the downside in that product, consistent with our overall outlook that we've given today in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p>And in manganese, you have seen that we have had the cutbacks on our manganese operations, totaling almost 50% in the second half of the year on a unit basis. Like on coking coal and particularly given the unclear stock situation here, because large volumes or large -- from a time perspective a lot of manganese can be stored, probably the risk here is towards the downside on volume even from here at this time as well.</p>
          <p>Just one last word on the iron ore, we probably have on iron ore modified our selling behavior, where we've got more product going to the market -- clearing market than we had and with term contracts relatively contributing less.</p>
          <p>Can I take perhaps at this point the next call on the telephone, please?</p>
          <p>Operator.  Our next question comes from the line of Damien Hackett and Sila Broda from Canaccord Adams. Go ahead please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Marius and Alex. Just a quick question on accounting -- IFRS accounting. The tax effect of that write-down on the Australian dollar tax assets, I presume that is an IFRS accounting mark-to-market issue. And therefore does it mean that we might see a reverse of that tax situation going forward should the exchange rate strengthen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Damien. We've had this and we've noted a couple of years ago, I think, two years ago we noted that over a two year period, because the Australian dollar had strengthened on a more progressive basis. I think we had on the order of a $300 million, or 250, 300 million effect, year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Obviously what comes to book here is the fact that we saw such a very quick weakening or depreciation of the Australian assets. And the number that you are seeing is exactly that, it is the &#x2013; it's a mark-to-market effect, which if the -- with no cash impact, and where the companies that don't have a US dollar functional currency for their assets, will just see this as a balance sheet size increase or decrease.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately because we've got US dollar functional currency, these adjustments show as a mark-to-market on the US dollar side, and flows through the P&amp;L. Alex, I don't know if your education of me was complete, but --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was perfect Marius, you've got a star in accounting there. But the only thing I would add to that, Damien is that the drop in the Australian dollar in relation to the US dollar in that half year was to the tune of 28%. If you go back in previous half years, you're going to see that never -- it was never even to double-digits. I think the highest before was 9%. So it is all happening very dramatically in one period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Alex just if can follow-up, it's got nothing to do it with the long-term view that you may have on the Australian dollar rate?</p>

          <p>And again out of all of the things on our P&amp;L today. If I look at all of the elements as we broke it down, and how we feel about our EBITDA, our EBIT, our margins, our cash flow and our profit after tax net of this amount, I think all of those are exceptional performances. And we've got one item which is quite difficult to understand, or to communicate, which is of a non-cash nature, changes nothing on the value of the company, which flows through our P&amp;L, because of a US functional currency choice rather than through our balance sheet. And I'd like to emphasize that point, perhaps for all of the people that are on the line.</p>

          <p>Good morning gentlemen, just one question with regards to your nickel business. I noticed for Yabulu and Nickel West, if we strip out the cost of the start up of Ravensthorpe, both of those businesses are still loss making at the EBITDA level. Can you talk about how you might be able to adjust the cost profile of those businesses going forward, or whether your focus may be on reducing production potentially? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perhaps two comments, there is obviously a substantial amount of costs associated with the buildup of partially processed stocks ahead of the Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter, which we will liquidate progressively now that that smelter is rebuilt and start up costs -- sorry costs associated with the rebuild of the nickel smelter.</p>
          <p>The second one is perhaps on the Mt. Keith open-cut operation, where we've got lower grade material which is at surface, and which we will process during the next period. Alex I don't know if you've got anything else to add on nickel costs?</p>

          <p>We have one last question from Luc Pez of Oddo Securities. Could you again elaborate on how third party access to your railway network in the Pilbara, impacts your existing operations and also your expansion plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luc, thank you. Not a lot of comment from what we said before. We have an obligation to carry material as part of our stake agreement for third-party. That means putting their material in our trucks, in our railway trucks. And that's an obligation that clearly we take very seriously, and we've got every intention to comply with that.</p>
          <p>On other access agreements, on putting third-party rolling stock on our rails and so on, clearly we've seen the ruling late last year by the Treasurer, on whether this process could be considered a production process or not. And hence the ruling there, but we are still quite a way from completing all of the legal processes around that. It could be several years before all of that is completed. And I think as such the impact on our earnings as you model it over the next couple of years should be absolutely negligible, both from a revenue basis or otherwise.</p>

          <p>And on that note, I think, thank you very much once again, especially for people in a cold London, we've appreciated having you. We look forward to your comments perhaps on the format. We genuinely would like to see whether that gives you better value. And thank you very much again for sharing with us what we believe is an excellent set of results. And a company that is in terrific shape from a cash flow and balance sheet perspective.</p>
