          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation of BNP Paribas's 2011 Third Quarter Results. For information, this call is being recorded. Slides to the presentation are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relations website, www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Philippe Bordenave, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, everybody. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter results presentation. I thank you especially because I understand that I am in competition with Mario Draghi holding his press conference at the same time. So it's really kind of you to come to our press conference &#x2013; our analyst conference.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like to start with a few introductory remarks on our quarterly results before taking your questions.</p>
          <p>The past quarter has been dominated by tremendous volatility in financial markets and the very challenging impact of operating environment and &#x2013; however, I would like to take you through the &#x2013; before I take you through business performance of the quarter, I would like to highlight maybe some key messages.</p>
          <p>The first thing I would like to stress is referring to the page 6 of our presentation is about the new agreement on Greek debt, the agreement of the 27th of October. So we, we have raised in order to take this agreement into account, we have raised the total impairment of our Greek exposure to 60%, both on our banking books and on the insurance activities books, generating an impact on quarterly results of &#x20AC;2.3 billion. And the slide is showing the breakdown. Our residual exposure to Greece is thus reduced to &#x20AC;1.6 billion now.</p>
          <p>Then, and more generally speaking about the sovereign exposure, I would like to maybe to comment on slide 41, we had significantly reduced our global sovereign exposure in order to reduce the sensitivity of our Tier 1 ratio to the mark-to-market of sovereign debt.</p>
          <p>We have acted in response to Basel III in order to be sure, to be fully compliant as early as the 1st of January 2013, as we have said, meaning that, in order to be sure of the target, we had to reduce the volatility of our sovereign portfolio market valuation and the only way to do that is to reduce the size of the portfolio itself.</p>
          <p>And the decision by the European Banking Authority to create a buffer based on the same metrics for the target at the mid-year next year has confirmed our analysis. Hence, it must be very clear that our sale of sovereign bonds was across the board, as you can see on slide 41, and not motivated by fear of specific country. We cut our global sovereign exposure by 23% in the 4 months to October, incurring losses of &#x20AC;362 million in the third quarter and an additional &#x20AC;450 million in October.</p>
          <p>Third, moving back to slide 7, I'd like to comment on the immediate target set by the EBA as of the 30th of June 2012, a 9% common equity Tier 1 plus a buffer against sovereign exposure.</p>
          <p>So for us, the EBA has reported a moderate shortfall, simply because it only accounted for the negative impact of Basel 2.5 &#x2013; that is to say 60 basis points &#x2013; plus the mark-to-market of the sovereign portfolio, 40 basis points &#x2013; without considering benefit occurring from our deleveraging plan and from retained earnings. If you assume that only half of the deleveraging plan will be achieved by June 2012, you see that BNP shall be in a position to exceed the range and target without any need to tap the market, and retained earnings will come on top of that.</p>
          <p>Now, the deleveraging plan, moving on slide 27, we are giving more details about this deleveraging plan. It's well under way. We have already identified and launched actions and projects accounting for some 80% of the overall plan. And the plan, I'll remind you, is expected to lead to an increase of our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 100 basis points by year-end 2012. That is the equivalent of &#x20AC;70 billion risk-weighted assets reduction.</p>
          <p>These measures are expected to have a recurring annual impact on gross operating income of &#x20AC;750 million, of which &#x20AC;500 million deriving from CIB. The CIB reduction represents the combined effect of lower revenues for approximately &#x20AC;1.4 billion, mitigated by re-pricing actions worth some &#x20AC;400 million and by lower costs estimated in the region of &#x20AC;500 million. What's more, these measures will generate restructuring costs estimated at &#x20AC;400 million, spread over five quarters starting from Q4, with a probable concentration at the start of the period, and probably less at the end of the period. And in addition, asset disposals are expected to generate losses of around &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of CIB funding in U.S. dollars, that is &#x2013; a significant part of the plan is targeting the U.S. dollar assets. And you can move to slide 28 and 29. We have announced the planned reduction of $60 billion by end 2012, of which we had said $20 billion by the end of 2011. And indeed, in the third quarter, we have already achieved the 2011 target, mostly from cutting inventories in capital market businesses. So we'll be well ahead of our targets by completing an additional $20 billion reduction in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As a result of this action on U.S. dollars, we have almost matched funding needs of our business lines in dollars with clients and medium- and long-term resources. You can look at slide 29 to this respect, and you see that the funding needs of customer activity is almost matched by the addition of the equity, the client deposits, and medium- and long-term funding. So the gap is &#x20AC;2 billion &#x2013; is not material anymore. And we expect to have reached full balance before year-end due to the further deleveraging of our U.S. dollar assets.</p>
          <p>And having achieved that, as for short-term resources, you see &#x2013; of which you see the U.S. money market funds' dollar deposits at $36 billion at the end of September. Should it continue to decrease, we shall act first by tapping the $56 billion liquidity reserves. For example, reducing cash deposits with the Fed that are shown at $30 billion at the end of September, or recalling liquid fixed-income securities. And even beyond this liquidity buffer, we can reduce interbank loans, and we can also reduce further the swaps that are creating other currencies out of U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>If we move now to a more broader view, all currencies included, we have continued to fund our business through the crisis with medium and long-term resources. And I'd like you to move to slide 32. And we have leveraged our &#x2013; on our access to diversified medium- and long-term funding sources. Since July, we have raised &#x20AC;8 billion in addition to our 2011 funding program through private placements, distribution in our networks and the CRH, the French home loan refinancing entity.</p>
          <p>The average cost of this medium- and long-term funding over the summer was 89 basis points, which represents a limited increase compared to the first half of the year. And for 2012, we have set the medium- and long-term program at &#x20AC;20 billion in addition to the &#x20AC;8 billion we have already raised.</p>
          <p>Due to this solid medium- and long-term funding, we come to the slide 30, meaning the global, all currencies included cash balance sheet. And you see that the total is around &#x20AC;1 trillion and you can see that all currencies included, our funding, long &#x2013; medium-, long-term funding plus client deposits plus equity is clearly exceeding the funding needs of customer activity. So, we &#x2013; it's &#x20AC;786 billion compared to &#x20AC;763 billion and it follows that short-term resources, therefore, only finance liquidity reserves and short-term assets. And the group's immediately available liquidity reserves totaled &#x20AC;170 billion at the end of September 2011, as shown in the following slides.</p>
          <p>So, those were, I think, the most important, I would say, messages I wanted to raise again. Having said that, I would like to turn your attention to the group's underlying operating performance, which net of Greek provisioning has been very resilient in the third quarter with a bottom line of close to &#x20AC;2 billion, &#x20AC;500 million plus the Greek impact.</p>
          <p>Our revenues, on slide 9, exceeded &#x20AC;10 billion with a positive contribution from retail banking investment solutions, especially offsetting the contraction in CIB revenues, which were penalized by the market conditions and by the losses on the sale of sovereign debt. Operating costs decreased accordingly, helped also by CIB cost flexibility. Cost of risk, net of Greek impairment, continued to show a downward trend in all business units, representing 50 basis points of outstanding customer loans.</p>
          <p>And as a result of that, on slide 33, that the book value per share continued to climb slowly but surely to the contrary of the share price. And our nine-month annualized return on equity stood at a still competitive 10% despite the impact of Greek impairment that is included in that figure.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I'm now ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Philippe Bordenave. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll now move to our first question from Jon Peace from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Three short questions, please on the Corporate and Investment Bank. The first one is that you used to give us an idea that revenues would be between the first quarter and the second quarter 2010 run rate, in other words between about &#x20AC;2.8 billion and &#x20AC;3.8 billion. And I just wondered, given the deleveraging plan and with the current market outlook, would you look to redefine that range?</p>
          <p>The second question is on cost control in the Corporate and Investment Bank. It was very impressive this quarter. I just wondered if you would be able to split for advisory and capital markets, or for the whole business, compensation versus non-compensation costs. I want to know if you've got the same flexibility going into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And the final question is on the disposal losses of &#x20AC;800 million. They're relatively high. I'm sure you can finance that given your profitability. But I just wondered what are these assets? Why do you anticipate the losses being so high? And what sort of sensitivity is there in that &#x20AC;800 million number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. About &#x2013; well, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:30). It's true that we &#x2013; while we were seeing that the run rate for CIB as a whole was between &#x20AC;2.5 billion and &#x20AC;3.5 billion per quarter, meaning that for the capital market it was something like between &#x20AC;1.5 billion to &#x20AC;2.5 billion, having in mind that the financing businesses are generating &#x20AC;1 billion per quarter around. And it's true that we &#x2013; well, this quarter was exceptional. I mean, we have gone through a quarter that was really extremely, I mean, extremely &#x2013; well, dramatic with surprises, especially in the equity business that was &#x2013; I think the equity prices went down more than during the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>So we have seen a crisis that was really a kind of aftershock of &#x2013; a significant aftershock or a replica of what happened in 2008. And yes, we are &#x2013; we fell out of the range and I agree with that. I hope that it will not last too long, but obviously the ups and downs of the markets are not necessarily over, it seems, and October has been relatively shaky again. So we'll &#x2013; well, we &#x2013; before I say something else, I think, we have to see the market come back to a more stabilized situation.</p>
          <p>About cost control, I think you have the combination of two things. If you refer to the fact that the cost &#x2013; well, on the one hand and we benefit from the Fortis synergy. You remember that a significant part of the Fortis synergies were benefiting to CIB because we have integrated both CIB, the Fortis one and BNP Paribas one and so we have said and you have somewhere in the presentation the synergies coming from the Fortis integration. And you can see that CIB is representing a significant part, so slide 44 and CIB is representing the 43%. It's the biggest part of all businesses of the synergies. So this explains what &#x2013; as a kind of basis, if you want, the cost control is good at CIB especially good at the moment because they are benefiting from the synergy.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, you have the natural flexibility of the bonuses and as the &#x2013; as I've just said, the revenues were outside of the range and the bonuses have been outside of the range as well. And I repeat &#x2013; and I remind you that in the past, we always managed &#x2013; we have always managed to take 100% of the bonus charges in the year where the bonuses were &#x2013; have been generated. You remember that. We don't have any overhang or any past bonuses being paid each year.</p>
          <p>So each year is self-sufficient in terms of bonus payment, of bonus accruals even if the bonus are deferred. So we have always charged &#x2013; accounting-wise, charged our bonuses to the year where there had been generated, even if they were deferred and this explains also why we don't have some legacies from the past. And if the quarter is bad, the bonus accrual is very low as well.</p>
          <p>And as far &#x2013; well, the disposals &#x2013; I mean, we have taken the view that it would cost us &#x2013; well, that on average, we would sell those assets with some discounts and some &#x2013; so we have taken the view that maybe this discount could be in the region of 3% to 5%. And this is &#x2013; what explains the figure of &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are really in the process of selling those assets with, I would say, with care and certainly not at any price and so we try and limit that cost as much as possible. We'll report &#x2013; every quarter we report all those figures to keep you informed of the implementation of the plan. And we see at the end if we can do better, but at the moment, we think it's reasonable to think that we'll have that kind of haircut.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Patrick Leclerc from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Well, I have two questions on the sovereign bond management and portfolio. Well, I mean, first, why have you cut Italian government bonds by &#x20AC;8 billion to &#x20AC;9 billion and have not made anything regarding your Belgian government bonds, which all in all are now the highest bucket within your sovereign portfolio?</p>
          <p>Second question, can you break down the &#x20AC;0.8 billion loss that you had between the third quarter and the month of October on these bonds? And what is the impact you expect on your recurring revenues? Otherwise, I mean, how do you reemploy the proceeds of these bonds, I mean, just to measure what could be the &#x2013; well, I mean, the impact from this kind of deleveraging?</p>
          <p>And very, very last question, if I may, on the 60% that you have retained from Greece, I mean, why have you chosen this 60% number? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, hello. I'll start with the 60% because it's the easiest question. The 60% is coming from the &#x2013; well, we try and translate the agreements held on the 21st of July, the first agreement. We try and translate it in our account. So at the end, it was not implemented and so we have a new agreement. And this new agreement, to a large extent, is taking more or less the same kind of feature as the first agreement, with the exception that the significant difference that we haircut by 50% before everything. So, on the one hand, you are losing 50% and from the other 50%, you have seen the same kind of zero-coupon bonds, with the collateral of &#x20AC;30 billion brought by the FSS and so on. So we expect, we are still told that, probably we would lose around 20% of those 50%, makes 10%, so total 60%. Clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clear. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That being said, we still don't know, well &#x2013; in more details, important details of this plan and it remains to be further discussed so &#x2013; but we think that we are on the safe side this time, right.</p>
          <p>Now, about the sovereign bonds, I mean, while we have and we will &#x2013; while we have reduced the exposure on an opportunistic basis, I would say, and we will keep doing so. So there is no other explanation to &#x2013; no other answer to your question. And the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to interrupt, Philippe. So it was opportunistic to sell &#x20AC;8 billion or &#x20AC;9 billion of Italian govies in September here and October, I mean that's your appreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we &#x2013; it was to us &#x2013; to start with, it was our biggest exposure and we &#x2013; well, we sold across the board a certain number of bonds depending on the market, on what was possible to be done in the market. So on slide 41 again, you have the indication of all what we sold. We have sold a total of &#x20AC;25 billion of govies. So the &#x20AC;8 billion of Italian govies is only part of those &#x20AC;25 billion. And well, it was just &#x2013; well, depend on the opportunities we find in the market at acceptable prices, and we'll keep being opportunistic in the future.</p>
          <p>While we don't give the breakdown per bond of &#x2013; we have just given the total cost of those sales. And in terms of loss of recurring revenues, I mean, those bonds, I mean they were government bonds, so they were not high-margin bonds by any measure.</p>
          <p>And the &#x2013; well, we are &#x2013; well, with the money we get from the &#x2013; with the proceeds of those sales, we do two things. First, we increase our central bank deposits. And we think it's important to remain very flexible in terms of short-term liquidity. And well, we think it's important to increase the buffer that way. And this indeed is generally less remunerative than the bond itself, of course. And also we have reduced our short-term funding and this &#x2013; well, it's also saving some costs.</p>
          <p>Overall, yes, there are some losses of recurring revenues due to a lower sovereign bond portfolio and those reduced revenues are included in the gross operating income we &#x2013; the cost of the deleveraging plan we have mentioned in terms of gross operating income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very clear. Thanks. And the very, very last, how much of further disposal do you expect to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll keep being opportunistic and we don't want to commit to any amount beforehand.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. And we'll move to our next question from Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Yes, just a few questions. First of all, on the AFS, the reserves in your equity came down a lot from the &#x20AC;0.8 billion gain we had at the end of June to &#x20AC;1.1 billion loss. Is it possible to get some flavor or color on that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the risk-weighted assets reduction, you achieved $20 billion this quarter, but the risk-weighted asset at the group level didn't really move. What was the offset from the reduction? If we can have some color on that, as well?</p>
          <p>And finally, on the deleveraging, the &#x20AC;70 billion in total that you have announced, what's &#x2013; I mean in terms of complying to the liquidity coverage ratio, I mean, does that get you there? Or do you think that further deleveraging could be needed for 2012? Thank you. Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry. Hello, Delphine. Sorry. Yes, about the AFS reserves, the reduction in &#x2013; well, the increase in the latent losses from, as you said, from &#x20AC;0.8 billion to minus &#x20AC;1.1 billion is coming mostly from &#x2013; well, this is coming from fixed &#x2013; both fixed-income securities and equity securities. And we, in the fixed income securities, the latent losses on fixed-income securities increased by &#x20AC;700 million compared to the end of June.</p>
          <p>And the latent gains on equities decreased by &#x20AC;1.2 billion, so it's coming from both sides due to the widening of spreads on the fixed-income side and due to the big drop in equity prices, in market levels throughout...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Now, the risk-weighted assets, you have to bear in mind that during the quarter, the dollar went up quite a lot and so we had an increase in the risk-weighted assets just due to the forex effects.</p>
          <p>So the &#x2013; if you compare the third quarter dollar level with last year's third quarter, the dollar was down. But if you compare the end of the quarter with the end of June, so during the quarter, the dollar went up significantly and linked to the euro crisis to the Europe &#x2013; the Eurozone crisis. And this explains why we had an adverse forex movement in terms of risk-weighted assets reduction.</p>
          <p>And your last question about the deleveraging, I think it's too early to say it because the LCR, I think, is probably poised to change. Again, I remind you that the liquid assets according to the LCR are only government bonds. And I think that, today, something that's very difficult to keep after what happened. And I think that &#x2013; well, and it has been said both by the Basel Committee and by the European Union Commission that they would look at it another time and so we'll have some changes in the rules of the LCR. So it's too early to say if our deleveraging target &#x2013; our deleveraging at the end of 2012 will be enough to put us in full compliance with the LCR. We'll assess the situation at that time. I think we'll have new information in between and we'll be able to decide at that time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Philippe. Good afternoon, everyone. I have four quick questions. The first one, just to be sure, the &#x20AC;450 million losses you announced in October on your new sales of govies, are they included in the &#x20AC;800 million of losses you planned on your deleveraging path or is it coming on top of that?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the dividend payment. Do you have any new scenario here following your meeting with the French authorities and the EBA Stress Test?</p>
          <p>Next question, it's not very clear to me if in the EBA capital requirements, so, the deleveraging process is possibly included or not in the calculation in order to avoid any credit crunch or not. I know that you take only half of your target here, but I don't know if in the EBA method this is included or not.</p>
          <p>And the last question is on the balance sheet. Could you give us a number regarding the balance sheet at the end of September and I have &#x2013; and add-up on that is, would you able to quantify a little bit more precisely the impact of the dollar on the risk-weighted assets in order just to have an idea of the real decrease of your risk-weighted assets in Q3. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Pascal, the losses &#x2013; no, the losses &#x2013; well, there are two separate chapters and the &#x20AC;800 million that are about the CIB, I would say, ordinary risk deleveraging and client asset deleveraging. And the &#x2013; and so the sale of &#x2013; well, of loans portfolio, obviously, and the &#x20AC;450 million are in addition to that, clearly. So you &#x2013; but the &#x20AC;800 million are going to be spread over five quarters. So it's not going to be &#x20AC;800 million in the fourth quarter. But the &#x20AC;450 million are concentrated on October and are related to the sovereign portfolios. So it's clearly two separate chapters.</p>
          <p>About the dividends, well, you know that &#x2013; well, just in the current figures, we have calculated a payment of one-third of our earnings in cash for the dividends. So it's currently the equivalent of &#x20AC;1.7 billion or &#x20AC;1.6 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;1.7 billion that are already deducted from the current ratio. We are at 9.6%. Now the decision about dividend, decision that is taken once every year by the board, and so there is no change to that respect. Strictly no change to that respect.</p>
          <p>Now, the EBA target, that's very clear. The only thing that is, I would say frozen, is the buffer for the sovereign debt meaning that the buffer or the deduction that is going to be taken in the calculation is the actual end of September figures.</p>
          <p>So for us, it's 40 basis points and this is not going to change anymore in the EBA exercise. Even if we would sell everything tomorrow, I mean the 40 basis points will remain 40 basis points. But &#x2013; and they're just &#x2013; they are process of checking the figures for all banks, so those 40 are not yet checked and approved, but this is our own calculation. But once it will be &#x2013; it will have been checked and approved by the EBA, it's going to be frozen until next June.</p>
          <p>But for the rest, the target consisting &#x2013; being at 9% including those 40 basis points. But by all means, indeed, and deleveraging in reducing clients' risk-weighted assets is something that is perfectly possible.</p>
          <p>And at the end, about the dollar effect on the balance sheet, it's &#x2013; on the &#x2013; you had &#x2013; there are two questions. About the dollar effect and the risk-weighted assets, it's in the region of &#x20AC;8 billion &#x2013; it's &#x20AC;8 billion &#x2013; well, the total forex effect was &#x20AC;8 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And about &#x2013; and as for the balance sheet at the end of September, you know that we are not fully closing the balance sheet in odd number quarters. But what we think is that probably due to this dollar effect, the balance sheet was slightly higher than at the end of June and well &#x2013; probably like what -higher than the end of June due to dollar effect.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question now comes from Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Philippe. I have a small series of questions, if you allow. My first question is on the new comment of the EBA last week about the contingent capital eligibility to core Tier 1. I think this endorsement looks quite a bit changed compared to what Basel III was implying? I know that you said in the past that you are focusing on equity Tier 1, but nonetheless, given the concern that you're now faced with by the same EBA and given the fact that you have north of &#x20AC;10 billion of Tier 1 securities, I wondered if this new endorsement is something that changes your view on this type of instrument and whether that's something that you would be then looking at?</p>
          <p>My second question is on the deleverage. So you have a range &#x2013; you have about &#x20AC;230 billion in short-term funding you show and &#x20AC;166 billion in long term. With the deleverage of the assets out of the balance sheet, what are you looking at in terms of the relationship between these two numbers at the end of your plan? Should we assume that most of the deleveraging will affect the short-term funding?</p>
          <p>Then on the other activity, I see that you plan a loss of about &#x20AC;150 million in recurring GOP. Out of &#x20AC;20 billion of risk-weighted asset disposal, backing this out, it's less than 5% ROE in a sense that this business would be generating, which is good to see that it's not costing you much, but why were you in this business, in the first place, just out of curiosity?</p>
          <p>And the last question is, we see with the increase on &#x2013; of the authority, let's say, of the EBA, we also see that the EBA has an agenda of checking the risk weights of various banks. And I wondered, how you see this and how comfortable you are with the projections of your models or, let's say, robustness of your models in regards to the risk weight in particular in light of other geographies criticizing a lot of banks with low risk weights? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Fran&#xE7;ois. Well, I think your first question, I think &#x2013; well, we are complying with the regulations and we are already trying and optimize our behavior in the framework of the regulation. So if some new products are becoming eligible to core Tier 1, well, we would look at them. But at the moment, there is not a lot of clear information about that. And so we'll &#x2013; I think it's too early to draw final conclusions.</p>
          <p>Your second question, first, I would like to say that, the medium- and long-term funding of &#x20AC;136 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;166 billion you are mentioning, you know, we have said that you can &#x2013; mentally, you can add the &#x20AC;49 billion that are also bond issues, but bond that we place within our own network.</p>
          <p>And so depending the way you look at it, we tend to &#x2013; well, this is what &#x2013; well, it can be looked at as being client deposits to a certain extent. But at the same time, they are kind of deposits that are completely secured for the medium- and long-term maturity of the bonds or notes they have bought. So you find the &#x20AC;200 billion-plus. If you add both, indeed, we have issued more than &#x20AC;200 billion medium and long-term securities.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms &#x2013; our aim in the deleveraging and our aim is definitely not to &#x2013; well have a kind of a proportion -freeze that proportion of short-term funding and long-term funding. I think that clearly we have shown on slide 30 and also on the other slide, concerning the dollar. We have shown how we look at it.</p>
          <p>I mean, we look at it &#x2013; the way that we think that the customer activity has to be funded with stable resources, and the stability being provided either by the fact that it's coming from clients &#x2013; and clients here are purely retail and corporate clients only, so we have &#x2013; from the accounting figures, we have deducted the deposits coming from institutionals, even if they are clients, and we have put that in the other category, the short-term funding.</p>
          <p>So either clients, kind of loyal clients, individual or corporate, because they are supposed to be more loyal than institutions, and &#x2013; or medium- and long-term maturities. And so this is why we are comparing the customer activity funding needs with the addition of equity plus client deposits plus medium- and long-term funding. And this &#x2013; I think this is the way we are looking at it, rather than focusing on a proportion between medium- and long-term and short-term.</p>
          <p>And that being said, to complete my answer, clearly, yes, the bulk of the deleveraging will be kind of huge in order to reduce the short-term funding, of course, because the two other categories, by definition, you can't change them, I mean, that fast. The medium- and long-term funding you issue every year. And then it's relatively sticky. And the client deposits, you try and increase them, and they are also relatively stable. So the flexibility is in the short-term funding, so when we are reducing our assets, it's &#x2013; the balance is on the liability side is made by reducing the short-term funding.</p>
          <p>About your &#x2013; yes, the others. You &#x2013; what you have in the other category, I remind you, I mean, those questions were raised <mark type="ph" /> a lot of years ago (47:45) since the crisis. I mean the other category was not under the spotlight. And so in the others, you remember you have all the proprietary investments of the bank and all the participations, the industrial participations of the bank including the AXA participation and quite a lot of others, and also the <mark type="ph" /> team (48:00) portfolio. If you remember the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Oh yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the team portfolio inherited from Fortis. And also Kl&#xE9;pierre. So this is what is in the other portfolio.</p>
          <p>When we said the equivalent of &#x20AC;28 billion risk-weighted assets, you have to bear in mind that it means equivalent, meaning that it also &#x2013; it can come also from a relief from the numerator of the ratio. Because a certain number of those investments are weighing on the numerator of the ratio, so the &#x2013; because they are &#x2013; they have to be deducted from our capital &#x2013; Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>So when we said equivalent risk-weighted assets, it can be a mix of actual risk-weighted assets and some addition or less deduction from the numerator.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the risk-weighted asset question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I missed one question on the risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's just that &#x2013; we can see EBA has more powers than it probably was first thought, and it looks that they have a big agenda on this risk weight control across geographies, in particular in Europe due to the model implementation of Basel II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, yes &#x2013; sorry, sorry. Yes. We &#x2013; well, first, we welcome the authority of the EBA. And we have always been in favor of harmonization in Europe because we always felt that the rules that were actually implemented in France were somewhat stricter than rules implemented elsewhere. And so, we welcome harmonization, firstly, under the agents of the EBA.</p>
          <p>Second, this is a big question about how our risk weights are computed. I think the answer is very simple. The main critique came from the U.S., because some U.S. banks were stating that their risk-weighted assets on assets ratio was higher and is higher than the risk-weighted assets on assets ratio of European banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Spanish banks are joining that debate, it looks like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Spanish banks are joining that debate. Okay. I didn't know about Spanish banks. But I looked &#x2013; well, I've looked into that, and through a very simple way, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.</p>
          <p>So if you compare &#x2013; I've let the kind of back-testing of risk-weighted assets on assets. Just comparing the risk-weighted assets on assets, average of the recent period with the actual losses incurred during the crisis &#x2013; because, after all, the risk-weighted assets are about &#x2013; it's about capital &#x2013; are about unexpected losses. So it's relevant to compare with what happened during a big crisis.</p>
          <p>And so if you do that and you look &#x2013; you take the Bloomberg crisis-related cumulative write-downs and losses that is publicly available, and if you try and put that on a chart, you see that, yes, U.S. banks have a higher risk-weighted assets on assets ratio, but they also have a much, much higher level of losses on assets ratio. And particularly, if you look at that, and it seems even that probably their risk-weighted assets should be even higher to be in line with the ones of Europe.</p>
          <p>Now, within Europe, there are some discrepancies that can be seen, as well, through this kind of back-testing, the main discrepancy being that the investment banks, the pure investment banks were probably kind of favored by the way the risk-weighted assets were calculated on market activity. And I think it's commonly accepted now that risk-weighted assets on market risk and counterparty risk were probably underestimated by Basel &#x2013; indeed, it was Basel I already, Basel 1.5, if you remember.</p>
          <p>And clearly, when you look at the figure, it's striking. And this, of course, is helping &#x2013; <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:58) was helping the pure investment banks more than the universal banks like ourselves. And the universal banks more than the pure retail banks. And that may explain the attitude of &#x2013; well, the comments of Spanish banks and also maybe Italian banks who joined the group. Because, yes, the risk-weighted assets associated with market risk were probably underestimated.</p>
          <p>This is going to be adjusted, completely fixed by Basel 2.5 already and even more Basel III, for market activities will have a significant additional layer of risk weights. This kind of anomaly is going to be fixed. And then further potential heterogeneity between countries, well, I hope they are going to be progressively corrected by the EBA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're confident that you will not be asked more risk-weighted assets than you currently have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as we are concerned, we are extremely confident.</p>
          <p>The first thing is that as far as market risks are concerned, you know that we have suffered only 11 days now, one additional day in this third quarter, either way. But since the beginning of 2007, we have only suffered 11 days of losses higher than the VaR, showing that our value at risk was really robust. Our value at risk model was &#x2013; is robust. So we are very proud of that.</p>
          <p>Second, in terms of the Basel 2.5 and Basel III, because we were already relatively conservative in a certain number of measurements, especially on counterparty risks, the additional risk weights we are going to take are relatively limited, as you know, much more than a lot of other investment banks.</p>
          <p>And you know that for Basel 2.5, for example, it's only &#x20AC;40 billion additional risk-weighted assets and it makes only 60 basis points. So it's completely relatively much less than a lot of others because we were already relatively conservative. So we are truly relaxed in &#x2013; on this debate about risk-weighted assets. And as far as credit is concerned, our models are also robust, and we are extremely &#x2013; well, relaxed on that debate.</p>
          <p>And the losses &#x2013; the cost of risk we have &#x2013; as you can see again this quarter, the actual cost of risk is lower. BNP Paribas always been low. And so the comparison between our, again, our risk-weighted assets on assets ratio and our losses on assets ratio is putting us in a very favorable position.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've got a few questions.</p>
          <p>One of them relates to Italy, you have said historically that owning government bonds allows you to manage your interest rate risk, so I was wondering whether we should now expect a little bit more net interest margin volatility?</p>
          <p>The second one is on the dividend accrual, do you accrue the dividend on the reported earnings including fair value gain on own debt? Because otherwise, I guess, if you exclude it, then there has been no accrual because there has been no earnings?</p>
          <p>And the third one relates to equity revenues. Would you be able to sort of give us a feel as to how much of the poor revenue performance is due to hedging cost and how much is due to the fact that you have reduced inventories?</p>
          <p>And the last question relates to Belgium. I'm not sure I have heard whether you have answered the question on the why it's also an increase in Belgian government bond or why is it your largest portfolio of government bonds? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the interest rate risk, we have two &#x2013; basically, two means that we can use to manage our structural interest rate risk, it's either the government bonds or the derivatives.</p>
          <p>And we were using both, and we are using both. And the only thing is that now the proportion will change, and we are going to use more derivatives and much less government bonds. But the aim to hedge the interest rate risk remains the same, so you should not expect more volatility in net interest margin because of that.</p>
          <p>The dividends, we accrued the dividend the very simple way. We accrue one-third of the net profit group share. So yes, de facto it includes on that revaluation at the moment. Yes, because we do that the simplest way possible.</p>
          <p>Then the hedging &#x2013; well, about the equity derivatives, the bulk of the relatively low performance is coming from hedging costs indeed. Given the huge crisis that occurred in the equity markets in the summer, well, they have very few clients indeed. The business &#x2013; the client business was low, very low compared with the normal &#x2013; and really limited to corporate demand for term equity derivatives. But all the demand from individuals and institutionals dried up almost completely.</p>
          <p>And they just had to hedge their current books. And they did that in a very methodic way because the market was so unpredictable and so volatile that it was necessary. And if you can &#x2013; if you remember, the second quarter of 2010, well, I mean one year ago, when we had the first Eurozone crisis, if you remember, with the volatility that was comparable with what we have seen in the third quarter 2011, the equity derivative, they had made &#x20AC;260 million in that quarter. So much less than for the &#x2013; than what they have made. Well, fixed &#x2013; well comparable with what they have made this quarter, &#x20AC;260 million, &#x20AC;290 million.</p>
          <p>So clearly we are in the kind of same situation where you have much less client flows, so much less opportunities to make margins, a lot of volatility requiring constant dynamic hedging, and a lot of hedging costs.</p>
          <p>The fact that inventory aspect is limited, indeed what we &#x2013; well, what they try and do is to replace cash inventory with futures and listed options, until &#x2013; with the derivatives product that can provide with a similar hedging to &#x2013; of course, you can't do that for everything, because at the end, you have to go down to the senior stock. But for a certain part of the hedging, you can just replace the big portfolios of stocks with the indexes or future on indexes, or option on indexes that are representing the same risk.</p>
          <p>And about your last question, well &#x2013; I will give you the same answer. I mean, we &#x2013; again, we have &#x2013; well, the policy of reducing the sovereign debt is across the board, clearly. It just happened that during this period, while as for Belgian bonds, there was no changes. It's not an increase, it's almost no change. It went up from &#x20AC;16.9 million to &#x20AC;17.2 million, so it's &#x20AC;300 million. So, it's not material.</p>
          <p>Well, this is just incidental, I would say. It was not, especially <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:30) and the &#x2013; we'll keep having an opportunistic approach of this general policy in the future, on the &#x2013; so the Belgian portfolios may decrease as well.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, sir. I have three questions, basically.</p>
          <p>First, can you just give us your gross and net exposures on Spanish, Italian, Belgian and French govies within your insurance business?</p>
          <p>Second question, can you describe what you include in the <mark type="ph" /> unencumbered (63:37) assets, which are part of the liquidity buffer? And is it fair to assume they are not eligible to open market operations of central banks?</p>
          <p>And third question, what is your view on the cost of risk trends in retail banking activities in the coming years? And in particular in Italy, France and Belgium? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost of risk trend in...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start with the cost of risk trend. I'll start with the last one.</p>
          <p>We currently enjoy a low cost of risk both in France and Belgium. I think both countries are probably going to follow the same pattern because the business mix is similar, the proportion of retail versus corporate is similar and the economic situation is also relatively similar.</p>
          <p>So we think that on both cases, we have a low cost of risk, and we think that institutions should stay for some time. We are not seeing any early sign of deterioration of the credit quality up to now.</p>
          <p>With that being said, it's a low level, so there may be some changes for Belgium. If you look the figures, we went from 16 basis points up to 21 in the second quarter, and then now down to 18. So that kind of small movement can occur, depending on the life of the quarter, but we don't see any significant increase occurring up to now.</p>
          <p>Now we are saying that with, having in mind a scenario of low growth next year. Low growth in Europe between 0% and 1%, depending on the country. So in a scenario of a double-dip or whatever, it could be different. But at the moment, and given what things are today, we don't see any early sign of deterioration.</p>
          <p>As far as Italy is concerned, the picture is somewhat different because the cost of risk is much higher. Close to 100 basis points. Due in part to the fact that the business mix is different with the proportion of corporate loans much higher in the total mix than in France and Belgium.</p>
          <p>And here, we &#x2013; I mean, we see &#x2013; well, we have seen &#x2013; if you look at the recent quarters as kind of improving trends, but very slow over the last four or five quarters, we think that this kind of improving trend could stop, could cease due to the, the economic situation in Italy that is going probably to be a relatively very, very low growth next year. And we may even see some &#x2013; that cost of risk moving up somewhat again. Again we don't expect a dramatic change, but we expect the end of the improvement I would say in Italy. So this is for your last question.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to your first question, that is the sovereign risk within the insurance funds' portfolios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You will find all the figures for Greece, Ireland and Portugal in the notes to the financial statements of this second &#x2013; the first half, in the interim results. And they have &#x2013; you will find that since then, they have gone down, of course, and they have not increased. They have progressively moved down and they are extremely small, not material.</p>
          <p>As far as Italy and Spain are concerned, the figures are bigger. We are not disclosing them because they are not that big and because as you know, the &#x2013; those countries, are not under aid programs like the three others, so we don't feel, I would say, necessary to disclose that. And then the bulk of the risk is taken &#x2013; well, it's borne by the insurees as you know, indeed between &#x2013; depending on the company, it's between 80% and 90% of the reset is born by the insurees, so the impact on the accounts of the group and the impact for our shareholders is much lower, as evidenced by the Greek situation.</p>
          <p>So that &#x2013; and your second question, I missed your second question, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just about the unencumbered assets, which are part of the liquidity buffer. I was just wondering whether it was fair to assume they were not eligible to the open market operations of central banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why we had given this figure once. Usually we don't &#x2013; we were not disclosing that figure and we're saying &#x2013; you are referring to slide 31. We were disclosing the &#x20AC;100 billion &#x2013; the unencumbered assets eligible to central banks and &#x20AC;128 billion for &#x2013; at the end of September and deposits with central banks, &#x20AC;42 billion at the end of September. Those figures are completely &#x2013; those amounts are completely liquid. It's completely available immediately and they are the real liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>But we have seen that some competitors were disclosing the total figure including the encumbered assets. And so, we felt was, in order to provide investors with the same level of information, we felt necessary to remind you that we also have the total of eligible assets that is much higher than the &#x20AC;128 billion, indeed it's over &#x20AC;200 billion, the total of eligible assets. The only thing is that part of them are used. They are used either in the repo with the central bank themselves for the monetary policy or the debt to their repo or with repo with third parties, or in clearing systems as a guarantee in the clearing systems.</p>
          <p>So they are not available today. But most of them are going to come back tomorrow if you want. But as of today, when you make a snapshot at the end of September, they are not available as such. So they are eligible. They can be used. But at this very moment, they were already used.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Anke from RBC here, good afternoon. I would like to ask some questions on your deleveraging plans. Firstly, you say the &#x20AC;750 million of your gross operating profit loss so to say is based on your expected profitability taking the new environment into account. And just wondered if we would look on a 2010 basis, what would the earnings contribution of these assets been at the time, because I assume your expected profitability would potentially include your higher funding costs. And I was also wondering, in terms of split of the reduction in risk-weighted assets in terms of disposals versus, basically, not renewing, for example, maturing debt, how you &#x2013; how this would break out? Although you said earlier that you would expect about a 5% discount on an asset disposal, which would imply about &#x20AC;16 billion of risk-weighted assets would be coming from disposals. If you can maybe help a bit.</p>
          <p>And then I'm just wondering, do you &#x2013; will you be aiming for cost plan as well because you obviously have given a &#x20AC;400 million restructuring charge, so is this close to potential cost savings? And then lastly, I was just interested in your deposit trends in some of your core divisions in the third quarter where they were sort of like flat to slightly down. Is this a seasonal trend or is this something you're seeing pricing competition which you're staying out? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Anke. Yes, when we give the figure of the reduction in the gross operating profit in the future, we are referring to the past. Yes, we are not referring to what would have been the future without doing that because it's too complicated. So we are just taking the assets we are going to drop and we deduct the amounts of revenues they are generating and then we add back. So this is, as I said, something like &#x20AC;1.4 billion for the CIB part, for example. And then we add back the re-pricing, meaning that the assets we are going to keep are going to &#x2013; we hope and we think are going to be better margin. And we also add back the reduction in costs that is going to be there because you need less costs if you have less assets. And you &#x2013; we come to the &#x20AC;500 million of CIB, for example, that it's part of the &#x20AC;750 million you were mentioning. So the &#x2013; it's clearly as a comparison with the recent past, so yes, the full year 2010 for example rather than the kind of unpredictable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the &#x2013; about, yes, the 5% discounts, we &#x2013; yes, it means that we are &#x2013; this is the &#x2013; well, we are planning to divest something like &#x20AC;16 billion assets, but this is not in risk-weighted assets. It's in &#x2013; it's priced in nominal value, if you want. It's in balance sheet value issue and the &#x20AC;16 billion you are calculating, the risk-weighted assets &#x2013; the corresponding risk-weighted assets are lower because a significant amount of those assets were very safe with low risk, low margin as well, but low risk and hence, relatively lower weight.</p>
          <p>Then your question about the potential cost savings, we are &#x2013; well, we are going to &#x2013; well, there are several things. On the one hand, there are, I would say, some reduction in the certain teams or activities because they are going to be, well, significantly downsized. And on top of that, we are even and also planning to, maybe, to close certain branches completely or to optimize the setup of certain branches in different countries of the world.</p>
          <p>So again, you have to bear in mind that the bulk of this plan or the core of this plan is related to dollar activities. And hence, it's a wrong assumption to think that the bulk of the savings are going to be in our domestic markets. Our domestic markets are going to be relatively less affected, much less affected than activities abroad, because by definition, the dollar business is largely abroad.</p>
          <p>And then, about the deposits, we have &#x2013; the only countries where we are facing a real deposit competition is Italy. Due to the very peculiar situation where clearly the state is &#x2013; the Italian state has always distributed &#x2013; has kept distributing its debt domestically through the banks network, so this distribution channel of debt is &#x2013; well, as always work in Italy to the contrary to almost &#x2013; well, to a lot of other countries, where the distribution has become really institutional and selling to individuals, that has stopped. And hence, also, in Italy, as the rates, the yields of the government debt is going up, it becomes a very attractive way of investing your savings if you are in Italy and a saver.</p>
          <p>And so the government is, to a certain extent, is now in competition with the banks in order to attract the savings of the Italian households. And because of that, certain number of banks were also obliged to raise their rates, so there is a real price competition in Italy.</p>
          <p>And of course, as far as we are concerned, having not &#x2013; the same kind of problem, when we are reluctant to engage in that kind of competition. So we, of course, we have to remain &#x2013; to keep in touch with our clients. So we have to be cautious, but as &#x2013; well, a kind of general policy, we have not completely followed the price increases that we have seen or the rate increases that we have seen in Italy. And hence, we have lost some deposits in Italy, so it's shown on page 49.</p>
          <p>And we &#x2013; in over one year, we have lost 2% of the deposits and mostly from individuals. And the corporate deposits that are linked to &#x2013; especially to cash management are more sticky. And as we are increasing our cash management business in Italy, the deposits from corporates have gone up. As such individuals, I mean, we have lost deposits so a little bit like the whole of the banking system because of this competition from the state.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one quick question as a follow-up. The &#x20AC;750 million in terms of timing, when does it &#x2013; is it right that it will basically be fully be seen by 2013 and may be half of this next year? Or how should we look at that in terms of timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of timing, we &#x2013; I mean, there is one element that is relatively unknown is the speed of the repricing. But we &#x2013; I think that it's &#x2013; well, I have to say that probably the repricing aspect of it is going to take more time than the two other aspects to be &#x2013; and so we &#x2013; if only because the repricing is completely in the books only once all of that book has been rolled over and this can typically take rather three years than one year.</p>
          <p>So we &#x2013; I think that the &#x2013; probably the bulk of the revenue losses, well, all &#x2013; if you take 2013, so the full year following 2012, probably we'll have &#x2013; normally, we'll have the whole of the loss of revenues and the whole of the expenses in the whole of the savings &#x2013; in saving in expenses, but not yet the whole of the repricing. And so the &#x2013; you have to take into account.</p>
          <p>Now between, about 2012, I think probably it's going to be kind of half a year or something like that. We need to implement progressively. I can't tell you exactly the speed. We'll try to be as fast as possible.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a few questions on your deleveraging project again. In slide 27 when you talk about deleveraging, you're giving a &#x20AC;30 billion risk-weighted asset reductions in CIB, whereas in your presentation some months ago, I think this was a Cheuvreux or BNL conference presentation, you talked of &#x20AC;50 billion reduction in CIB. Can you please detail what is behind this change? Is it because of market's weighted assets? Is it related to worse than expected Basel III impact? Is it simply because you're planning to de-lever less in the financing subdivision? How much of this &#x20AC;30 billion reduction would be linked to financing and how much to markets?</p>
          <p>And also, if &#x2013; because I think this &#x2013; I imagine this amount is expressed in terms of Basel III risk-weighted assets. So, will it be possible for you to give us the equivalent amount in Basel II risk-weighted assets?</p>
          <p>And also, regarding this reduction, the &#x20AC;30 billion risk-weighted assets, how much is the reduction that you can attain by replacing cash stock with derivatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with your last question, I mean, the replacing of cash stock with derivative is not changing the risk-weighted asset that much because &#x2013; it's about markets and risk-weighteds are coming through the value at risk and the counterparty. But it's rather a way to reduce the cash consumption, the dollar cash consumption. But it doesn't change the risk-weighted assets. So it's typically &#x2013; and it doesn't change the ratio either. So it's typically an aspect. So there are several aspects to the deleveraging plan. You have the risk-weighted asset aspect, the ratio aspect, and also the cash aspect, balance sheet aspect, that's another one. So you have several aspects and certain measures are impacting certain columns and not others. So it's a little bit complicated, but &#x2013; so this is for your last question.</p>
          <p>About the &#x2013; well, between markets and financing, clearly, the bulk of the risk &#x2013; overall, there is a majority of the financing businesses. But in terms of timing, it starts with markets because it's the fastest way. For the first quarter, they're going to &#x2013; the progress in the first quarter are going to be driven by markets. But next year, it's going to be driven by financing businesses. And your first question is about the &#x20AC;20 billion missing. I mean we have said that we &#x2013; I mean, the projects we are showing in detail on page 27 are representing only 80% of the announced plan. So yes, there is a missing part that is representing around 20% of the total plan and that we are going to disclose later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But still, if I take into account that missing part, that's, I think, 7 billion more, so there will be a maximum of &#x20AC;37 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets in CIB; whereas, you gave a target of &#x20AC;50 billion reduction, risk-weighted assets for CIB one or two months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x20AC;70 billion risk-weighted assets will probably be beaten in this. We'll achieve more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is why. The main column is the ratio one, if you want. The main target is to cut the &#x2013; to help the ratio, to increase ratio by 100 basis points and this is the main target. And the rest is the way to get it, to get there. And we had said that it will be the equivalent of &#x20AC;70 billion risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>At the end, given the fact that for 80 basis points, we have already identified &#x20AC;63 billion risk-weighted assets, probably, at the end, the bill for risk-weighted assets will be closer to &#x20AC;80 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And just a couple of more questions. Going back to Guillaume's question, macro hedging. He mentioned Italy, but I was wondering because my understanding is that you macro hedge your interest revenues in all your core businesses.</p>
          <p>And you once said that, for you, the worst outlook would be a low rates environment for a long period of time. So I was wondering how is this lower for longer rates environment can affect your macro hedging policies, whether you would see some pressure on interest income going forward or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's due to the fact that the hedges have a maturity issue. So even if we are hedging with several years' horizon in mind, typically for five years horizon in mind, if the low rate environments remains in place for five, six, seven, eight years, of course, at the end, progressively, the hedge are maturing. And yes, but well, historically, that kind of situation has not really existed very often.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just one final question. In slide 8, you're giving your sovereign exposures, net of your &#x2013; I imagine net of your CDS protection. Now, there is some debates on whether the CDSs going to trigger or not. So would it be possible for you to give the gross exposures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have any &#x2013; sorry, but the word net is only written as far as Greece is concerned and it's, of course, of the provisions we have taken. And as far as Spain, Ireland, Italy and Portugal are concerned, the word net is not written at all. And we have repeatedly said that we are not using CDS. Neither to write protection, nor to buy protection.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A series of questions, please. Firstly, what's unclear to me is that your deleveraging plans are focused largely on reducing U.S. dollar dependence. So we should infer from that, that you saw things that the only issue with your balance sheet structure is reliance on short-term dollar funding and nothing else. Why not take this opportunity to make sure that what happened to you this summer doesn't happen again to any other part of your liability structure and reduce short-term funding requirements much more broadly? I mean, right now, what you've announced is just a shade under 5% of the notional funded balance sheet in terms of deleveraging.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there was a big jump in ECB borrowing by French banks in the last month in the LTRO. Did you participate in that? And can you give us your current amount of ECB borrowing, please, as a number net of deposits would be even better? I know you've given us the deposits, the &#x20AC;42 billion there, but just the borrowing net of that would be great.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, can you touch on the drivers of the very large outflows in asset management, please? I think it was about &#x20AC;15 billion in the quarter. And then lastly, I see you flagged this morning in the press conference that you think ROEs should be above 10% to 11% in the coming years barring unforeseen events. I think that was Mr. Prot. Please, could you elaborate on the assumptions you make within this? I mean, if I strip out the exceptionals, including Fortis write-backs, I get something more like 10% and although CIB was cyclically weak, this was all before the deleveraging and the slowdown in GDP that we're seeing in Europe. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start with your last question. Well, the current level, I mean especially this year, I mean there's been a clear &#x2013; I think we are still relatively in a lot of uncertainty before really, I think, a precise target in terms of return on equity given all what's happening and all the &#x2013; the very shaky period and the uncertain regulation on banks.</p>
          <p>So I think it's probably more difficult to give a precise answer to your question. What we just say is that currently we are in, yes, in the region of 10%. Last year, we were at 12% over the year and sort of nine months, we are at 10%, I mean, so we can hope that once things have stabilized and in a normalized environment, of course, not in the midst of the double-dip or to a normalized environment and with the stabilized regulation, maybe we can have some hope to further &#x2013; to improve that current level. That's the only thing we can say.</p>
          <p>About the outflows on asset management, yes, we had &#x2013; well, we suffered significant outflows. It's the addition of several things. The main thing is that from the money market fund, clients, the yield is not very good anymore. Now, interest rates are very low, the money market funds regulation prevent them from any transformation, so they are yielding very, very low returns and at the same time, we try and attract out clients directly on deposits because we are &#x2013; all banks and especially all banks are try and increasing their deposits in order to comply with the new regulation.</p>
          <p>So, in that context, of course, clients are leaving money market funds and especially individual clients and so, we are, yes, there are outflows, but there are also corresponding to the significant increase you are seeing on the sight deposits and also passbooks and other way &#x2013; other kind of term deposits.</p>
          <p>And the second &#x2013; beyond those money market fund deposits &#x2013; money market fund reductions, we have seen outflows also on the equity funds due to the very big crisis in the equity markets and clients who are a little bit desperate after now four years of bad performance of the equity market. And also we have seen outflows in the bond funds because all those noise about sovereign bonds and also the widening of the spreads that are creating a low &#x2013; not a very good performance in the bond funds. So the outflows were a little bit across the board and I think it's relatively common in the industry.</p>
          <p>Now, about your &#x2013; the ECB funding as a kind of &#x2013; well, you are referring to the sharp increase ECB reports from French banks, and indeed, there has been a significant increase, but it's related according to what was disclosed by the ECB. It's related to the MRO and the one-week repo. As far as we are concerned, as a general rule, we don't use these facilities at all. So it's very simple to answer to your question. And that's it, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was a question on the broader balance sheet, the fact that you're still focused on reducing your dollar dependence. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are focusing on the short-term funding because, again, I would invite you to compare the slide 30 and the slide number 29, the two slides referring to the cash balance sheet. And here, we are showing the situation at the end of September for the dollar. And as I said, the funding needs of customer activity are only slightly above the stable funding, clients' deposits plus medium- and long-term funding.</p>
          <p>But just imagine what it was at the end of June because you had the decrease of those assets. You see that at the end of June, the gap was much bigger. And clearly, in dollar, we had a kind of specific situation that was that, indeed, part of our trading assets were financed with short-term resources. Our stable medium- and long-term funding and client deposits were covering &#x2013; more than covering the customer loans, but not covering the trading asset as well.</p>
          <p>And hence, to a certain extent, given the fact that those short-term funding in dollars appear to be kind of unstable all of a sudden and also having in mind in the liquidity ratios anyway, I mean we had to change that. So we &#x2013; well, as we cannot increase the client deposit dramatically in dollar, and we are not a dollar-based bank, the only way was the other way around, meaning reducing the assets. So the movement we are doing in dollar was based on this situation in the first place that was kind of not completely funding part of the trading assets with short-term funding.</p>
          <p>So we were assuming that it was possible to reduce those trading assets very fast in case of the short-term funding is coming down fast as well. And it's precisely what happened by the way. But this is indeed, it's completely limited to the dollar because if you look at the total balance sheet on slide 30, you see that we are covering more than the trading assets and the customer loans already in the overall for the bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So I guess my question is, so broadly for you, this is just a dollar funding issues. You are comfortable with your short-term funding structure ex-dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you can see on page 30, the short-term funding is just a final thing, very short-term assets or liquid assets, eligible assets and hence, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last follow-up. You obviously can't see it in the numbers given that volume growth remains very strong but domestically in France, there's both anecdotal evidence and also if you look at credit condition surveys run by several parties, that show that credit conditions are tightening quite strongly post this summer. Is that something that you're seeing as well? Have you changed some of your lending standards at SME level at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Domestically in France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the lending standards are not changing. I mean, we have always been very strict in terms of risk and I wouldn't say there is a changing in the lending standard. I would just say that what is happening is that the cost, the higher cost of liquidity is passed on to the clients. So, it's more a question of cost, not a question of quantity. But that's perfectly normal.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have some follow-up questions. First one, how the deleveraging will affect the impact of Basel 2.5 and Basel III in term of risk-weighted asset? As of today, do you have any calculation of your projected NSFR after your deleveraging plan? When it's come to short-term funding, on your balance &#x2013; I mean, on your presentation, I calculate that it represent 23% of your cash balance sheet. Where do you think you will be by the end of your deleveraging plan? When it come to the leverage ratio, do you have any target? I think that you are at 22.3 times. Do you have any specific target out there?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on Italy, I think that you have still decreased your cost-to-income ratio. Do you have more room to decrease it going forward? I mean, do you think that you can adjust your cost over there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In Italy, yes, we think we can continue and we &#x2013; yes, the answer is yes, we'll do that progressively as we always do in retail, but we think we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, but then do you have any target in terms of cost-to-income in Italy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We as far as cost-to-income is concerned, it's a little bit the same in Italy and in France and in Belgium. We &#x2013; well, Belgium is a little bit different because the starting point is relatively high, but Italy has already improved a lot.</p>
          <p>So starting from a &#x2013; very competitive level now in the system, we are among the best ones in Italy now, the aim is just to have a positive <mark type="ph" /> growth (1:43:50) effect year after year, so improve by a few tenths of basis points year after year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of leverage, we want to go below 20 and we should go as we expect the kind of around 10% deleveraging due to the plan we &#x2013; well, we expect to be below 20 by the end of 2012 in terms of leverage.</p>
          <p>Then your first question about the NSFR. Again, I will make the same answer as about the LCR. I think those ratios and even more the NSFR are not yet clear if you want because there are &#x2013; there's been &#x2013; everybody is acknowledging now that they have to be redrafted because clearly they are not based on business realities to a large extent, and even the Basel Committee that issued them is acknowledging that they have to be fine-tuned or refined or whatever the word you choose. So it's too difficult today to know what's going to be the end wording of those ratios. So we cannot give any answer at the moment. And anyway, they are not &#x2013; they are supposed to get into force only late. NSFR is supposed to be in 2018 or something like that. I think it's much too early to speak about them.</p>
          <p>And your second question, I missed the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I actually have two questions remaining. The first one was on your short-term funding. It represent 23% of your cash balance sheet and I was just wondering where this ratio will stand by the end of your deleveraging plan in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not looking at that that way, but probably, I think the current &#x20AC;230 billion probably are going to end up below &#x20AC;200 billion. And so the proportion of the total cash balance sheet will probably go, well, in the region of 20%, something like that.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I think, is that important because it depends on how much you have of short-term assets if you want.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Sure. And I was just wondering whether the deleveraging will have an impact on &#x2013; I mean, will have an impact on your projection in term of Basel 2.5 and Basel III when it comes to risk-weighted assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. I have a question on the deposit base. If you look at the total deposits excluding repo, around 50% are coming from retail networks and the rest is coming from other sources. Can you give a breakdown of those sources? Is it financial institutions &#x2013; I mean, not financial institutions I said, but financials, is it corporate? Is it hedge funds? Because you have a large proportion of your client deposits or customer deposits which are short-term of sight and so when you speak about matching the customer assets with deposits, I mean, I'm sure you take into account the mix and the stability of it. So, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Then I have more detailed questions which should be easy. The restructuring charges for Belgium, do we need to assume there will be another &#x20AC;200 million in 2012 as per previous guidance, or, everything is complete at the end of 2011?</p>
          <p>Another question is, what is the amount of risk-weighted assets in the corporate center which correspond to the other activities? And what is the current interbank lending intragroup to BNL because you, of course, source your funding in cheap location?</p>
          <p>And finally, the &#x20AC;500 million impact on CIB in terms of GOI, what's the allocation between financing and capital markets? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of questions. Let's start with the deposit base. You say that half of our deposit base is coming from the retail network but you take only the three domestic retail networks into account, no? Like in that...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, So, the rest...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Club Med, aussi, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean, you mean...</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Euro-Med.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Euro-Med. Okay. Banking life is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:50:16).</p>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; no, the rest is coming. You have &#x2013; as I said &#x2013; well, you have the private banking deposits first that are also, well, taken into account in that deposit base. And then you have &#x2013; yes, you have corporate deposits that are coming directly in CIB, even outside. And also you have also the cash balances of the security services, the custody. And the cash balances coming from the custody business. And I think that's it. The main sources are private banking. Outside the normal retail network business, if you want, the main sources are private banking. Corporate deposits, these are term deposits or deposits trapped in the cash management balances, that is more stable. And the custody, the deposit associated with custody.</p>
          <p>Then, yes, of course, well, part of those deposits are short-term, of course like, a lot of &#x2013; well and  essentially all the sight deposits are one day. But well &#x2013; both in reality and in the regulation, their stickiness is, of course, recognized and factored in. And on the other side, the customer loans also some of them are very short-term and also both in the &#x2013; well, the regulation even more in an excessive way, but it's in our own asset-liability management models, we are also factoring in the fact that part of them are going to be necessarily renewed.</p>
          <p>Then the restructuring charge next year for the Fortis integration, you will have a kind of tail. You will have a tail coming partly from Turkey because Turkey started a little bit later, and the integration of Turkey is going to go beyond the end of the year, and also a few project that are going to last also over next year, part of next year. But it should be very small.</p>
          <p>And then the inter-group lending to BNL, we have in the region of &#x20AC;30 billion, I think. But this is the &#x2013; this is some &#x2013; well, BNL is completely integrated in the bank's treasury management. And you should have in mind that for example, the BNL network is selling BNP Paribas bonds, for example, and so contributing to the liquidity of the group that way, while in the past, they used to sell their own BNL bonds. And so they had less funding needs.</p>
          <p>So again, BNL is completely integrated into the group's Eurozone liquidity management in a completely integrated way. If, I mean, should we &#x2013; up to now, we still hope that this very big &#x2013; I would say, is very big success about the European integration is not going to be put at risk and that the trend of re-enhancing the liquidity country-per-country is going to &#x2013; well, not to tank the Eurozone and that, at least, as far as the Eurozone is concerned, that it's going to be managed at the currency level and not at the country level.</p>
          <p>And we have good hopes with this respect, if only because with the EBA, we have also now one banking authority and also the European Commission is making sure that within Europe, the movement of capital, at least, in the Eurozone are free.</p>
          <p>And then, about the corporate center, what was your question with the corporate center?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I was wondering what is the amount of risk-weighted assets in the corporate center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The amount of risk-weighted assets at the corporate center is close to &#x20AC;50 billion, in fact, &#x20AC;45 billion to &#x20AC;50 billion. Well, when we are saying that we are going to cut &#x20AC;28 billion to that, you have to bear in mind that it's, again, as I said, it's not only risk-weighted assets, but it's also the equivalent of risk-weighted assets coming from less deductions from the numerator of the ratio.</p>
          <p>So if we &#x2013; I'm not going to give any example, but you can imagine that by selling certain participations, we have some deduction from the capital that could be reduced and this is in equivalence of risk-weighted asset.</p>
          <p>And then your last question was about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The breakup of the &#x20AC;500 million gross operating income impact for CIB between financing and the capital markets.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Maxence Le Gouvello from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Philippe, a quick question coming back to the question of my predecessor on the deposit base. If we look to the page 30, your deposit for the total group has been decreasing by &#x20AC;15 billion and when we look to the retail activity with the exception of Italy, it's more rising. Can you give us a little bit of feeling where the decrease is coming from? That was my first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is, I believe, you missed the question of Omar regarding the guidance on your return on equity between 10% to 11% that has been commented at the time of the press conference this morning. And the last one just to add on the request of Guillaume, can you give it back the breakdown of the loan in the emerging countries? You used to do it last year and you stopped in Q1. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the deposit, I mean I think you have to be careful. What we have shown on page 30 is a cash balance sheet that is restated from the balance sheet itself and especially as I said earlier to Guillaume and was not precise enough, we have kept only the retail and corporate deposit in the so-called client deposit on page 30, while in the &#x2013; if you compare with the 30th of June account balance, I mean the financial statements, what they call client deposits or in the accounts is all kind of deposits from all kind of clients including institutions, deposits from an insurance company or deposits from pension fund, for example, or things like that. They are in client deposits for the purpose of the accounts. But here in the cash balance sheet, they have been reclassified in short-term funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because here we wanted to be aligned with the regulation that is making a big difference between retail and corporate that are supposed to be loyal, more or less, retail more and corporates less, but still some kind of loyalty, and while the institutions are supposed to be completely volatile and to disappear in case of stress. And so the short-term funding is &#x2013; so from the &#x2013; if you compare the client deposits we are showing on page 30 in the cash balance sheet and the client deposits as they're shown in the accounts, it's reclassified. First, we have withdrawn the institutional deposits from this figure and we have added back the medium- and long-term funding that is sold to our clients in the networks as we have said, and we have given the figure, &#x20AC;49 billion.</p>
          <p>So this is why &#x2013; if you compare those figures with the accounts, it's a little bit difficult because it's not at all the same classification because here it's a classification more oriented towards liquidity management and ratio management, liquidity ratio management and in the accounts, it's oriented by the nature of the instrument. So, if it's a bond, it's in medium- and long-term funding for the accounts. And if it's a deposit, it's in client deposit even if you know the bond is sold to one of your clients and even if the deposit is coming from &#x2013; even if it's a deposit from a money market fund, for example. While the deposits from money market funds in the cash balance sheet are reclassified in the short-term funding. So, you can't compare both figures directly like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we compare the figures on the same basis, so, at the group level, you were at &#x20AC;554 billion at the end of June, where are you today? Or if we do it on the other way around, on the cash basis, you are at &#x20AC;539 billion end of September, what were...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer, on the cash basis, the answer is that we are stable. We were at &#x20AC;539 billion as well at the end of June.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and thanks. After that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the guidance on the return on equity, we have &#x2013; well, I'm not going to project an answer to an elaborate answer that I couldn't answer. I think that really, I think that you cannot give a guidance a precise guidance without a minimum of stability in the marketplace and clearly, we are not in that kind of situation today. So, we are not giving any precise figure.</p>
          <p>We are just saying that the figure of 16% that has always been the kind of our ultimate target, of course, the cycle and &#x2013; it remains something that we &#x2013; well, that is very challenging, but we don't think that it's completely out of reach. So again, once all the troubled time have elapsed and again, we're seeing that starting from around 10%, we can have some hope to increase that over time once markets have stabilized and once the repricing has been completely achieved throughout the book.</p>
