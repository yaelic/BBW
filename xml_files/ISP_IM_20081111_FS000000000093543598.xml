          <p>My poor name has been destroyed by the speaker, but I'm the same one. And thank you very much to all of you for joining us this afternoon.</p>
          <p>The third quarter 2008 has been quite an extraordinary quarter for all of us. And in this environment, we have put all our efforts on one main target. This target is solidity; solidity of our balance sheet, solidity of our operating performance. We have taken a number of decisions, I want to discuss with you this afternoon and everything has to be looked in this perspective.</p>
          <p>Page number two on the presentation. As I said, reinforcing the solidity of the Group and the sustainability of its revenues have been the main objective. And in that respect, we are wholly satisfactory &#x2013; satisfied, sorry &#x2013; for the results we have achieved.</p>
          <p>The first point, the first part of the presentation will be about the solidity of the bank from the risk point of view, from the liquidity point of view, from the leverage point of view and then from the capital base point of view.</p>
          <p>The second part of the presentation would be about the operating performance and the recurrent and non-recurrent items that affected our results.</p>
          <p>And then the third point that is at least as important as the first two is about the effort we are putting in the acceleration of the creation of synergies and efficiency improvement throughout the Group.</p>
          <p>Page number three. Page number three is the summary of a number of features of ours, of which we are very proud because the kind of things I'm about to read are not that common.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity, our direct customer deposits remain bigger, larger than our loans to customers, and that's the best guarantee to continue growth no matter how the interbank markets behave in the future. The positive position on the interbank position has been confirmed. We are probably one of the very few banks with such a position. We have built it in about 12-months period, and that's another safety on our liquidity side.</p>
          <p>We are also building a basket of eligible assets that can be used with the Central Banks, where we are now in the round of 32 billion and 16 more will be added before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of risk profile, you all know that the very large majority of our revenues come from retail operations. We will provide you with a lot of figures on our exposure in Central-Eastern European countries; that is very limited, and you will see, well-diversified. The ratio between net doubtful loans and loans remains stable below 1%. And the total impact of provisions and net adjustments on operating margin is in the round 25%.</p>
          <p>In terms of leverage, in terms of leverage, if you look at a ratio that will become more and more important and more and more used, I believe, also by Central Banks, that is tangible net shareholders' equity on tangible total assets. We are certainly steadily amongst the best &#x2013; among peers. We will give you a couple of figures on our operational and equity leverage.</p>
          <p>At the end the Core Tier 1, we have a pro forma Core Tier 1 between 7.5 and 8%. I will explain the way we got to that figure. I will explain in a few pages why we have decided to &#x2013; not to have cash dividends on the 2008 results. The pro forma Tier 1 is between &#x2013; will be between 2.3 and 8.8, but we will discuss this figure on the right page.</p>
          <p>Page number four, the interbank position on the left side, at the end of June, you see we were the only ones. This position has been confirmed at the end of September. Obviously, the sample and the peers are fewer because we don't have yet the results of all the banks in the sample.</p>
          <p>The interbank position, right hand inside bottom part of the page, has been built, as I said, in the last five or six quarters. The most important probably part of the &#x2013; of this page is the left bottom; customer deposits, strongly higher than our loans to customers.</p>
          <p>Page number five. Let's look at the funding and the possibility we have to manage our liquidity. We all know that the very large majority of our funding comes from direct customer deposits in retail. I mentioned that the eligible assets with Central Banks that have not yet been allocated. We have not used them yet. 32 billion already available; 16 million more will be available before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And in order to have an idea of our funding capacity on the medium loan in the long-term side, if you look at the total maturities we have for the year 2009, this figure is not far from what our retail networks have placed during the first nine months of the year 2008.</p>
          <p>Page number six, now we look at the risk profile. Risk profile first of all, business mix and the breakdown by business area confirms that 83% of our revenues come from retail.</p>
          <p>Page &#x2013; the following page, page number seven is the breakdown of our figures in Central-Eastern Europe. You see that our shareholders' equity that we have in this part of the world in any one country is never greater than 2% of the total net shareholders' equity of the Group. We are very happy about what our division is doing in this part of the world. But should any problem arise, and we don't expect any, none of the country is at a position to create any trouble for the Group.</p>
          <p>Page number eight, leverage. Leverage, we can see the &#x2013; you can look at the economic leverage on the left side of the page and the capital leverage on the right side of the page. Whatever &#x2013; whichever of these boxes you look at, you see that our leverage at the end of June &#x2013; as of the end of September is amongst the lowest in the industry in Europe.</p>
          <p>Page number time &#x2013; number nine is the same ratio, but the other way around. It's the ratio I mentioned before. It's a ratio we look very much at, and we believe, as I said, that this will become more and more important. The tangible net shareholders' equity over the tangible total assets is at the end the real Core Tier 1 if I can use this definition, and we are and we will remain amongst the very top banks in Europe.</p>
          <p>Summary of what I have said so far is the figure &#x2013; the strange figure we have at page 10. The red square is the average figures of our peer group in terms of risk, in terms of capital leverage, in terms of liquidity risk. And that square, the red square is the average of our profile. The green one inside the box shows very clearly that according to each one of this I mentioned, the profile of our bank is very much more solid that the average of the industry.</p>
          <p>This is an introduction to get to the decision we had taken that is summarized on page 11. We discuss these points several times in the presentations and in the one-to-one. And you know that we had a Core Tier 1 Basel 1 target in our business plan of about 6%.</p>
          <p>I must tell you that given the liquidity, risk and leverage profile, we &#x2013; I described a few minutes ago, this figure might remain the same, but we are aware that the financial crisis, the gravity of the financial crisis and the expectations of the market are for a higher capital ratio.</p>
          <p>At this point, we will see the figure in the following page. We have to take into consideration what we expect from the application of Basel 2 Advanced and what we expect from the divestments and other capital management actions that we discussed in our occasions. And we get to a figure that is certainly comfortable. But most of these improvements will happen only during next year.</p>
          <p>So the Board today has accepted my proposal &#x2013; our proposal &#x2013; the Chairman and my proposal to not to proceed with the distribution of cash dividends for 2008 because we want to make sure that our bank has immediately and without any delay the kind of capital ratios that the market expects from us.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; and let's look at the following page. We have at least two reserves that might become significant in the next month. And of the two dots we have at the bottom of the page, one is the possible initiative by the Italian Government to further strengthening all the capital ratios across the banking system, with a facility that has to be non-dilutive for the shareholders. We are now discussing through our banking association these initiatives and I'm hopeful that an agreement will be found in the next days or utmost weeks.</p>
          <p>Again, it's something that will not be &#x2013; will be acceptable only if not dilutive and it has to be &#x2013; it has to have in effect in terms of Core Tier 1.</p>
          <p>The second area of improvement that is not yet accounted in the figure is the potential value coming &#x2013; the potential benefit coming from the stake we have in the Bank of Italy that is more than 40% of it.</p>
          <p>But these two reserves are not accounted for in the figure. Let's look at the figure. The first column is our capital ratio today after the decision not to have cash dividends on the 2008 results. Core Tier 1 6.2, Core &#x2013; Tier 1 6.9 and total capital 10%.</p>
          <p>The application of Basel 2 Advanced will add and we have a bracket here because we have 0.4, 0.7 because the figures will have to be discussed and approved by the Central Banks and we are not in the position to have an exact figure today.</p>
          <p>At &#x2013; and capital ratios after the application of Basel 2, that is already something available to a number of our competitors, so in the comparison, it's useful to have this further element. The Core Tier1 will get much closer to 7% and the Tier 1 much closer to 8%.</p>
          <p>The last but one column is the effect that we expect in terms of divestments and other capital management actions. I expect this figure to be higher, but is reasonable to just take the goodwill release from the sale or from the listing of asset of ours according to our book values.</p>
          <p>In the last weeks, we have done some little divestments and 200 million worth of capital gains have not yet been accounted in the capital ratios of the 6.2 and 6.9. But we expect to respect the timing of our business plan and to achieve at least these figures during next year.</p>
          <p>So at the end, this 7.5, 8% Core Tier 1 and 8.3, 8.8% figure we mentioned before come from these assumptions do not take into any consideration the two further reserves we listed at the bottom of the page. And we believe it was wise for us to say, whatever happens no matter what, our capital ratios are in line with what the external situation provides for.</p>
          <p>Those figures in our opinion would be higher than what is needed. We would have at that point an excess capital, but that will be an happy problem, how to solve it, and that's for capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Page 13 is the second chapter of the presentation and has to do with the operating performance of the bank in spite of what is happening on the market. Net income 3.8 billion, and if we make the comparison on an adjusted basis, adjusted means without no recurrent asset items, you remember that last year we had quite an amount of capital gains. And without taking into consideration trading profits that has changed dramatically between the two years.</p>
          <p>From an investor point of view, our net income is higher by almost 14%. Operating margin 7.4%, operating cost down, this is a key factor for success in the future. We have already as we will see a very good cost income. It will have to be taken even more down than debt, but our cost control is certainly a key strength of our Group.</p>
          <p>In terms of asset quality, I mentioned before the ratio between net doubtful loans and loans that is stable below 1%. Our reserves on performing loans is 2.4 billion higher than our expected loss obviously, and in the third quarter of this year we suffered from almost 300 million worth of provisions coming from Lehman and the Icelandic banks.</p>
          <p>One point that is important and that gives the evidence of the effort that the bank is doing throughout this organization is the number of new net customers, and new customers on a net basis that means the difference between new customers and the customers we lose. That is close to 140,000.</p>
          <p>14, next page, our balance sheet, very good performance and &#x2013; of both loans for customers and customer deposits. That is the basis on which the increase in our net interest income line is developed. Indirect customer deposits obviously lower for a number of reasons. Performance of the market is the main one, and let's say, the crisis of the asset management activities throughout the world. But you see the trillion of customer financial asset remained the same, despite even the performance effect on our asset under administration and under management.</p>
          <p>Page 15, P&amp;L at the end of September vis-&#xE0;-vis the same period of last year, the black arrow shows a line of which we are particularly proud. The net interest income component grows by more than 12.5%. Obviously, the effect coming from profit on trading is such that from an accounting point of view, operating income is lower by 3.2%. But excluding profits of trade &#x2013; on trading and despite the inevitable performance of commissions income, we are at 1.5%.</p>
          <p>Cost income &#x2013; sorry, operating cost down 3.3% on an adjusted basis. Operating margin up 7.4%, but we have already discussed this point and then we will see line-by-line. The net adjustments to loans, that is a figure growing more than planned. 300 out of the figure of September this year comes from Lehman and the Icelandic banks.</p>
          <p>Page 16, I'll not spend time on this page. But you'll find on this page all the details in order to adjust the figures of both in 2007 and 2008. You will find the list of all the non-recurring items and the effects on &#x2013; of profits on trading on our results.</p>
          <p>Page 17, just a summary on the third quarter results, we consider them wholly satisfactory because the 300 million is a negative impact of Lehman, and certainly changed the profile of the results, but it's certainly a one-off effect. Profits on trading are lower as expected vis-&#xE0;-vis last year and asset under management is an area today creates some problems. But it's a reserve for significant growth for the future.</p>
          <p>One point I will elaborate more on our provisions has to do with a number of more restrictive mechanisms we have introduced on substandard loans. And one point that I hope you will take into consideration is that the third quarter was the quarter where probably we suffered the most in terms of the impact of the IT system migration that we decided to make in advance versus the initial merger plan.</p>
          <p>Page 18, page 18 is the third quarter results. We will elaborate on all of the &#x2013; on all these lines. Net interest income is particularly high in terms of growth, reduction of growth &#x2013; of cost is particularly significant and obviously we have this increase in net adjustment to loans but we would see together that a good part of them comes from one-off components, and we will try to identify together which one will be &#x2013; might be the running rate from now on.</p>
          <p>Page 19, the same page we saw before, to adjust the quarter figures and understand the different non-recurrent items and the profit on trading effect, then line-by-line, the main component of our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Page 20. Page 20 is net interest income, year-on-year at the end of September, plus 12.6%, more than we expected. And it means that the activity and the effort we are putting in developing the volumes both on the deposit side and on the loan side are paying. The attention we're paying to mark-ups and mark-downs are starting as we planned to give good results.</p>
          <p>The volumes, the volume increases are listed on the left side, bottom part of the page. You'll see that all the different segments are contributing to the growth. We have been quite prudent on the SME side, but we are happy in terms of risk profile.</p>
          <p>Following page, page 21 is the breakdown of the components that now &#x2013; that contributes &#x2013; contribute to the net interest income growth. The almost 1 billion growth come to a large extent from operating impact. That means from volumes and from spread management. The finance and treasury department is contributing because as I said before, the amount of reserves in terms of liquidity we're building up, are significant and that has also an effect in terms of the interest rate. It has some effect also on trading losses and profits, but certainly this policy of ours has a good effect in terms of interest income.</p>
          <p>Page 22, commissions. Commissions are down &#x2013; are down mainly or practically, exclusively because of the decreasing commissions from management dealing and consultancy activities, asset management in a word. This is an area that is very difficult to compensate in the short-term. People are afraid and fear of the markets, they prefer to have that is something all of you know very well. People prefer government bonds under administration than any kind of asset management products.</p>
          <p>This is an area that remains a reserve for growth. And as you see on the following page, 23, because even if the asset under management has decreased significantly not only for a negative net collection but also because of performance effects, the total amount of asset under administration and direct customer deposits together are higher than the decrease in asset under management.</p>
          <p>So the total net effect in terms of customer financial assets is positive. And the fact that this figure is positive despite what is happening in the real economy and despite what we have paid in terms of service quality during the migration period, we have the third dot in &#x2013; on the page that gives you an idea of the kind of number of people that has been distracted by commercial activities and that has been devoted to the definite migration of all the branches through the single IT system for the Group.</p>
          <p>In any case, it was important to make sure that you are aware of the fact that we are not losing these financial assets. The mix is certainly less profitable than it used to be. But the reserve for &#x2013; the potential for future growth is intact, is even probably &#x2013; it's probably more than intact. And the evidence of it is the figures on the right hand side of the page, where we have the &#x2013; another evidence of the fact that the number of our customers grow also in this very difficult periods of time.</p>
          <p>Page 24. Page 24 is profits on trading, obviously a very dramatic decrease. I cannot say we expected it, because actually when we made the budget 12 months ago, we expected in the last quarters of the year to become more normal. But that was not the case, and we all know that the third quarter has been an awkward quarter on the markets everywhere in the world. We have a positive figure for the third quarter, but these are very negligible one for Q1.</p>
          <p>Page 25 is the &#x2013; shows the different components that get to 41. The first line is profits coming from customer services. They are lower, but they show that this kind of activity remain sound. Capital markets and financial assets available for sale is a very low figure. But there are nothing &#x2013; no kind of merchant banking activities have been finalized during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The proprietary trading and treasury excluding structured credit products is negative. Here the reasons are several for sure, also the liquidity reserves we have created has contributed to make this figure a bit more volatile than it used to be.</p>
          <p>Structured credit products minus 33, but you have to take into consideration that we have used the new IAS reclassification criteria and should we have used the same criteria then the previous quarter, this figure should be increased by more or less &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>We decided to move a number of financial assets from where they were to new positions in the balance sheet and you have all the details obviously of these reclassification because we will help them until maturity we believe that those securities are actually credit positions on which the bank &#x2013; we will not lose money during the period of the life of these securities. But in order to make the comparison exactly the same, you should remember that the 107 million should be added to the 33 of the last line.</p>
          <p>Page 26, is the usual analysis on our &#x2013; of our structured credit products portfolio. In the attachments, you have like the previous quarters all the details of each category of asset lines in this portfolio. It remains a stable and in our opinion, high quality portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page 27 operating cost. I believe we have good reasons for being satisfied about cost controls. The negative figure you have on the left hand side show that we are well ahead of our business plan targets and we are accumulating some advantage on this side. That's something that we have to do given that revenues are not and cannot be in line with our previous expectations.</p>
          <p>Page 28, a number of staff reductions. All the figures on this page have already been organized and agreed upon. The blue ones have already been realized, the others will be realized according to plans and agreements by the end of last year.</p>
          <p>This is one of the reason why on page 29 you have the yellow cloud that says that we will have cost synergies before the end of the business plan higher than expected by at least 250 million. And you see on the left hand side of the page that we consistently beat the target of the &#x2013; of our business plan. But it was an obvious and due decisions to do more on cost given the revenues trend, and we will do even more in the future.</p>
          <p>Page 30, our cost income compared with the cost income of our peers that was at the end of June. We believe that we remain and we would remain amongst the best performers according to this criterion to this ratio.</p>
          <p>Page 31, provisions. Provisions &#x2013; the provisions on risk and charges has decreased significantly. On the other side, the net adjustment on &#x2013; to loans have increased by almost 30%. The rest is Lehman and Icelandic banks that will consider a running rate of the bank.</p>
          <p>In analyzing this increase, if we look on the right hand side, we have to find a reason for moving from 4. &#x2013; 402 to 601, so more or less 200 million. Part of it will become physiological; part of it is explainable by two decisions of ours. One is in the round of 50 million and it's a sort of step that we have created by making the mechanism of transferring past due to substandards and more stricter, and that we can &#x2013; can be considered a step. And the other one is the increase of our generic reserve on the performing loans that is bidding around of 60 million.</p>
          <p>What's the running rate from now on? Obviously, I do not know. Our best estimate as of today is that it will remain between 500 and 600, given the economic cycle. So our best estimate as of today is to have between 5 and 600.</p>
          <p>Non-performing loans, the total figures, these are figures I have already given. The doubtful loan coverage is stable at 71%. I already mentioned loans that have reserves on performing loans that is more than adequate that we &#x2013; let's see &#x2013; that most of the substandard loan flows is in small businesses, and SMEs. And they are concentrated in industries that are much &#x2013; are very exposed to the cycle like construction, distribution, metals and in the &#x2013; in services in general. And these are areas of our portfolio that represent in the round of 24% of our Group loans.</p>
          <p>This is an area where we will concentrate a lot of attention, where we are increasing the number of people that are dedicated to identify in advance what is happening, manage from an administrative point of view, the past dues, manage from a credit and legal point of view, the substandards then obviously then the doubtful loans as they became doubtful.</p>
          <p>Page 33, is simply to give you an idea of the kind of diversification of our portfolio. That blue little square, little &#x2013; sorry, the red points we put on the left hand side on the bottom of the page is to confirm that our largest single slice of the pi that are residential mortgage portfolio &#x2013; the residential mortgages are very sound in terms of quality.</p>
          <p>The weight of the installment on the income of the households is in the round of 33% and the loan-to-value remains lower than 50%, as we announced also in other occasions. The average life is 20% -- 20 years.</p>
          <p>Page 34, the breakdown by division. I will not go through each of the division figures in order to give you as much time as possible for questions. The two yellow clouds are important because the corporate and investment banking division accounts for more than 500 million worth of EVA, and proprietary trading that is part of this division obviously destroys a good part of the contribution. While public finance, if you exclude Lehman, has also like all the other divisions, a positive contribution to the overall EVA results.</p>
          <p>So I would stop here because the last page, page 42 simply summarizes what I have said during the presentation in terms of solidity, focus and decisions we have taken to &#x2013; in the interest of all shareholders we believe to make sure that the bank is also perceived as solid as we know it is.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much, and I am ready for your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Alessandro Roccati from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Go ahead, Alessandro.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Couple of questions from me, the first one is on the cost of risk. You obviously said we &#x2013; you expect an increasing cost of risk going into the fourth quarter and you're looking at more or less charges of around 5, 600 million in the final quarter. Just wondering whether you can give us any indications going forward whether this is going to be the run rate for the first part of the next year?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the growth of standard loans, which have increased by 1 million &#x2013; 1 billion in the third quarter, if you can expand on that, please. And the third and more specific question is on the situation in CE, where do you see volumes and where do you see asset quality in that region please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as cost of risk, we &#x2013; our best estimate as of today of the total provision to loans figure is between 500 and 600 per quarter. In terms of &#x2013; then &#x2013; as far as the second question is concerned, we don't have any specific concern. One point we made on the page concerning Eastern European countries, you'll see that the two countries that are more risky are mostly that is Russia and Ukraine, are so focused on small business and individuals that we consider the risk well under control. So there is really nothing specific I can enlight as a special situation in that part of the world.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Fabrizio Bernardi from Deutsche Bank. You mentioned no cash dividend for '08. What does that mean? I mean it &#x2013; is it like a script dividend meaning that you are going to distribute the new shares of Intesa Sanpaolo? Then on '09 dividends, I have seen in the presentation that you are not ruling out that even the '09 dividends can be capped or diminished according to market condition, and so to the profit and loss?</p>
          <p>And then, on pro forma Core Tier 1, I think you are very, very bullish on the pro forma figure. So this means that probably capital gains coming, I don't know from which asset disposals are very, very close. Can you give your comments on this, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question, we said no cash dividends because we wanted to say no cash dividends, in the sense that maybe something else. But as of today, we can only say that we don't expect any cash dividends.</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; as far as 2009, I am so much unhappy about the decision I had to propose that the sooner we get to normal payment, the happier I am. And so, there is no way we can take today any commitment, given the unpredictability of the economy and the world situation. But we want to get back to normal dividends as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>And asset disposals might certainly help, even to anticipate this coming back to normality. We are not that bullish, because in the figure we have put in the column of capital management and disposals, actually we have included only a part of the assets that theoretically &#x2013; non-core assets that theoretically can be disposed.</p>
          <p>So we consider that a reasonable &#x2013; those are reasonable figures, also because we have not included any capital gain. But it's only the goodwill effect of such disposals. So I must tell you that, as I said also in previous occasions, we are quite confident that we will make those figures and more before the end of the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And given your commitment regarding, I mean Core Tier 1 and other way to organically improve this ratio, we cannot rule out any capital increase or the fact that Intesa Sanpaolo as well as many other banks, I mean, you don't speak about other banks, actually that could use the governmental measures in order to improve the Core Tier 1 structure of banks?</p>

As far as this &#x2013; the subordinated loan that the government might propose to the bank toward the banking system, we will certainly consider that possibility very, very closely. And if there are no negative dilution effect for the shareholders, we are ready to use that opportunity to make our ratios even stronger than the ones we have in the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon, Mr. Passera. I also have two or three questions. Going back on capital and capitalization in more general terms, how do you feel the standards are changing? And how do you feel now, you want to see your capital ratio moving. What kind of discussion you're having with the government or with the Central Bank? Is there a new level that's on a divisional basis, on a Group level, the bank &#x2013; the Central Bank is also guided towards? Do we want to have a 7, do we have a 8% LTV ratio? What do you feel is comfortable and what do you have as guidance from the Central Bank, also given what is happening internationally, but not all the banks have the same here?</p>
          <p>And also on risk weighted assets, you have a close to 9 billion increase in risk weighted assets on a comparable basis, I believe, and quarter-on-quarter. Can you give us visibility of exactly what is the reason for that? Also, because I believe that the loan growth that you have, the loan increase is actually due to a reclassification of assets rather than real growth. So, how much is growth or how much is rate immigration and so on?</p>
          <p>On Central Europe, can you give us an indication on whether you had your current exposure for the banks that you own at least the major two, three banks in terms of their P&amp;L or in terms of their equity invested there? And also some indication if you have it, on what if, if any, the currency mismatch that is being in run in those banks?</p>
          <p>And then as a third point, for those assets that have been reclassified for trading and available for sale into loans, can you give us an indication of which type of assets they are, is this largely the structured credit portfolio or are there other assets that you have actually moved into loans and receivables? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have all the details on the reclassification on page number one, so you will let me know if those details are sufficient to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>As far as your first question, we believe that the kind of pro forma ratios that we have in our presentation are higher than what the new standards will be or the new requirements will be. We believe that those figures are and provide room for further growth. So we don't expect those figures to become the standards or the requirement, but by reaching those figures, we will be well above any requirements we will receive from authorities.</p>
          <p>9 billion risk weighted assets is more or less 1.5 coming from reclassification, the rest is 50% cash and 50% committed lines.</p>
          <p>As far as the third question, I must admit I did not understood exactly your question about Central-Eastern European countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the third question, my point was, do you actually hedge the currency for the consolidation of your subsidiaries, at least the main subsidiaries, in terms of the P&amp;L that you're taking from the subsidiaries, or also do you sometimes actually hedge their equity investments as well somehow in the main subsidiaries? You may or you may not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And for the first question on the assets reclassified, what I intended to say is the total 10 billion more or less, are these all the structured credit portfolio or are there other assets that actually have also been reclassified?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Out of the 10 billion is about 4 billion structured products and the rest are school loans, government bonds, and other kind of things, but structured credit products account only for 4.2 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Mr. Passera, I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the guidance you give about Core Tier 1 after the cancellation of cash dividends. You say 6.2% at the end of September. I just &#x2013; I find difficult to understand why the benefit seems to be in the region of 40, 50 basis points max, considering that you are canceling 3.7 billion of cash dividends out of 400 &#x2013; 400 billion RWAs. Maybe the explanation is the available for sale that has been eventually depressed further over the past &#x2013; over the past three months?</p>
          <p>And the second question I have is, what do you feel about the government? What's your opinion about the government pushing banks to lend money, or eventually not to stop lend money in such a difficult environment? We have been seeing couple of 100 million more provisions just in 1Q, eventually hard for this to be considered one-off, excluding Lehman and excluding Iceland banks. Do you really feel that you can let the loan book grow in such a way, eventually consuming capital and putting this capital at risk in such a difficult environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 6.2 comes from growth of assets first of all, the Lehman effect and so the lower than expected profit and certainly the AFS reserve adjustment has also affected the figure. As I said, we are now already close to 6.3 because of the divestments we have done after the closing of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Government attitude, I must say it is very respectful. We have not received any push, any forcing on us in any respect. And even if the loan by the government is agreed upon, I do not expect any commitment, any formal commitment, in terms of pushing credit where credit is not the quality one.</p>
          <p>One point I want to make very clearly is that a good part of the market, a good part of our customer base is, and remains a very trustworthy one. And the largest majority of our customers, company customers keep working in the &#x2013; not in any way considerable in trouble, and not worth lending money to. So please do not enter into the syndrome that there is no way you can profitably lend money to households or to companies in Italy and in the world, because this is not absolutely the case.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Eugenio Cicconetti from Dresdner Kleinwort. Mr. Passera, the &#x2013; just a couple of questions. The first is if in your calculation of Basel 2 Advanced, are you including also the pro-cyclicality effect, and if you can share with us what kind of number it is for you?</p>
          <p>And the second is, I want to make a step back on your potential goodwill impact on your capital management. So we should assume that 6.6 and 6.9 is the final target, considering these market condition, and nobody is able now to sell any asset in the market. So how confident are you to get a portion of these and to reach a pro forma level that is in my view more closer to 7% without raising capital on the markets? So, because my big question here is on your 90 or 110 basis points capital impact that are coming anyway from asset disposals. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was waiting for some elements on the first line for in terms of your first question, and I will start with the second and the third. Potential goodwill, the goodwill we will cancel because of the disposal we have in mind is the one we have in those projections. And I consider that effect the minimum we will achieve. And I do not agree that by definition in the next month, the assets we have in mind will not be sellable.</p>
          <p>In a number of cases, we have already done it, and I mentioned some divestment we have done already during the year, and also after the closing of the quarter, branches of Cassa di Risparmio di Orvieto, we have sold almost 1 billion worth of real estate in the &#x2013; before the end of the quarter. So the world has not finished, and most of the assets that we have on the table for sale will be sold. And so I don't have any doubt that by the end of the next year, those figures will be done. My best bet is that we will also add some capital gain to what we have in those figures, in terms of goodwill reduction.</p>
          <p>Another point that is very important is that by the combination of the two reserves we listed on that page, the subordinated loan by the government and/or the divestment from the Bank of Italy shareholding, we will not only compensate for the possible lack of achievement on the other divestment while we &#x2013; but we certainly go beyond what we put in those targets.</p>
          <p>In terms of pro-cyclicality or something effect, theoretically we might benefit from something between 90 and 120 basis points. But we have decided to use only less than half of it. So in the brackets we showed there are between 40 and 70 basis points.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have some questions. The first one is on the disposal of the Bank of Italy stake, just some color on that. How likely do you believe that this disposal, because we have read many times in the newspapers that about this possibility? And do you think that it's easy to solve the problem of the valuation of the Bank of Italy? Because I remember that two years ago there were discussions and then we saw valuations from 3 billion to 20 billion, so just an idea if you believe that this is, let's say, likely deal or not?</p>
          <p>The second question is on cost. Just if you can give an indication 2009, if you believe that the actions implemented could decrease cost in absolute terms? And a final question on the fourth quarter if you believe that the restructuring of the Zaleski debt could bring some other provisions in the P&amp;L? Thank you.</p>

I'm not in a position and in any case, I don't want to make any comment of it &#x2013; on it. We had to make that &#x2013; make clear that line that means that disposal is a theoretically and potentially available, but I'm not in the position to make any comment.</p>
          <p>Costs, yes, we will have a negative figure in 2009. And third question, no, we don't expect any provision on the position you mentioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is Giovanni Carriere from Execution. My question number one is in the press release, you referred to a more conservative outlook for the rest of 2008 and partly due to a deterioration in September and particularly in October. Can you provide more details on where do you see this deterioration? Is it more in trading or is it underlying credit quality? And also here we see the data on the virtue of 180 days, but do you see anything specific maybe on the &#x2013; on a 90-day basis or 60 days?</p>
          <p>And than number two, on the 10 million loans that you &#x2013; or 10 million assets you classified into the loan book, can you provide the impact on the net interest income so that we can compare on a like-for-like basis, if there has been any impact in the quarter and going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The deterioration we mentioned is on the outside world. We think it's wiser not to make any evaluation and projection given the unpredictability of the world around us. But we are not perceiving any specific deterioration inside and on our figures.</p>
          <p>The net interest impact of the reclassification is 9 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And if I can one last question. Compared to our end of August, one significant change in the environment is that the caps in interest rates of the ECB, and probably there will be more. Can you give us may be some guidance on the impact on &#x2013; particularly on the mark-down given your large base of the deposits and current accounts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>As of today, we believe that we will be able to compensate the decrease with an even stronger management of the mark-ups and with the kind of hedging facilities we have put on the deposits. So as of today, the effect of what has been decided in our opinion can be compensated internally.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have one question left. You said in the beginning of the presentation that you think that the gearing ratio will become more important. Could you tell us why you think so? Just to my knowledge, both among the European banks with the highest tangible equity to tangible assets ratio, where the Icelandics and we all know what has happened to them, so why is this? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; I cannot say that there cannot be exceptions to the rule, but taking into account total assets and not assets after weighting them with instruments that not always are very clear is the safer. And using the net equity without taking into consideration the goodwill makes the ratio stronger. So in my opinion, taking debt ratio at least into consideration is safer from an investor point of view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just couple of question on the net interest income. The first is, if you look at page 21, finance and treasury, the delta year-on-year is 221 million, which is almost double the figure of what you would have thought in H1 '08. It was 117. So I don't know if you can give us a rough idea or a guidance on the evolution of this item over the &#x2013; for coming quarter, particularly in light of the refinancing maturities that in case has to go through. And also related to this question, if you can give us an idea of the outstanding refinancing maturity for this year and in the year '09?</p>
          <p>And the second question that I have: if I look at the end of Tier 1 loans, I see that there is a growth year-on-year of 11.7%. Now this is probably also due to this reclassification. So if I strip out the available sub-sale and a bit of <mark type="inaudible" /> asset that's been reclassified as loans receivable, still have a loan growth year-on-year of 8.5%, which is very material and higher than what we have seen in the precious quarters. So again, if you can give us an idea of how much of this is sustainable and why we are seeing such a strong and robust loan growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will try to answer two questions that are not that easy, but I'll do. First question, if you take the kind of trend we have created in terms of liquidity from &#x2013; in the last five quarters, you'll see that quarter-after-quarter this figure has kept growing. And today, the result of the liquidity position we have created and that we will maintain, we will keep also in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>The need &#x2013; the refinancing needs, we will have in the 2009 are explained on page five. And you have the detail of the medium and long-term funding needs that we will have in 2009.</p>
          <p>And as far as loan growth, you have the details about different segments on page 20, and I must tell you that and this is partially an answer to a colleague of yours that was mentioning before the riskiness of the lending activity. We believe that a good part of the economy in the countries where we operate and especially in our country, are not yet suffering from any external event in such a way that they become risky. And a lot of them keep investing and a number of them have increased in the last few months, they request not because of troubles, but maybe because they have to cope with liquidity problems of the international banks.</p>
          <p>Be sure that we are paying the utmost attention to the credit quality issue because we are well aware of the fact that growing on the first line but losing on the provision line would be quite an unwise way to grow.</p>

          <p>I want to be sure that you got the first answer when -- because when I mentioned our liquidity position, if you take page four, you have exactly the trend in our liquidity position right hand side bottom part of the page. And you'll realize that the kind of benefit that we can get in terms of interest rate from a liquidity position that has changed sign in the &#x2013; of the size we have created is very material.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First question is a follow-up on net interest income. My question is net of interest coming from the liquidity position, what will you expect in terms of customer spread looking forward for 2009? If I understood properly, you said that thanks to re-pricing you are able to offset completely the impact coming from the 100 basis point cut from the DCE.</p>
          <p>The second question is adjusted figure on the tangible equity because I've seen many different figures around &#x2013; on your tangible equity, so I will like to ask you if you can share what's the number based on which you calculate the leverage ratio?</p>
          <p>Third question, I understand that probably this is not the right timing for asking you this. But, is there any time next year during which you will update business plan or at least give us some idea about what kind of target you have in mind? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the way tangible asset and the ratio on tangible asset has been calculated, I would strongly suggest you to call our IR people because you will get in that way much better figures and details.</p>
          <p>Interest income, we expect to be able to defend the growth because even if prudently volumes will continue to grow not at the same level we've had in the last quarters but at the same time we are experiencing the possibility as we expected actually to manage the write-offs &#x2013; I'm sorry, not write-offs, the mark-ups better than it used to be only weeks and months ago.</p>
          <p>As far as the business plan, I have always said that like in the previous cases, the last year of each business plan becomes the first year of the following one and we will, during the year we will present the new business plan. It might be in the first half, given the changes in the world and as soon as we can consider the environment more predict -- at least partially predictable.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a simple question, I know that you elaborated a lot on this. Just if you can give us the sensitivity of interest income to 100 basis point rate cut? Thank you. I mean in terms of 1 million Euro?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yes, you will find this figure also on our report is 170. But I will not repeat the main reason that there are several reasons why we believe we will able to compensate to a very large part of it.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I would like to go back to loan provisions if I may. You already inflated while...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I'd like to go to -- go back to loan provision, if I may. You've already indicated that we can expect an average charge between 500 to 600 million per quarter. Could you give us some guidance in relative terms, according to slide 31 in the first nine months of the 2008, net adjustments to loans, to total loans has been 45 basis points. So can we expect further deterioration in that ratio in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what the figure I gave you means that what we had in the last quarter without after eliminating the one short effect and the non-recurring items is as of today the best estimate that we can provide. It was a way to try to give you some guidance. And if you take the 850, you take away Lehman and Icelandic banks, you will take away the step in the mechanism and the increase in the reserves on performing loans, you get to 500. Given the unpredictability of the world something around of between 5 and 6 is as of today the best estimate I would make, if I receive this question.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes through from the line of Antonio Guglielmi from Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, Antonio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Antonio Guglielmi from Merrill. I've got three questions, Mr. Passera. The first one is again on capital. You've got lot of questions on the dividend. Mine is, why your decision of cutting the dividend now rather than waiting for year end? What I mean is that, given you just mentioned that the government intervention will be Core Tier non-diluted measures. So it look to me that by using the government support and given Basel 2 Advanced, you could get about 7% even without cutting the dividend. So why decided now because you know that you will need more than 7%, or because you're not planning to use the government support or may be because you're not sure the government intervention will come in the form of Core Tier capital?</p>
          <p>Second question is on management, and I am sorry to ask you this. But we have a few press reports talking about potential management changes taking place. I am wondering if you can comment on that and specifically if this might be related for potential government intervention?</p>
          <p>And finally, my usual question on fees and asset management, yet another not nice quarter if I can say so, on the fee income side. Can you give us a picture of what your expectation is there? I know that from the disposals, we're talking about 2009 now. But in the mean time what should we expect from the fee income line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the second question because you, Guglielmi, you succeeded in surprising me, but negatively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I knew that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only idea that the government can try to influence ourselves or our bank in terms of management decisions is something so far from imagination that if you want I can answer with a clear no. But I'm really surprised that the question was asked.</p>
          <p>As far as management, we are working on the new business plan and there are a number of organizational issues on the table. I have in mind a number of ways to further strengthen and reinforce our Banca dei Territori that is the bulk of our activity and I should &#x2013; I would not say the truth if wouldn't say that there are some disagreements on some organizational issues. But having said that, we are discussing on these issues and hopefully we will solve them.</p>
          <p>Why did not we wait for the year end? Because in such an unstable market, we thought it was in the interest of everybody to make sure that no risk of lack of solidity perception is knit around our bank. So should we find ourselves in a better position the next thing there is no reason not change maybe our decision. But as of today, we say even if nothing else is done, even if no other reserve can be used, even if nothing happens, in any case these banks has a clear quality Core Tier 1 position with a ratio that is more than what is the risk profile and leverage profile would need. So we did it in -- and we think that we did it properly in the interest of all shareholders.</p>
          <p>Commissions, best bet for the next quarter is in the round of what we had in the third one, but very hard to make any projections.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Passera. If I can just follow-up, <mark type="inaudible" /> has been telling me that if by next spring you will manage to dispose some assets, so to use the government support in the way you think is appropriate? Also what are the reasons you can still revisit your dividend decision at the moment or that's taken and that's it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only debt cannot be called back. I mean as we say in Italian, for sure we want to make the position of the bank as safe as possible. Should we win at the lottery, maybe something will be changed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much to all of you. As I said in trying to answering the last question, we have decided to take a difficult decision, but a decision that is in the interest of all the shareholders. Solidity today is priority number one, sustainability of results goes with it, and the bank is reacting very effectively to a very difficult environment. So, thank you again to all of you.</p>
