      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to our FY 2011 conference call. First, I'd like to focus on the highlights of 2011 and then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, will provide you with the financials in greater detail. After that, I'll give you the outlook for 2012 and finally, we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation and discussion are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We'll not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move to the presentation. I'll start with the highlights of 2011. We achieved the guidance we put in to the marketplace. The latest guidance on organic growth was 5% to 6% and we came out with 5.9%. Just to remind everybody, we started out the year by guiding revenue growth of 3% to 5% and should go up at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT margin, we have guided throughout the entire year at 13% and we ended at 13%. And adjusted EPS, we have guided throughout the year at approximately 10%-plus and we came out at 11.3%, meaning we hit all the targets that we've set ourselves.</p>
          <p>What does it mean? All key financial targets achieved or exceeded. We saw a good mix between all business group continue the possible growth, meaning gaining market share and improving on the P&amp;L on all lines.</p>
          <p>We continued to see double-digit growth in the emerging markets, despite the very difficult conditions, particularly in Middle East in the beginning of the year and in Thailand by the end of the year. We have a strong financial discipline, which you see our balance sheet. We announced our new sustainability strategy that we'll execute upon throughout 2012 and beyond. Overall, we laid the foundation for the performance that we will be expecting in 2012.</p>
          <p>On the challenges, we continue to see high volatility within the market due to crisis, natural disasters and of course, also, the financial unrest within Europe. Raw material prices came to an all-time high, higher than the &#x2013; on certain products than what we saw in 2008. And subsequent, the gross margin became under pressure throughout the year, which was offset by selective re-pricing.</p>
          <p>We've continued to see intense competition and a lot of strong promotional pressure. However, overall, we see a successful year in a challenging environment, hitting the targets that we put out in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>For Laundry &amp; Home Care, we saw solid organic sales growth. Adjusted EBIT margin increased to new record high levels. We saw across the board all regions growing, despite declining markets in certain regions and the emerging markets grew mid-single digits.</p>
          <p>We saw, across the board, further market share gains, high level of promotional pressures. Despite those, we were able to make progress on our EBIT line and a high innovation rate of 41%, meaning that 41% of the business in Laundry &amp; Home Care are generated by products which has been less than three years in the marketplace. Overall, enhanced performance in a highly competitive environment.</p>
          <p>On Cosmetics and Toiletries, strong organic sales growth for the sixth year in a row. Adjusted EBIT margin further increased to record high levels. All regions growing and the emerging markets grew double-digit. We did see market share gains across the board and similar picture on promotional pressure. Despite promotional pressure, we were able to substantially increase our EBIT line. Innovation rate at 43%. Overall, strong performance in a highly competitive environment.</p>
          <p>On Adhesive Technologies, very strong organic sales growth. Adjusted EBIT margin further increased to record high levels. All regions growing; emerging markets double-digit. We did see market share gains and we substantially took up the innovation rate to around 30%. So, as you can see, across the board, all business groups contributed to the 70 basis points of progress on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the next slide, organic sales growth of 5.9%, so at the very high end of our range, 3.4% reported. Adjusted gross margin down 130 basis points. Lothar will take you through the bricks and the details on this. Adjusted EBIT grew and surpassed &#x20AC;2 billion for the first time with 9%. Margin grew by 70 basis points. EPS grew by 11.3%, above the 10% that we put out. And net working capital, the number I was critical about in the third quarter, running around 7.8%, 7.9%, down to 7.3%, so we did make the progress that we aimed to make throughout the year, a bit higher than last year but nothing worried, 7.3% is a very satisfactory number. And net debt further down to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. So a strong performance in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>We also announced the succession in our CFO. Carsten Knobel, who has been with the company for many years, will succeed Lothar, when Lothar retires end of June. Carsten is currently Corporate Senior Vice President in our Cosmetics division and also responsible for corporate controlling. And Lothar will retire, as I said, after more than 30 years at Henkel.</p>
          <p>This is now the fourth promotion into the management team in the last 16 months and I do believe &#x2013; internal promotion, and I do believe it's a testament to the strength of the bench that we have. The reason why that we're capable of increasing the numbers in a very difficult environment is that the bench strength has significantly increased over the last four years in Henkel. And as you can see, four promotions from within to our management board in the last 16 months is a good proof of this.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to hand over to Lothar, who will take you through briefly Q4 and more in depth the fiscal year. Lothar?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me briefly start with a perspective on Q4 and then move on to fiscal year 2011. Q4 2011, we have seen the key financials for the total quarter, sales growth of &#x20AC;3.8 billion organic, adjusted gross margin down by 70 basis points, adjusted EBIT up 12% or 120 basis points, adjusted earnings per share up almost 12%. Net working capital to sales and net debt, I will address in my presentation a little bit later.</p>
          <p>Sales growth by business sector, first of all, Laundry &amp; Home Care, with organic sales growth of 2.4%, which is composed of a pretty strong, almost 5% price increase component in our sales growth and minus 2.5% on volume. We've communicated on many occasions that volume, obviously, includes new product launches, so therefore, the impact of product launches is reflected in our volume &#x2013; sector of price and volume distribution of organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>And we've also communicated on various occasions that with the strong pricing that we have undertaken in Q4, we obviously expect to be able to benefit from that in year 2012. And also, that it is likely that we get an initial setback on volume. So from that perspective, price volume is strong and as expected.</p>
          <p>In particular, we've seen North America continuing with its strong contribution after the recovery. We've seen an overall slowdown in the Laundry &amp; Home Care sector in Q4 in Western Europe. We've not lost market share, so that's nothing particular or particularly negative.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics/Toiletries has continued with its strong 5% organic sales growth with the composition of price 1.4%/3.6%. Volume here again, comment is appropriate. It includes new product launches and, therefore, there's a slight overstatement of volume over pricing component.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies, organic sales growth 4.2% which, again, is composed of a very strong pricing component, 7.4% and a negative volume. Same comment applies to Adhesive Technologies that I've made with respect to Laundry &amp; Home Care.</p>
          <p>Strong pricing usually results in short-term negative on volume and, therefore, we've taken the risk of increasing, again, our prices in Q4 with the expectation that we're getting the benefit of it in fiscal year 2012. We've seen a slowdown in China in Adhesive Technologies due to inventory reduction and we expect that to reverse in year 2012 or in Q1 year 2012 already, resuming pretty strong growth in China.</p>
          <p>With respect to overall total Henkel, the negative impact on sales, it's very much from currencies and that's mainly from Turkish lira, Polish zloty and Mexican peso, which has been negative impact on total sales.</p>
          <p>Looking at adjusted EBIT margin by business sector, we have progressed again in Q4 with a pretty good margin increase, 60 basis points both in Laundry &amp; Home Care and in Cosmetics/Toiletries, and an even much stronger progress of 210 basis points in Adhesive Technologies. And that obviously is a result already of the pricing actions that we've taken earlier in the year, and we expect that we will be able to have a pretty good contribution from that on our margin progression that we expect for fiscal year 2012.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll move on to a total look at fiscal year 2011 versus 2010. First of all, look at organic sales growth. Laundry &amp; Home Care, almost made it to 3% organic sales growth with a pretty good distribution of price and volume. Solid performance based on balanced price and volume mix and North America progressing over the course of the year. Again, we've communicated on various occasions that we've been struggling to regain our solid growth momentum in North America in our Laundry &amp; Home Care. And we basically have improved our sales performance during the year and we're sure that we're on the right path with proof that we've been able to deliver in three quarters of last year.</p>
          <p>In Laundry, a strong contribution to growth was &#x2013; in Laundry &amp; Home Care, the strongest contribution to growth was from Laundry, in particular, heavy-duty detergents with the greatest growth momentum. And major drivers behind this were the launching activities in particular with Persil in Mexico and in South Korea. Home Care was weaker, although we've been pretty successful with a significant revenue increase in our Toilet Care products in Europe.</p>
          <p>Next, look at Cosmetics/Toiletries. We have seen and experienced strong promotional activities over our peers and strong competitive pressure. And that has increased as a result of particular activities which we have experienced in the markets. Pricing was a slight negative on 0.3% for the full year but a strong volume, 5.7%. And here again, I made the comment earlier, pricing would have been reflected higher if we were to count new product launches in pricing and we'll put some perspective on that in the future.</p>
          <p>We've seen double-digit growth, again, in emerging markets and solid performance in our mature markets. Overall, very balanced portfolio in terms of regional growth and also in terms of price volume growth.</p>
          <p>Next, looking at the Adhesive Technologies, organic sales growth exceedingly strong with 8.3% and here again, a strong pricing component, more than 5% and still very good volume, despite the strong pricing activities. Very strong growth driven by both price and volume, with the general industry with the strongest organic sales performance. As a matter of fact, all subdivisions achieved this, except the electronics, have experienced strong growth, almost double-digit in every sub-segment.</p>
          <p>Adhesives has experienced a decline pretty much because of what happened in Asia Pacific, out of which was influenced by the natural disaster in Japan, which we were able to, I guess, compensate during most of the year, but not completely.  From that perspective, expectation for 2012 is obviously significantly better also in our electronic adhesives sub-segment.</p>
          <p>Total company, &#x20AC;5.6 billion (sic [&#x20AC;5.9 billion] (14:58) as Kasper reported earlier which is almost 3%, 2.9%, so almost equal between the two components, price and volume. We've seen the negative foreign exchange impact mainly from the U.S. dollar, which has strengthened, Turkish lira, Egyptian pound and Russian ruble.  We've seen a strong sales performance, based on a balanced mix of both price and volume.</p>
          <p>Looking at our performance in terms of regional performance, we have experienced double-digit growth in our emerging markets. I will get to that in a moment. Western Europe and North America with solid sales performance, despite a very challenging business environment. We see Western Europe with more than 2% organic sales growth. North America was more than 4% organic sales growth. From that perspective, taking the mature markets together, we're quite happy with our organic sales growth performance.</p>
          <p>Taking a comprehensive look at our emerging markets performance, sales performance was driven by double-digit organic sales growth in Adhesive Technologies and Cosmetics/Toiletries and we're happy to report that we've regained high single-digit growth in our Detergent, Laundry &amp; Home Care division. Sales shares of emerging markets increased to 42%, which was obviously negatively impacted. It would have been higher, except for the currency fluctuations that we have experienced, in particular in emerging markets currencies.</p>
          <p>Looking at operating performance by business unit, Laundry &amp; Home Care, Cosmetics/Toiletries and Adhesive Technologies. Starting with Laundry &amp; Home Care, 20 basis points. Efficiency gains and cost control together with our price increases have overcompensated impact from high increases in raw material prices.</p>
          <p>Obviously, this was a very challenging year in terms of implementing price increases and a very challenging environment, despite the fact that price increases &#x2013; we had to lead the way in many countries, so basically implemented the price increases, with some negative impact on volumes. But as we have experienced that on earlier occasions, we're going to come back in order to increase our volume and therefore, again, optimistic about our outlook for 2012, also on Laundry &amp; Home Care.</p>
          <p>Next, Cosmetics and Toiletries, plus 90 basis points with strong efficiency gains and cost control, together with some price increases, have overcompensated. Again here, the impact from high increases in material prices. This was a year where even Cosmetics and Toiletries, which otherwise has less of an impact from raw material price increases in the past, has experienced pretty strong impact. And therefore, combined with the strong sales performance that we have displayed, it has resulted in our ability to eventually increase our margin to a significantly higher level than what we had before.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies, here again, a strong margin progression, 110 basis points over the 2010, with price increases in all business and all sub-segments and all regions, as well as ongoing efficiency gains and cost control, which have finally have overcompensated substantial rises in raw material prices. And it is important for us to point out and emphasize that cost control has been and will be in the future a very important element of our margin progression.</p>
          <p>Look at gross margin, which has been negative by 100 basis points in the full year. I reported earlier that the negative in Q4 was less, only 70 basis points. So, eventually we see light at the end of the tunnel suggesting that we're getting through with our price increases eventually covering and turning around the negative evolution in gross margin.</p>
          <p>Higher cost of goods obviously negatively impacted during the year our gross margin by approximately 600 basis points, with 80% during the year that we've been able to offset by our own price increases and savings. And we've also experienced an impact on gross margin from the negative growth in Electronic Adhesives, which results in a negative mix effect on our gross margin.</p>
          <p>So, to look at it, income statement adjusted with particular emphasis on marketing, selling and distribution expenses and admin expenses. Marketing, selling and distribution have been down by 100 basis points. That is in large part due to cost benefits that we have gained from restructuring synergies, restructurings that we have undertaken in the years before, but also which we have accelerated during &#x2013; throughout year 2011.</p>
          <p>We've also experienced in our fast-moving consumer goods division a market shift towards higher promotional spend. We've not changed our ratio of share of voice, share of market. But marketing spend has been down in the market and that also resulted in relief on this line, but with higher expenses in rebates and customer spend. So from that perspective, we've maintained our position in the markets and increased market share in our divisions and benefited from lower market expenses on advertising.</p>
          <p>Admin expenses down by 20 basis points. We have on many occasions talked about our shared service effort, which will continue over the next years, which we have continued and delivered quite some savings already throughout the past three years. Shared service will be the most important element of improving our cost structure and shifting our cost structure into the growth regions and the regions where we experience our strongest performance in terms of revenue growth, but also in terms of margin progression.</p>
          <p>Please look at reported to adjusted EBIT with the restructuring charges, &#x20AC;227 million. As a brief perspective on what we spent in order to continue our shared services effort, it was &#x20AC;60 million out of &#x20AC;227 million, with almost &#x20AC;100 million on optimizing our manufacturing footprint. In particular, in Adhesives, we've communicated on various occasions about the necessity to improve our manufacturing footprint and obviously, also follow the shift of industrial activity into the emerging markets. So, we have invested significantly and we have achieved a significantly better manufacturing footprint than what we started out three years ago.</p>
          <p>Delayering in Laundry &amp; Home Care, almost &#x20AC;40 million. That's been an important element in adapting our structures to the changes in the market environment and that, obviously, is also an important element in delivering our margin progression in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division.</p>
          <p>Net working capital, Kasper has alluded to that briefly already. That's a more detailed perspective on performance of our units. Here again, Laundry &amp; Home Care has improved the strong level which they had achieved in 2010 with minus 2.4%. Again, Cosmetics/Toiletries is almost on the same level, a little bit better than the year before at 3.2%. That's very strong compared to our peers.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies with a slight negative 15%, versus 14% the year before. Much of that is due to changes in the manufacturing setup that we have experienced during 2011, where it wasn't possible or necessary, as preparation for shifting production from one country to another to increase inventories in order for us to be able to continue to supply our customers. And we've also built some more inventory in order to be able to deal with the shortages, raw material shortages which we have experienced. We have communicated about that on various occasions. Once again, we're prepared. We've basically not been forced to cut off any supplies to our customers, even though that has remained a challenge throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Net debt, again, strong improvement over the same period of last year, almost &#x20AC;700 million and compared to 2008, the highest level following our National Starch acquisition. We have deleveraged our company significantly over that period of time, only three years. We're down to the lowest level for a period of &#x2013; since 2008, reduced by &#x2013; net debt by more than 50% in the last three years.</p>
          <p>And obviously, that's an important element to regain our financial flexibility, which permits us to invest into our businesses, in particular, also into external growth. Although &#x2013; and we've been extremely disciplined over the past three years and we therefore reduced significantly our ability to participate in any consolidation, should those opportunities arise.</p>
          <p>Our dividend proposal, &#x20AC;0.80 on preferred share, which is a significant increase over the period since 2004. We have been able to apply a consistent, very consistent dividend policy over the years. Obviously, payout ratio is lower than others, but we've been able to pay out every year and not decrease our dividend over that period of time. And as we regain our strength in terms of earnings per share, we're increasing our dividend payout. That, obviously, is a proposal to the Annual General Meeting due in April 16 of this year and therefore, that's subject to confirmation from the AGM.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand over to Kasper again to continue with our progress on our strategic priorities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. Before going into 2012, let me just spend a couple of minutes on where we are on our strategic priorities. This chart, you know. This is the guiding chart that we've been using for the past four years and this is what sets our priorities.</p>
          <p>Lothar has said a very important part that I'd like to reiterate. Over the last three years, we have continued to adapt the structures to the marketplace. We will continue to do so in the future. We believe there is plenty of opportunities for better performance within the organization. We don't believe at any point in time that we're at the end of the road. So, we will continue to adapt our structures to the market.</p>
          <p>Our emerging market sales share is up to 42% at this stage. We've dramatically consolidated our brands. Our top three brands are now a quarter of our business. We'll continue to drive innovation into the marketplace, because that is the key driver for GP1 improvement. And as Lothar alluded to, company-wide use of shared services is a strategic move for Henkel that will accompany us over the next three to four years, where we do expect substantial and continued improvement of our cost line.</p>
          <p>We have announced our new sustainability strategy last year and we are in the process of implementing that internally and externally. We have moved the majority of our infrastructure to the emerging market, with 54% of all employees by now employed in the emerging markets with a sales share of 42%. So we have proactively moved our employees to the emerging market, which has a very positive impact also on our cost structure. And we have 30% of females in management positions. We continue to have business potential customers and global team at the focus and we still believe there's substantial room for improvement.</p>
          <p>On the emerging markets, since the end of 2007, starting with 34%, we're up at 42%. We lost approximately 60 basis points of progress this year due to currency. But overall, we're looking upon the organic side and we are seeing the emerging markets not only being driver for top line, but as you could see on the lower side, we have made substantial progress on the margin contribution from the emerging market. And that is also the expectation that we have for the future, that they will continue to not only help drive the top line, but also the bottom line.</p>
          <p>We have, as announced last year, started the building of our largest adhesive plant in the world, which will be the newest state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in the world, which will come online by the end of this year. And at full capacity, it will manufacture 428,000 tons, predominantly for the Chinese market. It creates 600 new jobs and is another indication for how we are moving our infrastructure and capabilities to the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>On our top brands, our top three brands for our &#x2013; in our detergents division account for 58%; our top 10 is 81%. For our Cosmetics division, 73% and 90%, respectively. And for our Adhesive business, 27% and 54%.</p>
          <p>Throughout the last four years, we've taken the number of brands from 1,000-plus to 400 and we're aiming to take another 100 out. So what you can see is we are dramatically reducing the amount of brands, subsequent, also, the complexity, which allows us to relatively invest more with the same amount of money, because we have fewer brands. So we are making the progress on the consolidation of the brands and expect also complexity advances through this reduction.</p>
          <p>I mentioned innovation is a key driver for margin enhancements. I've taken three examples here; Persil Black improved our GP1 margin by 16 points. Gliss improved our GP1 margin by 7 points and Pattex improved our margin by 7 points.  This is very key to the improvement on our overall profitability and a company level that will continue to bring customer relevant innovation into the marketplace that are accretive to the GP1 line.</p>
          <p>Shared services, one of the most strategic initiatives and is adopted company-wide. We believe that we have substantial opportunities ahead of us over the next three to four years, on moving not only the central functions like finance or HR purchasing into shared services, but also a number of functions from what we call our business groups, like customer support, master data, controlling work analytics. And this will help us not only in terms of speed, but should also give us significant cost efficiencies in the future. It's not something we started yesterday. It does take time to standardize processes, but we're very, very focused on driving this forward into the company.</p>
          <p>I also mentioned our new sustainability strategy, which in essence, is becoming three times more efficient with the same footprint, Factor 3, announced last year, is in the implementation.</p>
          <p>Now, let me get to the outlook of 2012. This is the chart that we announced in November 2008 and we've not changed direction so far and we've no indication or intention of changing direction. In 2008, we guided an average growth rate for the years until 2012 between 3% and 5%, adjusted EBIT margin of 14% and adjusted EPS of above 10%. And we're right on track.</p>
          <p>We are guiding for fiscal year 2012 an organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. We expect our Laundry and Cosmetics division to deliver low single-digit growth and we expect our Adhesive Technologies division to deliver mid single-digit growth. We are aiming at a margin of 14% and adjusted EPS growth of above 10%. So we are, as we've done now for four years in a row, confirming the guidance for our financial targets for 2012.</p>
          <p>And I believe that with the work that we have done and I want to stress the following, that we're contemplating doing also for the future, we're well positioned. We have moved a big part of our business to the emerging markets along with our footprint. Shared services has been optimizing the functions. There's huge opportunities in the business groups. We continue to see substantial opportunities in optimizing our manufacturing footprint. We have strengthened our top brands and we have approximately another 100 brands to go, which means that we're taking the total number of brands from above 1,000 to approximately 300.</p>
          <p>We have a great bench across the board and spend a lot of time developing our people to ensure that we can deliver the numbers. We have a very clear vision and a set of values that we're building our business around. We have a new sustainability strategy and we've been working now diligently for nine months on our strategy beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>But, I also want to use the sentence that my predecessor, <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Weiner (33:41) once used. There is no long term without the short term and that's why we're very confident to hit and reach our targets in 2012. Just let me reflect for about five seconds on 2011. We came out and hit or overachieved all the targets we set ourselves.</p>
          <p>Q4, and I know some of you are concerned about 3.8% growth, that is not a number that I'm greatly concerned about. Lothar was very clear on the two reasons, slowdown in Western Europe for detergents business, but at the same time, we offset it further down in the P&amp;L and deleveraging stock in China. We do expect the China to come back to a normal scenario in 2012 and the 7.5% growth rate that the Chinese government had put out is falling in line with our expectations. We're very happy with the numbers we hit. We hit the targets. I'm not concerned about the top line in Q4.</p>
          <p>Events for 2012, AGM, April 16, where the dividend will be voted upon. Q1, May 9, Q2, August 1. We have the Investor Day, our Annual Investor Day, this year with a focus on Laundry &amp; Home Care, September 4. And our third quarter numbers, we've moved to November 16. So, on the third quarter numbers on November 16, we will also announce our long-term strategy and guidance beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>So, just to reiterate, on November 16, third quarter numbers for 2012 and the new long-term strategy for Henkel and the guidance beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>With this, Lothar and I would like to thank you for listening in and we would now be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Our first question today comes from the line of Harold Thomas (sic) [Harold Thompson] (35:56) from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Harold Thompson, Deutsche Bank. I've got three questions, if I may. The first one is on promotional intensity. It's something which you mentioned in your HPC divisions. And I also note that pricing in the Cosmetics businesses continues to be slightly negative. What would you say is the outlook on promotional intensity through 2012, given what peers, I guess, have mentioned in recent times and I guess what's happening in the overall input cost environment, which surely must be impacting margins and therefore, the desire to keep promoting?</p>
          <p>The second one is on net working capital. You mentioned at Q3 that you weren't very happy and you've tried to turn that round in Q4. Could that, in a way, also be explaining why maybe your growth is not as good in the fourth quarter, as you've worked hard on the net working capital, or is that just the wrong way to look at it?</p>
          <p>And I guess thirdly, this is more on utilization rates. You've mentioned in the past that you've significantly improved your capacity utilization rates of your plants. Maybe give us an update on that, where we are today? And the reason I asked that is, essentially, your CapEx, you're running for quite well below depreciation as you've basically improved your rates. And I just wonder how long that can realistically go on? If you essentially want to grow, you're going to have to invest to grow and when should we expect that investment to go back in? Maybe explain your views on that. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Harold. I will take the two first ones and Lothar will take the third one. On the overall market, we don't expect any recovery when it comes to promotional activities, so we think that our market has stabilized around what we have right now. Pricing will be delivered and I'm speaking now of Cosmetics business, through, one, is those pricing increases. But of course, what we do, do is through new innovation.</p>
          <p>And you've seen that even in a market where you indicated that pricing is difficult, in our Cosmetics business, we did increase our EBIT margin by 90 basis points in a year with dramatic increases in raw materials. So the underlying planning, it's assuming a similar competitive environment as in 2011. Pricing will be taken on a one-off basis on existing products, but pricing is predominantly driven in Cosmetics through our new products and that's why you don't see it on the volume and price. That's why you actually do see it on the volume side, but it doesn't appear on the price because new products is only recorded on the volume side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second one on net working capital, my point was following the third quarter, I think we need to look upon all elements, and I found that 8% was unnecessarily high. We've also said that we're not going to forego top line based on net working capital. So we brought the number down to what we felt was the appropriate number, which was 7%-plus, 7.3%.</p>
          <p>As I said, the top line was influenced by a negative development in our detergents business in Western Europe and the Chinese. And I've been very clear on what I feel about that. I'm not overly concerned. It probably could have been one point higher, but it's not something that I'm concerned about. If you go through the different elements of the P&amp;L, we came out at 13.2% margin on a lower top line, and I think it does show the capability to absorb changes on the top line. So, no correlation between net working capital and top line. The top line were the two reasons I mentioned. Lothar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the CapEx question versus depreciation, let me just briefly explain how we look at it. First of all, usually, we manage our investments by looking at the investment, which is different from CapEx. So I'll explain that in a second.</p>
          <p>Now, investment is the budget that we set up per year in order to reflect the investment activities. And in the past 10 years, there's only one year where investment was below depreciation, that was 2009. So always, this year, 2011, any other year except 2009, investment budget was always above depreciation.</p>
          <p>Now, CapEx follows with a time delay investment. In other words, if we are high on investment in 2011, CapEx will follow with a certain delay, because CapEx is the cash out. The cash out on the investment budget is, in our experience, stretched out by 35% in the year of decision, 55% in the year after and another 20%, which is, obviously, then adding up to 100%.</p>
          <p>So we have a sequential expense or investment or the balance sheet impact over three years from investment budget decisions. And therefore, looking at investment budget decision, it's the more important aspect, because you always have this delay and &#x2013; obviously, CapEx just follows the investment budget decision.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective, we've decided in 2009 to reduce our investment in response to what was happening in the markets. Now we've regained and recovered to the normal level of investment above depreciation in 2011. And that will continue unless we have another crisis, but for the time being, that's the way we look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is there anything you could maybe add on the utilization rates of your plan? I mean, you did mention that your last...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Analyst meeting where you thought you were. Now, I guess given &#x2013; gee, Lothar, maybe you could give us an idea of the tax rate for 2012. I see it's coming a little bit below what you had guided for in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 2011 was positively impacted, if I may start with that, by the one-off gain from the disposition of our Indian business. The normal rate would have been 26%. So basically, if you don't look at the one-offs, the tax rate would have been as guided. For 2012, our expectation is in the range of 25% and that's, therefore, an improvement over the run rate that we have experienced in 2011 and failing one-offs from dispositions, that's the expected value for 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of capacity utilization, you know that we're hesitant to talk about it, because there's a strong impact on capacity utilization from what the segments or sub-segments in our Adhesive Technologies division experience. And change in a stronger performance in Adhesives, Electronic Adhesives, there's no impact on capacity utilization, because it's small volumes, while a strong performance in packaging adhesives has an impact, or building adhesives, for that matter, although that is obviously not particularly helpful in terms of margin progression.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective, one needs to look at it. Nevertheless, overall end of Q4, we were at around 50%, taking out building adhesives, because with that big volumes and small margins, that would distort the picture even worse. That's a little bit down from what we had throughout the year. Throughout the year, we were in the low 50%s, 53%, 54%, and as usual, industrial activities somewhat dies around towards the end of the year. So the 49%, it's basically what we had expected, and similar, by the way, to the evolution in 2010.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Eva Quiroga from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Can I please go back to the personal care business? Over the last five to six years, you've had average organic top line growth of about 5% and you're guiding to low single digits in 2012. So I was trying to understand what makes you more cautious apart from the promotional pressure? And maybe also on the personal care business, can you remind me how much of that is in emerging markets? And maybe give a little comment on how you've done in Eastern Europe? And my second question is on input costs, can you maybe tell us how much of those are now budgeted for 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eva, starting out, we guided 3% to 5%. We've been running this year at 5%-plus. So we believe that this year or this year, which was last year, was very strong for Cosmetics and Detergents &#x2013; our Cosmetics business. We have seen a slight slowdown in Eastern Europe driven by Russia, which we believe that should be turning around in the latter part of the year. We have seen a slowdown in the overall growth rate in Eastern Europe, driven by Russia. The overall position we have &#x2013; of the emerging market for the company is 42% and I believe, roughly, it's around 33% for our Cosmetics business at this stage.</p>
          <p>Then in the U.S. also &#x2013; sorry, Eva.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah. Eva, I said 33% is our emerging market and input cost, Lothar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Input cost for expectation for 2012 is mid-single digits. That's lower, obviously, than what we have experienced in 2011. And the difficulty in, I guess, being precise or being right on the expectation is our initial expectation was higher, then it was lower and now we're in single digits.</p>
          <p>It's vacillating with what's happening in the Middle East on the oil price situation, which is already impacted negatively by the political situation surrounding Iran. So that's a big unknown what is going to happen there and the impact, if something really material happens, would be negative certainly on the oil price and that obviously transcends then into our raw material price situation. So for the time being, that's our best estimate without war or a significant crisis and it could be better, but it could be worse.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Celine Pannuti from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I would like to come back on the comment you made on the pricing momentum and the volume impact it has had. So, am I clear to say that pricing has been increasing in the fourth quarter, so we should continue to see volume decline at least in the beginning of the year? Is that what you were getting to? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And then my second question, given that we could have a lower volume in the first half, would there be a difference in your performance on H1 versus H2? I think it as well has to be tied up with the &#x2013; in essentially in raw material, which some of your competitors have said will continue to impact their gross margin in the first half. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Celine, obviously, we did not guide to negative volume for H1 or Q1. What I was saying is that immediately on implementing price increases, you get push-back and that's particularly true in Laundry &amp; Home Care. We've seen that push-back in Q4, we don't expect that to continue through Q1 and first half year. So, we don't expect negative volume in H1 on fast-moving consumer goods.</p>
          <p>It's also important that one recognizes the experience that we had in the previous years. It's on implementing or finally pushing through price increases, usually, the market follows. And therefore, the negative impact &#x2013; the immediate negative impact from price dissipates.</p>
          <p>With respect to H1 and H2, our expectation is that we will see some relief on the raw material, on the input cost side in H1. And as I mentioned earlier, H2 is particularly volatile in terms of what are we going to see in the political situations surrounding the oil supply &#x2013; oil supplying countries, is that we remain stable. Our expectation or our hope would be that H2 will be less negative than what we expect today. But that's something that we have no control over and therefore, we're trying to be cautious. So H2 should have a more negative impact on raws again, but with an upside potential.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Mark Josefson from Silvia Quandt. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Can I just actually go back to your answer to the last two questions in terms of the gross margin there and at the moment, you're looking for this mid single-digit input cost. My impression through most of second half of last year is that you were running hard trying to offset the pressure on GP1 from raw material costs. And as we went through the period, the negative influence of raw materials always seem to be <mark type="ph" /> pushed on (50:12) over and above the price increases accepted by your customers.</p>
          <p>Now, as you say, we're not quite sure of political events, but in the absence of escalation from where we stand today, given your answer from the last two questions, is it right to presume that through the year, we should still anticipate raw material price increases being the larger of the influence, namely that your gross margin profit will be slightly down for the year, despite the price increases accepted by customers? And that's a follow-up to that.</p>
          <p>My first question there, however, is with respect to your guidance or lack of guidance on restructuring charges. I think this time last year, you guided for restructuring charges and given the many projects still underway to support operational efficiencies, what should we factor in today in terms of one-off or exceptional items in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, a quick clarity. We expect gross margin to increase throughout the year. Will there be bumps in the road there? I'm certain there will be, because of the volatility in the raw materials. But for the full year, we do see GP1 margin to increase, which is going to be one of the contributors to the bottom line from the 2013 bridge to the 2014. We expect restructuring to the tune of &#x20AC;100 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, a couple of questions, if I may. In terms of electronics, clearly there was a negative impact in terms of sales and margin in 2011. Can you put a little bit more color around the actual impact that we saw? And then two, in terms of outlook for that sector in 2012, how do you see that trending and what recovery rate can we expect?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in terms of Adhesives, other end markets, in terms of demand, how do you see developing markets trending overall? You've mentioned China, you expect to get better. What about the other markets, Brazil, Latin America, for example? And then also in terms of the mature markets, Western Europe and the impacts that we're seeing from the euro crisis in North America, how do you see that trending? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to electronics, I mentioned in terms of sales impact that we were slightly negative in 2011. We expect that to recover to positive. We don't, obviously, try to give guidance on every segment in our portfolio. Otherwise, life would be extremely volatile. So from that perspective, we do expect a clear recovery and positive sales performance of our Electronics segment in 2012. And that will have an impact on the margin. Now, we've not estimated, let's say, the negative margin impact from Electronics on our overall margin, which is, obviously, difficult to estimate. But that, again, will reverse in 2012. That's our expectation and, therefore, Electronics will be part &#x2013; is part of our positive expectation or outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of other adhesive markets, developing markets, Brazil, Latin America, all the rest of it, again, we do expect that to be positive, in terms of particularly China. We see that basically growing at the rates that we have experienced in the past several years, actually.</p>
          <p>We do expect good positive growth from Brazil, overall in Latin America. Developing markets, that's a more difficult thing to estimate in particular. We've been positive also in mature markets, I should say, sorry. In mature markets, we've seen positive sales growth in 2011. We've seen some of that already negatively impacted by &#x2013; for example, automotive in Europe, although automotive in North America continued pretty well.</p>
          <p>So we're going to see a mixed picture and our thesis is obviously that some negatives that we experienced or have experienced in the past, again, we're going to be able to compensate or overcompensate through stronger growth in other regions. That's basically a strong thesis that we with respect to our Adhesive divisions. We're not depending on automotive industry in Europe alone. We're not depending on automotive in the U.S. alone and therefore, we're making up weaknesses in parts. You've seen that with our strong organic sales growth of 8%, more than 8% in 2011, despite negative electronics. So, from that perspective, we have a broad portfolio. We're involved in many different segments and countries and regions.</p>
          <p>And our expectation for Adhesive for 2012, overall, is a stronger contribution for total growth. Again, as we have seen that in 2011, stronger than the other divisions and that is composed of certain expectations for countries and segments. But from our perspective, it serves no purpose to be specific on that, because the overall results for Adhesives division is what counts and therefore, that's in line with the expectation and the guidance that we have provided.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we come to a close, let me just make one remark before I close the call. As an extension to Lothar, 47% of our business in Adhesives comes from the emerging markets. We grow the overall company more than &#x2013; the top line for the emerging market was more than 10% and Adhesives was above that. So, we actually have a very broad position in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And if you look upon some of the countries that was impacted or one country that was significantly impacted in the fourth quarter in the emerging market, was the underwater situation, so to speak, in Thailand that has significant impact on automotive and electronics. As we speak today, 30% of the automotive plants in Thailand aren't running and 50% of the electronic plants, not <mark type="ph" /> ours on speaking (56:51) markets, are not running. That, of course, did have an impact. That will normalize over time.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to thank everybody for participating in today's call. Despite the challenging environment, we achieved and even exceeded our financial targets for 2011. Also for 2012, we will maintain our rigorous approach to cost management and further adapt our structures to the changing environment. We are very confident to achieve our 2012 financial targets of 14% EBIT margin.</p>
          <p>I wish you all the best and I look forward to speaking to you all at the end of Q1 at our conference call on May 9, 2012. Good-bye and thank you.</p>
