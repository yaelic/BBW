          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call of Deutsche Bank. I am your operator for this conference. Please note that for the duration of the presentation, all participants will be in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning welcome from Frankfurt. On behalf of Deutsche Bank, I would like to welcome you to our early conference call on the second quarter results. Our CFO, Stefan Krause, will talk you through the slide pack, which is also filed on our website along with all other documents we issued this morning. We'll try to make this call as efficient as possible, so we try to stay within an hour, so that you can join our colleagues from UBS later.</p>
          <p>And before we start, let me remind you of the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>And with that, I hand over to Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning from me as well, and thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter Results Call. We very much appreciate it because it's so much earlier than you're normally accustomed to do. So, I'm going to try to move through the slides quickly and to leave as much time as possible for your questions.</p>
          <p>Before I go through the results, I would like to mention a few high level takeaways from the quarter. As you can imagine, our investment banks performance was materially impacted by the intensified concerns over the European sovereign debt. Despite the significant slowdown in global client activity, though, the business performed quite resiliently.</p>
          <p>Our PCAM business did, obviously on a strong first quarter earnings and continued to outperform year-over-year. Exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain declined over 70% in the first six months of the year to &#x20AC;3.7 billion. And last but not least, at this point I'll say we will affirm our &#x20AC;10 billion IBIT target and I will elaborate on this topic later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now to the group results on the first slide, the highlights. I will touch on many of these numbers as I go through the presentation, so I will not go into any details now. I will mention that our pre-tax return on equity, based on our target definition, was 14% for the quarter, equal to the level achieved last year, but as you know on a substantially higher equity base.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet assets were slightly up, mainly reflecting an increase in our liquidity reserves in the quarter and the leverage ratio, as you can see remains unchanged at 23 times equity.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you see that our pre-tax profit is up 17% on a year-over-year basis. The outperformance versus a year ago is attributable to the strategic acquisitions we made in 2010 to strengthen our PCAM businesses. These acquisitions are positively contributing to earnings already. There's also concerted ongoing effort to streamline our existing businesses, as evidenced by the positive operating leverage in many of our divisions.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate this quarter was 31% and benefited from the geographic mix of income, which was partly offset by the non-tax deductible charge for the German bank levy. The full year tax rate is expected to be approximately around 31%, as well. However, the U.K. bank levy and bank levies in other jurisdictions may cause this rate to increase.</p>
          <p>You can see on an after-tax basis, first half profits increased 14% versus the same period in 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our non-interest expenses on the next page. They were &#x20AC;6.3 billion, an increase of &#x20AC;900 million versus the second quarter of 2010. If we exclude the impact from acquisitions, total non-interest expenses would have increased approximately &#x20AC;250 million year-on-year.</p>
          <p>I will not cover all the increases, because there were also a lot of offsetting factors and there will be offsetting factors over the course of the year, and there were some offsetting factors in this number. But the major drivers of the increase were several.</p>
          <p>Bonus and retention has increased approximately &#x20AC;100 million, in line with higher year-on-year revenue. We have booked approximately &#x20AC;100 million of additional operating expenses from Cosmopolitan, our casino, in that figure. And this quarter includes an accrual of &#x20AC;62 million for the German bank levy and non-tax deductible operational expense. I'll give you a little more details on the bank levy dynamics later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Finally, there has been an increase in operational losses and litigation expenses, which is fairly typical for this point in the cycle. We anticipate that litigation related expenses will continue to represent an increasing amount of our general and administration expenses going forward.</p>
          <p>Positive offset to the increase in non-interest expenses, the development of the complexity reduction program, year-over-year an incremental sustainable savings of more than &#x20AC;100 million has been realized, net of cost achieved so far. As a reminder, we expect to achieve approximately &#x20AC;800 million of savings in the full year 2011 with a net contribution of &#x20AC;600 million to our cost base after the investment spend.</p>
          <p>We are on track, having realized approximately &#x20AC;350 million of gross savings in the first half of the year. And finally, the compensation ratio has declined three percentage points to 39%, our lowest reported ratio in several quarters.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the next page, here you see that the Core Tier 1 ratio stood at 10.2% as of June 30. It's worth mentioning, given obviously our endless capital debate, that it's above 10% for the first time for Deutsche Bank. The increase of 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter and 150 basis points since the end of 2010 reflects Deutsche Bank's strong capital generation, as well as our tight risk discipline.</p>
          <p>On the following page, we provide details on the development of Core Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. The net increase in Core Tier 1 capital of &#x20AC;900 million was primarily driven this quarter's net income of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, as you can see, partly offset by the dividend accrual and FX effects.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets decreased by more than &#x20AC;8 billion from &#x20AC;328 billion at the end of March to &#x20AC;320 billion at the 30th of June. Our FX continues to have a positive effect on our risk-weighted asset base. This quarter it was a &#x20AC;1.9 billion benefit.</p>
          <p>Market risk-weighted assets declined &#x20AC;3.1 billion, due to lower activity levels across the Investment Bank. And the decrease in credit risk-weighted assets was &#x20AC;2.7 billion. This reduction includes effects from a regular parameter recalibration and other changes.</p>
          <p>Operational risk-weighted assets were &#x20AC;600 million lower compared to the previous quarter. We obviously will continue to closely scrutinize our risk in advance of Basel 2.5 and Basel III requirements. I caution you, though, not to assume a straight line development for risk-weighed asset mitigation. However, as was explained in some details at our CIB workshop, we do have a clear timeline and agenda to successfully reach our target.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the next page where I give you an update on our funding activities. The turbulence of the current environment has, again, put the funding topic to the center stage. Deutsche Bank continues to enjoy clearly funding advantages. This quarter's issuance volume totaled &#x20AC;3 billion and the year-to-date average spread of Libor plus 54 basis points remained unchanged. The slightly revised mix of our funding plan as we indicated, we have the flexibility to do when releasing figures for the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The total funding plan of &#x20AC;26 billion has remained constant, however, the updated plan split is &#x20AC;7 billion from deposits and &#x20AC;19 billion via issuance. Given that we have completed &#x20AC;14 billion year-to-date, we would have a total issue obtained of roughly &#x20AC;6 billion for the remainder of the year. Our deposit campaign took in another &#x20AC;800 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to &#x20AC;6.8 billion. And as I mentioned earlier, we have increased our liquidity reserve by &#x20AC;15 billion this quarter It now stands at a greater than &#x20AC;150 billion.</p>
          <p>So, let's now move on to review the second quarter results of our different business divisions. And as you can see on page 11, we'll start with an overview of the divisional performances. Each of our business segments had a good underlying year-over-year pre-tax profit growth, each one of them. Included for the first time, &#x20AC;62 million was charged to consolidations and adjustments for the German bank levy. The full year amount will be approximately &#x20AC;124 million. As you may know, the levy is based on preceding year's German accounting results and is not tax deductible.</p>
          <p>The U.K. bank levy will only arise as per December 31 of 2011, based on a year end balance sheet number. German bank levy will partly be credited against the U.K. levy, however, the still rules are still unclear &#x2013; the rules are still unclear.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, we expect a more than &#x20AC;200 million charge for the U.K. bank levy, but that number is obviously caveated for loss of uncertainties. Like in Germany, the U.K. bank levy is not tax deductible.</p>
          <p>On the next page, I show the results in our Corporate Banking and Security segment. It was a very challenging market environment, as you know, for the Investment Bank this quarter, as our relative strength and weaknesses as a franchise were magnified by the market dynamics. Specifically, we experienced a significant slowdown in global client activity during the quarter. Heightened investor risk aversion precipitated decreases and slow volumes.</p>
          <p>Finally, given the strength of our franchise in Europe, who were particularly affected by the disproportionately greater slowdown in Europe versus what was experienced in the U.S. and Asia. Nevertheless, our second quarter '11 revenues are up 9% year-on-year and IBIT is up 26% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Risk taking remained well below limits with average VaR in the second quarter down 6% quarter-on-quarter. Integra, as you know, our core initiative to streamline and integrated our business across CIB, remains on track to deliver the targeted revenue synergies and cost saving.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the next page. I'll give you some more details on Sales &amp; Trading debt. Here, the challenging market environment most affected our Fixed Income businesses. Against the peer set, we still did comparatively okay.</p>
          <p>On a quarter-on-quarter basis Fixed Income revenues increased 37% to &#x20AC;2.3 billion. The meaningful breadth of our franchise allowed us to compensate for a slowdown in core areas of strength with good performance from others. Revenues were lower in Money Markets, Rates and FX and this was partially offset by resilient year-over-year performance in Credit, Emerging Markets, a good performance in Commodities and a solid performance in our RMBS business.</p>
          <p>On the next page 14, Sales &amp; Trading equity revenues, you can see, were &#x20AC;555 million, a 41% decline quarter-on-quarter. A portion of the decline is usually expected due to the seasonal weakness versus the first quarter. Cash Equities was negatively impacted by the slowdown in client volume.</p>
          <p>The decline in equity revenues was more pronounced, given our skew towards Europe, where overall commissions declined substantially more than those in the United States. The U.S. Cash Equities business performed well. However, this quarter reinforces the importance of continuing to invest into this business.</p>
          <p>Prime Brokerage results were solid despite low levels of client leverage and lower financing spreads. And Equity Derivatives operated throughout the quarter with low levels of risk allocation.</p>
          <p>On the next page, on page 15, you see our Origination &amp; Advisory revenues that were &#x20AC;714 million, a very strong quarter, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong performances across all products. We are ranked number five globally and improved to our largest ever market share in the EMEA region.</p>
          <p>We were number one across all products in Europe, except lending, where we are number two. We were ranked number one in global IPOs by value for the first time, and our M&amp;A business was ranked number one in EMEA. We were also ranked number one in all international bonds and ranked number one globally in high yield.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to our next page where we show you the results of our Global Transaction Banking business. GTB had a really good quarter with strong performance across all major products. Trust and Security Service continues to profit from the improved market conditions in the Depositary Receipt and Custody business. Cash Management benefited from the increased interest income, as well as payment volumes. Trade Finance, despite incremental margin compression, generated stronger revenues based on higher volumes of financing products.</p>
          <p>If we exclude the impact of negative goodwill that, as you may recall, we recorded in the second quarter of 2010, IBIT increased by 9% to &#x20AC;293 million. Revenues grew by 4% based on robust fee income and the benefit from initial interest rate increases, as you know, particularly in Asia and Europe. And non-interest expenses were essentially unchanged versus the second quarter of 2010, reflecting a disciplined cost management in this business.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now on page 17 to Asset and Wealth Management. Before I go into the detail of the two differences within Asset and Wealth Management, it's worth taking a quick snapshot at the positive trends at the segment level. Asset and Wealth Management has worked diligently at integrating and realigning the business platform over the last year, and this first half-year result is evidence of some initial success. In just about every metric, the business segment is vastly improved year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Revenues are up 9%, expenses are down 11% and IBIT has more than tripled to &#x20AC;227 million.</p>
          <p>Just as importantly, net new money flows have stabilized over the course of the year and have a positive trajectory. Also, the acquisitions in this segment are now stable and rebuilding. For your benefit, we've added some disclosure on this segment of financial data supplement.</p>
          <p>On page 18, you see that Asset Management continues to gather momentum and is progressing as normal seasonal tariff. IBIT increased &#x20AC;68 million year-on-year, reflecting the efficiency benefit of the platform realignment and the increased performance fees. Although we experienced overall asset outflows in the quarter of &#x20AC;5 billion, the outflows were predominantly from cash and insurance products, which were partially offset by inflows into higher margin product.</p>
          <p>The effect of the asset mix shift is evidenced by year-on-year 9% growth in revenue against the 5% invested asset contraction. In the first half of the year, DWS had a net 14 Morningstar increase of its fund ratings and correspondingly performance fees had more than doubled in the first six months of 2011 versus the same period in 2010. The positive momentum in our fund performance gives us reason to be optimistic about the continued growth of this business.</p>
          <p>On page 19, I show you the Private Wealth business. IBIT was &#x20AC;102 million for this segment. Revenues increased 9% year-over-year, benefiting from good market performance and a profitable asset mix shift. In the quarter-over-quarter view, the revenue volatility results from some large structured transactions, which will obviously be invariably lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but overall, the quality of the revenue stream continues to increase along with the asset mix.</p>
          <p>Impressively, expenses are down 13% year-over-year. As we indicated during our full year results presentation, we feel most of the technical expense reductions necessary at the Sal. Oppenheim franchise have been taken, and what you see here is the benefit of efficiency gains and strong cost discipline.</p>
          <p>Net new money inflows were &#x20AC;5 billion in the quarter, a continuation of the first quarter's inflow of &#x20AC;3 billion. Sometimes it's easy to overlook, and as I want to make the point that PWM is the largest wealth manager in Germany with more than double the invested assets of our nearest competitor.</p>
          <p>So, let me move on now to our Private &amp; Business Clients segment. And as you're aware, we have enhanced our segment disclosure in PBC to give you a more granular view that's aligned with the way the business is managed.</p>
          <p>But first, the traditional consolidated view you're accustomed to, with pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;458 million, PBC is running well ahead of our plan. As I mentioned earlier, the negative impact of Greek government bonds reduced PBC's IBIT by &#x20AC;132 million. The strategic decision to increase our exposure to German Retail Banking with the acquisition of Postbank is showing strong signs of its future potential. We continue to attract strong deposits via our deposit campaign, &#x20AC;6.8 billion as I've said in the first six months of the year. As you would expect, our deposit revenues have grown 8% year-over-year as a result of this trend.</p>
          <p>Revenue from credit products is down 7% year-over-year. Over the course of the last year, we've deliberately reduced our risk appetite with two major consequences. Obviously, our interest margin net interest income suffers when higher margin loans roll off without comparable levels of origination. However, the positive offset is the provision for credit losses continues to stabilize. Excluding Postbank, cost of credit declined 20% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses continue to progress favorably. Excluding Postbank, expenses declined 5% year-over-year. Postbank integration and the cooperation with our colleagues from Postbank continues to be well on-track.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to this enhanced segment disclosure. Let me give you quickly an explanation, the Advisory Banking Germany comprises all of PBC's activities in Germany, excluding Postbank. Advisory Banking International covers PBC's European activities outside Germany and those in Asia, and Consumer Banking is Postbank's contribution to the consolidated results of Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>The IBIT, as you can see, in Advisory Banking Germany on an underlying basis excluding cost-to-achieve and the Greek impairment charge, is up 20% year-over-year. The business is benefiting from increased revenues from deposits, lower credit cost and tight expense control. Expenses are down 4% year-over-year, including &#x20AC;35 million of spend relating to the Postbank integration.</p>
          <p>Advisory Banking International had 60% IBIT growth, albeit off a lower base primarily driven by stronger advisory and brokerage revenues in Europe and lower levels of credit provisions. And the Consumer Banking Germany Postbank business reflected strong contribution from Postbank, which continues to benefit from the relatively strong German retail market, as you can see.</p>
          <p>Let me move on now to the page 22 where I give you some information about our non-core investments, but I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. Our strategy here basically remains the same. We continue to manage these assets with a view towards divesting them at an appropriate time.</p>
          <p>The only thing of note is that we took an impairment charge of &#x20AC;39 million against Actavis. And as you probably are aware, we have entered into negotiations to sell BHF. There is still some due diligence remaining and, obviously, all the proper regulatory approvals are still required. And I'll provide you with an update then at an appropriate time about these sales.</p>
          <p>I took out a couple of additional topics, I think that deserve some additional attention this quarter, and let me start on page 24 with our provision for credit losses. We recorded, as I reported, &#x20AC;464 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter, including &#x20AC;182 million for Postbank.</p>
          <p>As this may seem high in contrast to previous levels, there is one important issue to keep in mind. With regard to Postbank, I would like to remind you again that we consolidated Postbank loans on our balance sheet at fair value as of December of 2010.</p>
          <p>Consequently, obviously, no allowance was included in our accounts for this loan. And therefore, as a result, any subsequent allowance release that Postbank booked in its standalone accounts as a provision for credit losses is recorded as net interest income in DB Group account.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, we recorded &#x20AC;82 million of net interest income in our consolidated account. For the first quarter 2011, the sum was &#x20AC;170 million of such income. Adjusted for this accounting effect, which means applying the net interest income credit to loan loss provisions like is done at the Postbank standalone account, our second quarter provision was &#x20AC;382 million, including &#x20AC;100 million for Postbank.</p>
          <p>Regarding our Investment Bank, the increase compared to prior year quarter mainly reflects a small uptick in our reclassified IAS 39 related provisions. Please be aware that future quarters will reflect similar accounting driven effects, where the provision for credit losses should be viewed in conjunction with related offsets in our line item of net interest income.</p>
          <p>On page 25, the connected topic, I'll show you the impaired loans. In the second quarter, we recorded an increase in impaired loans of &#x20AC;965 million, principally driven by two items. First, we had a single CRE borrower situation, where we have taken a small charge on the larger financing.</p>
          <p>And second, Postbank, where the increase is driven by a technical effect I already discussed in our first quarter <mark type="ph" /> earnings (24:00) call, namely at consolidation, all loans classified as impaired by Postbank were classified as performing by DB, as they were recorded by us at fair value. As a result, the further deterioration in credit quality of any loan classified is impaired by Postbank triggered impairment classification for the full loan amount in DB Group accounts.</p>
          <p>In addition and on top of that, improvements in credit quality of loans classified as impaired by Postbank do not reduce impaired loans recorded in DB Group accounts. Please take that into account, as this number moves forward. The two items driving the impaired loan increase for the quarter also explain the drop in our reported coverage ratio, as the CRE loan was not previously reflected in our coverage ratio, and because for impaired loans in relation to Postbank, neither the allowance held by Postbank at the time of consolidation, nor any purchase price adjustment made by us, is included in the coverage ratio reported by DB.</p>
          <p>In short, you should not interpret the reported increase in impaired loan, nor the reduction our coverage ratio, as a sign of deterioration of the credit quality of our loan book. In fact, I can tell you, our credit quality remains very sound.</p>
          <p>You also should expect the Postbank related technical effect to continue for some time with the corresponding further increases in impaired loan, which will appear lowly provided. Again, this does not reflect any credit deterioration.</p>
          <p>On page 26, as in this quarter, we had the EBA stress test. As you are aware, from our July 15 press release and the publication of the year where stress test result, DB has a Core Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% for 2012 under the EBA adverse scenario, well above the 5% benchmark set by the EBA.</p>
          <p>Additionally, given our strong capital formation in the first half year, our Core Tier 1 capital improved by &#x20AC;2.5 billion, and at the same time risk weighted assets were reduced by &#x20AC;27 billion. Our capital position today is significantly improved compared to December of 2010, which was the basis of the EBA stress test.</p>
          <p>Applying the first half-year risk weighted asset reduction and Core Tier 1 capital improvement for the EBA stress outcome leads to a pro forma 2012 Core Tier 1 ratio of 7.5% under the EBA adverse scenario, as we show you here on the chart.</p>
          <p>And as discussed, the first half of 2011 is evidence to our commitment to grow the bank in a highly capital generative way. Equally, the simple pro forma calculation done here shows you the strength of our capital position, even without taking into account our sovereign risk reduction or the fact that the pre-impairment income used by the EBA in its baseline scenario is well below analysts' estimates.</p>
          <p>And we now move on to the sovereign exposure on select countries. As I said at the beginning of my presentation, and on page 27, as you can see, we've significantly reduced our sovereign exposure to PIIGS countries since year-end. Having said this, we still hold net loan positions in all PIIGS countries. They are just somewhat moderated versus year-end 2010, which means that at the end of the second quarter 2011, as a firm, we were not positioned to benefit from a sovereign default.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a bit more color on Greece and Italy. For Greece, you see a reduction of about &#x20AC;450 million, which is fully explained by redemptions, which means that we had maturing exposures as well as some of the markdowns taken since December of 2010.</p>
          <p>For Italy, you see the most significant absolute reduction. Our net sovereign exposure for the &#x2013; all the counties we show on this chart, here the reduction is driven by two principle factors. Firstly, our desire to offset the exposures we added to DB Group as a result of the consolidation of Postbank that also is part of our acquisition strategy and which we've now largely completed. And secondly, protection bought into the S forms in our trading book.</p>
          <p>On page 28, I will give you our update on our 2011 targets. I'm sure that's a question you will have based on our half year performance, but as we show on here, our &#x20AC;10 billion target published in 2009 and which we updated in February includes pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;6.4 billion from our Corporate Banking and Securities business. Delivery of this target is predicated on certain assumptions, as we have always told you, about the operating environment, which we have clearly communicated and most recently, as you remember, updated in February.</p>
          <p>During the first half of 2011, the actual development did not confirm all this environment assumption, including FX movements. The intensified European sovereign debt crisis led to investor uncertainty and thus, the significantly lower volumes and revenues, especially in our CB&amp;S division.</p>
          <p>Our ambition to report income before income taxes of &#x20AC;6.4 billion in the segment may now be difficult to achieve. And it's dependent on a swift and sustained resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis and, obviously, a return to significantly improved operating environment in the second half of 2011. In this context, obviously, we see the most recent agreement reached by European governments, the private sector and the IMF as a positive and constructive step.</p>
          <p>The performance of Deutsche Bank's classic banking businesses, Global Transaction Banking and taken together with our successful delivery of more than half of the targeted benefit from our efficiency program in the first half of 2011, give us confidence that our &#x20AC;10 billion pre-tax profit target from core businesses in 2011 remains in sight.

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, everyone. I have a few questions that I was hoping to follow up with you. The first one is the question relating to slide nine where you showed essentially the comparative funding position of Deutsche Bank versus everyone else.</p>
          <p>And I was just wondering, I guess in today's times, this is a significant competitive advantage. And I have two questions. One, do you think we're going to see the benefits of this in your P&amp;L over the course of the second half of the year? And can you give us a sense to what extent you feel this is a substantial competitive advantage versus your peers?</p>
          <p>And the second question on this I wanted to ask is, to what extent does it become tempting for Deutsche to engage in interbank operations on a slightly more significant scale than you have to date? Given that, I assume you can make easily a 100 basis point margin just through some of your interbank positions where you could put them on at current funding spreads.</p>
          <p>The second question that I have is more of a bigger picture question and relates to this analyst debate surrounding the risk-weighted assets. I think that your average risk weight was down around 100 basis points again in this quarter. I think you were at 26% on an adjusted basis in Q1. And I think we get to 25% currently. And I was just wondering whether that's due to an increase in your liquidity reserve, as you suggested, the &#x20AC;15 billion or if there is anything else.</p>
          <p>And the second question on this topic is given how the Fed has picked up the volume on this issue and I think you had a statement by the Fed governors over the past few weeks, and I believe there was another one last week. Where do you stand on this? Because I think it's very clear that the Fed and some of the other regulators are looking towards the German, French and the Swiss banks on this issue. Do you expect any changes on this front or not?</p>
          <p>And the final question is purely a numbers question. I think on page 27 you show &#x20AC;12.1 billion of net sovereign exposure to the periphery at the end of the year. I think your EBA stress test submission suggested &#x20AC;10.9 billion. I was just wondering what the difference is.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I was also wondering if you could update us on the interbank exposure to the periphery. I think that the EBA submission suggested exactly &#x20AC;20 billion of interbank position versus the periphery banks. Can you give us an update on this, as well? Those are my questions. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jernej, lots of questions. Okay, let me try to go through them one-by-one. The first question here you asked was the funding benefits in P&amp;L in the second half. The bank has always enjoyed and it's always been obviously part of our P&amp;L, our strong funding positions. And as you know, I always present this chart in the context of the whole capital debate and our view that if you have these strong advantages on the funding side, you may be able to &#x2013; from a capital perspective, you know, to be slightly more in the mid-group of capitalizations than to be on the high-end and carry lots of surplus capital to the disadvantage of our investors.</p>
          <p>So in that sense, yes. So obviously, the bank always will benefit then. Will we do more interbank levying with that interest? Clearly, no. We are not necessarily a bank that, as you know, builds our P&amp;L on NIM. Yeah, it's not something we do. It's not a game that we played pre the crisis. And we didn't use our lower funding to invest in sovereign, et cetera. As you know, our hedge business model doesn't imply this. So, I don't think there is a risk of any of that type business to occur.</p>
          <p>Our average risk-weighted assets of 26%, you have to bear that any asset that even under U.S. GAAP, including the derivatives, I think gets the specific risk-weight. The second quarter movement shows again that there is no direct link, yeah, between our balance sheet and our risk-weighted assets. And as I told you in the presentation, the second quarter included a benefit from our parameter calibration on our risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>You asked a question about the Fed and some other regulators that we're looking, specifically at French, German Banks for &#x2013; and to look at the risk-weighted assets, the total assets. I've had personally discussions with the Fed and this is true. Again, the main difference continues to be that obviously, our U.S. peers did not implement Basel II. And as you know, there are benefits of implementing Basel II if you, number one, go more granular in your risk metrics, and second, obviously, if you have a hedging business model, as we have.</p>
          <p>And that really explains all the difference. And in all the discussions we have with the Fed where we have had clarify that many of this market rumor discussions about lower risk-weighted assets for European versus American entities can be easily explained by mainly the factors on how the Basel II framework works versus how the Basel I framework works.</p>
          <p>And to be honest, in an assessment that we did, if this Basel II assessment is right, the more you hedge, obviously, the lower risk you have and the lower risk weighting these assets should get, the more granular you are in terms of how you manage your risk. And the more granular you are, how your models works in terms of assessing this risk, the better, obviously, and the lower risk-weighted assets you should carry.</p>
          <p>I will owe you the different number on &#x2013; I think, I don't have this number here to explain to you the difference between our PIIGS reported number in the EBA and the number we have here. Maybe we'll call you after the call to explain the difference. I just don't have this number with me. And the same to the bank exposure, I will owe you that number as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. Thank you very much. Can I just follow up &#x2013; sorry, just very, very briefly on your comments in regards to essentially most of the differential in the average risk weight being explained by the implementation of Basel II in Europe. Two questions on this, again, very briefly. It almost sounds like you're expecting that when the U.S. banks go to Basel III and hence essentially by implication implement these models for Basel II, as well, that they will be recalibrating their average market risk down. Do you think that that's what's going to happen? And I mean do you believe that the U.S. regulator, for example, will allow the U.S. banks to be releasing capital from their trading books? I guess that's my first question on that topic.</p>
          <p>And the second one is my sense, listening to the U.S. regulator in particular, but also I guess the U.K. is evermore vocal on this issue, is that they expect under the auspices of the Basel committee to essentially check the select risk-weighted models of banks which come out with particular low risk-weights. So, if I understood you correctly, your position basically is even if you check the risk models, you wouldn't come out thinking that banks calculate risk in a substantially different way today. Did I understand you correctly? Either there's no real difference on the calculation side, you attribute it all to Basel II versus Basel I.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The review we did still for Deutsche Bank as we looked at it, we did an interesting analysis to look how our risk-weighted assets developed when we switch from Basel I to Basel II. And there was clearly a benefit from moving. And when you discuss whether this benefit is justified or not, it is clearly justified because the Basel II contains a benefit, yeah, if you have lower risk then you carry lower risk-weighted assets, which is very transparent and logical.</p>
          <p>Second, let's not forget all these models, we have to provide to our regulators and all these models are continuously checked and looked at by our regulators, and have to be verified by all regulators. So it's not like we can invent models in here by ourselves and run around this. And this perception that's being created, I sometimes believe with some political purpose, it's just incorrect. Yeah. Believe me, we have been &#x2013; it's not like the Fed has started to look at Deutsche Bank now. The Fed has been looking at Deutsche Bank ever since we operate in the United States. And, of course, we have these discussions with the Fed, as well, but it's the Basel's main task to review and look at these models, which they do, and these discussions are intense.</p>
          <p>So, I tell you, yes, there was a benefit going from the one model to the other, which was also, in our view, a completely justified benefit. What will happen with Basel III, I'm sure that some of these benefits &#x2013; there might be some benefit there as well. But on the other hand, the risk weights are increasing so much that you may not really see them, yeah. So, I would answer your question that technically you might see these type of benefits, but effectively because of the substantial increase overall in risk weighting that both frameworks bring with themselves, you will not see.</p>
          <p>And therefore, this gives you some explanation of this <mark type="ph" /> come over (41:29) &#x2013; I think after all this discussion we did, I personally did have a session also with the Fed in the U.S. We had Basel sessions to really go after this issue and I can very clearly say, the systems implemented Basel II framework implemented is as honorous the Basel I framework implemented in terms of the quality of implementation, in terms of the need.</p>
          <p>It just reflects on an improved basis what your true risk is. And if a bank under the Basel II framework has higher risk weighted assets than the other, it clearly means it either carries higher risk or it has less granular models to report, for which then obviously because if you report less granular, there is a safety margin put on top of your risk-weighted assets to make sure that if you have deviation in the non-so-granular view that the bank is protected. And I think that this is very reasonable, very straightforward. And all the other discussions around it, for me, it's just politics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was just hoping, you could just give us a bit more detail on the impact of the bank levy in future years. I think there was a &#x2013; it was reported that Joe Ackermann had talked about &#x20AC;700 million to &#x20AC;900 million as being a possible <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:04) when presenting to Parliament. And just wondering, as that seems a large number compared to the &#x20AC;124 million occurring this year. So, hoping you could just square the difference there and maybe there are some net impacts of the U.K. levy that you could let us know. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew, good question, you know we've got this law now put in place in Germany. And overall, obviously, we are not now in a position to give you guidance with any degree of reliability, because as you know, this tax &#x2013; this levy is based on our German accounting results, which are substantially different than obviously our IFRS results. And it's also true, as you stated, for 2010, yeah, the HBG results for DB AG were exceptionally low because we also had the other implementations of the new German bill mark, which allowed us to put some substantial reserves aside in our German accounts, yeah. And therefore, obviously, we did report a substantially low HBG result and that's why the bank levy, as we have reported today, is low.</p>
          <p>The basis on a going forward basis will be much higher, and as you know, the system is designed, it has a cap. So, we anticipate that we might be at that cap from time-to-time and therefore, obviously, what is going to happen that we have a roll-forward of the tax that was capped, yeah, and this roll-forward will continue to build.</p>
          <p>And I also caution you that the German Government has built in a provision that if this funds, yeah, that they are planning to fill with this bank levy to protect the banking system in Germany, if it doesn't fill as quickly as expectations are, they may from time-to-time also add exceptional taxes to it. And that's why I please ask it's very difficult to predict. I can clearly say the number for this year was at the lower-end because of the bill mark implementation and certainly will somewhat grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just follow up then? I'm a bit surprised that you are not taking an accrual for that catch-up in the future years under IFRS this year. So, do you expect to, under IFRS, accrue for it kind of on a cash basis rather than on more of a fair value basis?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, should we be adding the U.K. bank tax of &#x20AC;200 million to that &#x20AC;124 million for the German tax this year? Are they additive or is there some overlap there, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. First of all under IFRS, we're not allowed to accrue for this type of a tax and we don't accrue for it. And the second question the answer &#x2013; it is an estimate, please, the &#x20AC;200 million is an estimate. And as we understand, there will be some recognition of taxes bank levy paid in Germany and U.K. So, there will be some recognition, but the rules are not clear. So, I couldn't tell you at this point how much of the &#x20AC;200 million respectively of the &#x20AC;124 million will compensate each other. So, at this point in time, I think it would be a safe assumption to look at it as an additive basis, but obviously we hope that there will be some recognition, at least on the portion in the German bank levy, that is attributable to our U.K. business. Yeah, so to give you maybe a help in which direction we think at this point in time the double taxation avoidance will go.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then finally could I just follow up on the &#x20AC;10 billion target, just to absolutely clarify that the &#x20AC;10 billion target isn't necessarily dependent on a recovery in markets. It's just a &#x20AC;6.4 billion target in the CBS division that you think is dependent. Is that the right -?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I had two questions, please. The first one is on slide 25, what do you think the underlying increase in the impaired loans is, if we exclude the Postbank noise?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the management changes you've announced. How will you split the co-CEO responsibilities between Anshu and Mr. Fitschen? And then I guess thinking about Joe's role in the future, I mean German Corporate Governance discourages CEOs becoming Chairmen, but you've decided to do it anyway. Why are you as a management team excluding Joe comfortable this is a good idea? I guess my question is how certain are you, you wouldn't get a third co-CEO through Joe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer the last question, that's something you have to ask the supervisory board to answer because, as you know, in German Governance that's not a topic debated at management board level, nor is it a decision at management board level. So, I just have to defer to another group of people.</p>
          <p>And your other question, we have 10 months to go, and obviously, as you can assume, it's way too early to discuss on how &#x2013; and I think that's between Anshu and J&#xFC;rgen. They will, I'm sure, sit down and think about how they will run the business and discuss that with the board. And again, we have 10 months to go until they assume. So, I think there is plenty of time for lots of debate to happen over the next couple of months.</p>
          <p>And then to your first question about the underlying increase ex-Postbank, it's about half. However, that half is driven by one commercial real estate situation, so no increase. We had really no underlying increase, excluding these two items. So we had this one CRE that's related to our business, to Deutsche Bank's business, and then the other was Postbank. So, underlying unchanged.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Three quick questions. First one is if SIFI, let's say will be ex &#x2013; let's say 9%. How much extra common equity do you think you would need in order to have kind of a cushion over the SIFI level?</p>
          <p>The second question is on page 34 on your funding source and liquidity. I was wondering the &#x20AC;150 billion of liquidity, how that is invested and what's the duration of it and how much money you are losing on that.</p>
          <p>And the last point is on corporate investment, you mentioned last quarter that it should have a cost for the year of about &#x20AC;300 million pre-tax. We're roughly at &#x20AC;300 million now in the first half. Does that mean we should assume more or less zero for the second half? Thanks?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks moderator, but we seem to be fine technically. Kian, so the SIFI, we expect our current view is seven obviously based at 2.5 SIFI, so we will be at 9.5%. And we assume that there will be a cushion on top of it that will be maybe a percent or two maximum, but no further significant additional, because the reason of having a SIFI is as an additional protection. So, we think around 10%, maybe slightly north of 10% is what we expect that we need, but at the end, the market will decide what that you &#x2013; if more than we can decide it ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's common equity, I assume, the Basel on top?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the new Basel definition that you &#x2013; I would say the new clean capital definition or whatever we want to define it to be. And that will obviously include also the discussion we have with our individual regulators then on it. So, I think that that's, I think, a fair assumption to take.</p>
          <p>The next &#x2013; on the liquidity reserve, I don't have any numbers. We don't calculate any P&amp;L impact out of that. I wouldn't be able only to tell you also at this point where specifically &#x2013; it's a cash reserve we have. It's obviously all invested into short-term taxing. So it does represent a liquidity reserve under current definitions and I don't have an impact of that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on Corporate Investment, where we wish we would go the second half with zero, that's for sure. I feel that will be not the case. I think we have recovery in all these businesses. At the end, we need to sell BHF that will be something that obviously will impact that CI, and that it will depend on obviously how the sale of BHF will go.</p>
          <p>Then second, we have Actavis. It's actually running quite well. But, we obviously have to look at our book value versus the cash flow derived model of that. So, it's always a valuation, and therefore one-time driven.</p>
          <p>Then we have the casino, which is improving. As we go, it's getting more into an operational balance. And the hotel, I think, is working quite well. The casino itself needs to still go into a regular mode of operandis. So we expect this to improve over year and hopefully provide a slight positive over the year. And then we have our ports that are on an EBITDA basis already positive and developing well, but they have some interest cost and depreciation they have to carry, which is what causes them to lose money. So, I would expect a much improved second half than first half, but certainly we might see some further impacts positive and negative in the second half year.</p>

          <p>Hello. Good morning, Mr. Krause. You had a very strong reduction in costs in the sustainable area, especially in PCAM. Do you think this is now a run rate or are there some special effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just no, this is really run rate. As you know, we have these three efficiency initiatives in the group running, which is Integra for the Investment Bank, which is the Postbank integration for our PBC business, and which is the complexity reduction that goes up for the cost base of the infrastructure. And all of them are providing run rate results. They're all designed and measured to bring run rate results. We really had no one-off benefits in these numbers. So, you can assume &#x2013; and that was also our aim and ambition to really continue to lower the expense basis, running against &#x2013; I have to expose you to the reality we all face and probably many of our competitors will report similarly.</p>
          <p>The new regulation cost, is the biggest negative we have to absorb and they are substantial. The additional deposit protection. You see all the bank levies. You see all the costs for implementing Dodd-Frank in the United States and all these line items are certainly having an impact on our business. And what &#x2013; and that's why we're disclosing it separately. The one-time effects on our cost base always is cost-to-achieve, which for example in the case of PBC I disclosed to you, so you know what one-time &#x2013; what these investments are, which generate future efficiency.</p>
