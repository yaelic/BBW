        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have the honor to open this Q4 Presentation with Atlas Copco. And I now will leave over the speech to the moderator, the CFO of Atlas Copco, Hans Ola Meyer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peri-Eric and heartily welcome to everybody here in Stockholm and everybody on the conference call, as well. We will follow the usual format. We have Gunnar Brock, our CEO, will make an introductory remark for about 20 minutes, and then we'll open up for questions-and-answer session after that.</p>
          <p>So with that, I welcome you all again and I leave the word to Gunnar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans Ola, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. We will try to keep this at around 20 minutes, and then it will be able &#x2013; you will be able to put all the questions you would like to do. I will also refer, as customary procedure, to the PowerPoint slide numbers, so those of you who are not in this room can follow.</p>
          <p>So, let us jump over to slide three immediately and try to put the highlight.  Some said it should be lowlight, but when we are through with the presentation, I think in the end, I am very convinced that given the state of the world, it is really highlight.</p>
          <p>Now, as you have seen, and I will touch on that more in numbers later on, the orders intake during the quarter, of course, dropped considerably, about 18%, organically, and then we add on the cancellations, particular within mining sector, but I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>The good thing, though, as we have said is that the aftermarket is still continuing to grow. And as we will count towards the end of this year, of course, the mix will be such that the aftermarket share of the total, barring a change in the demand situation, will of course be higher, and therefore that should sustain the margins.</p>
          <p>We have, perhaps, not been too vocal, but those of you who know us, know also that we have a relatively short sort of distance to react. So, we have actually reduced the number of people during the last three months of the year with about 1,400 &#x2013; close to 1,400. That means people have left the payroll, and who are no longer with us, and that has been possible through various actions. And that's not been in Sweden only, not at all, it's been in a global fashion. And finally, the Board just proposed, some hours ago, that we will keep the dividend unchanged to three krones per share.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, number four. Now, a little bit more in figures, what I just said verbally; 19% organic order intake drop, and if you add the cancellations, mainly in the Construction and Mining about 8%, it turned out to be 27. Revenues, as we have an order book and as we go into the first quarter of this year, we also have an order book, revenues grow by 3%.</p>
          <p>The operating profit, just a little touch less than last quarter &#x2013; same quarter 2007. However, if you add back the redundancy costs to 258, you will see a margin of 18% to be compared to 19.3. And I think this is pretty strong given what is happening, when you go from a sort of tremendous high-capacity utilization into a very, very abrupt sort of status.</p>
          <p>Now, we were helped by the currency as you see. Hans Ola may give you a little more flavor to that later, but it also has to do with the financial net. Profit before tax, quite considerably above last year, one-time item of roughly 900 million Swedish krones relating to capital gain and repatriation of equity, Hans Ola may come back to that later as well. And that leaves us with a very high earnings per share, of course, for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Cash flow turned out quite strong in the end and that to us is important. It is a combination, and I will come back to that, of operating cash flow from the business and some cash flow from the financial items.</p>
          <p>Turning then to the world map, slide six. There you can see the geographic split of what I just said. These figures do contain the cancellations. So, the picture may not be as bleak as it looks here. If I take Compressor Technique, for instance, they had growth in South America, Africa and in Australia. So, they had a slightly better mix and substantially fewer, only 1 or 2% cancellations.</p>
          <p>Not dwelling too much on this, going to the North America, I think we confirm what everybody else is confirming, the MVI, motor vehicle industry is not doing particularly well. General industry is doing relatively better, but still below last year. The mining industry, particularly coal, surface coal did contract quite a bit in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Compressor business turned out pretty stable, and I think it has been better than expected, and quite a good performance actually. Perhaps, we are taking a little bit bigger slice of the cake as well. South America in the degree of misery, if you say, was actually not so bad. Brazil kept up very well until, I would say, December, when we also saw in Brazil what generally happened in other markets a bit earlier.</p>
          <p>Turning then to slide eight, Europe, where about 9% of the business in Europe is, what we call, Eastern Europe and the rest is the traditional Europe and the Northern countries. Similar picture there, we saw, basically across countries and business, there are similar developments, and mining business actually quite weak in Russia as well. Africa, a bit better; Central Africa, doing well in the mining, actually; South Africa, doing relatively well, as well.</p>
          <p>And then finally moving over to Asia, I think Japan, has been a troublesome market for many years, is ironically showing good figures, when the rest of Asia is showing less good figures. But I think the general backdrop in Japan has not improved, as you know, on the contrary. But I think we have done a few things to perhaps improve our positions.</p>
          <p>China, India; China rather weak except in the construction business, where CMT, but partly also in mining has actually done quite well and we see actually growth figures in China in that area. We may come back to that later. And Australia, finally, having done relatively better than other mining countries. And Compressor Technique is doing very well in Australia.</p>
          <p>So, that adds me up to the slide 10, and as Hans Ola said at beginning, it's the same procedure as every time. Unfortunately, it is not the same procedure, because for the first time the bar is showing the wrong direction. Our little graphic innovation, as you can see the colored part of the bar is the 18% organic decline, and then the transparent part of the bar refers to cancellations.</p>
          <p>Speaking about cancellations, particularly in the mining business, they have been going on at a similar rate during the first quarter. But in January, we see a slowdown in the cancellations, so an improvement on that respect. I think as we normally show, the slide 11 on the organic, and organic and adding there acquisition growth, you can see that, of course, with the changes and with the cancellations the 2008 bar does not stand as tall as the other bars.</p>
          <p>Coming over to the bridge, you can see to the left the orders received, the 8% cancellation, volume 22, price up three, so that together will be the organic of about 19%, nominally down 18. Currency, of course playing a role here, adding another 9 to the quarter figures, and for the year, it actually came out more or less without any impact.</p>
          <p>Quickly going over to the business areas, if you look at the figures, the return on capital and the EBIT figures for the three business areas, you can see that 18.6% for the group of 2008, I think is still very strong given the difficulty everybody has to try to adapt to the last quarter of this year. Return on capital 34, if you add the customer finance business which now is starting to creep in, you should add 3, 4%, if we would take the rouse excluding the customer finance business.</p>
          <p>Now we are on slide 15, I think, talking about the business areas, Compressor Technique in the quarter had about 15% lower order intake, and you could generally say it was to be seen in those parts and in those segments, barring what I said just a little while ago actually U.S. held up pretty well, and so did Australia but otherwise similar pattern.</p>
          <p>I think if you add back the redundancy cost 21.4% EBIT in the quarter, I think is very strong, and I will say this and repeat this many time. We must remember that we went into the year, and it was records on every parameter until basically 1st of October. So with the difficulties you have &#x2013; and I'll come back to that when I talk about flow through later on &#x2013; you will see a, I think a very strong performance by Compressor Technique.</p>
          <p>A small acquisition was made, hasn't been consumed in its entirety yet, because we are waiting for some anti-trust approval in one or two markets, but in several markets it has been approved.</p>
          <p>And I will not dwell on slide 16, but that shows the graph over time, and as you can see although this revenue growth, we have still and of course, been able to keep a steady, steady earning capacity in different growth modes.</p>
          <p>CMT, Construction and Mining Technique had, as we've said, the sharpest decline in the order intake, 16% of the order declined, over 27% was cancellations. Mainly mining, and as, I've said just a little while ago, the rate of cancellation has dropped considerably in January compared to the quarter.</p>
          <p>Aftermarket as well in Compressor Technique as in CMT is growing steadily and if you take away the &#x2013; or add back the redundancy cost of 100 million, you will see that, it was basically an unchanged EBIT margin. Yes, helped by currency EBIT, no question about that. But I think also the difficulty has been pretty big for CMT to adapt to the slowdown. I'll come back to that and here you see the graph on slide 18 or is it possibly 19 &#x2013; 18.</p>
          <p>Then moving over to the worst hit in terms of profit numbers, the Industrial Technique, where we're adjusting for the redundancy had a 16% profit margin.</p>
          <p>Now, why do I say it's been the worst hit? Well, it is the business area of the three that has the most exposed anatomy, because basically, what you can say they have very high gross margins and very high functional costs.</p>
          <p>So when revenue drops, it has a very quick impact on the profitability. So they are of course, fighting with a lot of redundancy and under absorption as well as adjustments. So it is not surprising and this has been shown in the past, when downturns have been even &#x2013; or hasn't been as bad but you can see the effect. So there is nothing strange about that.</p>
          <p>Then the mix vis-&#xE0;-vis customers has been more of projects and less of components and we have seen &#x2013; we've been buying and reselling more products as some of our customers really want us to take a bit bigger scope of supply and when you then add products that are not your own proprietary products you have, pretty low profitability on those.</p>
          <p>So, let me then move over to the financials, slide 22. And I think it summarizes what I have said and I don't think I need to dwell on this anymore. We have talked about those figures before. Coming back to the flow through and I will basically talk about all three business areas at the same time so I just turn over to the next, which is 24.</p>
          <p>I think there is nothing strange that the flow through is bad because what we've seen of course is a tremendous increase in capacity and activity for five years. And in a normal slowdown, these adjustments, they come gradually over time, but when you have such a sharp slowdown you have the adjustments. So that's under absorption, its warrantee and return and write-downs of spare parts. It is obsolescence. A lot of normal adjustments come all-in-one. So from this point of view, I am not concerned that the flow through hasn't been better. I think we have really sort of gathered a lot of since that has been building up during several years.</p>
          <p>Now, there is nothing wrong about that what you would like to see perhaps it's a slower decline, so you don't bring out everything at once. We will of course not be free of this in Q1 either, but I think we have seen I would be surprised if we haven't seen the worst at least this quarter.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet on slide 25, yes there is quite an inflation in the balance sheet but I think you could pretty quickly consolidate the figures between the previous periods and December by referring to currency as a major part, but also we have cash and other financial assets that are substantially higher and then also some deferred tax assets so when you add that together it is not &#x2013; not terribly strange.</p>
          <p>What we are seeing though and I'll show you that when we come to the cash flow figures in the wireless of course, a reduction in the working capital starting to take place.</p>
          <p>Net debt to EBITDA, a little bit lower hardly though and that's of course been inflated by the currency. Hans Ola, I'm sure, will come back, but of course we have seen a really extremely unusual change in the dollar and particularly in the euro/Swedish krona rates and of course this has had an effect on our balance sheet, but Hans Ola will talk a bit more about that.</p>
          <p>Perhaps to mention also that our loan maturity you've seen in the slide before is good, in addition to this we have very little outstanding in the outside the Atlas Copco AB about one billion spread in different countries and in different maturity rates. So, looking from this point of view, I think we have a very enviable perhaps profile.</p>
          <p>Cash flow quite strong, which is important. We have been a little bit and particularly myself a bit I am patient that we haven't seen the reduction in working capital starting to take place until basically in the end of the period and as you can see here change in working capital it's been reduced by a bit over 100 million, than of course comparing with that same quarter the year before when we still grew the business we sort of invested another 800 in the working capital.</p>
          <p>So as we go forward, no doubt the cash flow will start to come back in a good way. It does take several months before the inflow of components, before the work in progress, before the sales stock is really being sort of worked through. And if you have the cancellations of 16% like CMT, it is not easy to quickly adjust. So, impatience is good, but I think we will be rewarded as we go into this first quarter. But still a very good cash flow although as you can see some of it relating or is related to financial items.</p>
          <p>Investments are a little bit higher. We are not investing unnecessarily today, but the investment decisions taken 2006, 2007 has of course trickled through, but you will also see a much reduced fixed assets investment to '09 compared to the figures you see here.</p>
          <p>Moving, then over to the slide about dividends. As you can see here, some anomalies in the charts, but these are positive anomalies I think, so we are &#x2013; don't excuse ourselves for that. We have maintained the dividend at three krona. We have and we believe we will have a good cash flow. We believe that the resilience in our business model will prevail even into '09, even taking care and taking into account potential acquisitions, but also a slightly lower tax rate going forward compared to earlier. I think we are prudently able and prepared to suggest an unchanged dividend.</p>
          <p>Then looking at the summary, since most arrows have been pointing down so far. I think I could show at least one slide showing some arrows pointing upwards. And although we ended the 2008 on slightly misery or miserable note. I think, we still added almost two billion more to the profit, the operating profit. So I think that all-in-all it is perhaps as Hans Ola suggested it was a tough ending to a very good year.</p>
          <p>And this is &#x2013; sum it up here for the year as a whole, I will not read that. I think you can do that yourself. Slide 32 for those of you are on the phone lines. And then the outlook, which is pretty short and sustained, and I think that is basically what we see. I think there is one aspect that I'm sure you will ask about. And I think it is a positive ingredients looking at 2009, and that is the massive investment in infrastructure that almost every government around the world have proposed.</p>
          <p>We see stabilization in the construction center. We see now we should not get carried away. But we see that this will most likely start to show as we work through the year, most of it will probably come in the second quarter. But as I said China is already actually pretty active in this sector. So I think the positive ending is that if there is anything that may surprise us particularly the second half year it is that sector.</p>
          <p>So by that, I think, we close and leave the floor Hans Ola to the guests and the people on the line.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gunnar. We start the question-and-answer session, and before we actually get going, I think I ask the operator to repeat the instructions for question from the conference call.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was quick, so without further ado, I think we start here in Stockholm and we take two questions here and then we follow-up with two questions from the conference call. So we start here is there a microphone there? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n, Handelsbanken. A question about the cancellations, predominantly done in the mining field. Have you been very active in trying to get customers to cancel, are you not postponing their orders? And how you actually manage this, because it's a quite a significant number you're guiding about cancellation rates coming down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bit of an unusual question, because we don't normally have people who are skilled at calling the customers, saying please cancel your orders. And so, I think that where we have been very careful, but we have been that even before we saw the downturn. And that is to ask distributors, do you really have end customers? Are you really going to take the few orders? Because distributors are perhaps a bit more tactical sometimes, but they also have difficulty to pay for the equipment if they don't have an end user, who basically takes over the equipments. So there we have been trying to sort of sort out the potential cancellations.</p>
          <p>When it comes to large mining companies, I think they have skillfully themselves called us and said they don't want the equipment or they want it postponed. I think that, most companies would rather say, we cancel the equipment rather than postponing, because it maybe a better position today to talk about cancellation fees, and penalties et cetera. We do have those in some cases, you can evoke them sometimes, sometimes you can not. But I mean, logically, the cancellation rate will go down as the order books will be more and more of a short-shelf and fresh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my second question, if I may, regarding your cost savings habit, quite a big number two billion, and could you please explain that a bit more in detail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's actually a rather simple calculation, because if you add what we have done in Q4 and what has already been put in place to a very large extent for Q1 and Q2 this year. Just the number of employees not being on the payroll will add up to those sums. Then of course, we crosscheck with, what we call, functional costs and, of course, we are not only trying to save people, which is a rather miserable work and nobody is happy for every single person that has to leave, but we are also, of course, trying to reduce costs in other areas. But people are both part of the functional sales administration and marketing costs as well as they are part of the factories and the cost of goods.</p>
          <p>So, if you add up, it's a rather realistic figure, no doubt, if by mid-year all those programs will have been enacted upon. And there you can &#x2013; if you are pressing us on the redundancy or extraordinary restructuring costs, it is of course very difficult to say, because in some cases where we have given notification to people and you have six months of notice. In some cases, of course, there will be no redundancy costs because the people will stay on for the full period. In other cases, people will be asked to leave and then we will, of course, pay the residual amounts.</p>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; it's a difficult thing, because it's pretty demoralizing to have people staying on if there is no sensible work to be done. On the other hand, given the flexibility we have, if things should turned for a little bit better, then of course one wouldn't like to have seen qualified people leave. So, I think therefore it is difficult to give a very fair sort of month or quarterly. I think, the first half of the year will sort out. But the cost savings are, no doubt, of that magnitude, on a run rate from second half of next year, and we have seen, of course already, the last month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I've two questions, a follow-up on the previous one. Among 3,000 people who leave the company, are there any temporary employees, so the easy targets you move first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, out of those close to 1,400 that's left in the last three months of the year, there were a lot of the temporary employees. There are still temporary employees in some parts, but you know when you are working in 160, 70 (sic) [170] countries around the world, there are different rules in every country about what is a temporary employee and what is not. Countries like Belgium, where we have CET, as you know, there you can have a flexible system, where workers leave more or less immediately but you pay a fourth and the government pays three-quarter. In other countries, you have different arrangements.</p>
          <p>So, yes, there are still left, people in the organization, who could be classified as temporary. Then we have consultants who are 100% occupied by us, but technically, not on our payroll, and they are over 1,000 people. So, there you have a -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are they included in the 3,000 as well -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there are parts of those, not all of them. But, there are parts of those. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question is regarding order intake. I guess the order intake has been even &#x2013; not evenly spread during the third quarter that means that December should have been the worst month. And what do you see now in January? Should we expect another downturn in the order intake of the same magnitude or even worse, maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you talk about -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>19%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...rate of decline or the &#x2013; no, I think you &#x2013; I think that you will see a Q1 &#x2013; you will not see an improvement on the contrary. I think if you take the Q4, it started off better, or relatively less good in October. And now I think we have to be very careful when drawing conclusions from December and January, because so many companies did not have any activities going on for several weeks or even six, seven weeks. We have a lot of companies, who didn't really start activities until end of January. We have the Chinese New Year making China pretty, sort of, passive as of 22nd, 23rd of January.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's a little bit hard to use December and January as a guide. But, it's not looking &#x2013; judging from that, it will not look better on the contrary. But I think we have to, and I think, we all have to see how February, March looks. There is a reduction in inventory in the manufacturing world. I'm not sure we have such a good hand on that and I think that companies like Caterpillar, the other day, showed how difficult it is for them to keep track even on their distributors to know the stock.</p>
          <p>So, are our customers coming to the end where they can reduce inventories no more?  I think, we don't really know that yet. But that is logically it's an issue of timing. Ones it is then we will see what the run rate is. But, I think it's very difficult to be too precise.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, Nico Dil from JP Morgan. Two quick questions please. First of all, on the lead times within the different divisions, just to get a feel of also, how far these cancellations can still keep up. Could you highlight what lead time is currently in CMT and CT? Second question is you highlighted that organic orders were down about 43% in CMT, how much of this was due to construction and what was due to mining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with the last question first. I mean the 43 included 19%. I think it was 19 or 16 cancellations, and I think the important thing is the run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>16.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>16, so take away 16 from the 43 to get some kind of run rate. The majority is mining. By far, the majority is mining. And in the new order intake, we can see a, as I alluded to earlier, shift towards more construction of the mix than mining. Lead times differs from different divisions. Gas and process, basically, has a full order book for the year. Their lead times are depending a bit on the type of equipment, relatively long still. Oil-free Air; couple of months, depending on the type of equipment. Most of the other comprehensive business, rather short, so be it for most of the CMT. There may be large special drill rigs that have a longer delivery time, but from stock to three to six months, depending on what we talk about.</p>
          <p>Industrial technique has, of course, normally a components delivery where we basically shift from our distribution centers. So, there we have a very short lead time or a delivery time, larger system deliveries, a bit longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Shall we take the second question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Arnaud Brossard from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have two questions. The first one would be on prices, and I would like it if you could comment on your view on pressure on prices in the next few months. My second question is on savings, and I would like to know if you could tell us when you expect these to be implemented in real effective savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I start from the back again. As I said, the &#x2013; provided, as we stated in the report, the program is run as it's been put in place, you will see the run rate as of second half next year, but of course progressively. But again, this depends very much on the way we do this, whether people work the notice period or whether we sort of financially settle before that. But, all that aside from second half run rate should be in.</p>
          <p>Prices is an interesting thing because, obviously, classic theory would argue that prices would be under a lot of pressure, and I think they are in general. However, I think that for us being who we are with our heritage, it's very important to keep prices at a desired level. And therefore, I think we will really aim at that going forward. And so far, we've managed well to keep our prices. But, there maybe pockets where things warrant more aggressiveness, but generally, there is a life after this. And therefore, we are going to maintain our prices as much as ever, ever possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just detail a bit on what pockets are the weaknesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it &#x2013; general pockets, it could easily be said. There may be countries where a particular competitor has a lot of stock. And they may &#x2013; depending on who the competitor is, they may elect to try to be very aggressive on getting rid of that stock, which I think is pretty standard actually. Now, we are not going to do and act that way. Our stocks are moderate, and therefore, I think we don't have to. So therefore, I cannot say where and when, but in the global empire, I'm sure it's going to happen. But so to say, we will be very tough in trying to maintain a, and even positive, bridge component on price, but we will see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps just to add to that you can already, in the fourth quarter report, see that there is a slight difference between the business areas that might also give the hint to that Industrial Technique has had slightly more challenging environment when it comes to prices and that's an indication that might also be carrying into 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I should add, Hans Ola, one thing on the prices and that is our product pipeline, our new product introduction is very good for the 2009. And of course, that is the most important way of trying to keep prices up when you introduce new products that are hopefully more performing and we have a religion that when we introduce new products they should always be lower to manufacture than the products they replace. And so far, I think we keep that pretty well. How that pans out, of course, in a market situation to what extent we will be really following or tactically delay product introductions, that is a tactical issue we will play case by case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last question. If demand remained at a low level, would you expect the pressure on prices to increase during the year or do you expect it to be stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; generally, for any industry, generically, the pressure would increase. But it depends also on who is there to compete with you. And in the end, as I said again our heritage is not to be a price fighter, and as a market leader in most areas, I think it's pretty clear what we will try to do.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. We turn again to two questions here in Stockholm. We have one in the back there. If you please state your name before, it would be -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mats Liss, Swedbank. Just a couple of questions; first, regarding orders, again. Well, the cancellations, have it &#x2013; well, this &#x2013; have it made you, well, stock up on finished goods that has to be distributed later on, or are you sort of free of those problems? And then secondly about the service, you in &#x2013; service in aftermarket you indicate that the growth have continued during the fourth quarter, and I just wondered if that's quarter-by-quarter, or is it gradually during the quarter as well. So, you started out January on a pretty good note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Where do we have stocks? I take Compressor Technique, not much, not that much. And I think again, it comes back to the different make-up of the divisions as well as the way we are producing, because we are not producing at full stock, no but we produce that &#x2013;  So, I think that is not a sizable problem. CMT, there are in some areas for drill rigs, surface drill rigs, there are a bit of sales stock. But, what you can do is you can rebuild those, not all of them. In some cases, you have to wait for the order, but in some cases you can decide whether you want to rebuild them for a respect that is more current. But in the other area, it is not that much easy.</p>
          <p>Industrial Technique, we have &#x2013; for most of the product, we have launched distribution center in Europe which is sort of more or less delivering out of stock. And there, of course, we are gradually reducing that, but it takes of course a bit of time. And IT, as I said earlier, it's the business area that is hit the hardest, the fastest, because of the high gross margins and high cost levels, which means they will have a lot of under absorption and adjustments. Aftermarket, yeah, I'd &#x2013; aftermarket is aftermarket and consumables, particularly for, well all three business areas have consumables, but particularly CMT. It's been a growth, but the growth has been a bit small, lower in &#x2013; let's say in the second half than in the first half, but it's still a relatively good growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we have another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>More regarding Compressor Technique. Well, is the slowdown in that market, will it make you sort of speed-up the in-house use of your own compressor elements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah. Yeah, you are right. I mean, basically today, most of it will be done in-house this year. There may be not exactly 100% fit between our capacity to machine parts for certain rotors, because in the end you cannot change the mix in the manufacturing of rotors from one day to another. You have to take a bet on what will be the mix going forward a bit. But yes, we will do most of it ourselves. That will be very little outside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Johan Trocm&#xE9; from Nordea Markets. Gunnar, at the Capital Markets Day on the 4th (sic) [2nd] of December, you mentioned that you didn't want to cut back adapting to the coming downturn in research and development, and that the next area for review in scaling back could be those additional feet in the street in covering markets better, particularly in emerging markets. Will people in that part of the organization be part of this next wave of downsizing, or are you trying to maintain that effort?</p>
          <p>And the second question, if I could just add on straight away, may be for Hans Ola, could you just describe to us a little bit in what you did in the repatriation of overseas equity, which led to this capital gain? And is there anything more to be expected there that we should be aware of going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, we said in early December at the Capital Markets Day, there are two areas we will not scale back. R&amp;D, because; one, the people are difficult to find, and if you let them go, they may not want to come back; secondly, it's pretty &#x2013; I think it's pretty downright stupid to save 0.5% on R&amp;D costs. There is a life after this downturn. And if you want to &#x2013; if you can afford and we can afford to spend on those, we will. So, there will be no saving.</p>
          <p>The other area is aftermarket. We will not save anything in the aftermarket provided there is business, but it's a pretty simple decision, because it's a rather variable cost. If we get a service contract, we will deal with that. If we have service contracts that are cancelled, we will not have the resources staying with us. So, I think in that respect, we will be able to take whatever aftermarket growth and opportunities there are.</p>
          <p>And if I look then at feet in the street generally, I mean, yes, we are scaling back even some feet in the street in the world. There is no doubt about that. But, the &#x2013; if you go back and look at the business volume we had a couple of years ago and look at the resources we had then, I think it would be strange if we with the resources we will have this year will not be able to take the business that's there.</p>
          <p>I mean, CMT has gone for and I think if my memory serves  me right, 7 billion Swedish krones of turnover 2003 to 32 &#x2013; Hans Ola slaps me if I'm wrong, 32, I think in 2008, and we've had a lot of resources. So, no doubt we will be able to fight for whatever business there is out there with even a substantially slimmed down company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. When it comes to the repatriation of euro, I perhaps should start with an overriding comment that in this quarter we have seen, by far, the most dramatic currency changes vis-&#xE0;-vis the Swedish Krona in such a short period as far back as the big devaluation in 1992, perhaps. And that causes effects, not only in the financial net that you mentioned Johan, it causes effects that are difficult to predict and to project the size of them also in the cash flow statement and also in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So, this is sort of that type of a quarter, if I start with that. What we did was following the capital structure &#x2013; restructuring of 2007, we have a very large internal equity, internal capital in euro land; in Belgium and in Luxemburg. This is a capital that is tested for market value, so it's our operations value in short.</p>
          <p>Now, what we did in December was that we brought back some of that capital to Sweden. And the &#x2013; in order not to have a large currency exposure, we also had that capital, to a large extent, hedged by means of internal loans between euroland and Sweden in that case. Now, we have gone from a euro to Swedish krona rate of about 9 to 950, when this capital was put in place in 2007, and now we repatriated portion of it at close to 11 to the Swedish krona. So, that's been a tremendous change.</p>
          <p>In this structure, we can have a tax deductible currency loss on the loan that is not matched by the gain that we make on the repatriation or the dividend that we take from euro, meaning, basically that we have a tax-free gain of this 940 million. We have a more capital in euroland. Is there any plans to reduce that? Well, we look into the capitalization of the group continuously, and particularly in situation where there are tax changes in Sweden, as you know, coming up. Both, the income tax is going to change from 28 to 26.3, next year, there are new rules on the possibility to deduct internal interest between companies, and at the same time, we look at how big value in terms of euro &#x2013; in terms of Swedish krona do we carry, just because of the exchange rate, and we make an assessment.</p>
          <p>So, I cannot predict that there will not be more changes to that structure that might eventually lead to results of a similar nature that we have seen this time. But it was a very, very specific quarter and the magnitude became very big for that reason. So, the main message is perhaps that, yes, it is a realized event, but at the same time, we cannot build it into any forecast, we cannot predict it for the future.</p>
          <p>On the same token, there was also a mentioning in the report that in our cash flow, we also had a positive effect of similar &#x2013; related to the same basic topic that we have to bring certain internal deposits into Sweden. And again, when we hedge that to the Swedish krona, we have realized big gains on that hedging. And that is also only a cash-flow effect, though, and that's what we refer to as being a result of hedge transactions, when it comes to the cash flow as well.</p>
          <p>And finally, Gunnar also mentioned when you saw the balance sheet that also there, of course, there are huge translation effect that will not be realized over the income statement just because of the tremendous strengthening of the euro or the weakening of the Swedish krona, I should probably say. I think we move to the telephone then to keep the two-and-two order.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just two questions, please. Firstly, I was wondering if you could help us understand the Compressor Technique order trends, maybe some understanding of the extent different industries that face this or whether this is in your view related to say financing crisis in general sense or cautiousness. So, we can understand how this might take shape going forward? And the second question is just on the mining side, where you've seen most of the cancellations. If you could help us understand how your visibility may have changed in this segment of the business going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Compressor order trends, we have various divisions, different ones. Gas and process, as I said, we have a rather still large order book and deliveries secured for quite sometime. There I think you could base &#x2013; if there is one industry that stands out in a negative terms, I think it's air separation, where there is much less business. But, that's just one of the many applications. And air separation is, as some of you know, it's an ingredient often in steel mill, steel production, and of course steel production is not hottest item today.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, I think it is reasonably similar, because this whole downturn is affecting no particular sector really much more than others in &#x2013; you could say, I think you see the effects in consumer goods companies, et cetera. You could, of course, say that some of our oil-free air compressors that are destined for food industries may hold up better than others for chemical industries, et cetera, that general statement I think you can make. Same goes for, let's say, pharmaceutical end-users where you see a &#x2013; still no real downturn.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, the most affected one in CT is the portable air that, of course, has a large end-user market within the construction industry, and there you see, of course, some slowdowns. But as I said late earlier that this may, towards the end of the year perhaps or second half, turn out into a better trend, but there you see more of it being effected. A large part is aftermarket, and of course that part will increase as we go through the year, and there we see, as I said earlier, a good demand.</p>
          <p>In the mining industry, cancellations visibility, well, I think it is not that easy to have a very good visibility in the mining industry. What we see is that, for instance, our very large unit in &#xD6;rebro that deals with the underground rock excavation there mix, there is now quite some interest and orders in the construction sector, and these drill rigs are a bit more sophisticated and interesting, perhaps, on some of the mining rigs. And if you take, for instance, the Alpine region, Austria, Switzerland, France, perhaps bit of Slovenia as well, there are some very large projects being discussed. So, there, I think, we are pretty positive.</p>
          <p>So, coal mining, yes, I think coal mining doesn't look too good. We had a rather large exposure to gold, gold mining, and gold mining is holding up very well. It is the second largest, I think mineral for us, and it's holding up very well, as you know prices are good. So, you have to dig into the details. Is that a good enough answer to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's helpful. I was also thinking in terms of backlog visibility and just in terms of length of backlog and how it might be even or uneven inside the mining business, or the &#x2013; what challenges that might have created for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the challenges are, of course, that our cancellations of rigs are almost complete. Are they going to be sort of mitigated by new orders for similar type of rigs, and that's a bit hard to say. But, there is always for many rigs, not all, an opportunity to rebuild and adapt, if there are changes.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. And I had a question when it comes to the aftermarket. You're sounding fairly confidence about demand &#x2013; confident about demand there, but when you read the text in your statement, you're mentioning that aftermarket demand is weaker for industrial compressors, which is quite a significant segment in CT, and then you're also talking about weaker demand for consumables and CMT. Is there anything we should read into that? Are you seeing emerging weakness, even if the overall level of the demand is good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think the overall is good. You can find pockets of weaknesses, if you look hard enough, there is no problem in that. But on the other hand, you can also find pockets of strengths. So, if you add it all up, it is a growth area for all three business areas. Now, if the future is going to be like the past that when you have standstills, you inject as much maintenance as you normally did in a stand-down or in the recession. I think time will tell, but no large or major signs showing that today.</p>
          <p>I think we have to be very careful, and as I said earlier, when you take December and January, I think, it's very difficult to read out of that exactly how the landscape will look like, because so many companies did just scale down and stopped and went home during those two months that it is not a representative, I think, picture. So, I think we have to take it from there. I don't think I can promise you much more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, do you think the very quiet end to Q4 and at January here was good for your aftermarket business or that it maybe &#x2013; was a bit weaker than should have been?</p>

          <p>Yeah, I missed that comment. I think you mentioned earlier that why your operational leverage was weak but I missed it -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take it for you then. Very quickly, we have seen five, six years of unprecedented growth. And of course, when you see that, you add a lot of inefficiencies. Because the main focus is not productivity, it is to satisfy customers and to cope with the ever increasing demand. So you add inefficiencies.</p>
          <p>Now, in a normal downturn, you do away with those inefficiencies in terms of what you call adjustments over a period of time: write-downs, scrapping, et cetera. And you adapt your under-absorption also in a smoother way. When you see such a rapid fall, as everyone has seen in the last quarter, there is no way you can mitigate under-absorption in a couple of months and there is no &#x2013; and of course, everybody is bringing out all the inefficiencies; spare parts, write-downs, obsolescence, things like that.</p>
          <p>Dealing with sub-suppliers, as you know, we do have a lot of sub-suppliers, and this is part of our strengths, in terms of being flexible to cope with this. But you don't, sort of, severe your ties with sub-suppliers totally without any financial consequences. So there has been a lot of this coming up.</p>

          <p>Thank you. So I think we take two questions here in Stockholm, then we finally take two questions from the telephone conference after that. And that's unfortunately &#x2013; I know there are many questions left &#x2013; but if we do that. Two questions here and then two last questions on the conference call.</p>
          <p>Here in the Stockholm, if we have anymore questions here that is? Yes, couple of them. Yes. So we start over there then and we follow-up with you later.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Anders Eriksson, SEB Enskilda. If I may come back to the CMT business, you report an order volume contraction of 31%, could you please help us with the math and tell us what the equipment business did in the period, i.e., excluding the traditional after sales business and consumables? Yeah, I think I'll stop there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You sort out the math; I gave you the values, right? Equipment after-market grew, equipment declined. Mix &#x2013; so I think there is no other &#x2013; I mean, of course, it was all equipment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And after-market did grow spare service. So I think that's where you have it in general terms. So, I cannot, by heart, tell you exactly for what product categories. But, well, I can say, of course, as we said earlier, it's mainly mining related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, reading between the lines, it seems like consumables were also down, but down less than equipment, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our shipments. But what we are not totally sure of, like many of our colleagues in the industry is, is this a decline in the activity level or is it a stock reduction? Because we have had &#x2013; we know that customers have stocked. And we have had also an accumulation of sales stock around our customer centers around the world. Because when we have had promised to deliver they didn't have confidence in the factory to deliver. So they hoard it, and unfortunately that meant also stocks in many places.</p>
          <p>That's why we have taken back a local stock and therefore written-off obsolete parts. But it maybe a small, but not a major reduction in the consumption at the customer site, but in our deliveries there's been a bit of fall, not large, but a bit, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Also if I may, I didn't quite understand why cancellations eased in January, was it because customers have already cancelled what should be cancelled? Or have you been conservative? Or is it a combination of both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, they did. Now why I'm not so sure, but I said that if you sort out the old stuff in the fridge, it should be a short shelf life of what's left. And it's hard to imagine that those who placed orders the last five, six months have cancelled to the same extent to those who placed order a year ago. So, I mean, sooner or later it is going to ebb out, because obviously no one is putting spec orders with us anymore. That is gone, unfortunately, in a way where we &#x2013; perhaps we wouldn't mind if we didn't have those spec orders now. But &#x2013; so I think, I mean, it is slowing down clearly. But this is how the speculation about what I think is the only I thing I can do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We had another question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>H&#xE5;kan Filipson from Adrigo. I am just curious about to go back to the demand side. And I think part of the reason we all come back to this is that you didn't fall into the trap of believing things could only go up, a while ago. My question is, you say two things, you say on the hand, that Atlas Copco will cut CapEx substantially in '09. And I would imagine that most industrial companies would say that at this point, i.e., that you'd be in the receiving end of that.</p>
          <p>How do you tie that comment to the other one you say, which is that maybe Q1 will be the worst and infrastructure demand will probably lead the way in future. Does that tie &#x2013; is that only for CMT or is that for the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. CapEx generally, I mean, we have, as many of you know, we have been trailing all the time the last three, four, five years, where we haven't had capacity, CMT and Compressor Technique to deliver the orders that our customers have placed. So we have, of course, invested. And often it is between 12 and 24 month lead time, before you get the equipment in place. And of course, ironically then, we will now have quite a good equipment situation 2009, because investments we ordered and have run through are now in place, which is adding a bit to the under-absorption, of course, but you can't do much about that.</p>
          <p>But we're, of course, not investing anything more, anything we can hold-off, and this is, of course, contributing to the bad developments in the industry, because everyone is stopping any investments. We don't need to make any capacity investments anymore. But &#x2013; so stopping whatever we can stop in addition to not making new investment decisions will lead the CapEx for 2009 to be very modest, right. So I think that's not &#x2013; I mean that is pretty simple, although we would have liked not to have so much capacity now, but -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With all companies doing that, how could you then explain your other comment about how CMT makes you the most -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. All companies are doing that. But if I just add the stimulus packages promised by all governments around the world, and if only a tiny part of that is happening and coming into place, I think that it will be positive if nothing else. How positive and when? I think is hard to say. But we see, as I've said, good growth in China, where the government's actions have been put in place, probably, more swiftly than in any other places.</p>
          <p>But you just hear what is promised, I was going to almost left, right and center, but in this country, on road development the other day, in Norway, in Europe, in U.S., in India, perhaps there may be a capacity squeeze in the industry in 2010, when inventories has been done away with. And of course, it's different. We are not in the excavator or general construction equipment where inventories are very high. We are in portable compressors, high pressure portables, we are in construction tools, we are in pretty sophisticated drill rigs where there are not many competitors.</p>
          <p>So, to judge us 100% look-a-like to CAT or Tarex, I think is wrong. So I think, I wish I could tell you, exactly when this is going to show some positive signs, but it surely will be there, I think.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from James Moore of Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Some questions on your underlying margins, I wonder if you could help me a little bit more, because normally I find Atlas Copco quarterly margins easy to understand, but not today. You mentioned that your clean margins are down 140 basis points, given the tough environment, but I don't follow that given your organic sales growth is actually up. And if we take your profit bridge, you have shown organic sales growth of 457 million krona, but your EBIT is down organically 200 million. Normally you show a 30% drop-through, which would be 150 positive. So you're sort of 350 the wrong side.</p>
          <p>Could you help us, a little bit more, understand what happened to costs in the quarter. Gunnar you mentioned some write-downs, if you've taken some write-down, could you quantify them, so that we can get back to what the clean picture is? Is there anything materially on mix, for example, high margin aftermarket versus low margin OEM that helps explain that, because I'm finding that difficult to square off, that's my first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on cancellations, can you tell us what margin you've taken, if any, in the fourth quarter on cancellations? And secondly, what the average down payments on order backlogs are? And what the percentage of backlog has payment clauses in them, if there are further cancellations, it would be helpful to know that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Margins, we will sing a duo here, Hans Ola and I. Margins, currency has helped the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question, excluding the currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then secondly, what I talked about under absorption and adjustments, you know the adjustments in CMT and IT are about twice the normal size. And that is exactly relating to cleaning up of all these issues that I talked about. And when you have a very high gross margin and a high functional cost and you're deliveries fall substantially you have an issues, particularly in IT. But also in cleaning out the flows in CMT.</p>
          <p>And when we close service contracts or when we try to bring back surplus stocks in the customer centers around the world, you find a lot of write-down of obsolescence. We have pretty strict rules in when we do this.</p>
          <p>So adding all that up, I think that it is not so strange that &#x2013; or you can consolidate the margins. Looking at the other questions, I can't tell you from the top of my head, at least, what number of contracts of the total contract number is with penalty clauses. We do have and we try, but even if we have, depending on customer circumstance, you cannot evoke a penalty clause.</p>
          <p>The downpayment, I can't tell exactly either. Of course, we are trying to increase the downpayment. We're also getting more and more of our businesses covered by export credit insurance, where downpayment is reasonably high, 20, 30% very often. And then you have a good cover to the financial and political risks. But I can't tell you exactly what share of that is &#x2013; we have got some nice paybacks from customers who cancelled, and other cases we have fought hard and lost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But perhaps, we can say that, primarily, it's within the large gas and process compressors in CT, where we have a substantial part of the backlog, there they have, as a standard, downpayments received from customers. And for other reasons, that is an area where we don't expect that haven't seen a lot of cancellations so far at all. The cancellations have been primarily in CMT, and as a general statement, we don't have a lot of these contracts that have penalty clauses in that sense. So I think that's basically also what Gunnar alluded to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That helps on the cancellation. Can I just get back to the underlying margin and focus on CMT. You mentioned deliveries were down, obviously, orders were down dramatically, but your organic sales growth is up some 350 million, but you had an organic decline in EBIT? I don't understand how you get overhead absorption issues, if you got growing organic picture on the revenue basis, on the P&amp;L basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, it is not so strange, James. If you consider the tremendous cut in terms of incoming orders, as from early October, meaning that the planned activities in the factories have been dramatically affected already, even though there were shipments going on. But the load in the factories is very much affected already in the fourth quarter. This is unusual, when we look at previous downturn, because they have not been anywhere near so abrupt, but in this case, there is tremendously quick adjustment. And that has loaded the quarter with much more of under absorption cost on top of the other adjustments that Gunnar explained that comes from sort of trying to clean up for what might become even worse quarters to come. So it is doable to come to these effects, in spite of the fact that the revenue actually grew compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Were any of those one-off adjustments &#x2013; can you quantify them. Have you taken a big number of write-down -</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>That is above the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Most of them are many, many small items add up to a larger amount. I think, also, one thing on the under-absorption, don't forget what we've said several times, we have been investing a lot. We are getting, we have a &#x2013; during the whole autumn, and as we speak, we have really, fully invested, particularly in the rock-drilling tools, but also in the other parts of CMT.</p>
          <p>So that capacity has moved in, that is there to take care of even higher volumes. Now when the volume is not going higher, of course, we are added another under-absorption item to that, so it is not so strange in the end.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes. I was wondering, actually, if you could give us some guidance on exactly where your capital expenditure, or some area where your capital expenditure you think is going to go next year? And the other thing was, you mentioned Japan as a market that had been picking up for you. Is this something that's actually just one-off or can you explain a little bit what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I can say, it's not a one-off, but I think we have not performed well in Japan over many years. Japan is still the world's second largest industrial market, and will remain like that for many years to come. It is of little consolation that I think I can proudly say we have done better than any foreign company. But still I don't think we have done well enough.</p>
          <p>And we have tried to address that by looking at our organization. We have done a few changes in the way we run the Japanese business with people, et cetera. I hope I can say that we are stronger after the activities we've done, whether that will show in Q1 and Q2, I cannot say, I mean the Japanese economy is not the brightest place for the time being, but I think it's &#x2013; it will be interesting to see, but I can't promise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the CapEx, I think that we have made some word comments, if I call it at, to the end that the CapEx might come down and will come down in 2009. If we look at the level of approved investments that we have done already during 2008, that normally then is executed with a certain time lag, we are seeing close to a reduction to half of the level that we saw a year ago, in terms of approved investments.</p>
          <p>Now, if that will exactly lead to that tangible fixed investments will be halved from this layer, it's far too early to say, but that's one of the indications that we have that is behind the comment that Gunnar made. So we know that there is nothing in the pipeline that has already been sort of &#x2013; how should I say &#x2013; been approved and will lead to investments in 2009. There is a maintenance type of CapEx level for next year, and that will of course continue, but it's substantially below the levels we have seen in 2008.</p>
