      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everyone, to both the people that are assembled in the room here and for those that are on the phone. For those that have made the trek to Norwest, thank you very much for doing so. We're glad to have your company this morning for the release of the Final Profit and Dividend Announcement for the Financial Year 2011-2012.</p>
          <p>Joining me today are a number of the executive of the Woolworths Group. I'll just take a moment to introduce those: Tom Pockett, our CFO; I think everyone knows Tjeerd Jegen, our Managing Director of our Supermarkets Division; Julie Coates, Director of BIG W; Director of Liquor, Brad Banducci. Where are you, Brad? Over the back. We've also got Melinda Smith, who's the Director of Masters; Steve Greentree, COO of Supermarkets; and Dave Chambers who is the Managing Director of our Progressive Enterprises business in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>So before I go into the results, I just wanted to make some introductory comments about the year that was. And first to say that despite a pretty tough retail environment and pretty tough retail conditions in &#x2013; and certainly toughest that I've seen in many years, I'm really satisfied with what the team have delivered, both in great value to our customers who've enjoyed the lower prices and also solid profit growth for our shareholders as a result of this year's result. The underlying result lands well within our guidance, I'm pleased to say, and also take the opportunity to again commend the Woolies team for landing that result.</p>
          <p>We set out what we were going to do, and I'm proud to say that we've again delivered against that. That's what Woolies does. When we look at these results, I'm really pleased that we've delivered a 5.6% EBIT improvement from continuing operations before we take into account the investment we've made this year in the home improvement business</p>
          <p>Woolworths is a resilient business and we have at our core some fundamental elements that help us trade through all of the cycles that come our way. A strong core business in food and liquor is critical to that, a cost focused DNA throughout the company and a very strong customer focus, all part of what makes Woolworths a resilient business.</p>
          <p>Building on this base will be the benefits stemming from the strategic initiatives, and I'll touch on those in a little while. Of course, today's results are also unique inasmuch as they include the distortion of a provision made for the Dick Smith divestment that we announced in January. As a result, we're reporting a decline in total net profit after tax for the group of 14.5%.</p>
          <p>Today, we're also announcing that we'll increase the provision for Dick Smith to A$420 million. We believe that it's a prudent measure and it will allow us to drive the restructure and separation program ahead of an exit.</p>
          <p>Effectively, this writes down the Dick Smith business to zero and it sensibly positions the business for the &#x2013; whatever the outcome from the sale process. Back in January, I made the point the Dick Smith business was a small one and non-core moving forward. And that's part and parcel of the decision that we made to divest that business.</p>
          <p>So now to the financial year, and firstly to the results, if I can just flick forward to that and call out a couple of the numbers that you see on page three of the pack. Firstly, our sales for the group, A$55.1 billion for continuing operations, which was 4.8% up on last year.</p>
          <p>I also want to call out the EBIT from continuing operations before the home improvement investment, which was 5.6%, a very strong trading result for our business. Our net profit after tax for continuing operations was A$2.183 billion, an increase of 3.6% on the previous year. And as I mentioned before, when you take into account the provision for our consumer electronics business, our net profit after tax for the financial year 2012 is A$1.816 billion, a decrease of 14.5%.</p>
          <p>So we started &#x2013; I started in this job 11 months ago and 10 months ago I set out the strategic priorities for the group. And I want to start on those because that's actually what's driving this business, that's what's driving our business and the priorities that we have. And the first priority we set out was to extend our leadership in food and liquor. And we called out that we needed to make improvements in our marketing. We needed to unlock further growth from this business. And we needed to accelerate the opportunity that was there for us in fresh food.</p>
          <p>Liquor has been a good business for us, but there's lots of upside still left in that business, and extending our leadership there was part of what we set out to do. And the New Zealand business has been a bit of a star for us in recent times, but it's just the beginning of the momentum that we expect to recoup, courtesy of the investment that we've made in that country.</p>
          <p>The second priority was to act on our portfolio to maximize shareholder value and revisit the way we participated in the consumer electronics business was a key part of that, and obviously today's result reflects our progress on that. Also, to accelerate the alignment of our BIG W business to the new era of the customer and also to continue to put into place measures that ensure that we are the most responsible operator of local pubs in Australia.</p>
          <p>The third priority is around maintaining our track record of building new growth businesses, and Masters is a good example of that as is our ambitions and our progress that I'd point to in relation to our multi-option business.</p>
          <p>The last one is about the enablers that deliver or allow us to deliver on those things. And there's been a real step change again this year, a continuation of our productivity improvements in the supply chain space. Customer data has really come of age after us having it for a period of time. We're now using it and getting value from it.</p>
          <p>And the investment in our business that we see through space growth and the most important investment of all, which has been the combination of new talent into our business with the established retail smarts that exist here in Woolworths to build what I think is a world class retail team.</p>
          <p>So there are the four priorities that were set out. And I just want to touch very quickly on progress made against those. In relation to our Food and Liquor business, the greatest indicator of our progress there is market share and we've increased our market share over the course of this year, which is a very strong signal.</p>
          <p>Towards the end of the financial year, we launched the Australia's Fresh Food People marketing program to firmly establish us as the fresh food leader in the marketplace. And also building for growth, 38 new stores this year, I think we've conveyed that pretty clearly. It's a record year for our space growth.</p>
          <p>Strong performance in liquor. I'm pleased to say they've continued to build on the strong position that they've had in the marketplace. Dan Murphy's has grown by another 20 stores and was awarded this year's BRW Retailer of the Year, not just liquor retailer, retailer of the year full stop. So a good outcome for that business and point it to the future. In growing our New Zealand market share, Dave will talk about his market share improvements there when he gets up a little later, but very solid progress there.</p>
          <p>In relation to acting on what we said we'd do on our portfolio of businesses, we've been working hard at evolving our BIG W business. I'd say that we're at the beginning of that process, encouraging results, but much more to do to ensure that that business is both relevant and growing in the future, but a good year, particularly a good second half for that business.</p>
          <p>We're working also hard in our hotels business to meet our objective of being the most responsible operator of hotels, and pleasingly was awarded the Socially Responsible Operator of the Year at the International Gaming Awards held in January of this year. I think it goes some ways to show what we're doing in that space to deliver on our ambition. And I've covered the exit from the consumer electronics business &#x2013; that is the Dick Smith business. We'll obviously stay in the consumer electronics business through our BIG W business and online.</p>
          <p>Maintaining our track record of building new growth businesses is part and parcel of what's driving the new growth that we're searching for in this business. Lots of innovation this year, which is particularly pleasing and particularly around the multi-option space. The launch of our mobile app and the fact that 2.3 million people have thought enough of it to download it. And while we're talking about awards, the Supermarket business here in Australia was awarded the Best Multi-Channel Retailer of the Year. And happy to say that also in New Zealand, the same award was bestowed upon the Progressive business, the Countdown business there as well. I'm really happy with the strides we're making in the online business that will deliver us as a true multi-option leader in the future.</p>
          <p>Further to that, we're growing a business, Masters, and we've said all along that it's going to be a multi-option business from birth, which means that we will have a transactional website from the very early days. We've got that up and running and more products will be added to it, but good and early success for that.</p>
          <p>To point to the sales, we've got 48% increase in our online sales when you take out Cellarmasters. And our ambition is to improve on that number in the years ahead. Masters is the largest, probably most visible, of our growth initiatives at the moment and that business case is well on track, and I'll give you some more detail this morning on that. And we continue to make prudent and acquisitions, 39 in our hotel business if you count in the Laundy hotels that we're taking onboard right as we speak. We've got a lot to do in the multi-option space and there's a lot to look forward to.</p>
          <p>The last one is to put in place the enablers that are going to deliver this. And the best examples of that, over the course of the last year, have been the Hoxton Park warehouse, the Tasmanian warehouse and the New Zealand warehouse that have given us the final pieces in our supply chain strategy that will set us up for productivity improvements for many years to come. Complementing that has been the installation of the next generation replenishment software and the rollout of that through Penny and Craig and their team is almost complete and getting some great benefits from that and will do over the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Cost savings, particularly around global sourcing and particularly around above store costs have been a feature of this year. But really, quantum is about not just cost of doing business; it's about cost of goods sold as well. You've heard me say many times that our biggest cost is what we pay for the products that we then sell and that's where our biggest opportunities are. So shrinkage and margin improvement courtesy of buying better and buying direct are helping our margin and will do in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Unlocking customer data I've touched on. One of the real material outcomes of having that customer data was the creation this year of our Category Lab. Category Lab is where all of our categories are sent to be improved, not just the data itself but also the education of our team members in how they get the best use out of that data, and we've made good improvements on that over the course of the last 12 months. And the best people is, as I said before, the biggest enabler of all.</p>
          <p>What we've got happening here at Woolies is the beginning of a transformational plan. The reason for standing up at the beginning of November last year and talking about it was to signal the fact that we were going to change this business. And when I look inside the Woolworths business, I see probably more change than we've undertaken at any time in the past and I would include in that Refresh and Mercury.</p>
          <p>We've got a lot going on and, whilst we've been doing that, we're continuing to deliver results. And I think that's full credit to the Woolworths team. We're changing this business because we need to. We delivered this year on what we set out to do this year in terms of both the changes and the delivery of the financial result. And for that, I'm proud of the team and pleased with our progress to-date but much more to come.</p>
          <p>Now, to get  into some of the detail of each of the trading divisions, which I know you want to, I'd like to invite to stage our Managing Director of Supermarkets, Tjeerd Jegen, to take you through that. Thank you, Tjeerd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Grant, and good morning. I would like to give you a very brief summary of results, just touch upon some highlights but much more importantly, I would like to take you through the progress we're making on implementing our new strategy.</p>
          <p>So I'll first start with the numbers, overall sales combining petrol, food and liquor, up 4.9%, and EBIT growth of 5.3%. If you strip out the petrol sales growth, it's about 3.8% sales growth and 5.2% EBIT growth. So good shape of sales versus EBIT.</p>
          <p>If I then go into more detail in the comp sales number, overall for the year, 1.1% comp sales. But it's really a story of quarters. Quarter three, flat sales, mainly driven by deflation. Quarter four, quite a recovery of 1.3%. And if you look at the quarter four trading pattern, it's really the end of quarter four where we saw the biggest momentum and it's good sign that the momentum has kept on going in a new financial year.</p>
          <p>There's never been a better moment to be a value customer in Australia because we have decreased the prices in the mix by more than 4%. And even with reducing prices, we've been able to grow dollar sales so our units, especially in fresh foods, have risen significantly. But also our customer transactions have risen sharply.</p>
          <p>We're serving 600,000 customers a week more than we're doing a year ago. We've served 30 million customers this year versus a year ago. So customers appreciate the value we're giving them and they're buying significantly more volume than they've ever done.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin grew with about nine basis points, which is a net growth. The majority of the gross margin initiatives have been given back to our customers with lower prices and we have been mainly able to do so because of an initiative in shrinkage, but also by a better mix of our own brands and efficiencies in buying overseas, especially in Hong Kong, for our general merchandise.</p>
          <p>Our CODB rate went up a bit in terms of basis points but corrected for the Cellarmasters acquisition, it's only up three basis points mainly by the deflation and mainly by a higher inflation in other cost lines. But if you look at the core cost drivers, store wages was very well controlled and on the same level and rate as the previous year.</p>
          <p>And then last but not least, return on funds employed, if you strip out Cellarmasters acquisition, we returned more on our assets than we did last year. It's a very brief summary of the year, but it's much more important to look forward. And I would like to look forward with the help of our vision for Supermarkets, which we have launched in November last year in this room.</p>
          <p>And we've launched a strategy based on four pillars. And the first pillar is regaining our fresh food leadership, being the first in fresh foods. That's our heritage because we are Australia's Fresh Food people. And the second one is providing our customers unbeatable value and more than 4% reduction in prices, I think, is testament to that.</p>
          <p>But growing our sales is not enough with just fresh foods and just great value. We also continue to focus on new offers and tailoring our shop for our customers, so they can shop whenever and however they would like to shop. And I will give you an update on all four pillars today, but I also will touch upon two core values. One is being customer led and one is working as one team. And I will start with one team because in the end, it's about our people who make a change. And it's about the word people in Australia as Fresh Food people which is our core point of difference.</p>
          <p>And I'll start with the first, a year ago in the Supermarkets management team, we had one nationality. Today, we've got four. I've got a South African General Manager of Human Resource. We got an English General Manager of Long Life Grocery and Dutch, and I've got a big group of true blue Aussies in my team. I think it's a good example of how Woolies have changed and how we've blended international with local talent.</p>
          <p>But it's not just the top team where we've invested. We've also invested in training and development for all of our staff, close to 50,000 staff in our stores have received the customer service training. 15,000 have received special skill training like bakery, meats and seafoods.</p>
          <p>And one of the most frequent heard complaints of our store managers was they don't have enough time to spend time with their staff and customers on the shop floor. So we decided to give them an iPad, which is nothing unusual these days. But the unusual bit for us is we decided eight weeks from inception to actually giving out the iPads, and in those eight weeks we migrated most of our core systems in an app version on the iPad. And we believe about eight hours a week our store managers will now be able to spend on the shop floor more than they could do in the past, looking after the real important people in the business, their staff and their customers.</p>
          <p>We also launched a new program for talent. We were quite conservative with the way we've brought talent through the business. We let them work several years in several roles and that's the way they could progress. But with really great talent, that's too long. So we've got a special Fastrack program for top talent so they can quicker through the ranks and get more responsibility early on in their career, which is great for them and great for us.</p>
          <p>Staff engagement continues to increase and good indicators are very low levels of absenteeism and is on the decline, but also our staff turnover is going down, which is a good indicator for engagement. And not just diversity in terms of nationalities but also we've got the majority of our staff being female and increasing number of our executives being female and we would like to grow that number even beyond the 29%. That's the news on people.</p>
          <p>So let's move on to the four pillars, and let's move to the first one, which is first choice for fresh foods. And this is a real person. This is Janet. She's our Meat Manager in our Gordon store. But  Janet was also in our TV commercial because that's who we are. We are real people, serving real customers, not celebrity chefs. And Australia's special people is the essence of who we are. We did a lot of customer research and many of our customers didn't know that 100% of their meat we sell to them is Aussie grown.</p>
          <p>They didn't know 96% of the fruit and vegetables is from here and the 4% is just because you can't grow cherries all year round. You can't have avocados all year round, and probably the best kiwi fruit is from New Zealand. It's only 4%, 96% Australian, our customers didn't know. And whenever I was sitting in the focus group and I ask them the same questions, they would give me numbers like 60%, and the rest is Chinese import. So we thought it was really, really important to make sure they understood who we are and they understood where the products came from. They also didn't know that there were actually real bakers in our store, real butchers.</p>
          <p>So that's why our campaign is about real people delivering great fresh food every single day like the song to the whole of Australia, with real Woolies people in center stage. We've got nine real people in our ads and no actors. That's the start of the campaign and, as Grant O'Brien said, launched during the final of The Voice, 4.5 million watched the show, the number one show of the year in Australia and a full integration with our song, which was beautifully sung by Emma Birdsall.</p>
          <p>If you look at the online space, 200,000 YouTube viewerships on the ads and thousands of people have downloaded the song. So a great start, but this is just a start. This is just the start of a journey. And we've already told you the first leg is quality, the second leg is value, and that's why we launched this week a 30% reduction in lamb prices. Monday we launched that. And so far, one weekend, we've seen a very strong double-digit sales growth and volume growth in the lamb category. So customers really, really give us credit for the fact that we make great Aussie lamb even more affordable. That's the campaign and it's just the start of it, start of a journey.</p>
          <p>So what did we do more in fresh food this year? We've really focused on improving the quality of our fresh foods and we're so confident about the quality of our fresh foods that we not just replace the products, but we also refund the products, if you're not happy with it. So we deliver a Fresh or Free Guarantee and that has helped us, together with all the other initiatives, to really drive our market share in fresh food ahead of anybody in the Australian market on most categories. And that's our core. Fresh food is our core. We grow our business by fresh foods, that brings frequency, loyalty and advocacy. That's our core business.</p>
          <p>But we also improved quite a bit our store concepts. Some of you have seen our Eastgardens store and many of the concept in Eastgardens is now being implemented in all stores, new stores and refurbished stores all across the country. Sushi kiosks, meat serveries, cutting stations, fruit and vegetables, new ways of merchandising fish, bag and bake Fish, all of that is now being rolled out all across the country.</p>
          <p>And our core focus for the year has been meat. We were the first national supermarket chain to launch beef, always juicy, always tender. And later, lamb, double-digit sales growth in those lines and great market share growth. So, good progress in fresh food but much more to come.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about value. November last year we already spoke about value and we said value has got three components. First of all, the price you pay every single day for the product, and we've more or less reduced the price by 4.5% versus a year ago. And according to our tracking on 10,000 products every week, we're currently 2% cheaper than Coles. The second one is promotion specials and I'll talk a bit more about specials. And the third one is own brands. Those are the three pillars of value.</p>
          <p>I already touched upon the 4% reduction of prices overall. I'll move to Extra Special, Extra Simple. We launched that as an additional benefit for our customers, something we've already done many years in New Zealand and we brought it to Australia. A clear benefit, if you've got an EDR card, you swipe it, no need to count to five and you get 20% discount on the products you buy most. After three months, 4.2 unique customers have bought one or more products of Extra Specials, which is 80% of our total customer base. Pretty good penetration and it's really helped us delivering more value for customers.</p>
          <p>And as I spoke before, we are able to reduce prices, we are able to offer better value because we really use the money we save on our shrinkage, the money we save by buying more efficiently, the money we save by buying in other parts of the world where it's cheaper to source by giving a majority back to our customers.</p>
          <p>And let's talk about customers. One of the things I'm personally very passionate about is being customer-led. And the biggest transformation has been the Category Labs. A$16 billion of sales has been undergoing a deep dive in our Category Labs. 60% of our buyers has undergone training in the Category Lab. And it's given us remarkable insights and I'll touch upon a few to make it more concrete what the Cat Lab actually delivers for our company.</p>
          <p>We started looking at the stationery category, and we found out that actually beyond six bays, so six meters of space for stationery, there's no incremental sales. But guess what? We had 550 stores where we had more than six bays. So in those 550 stores, we took out the stationery range, we put in an ink cartridges range and peripheral stationery and we generated in the first year 25 million additional sales, just by focusing more in space efficiency.</p>
          <p>We were also able to understand loyalty and substitution on a product level. We did a battery category and battery is a category where you've got many brands, where there's a lot of confusion with customers because you've got AA, AAA, C, D, Energizer, Duracell, Eveready, very complicated. And we found that there was no loyalty and very high substitution between the brands in batteries. So we will make shopping much easier for our customers and we will benefit and the remaining brand will also benefit.</p>
          <p>We also found out that if you look at penetration numbers, we had very low penetration in our promotions on prop breads. We underindexed in single and double households, two-person households with the purchase of prop breads, proprietary breads, in our stores. And we found out that most of our promotional mechanisms were two for A$6. So we now implemented a strategy where we always have one for A$3, two for five, and our sales went up 50% because we actually target performance by customer group.</p>
          <p>And the last example is one which is an interesting one. You've got some very small products, like a product called DampRid which is a humidity heater or humidity remover out of your closet or wardrobe. Normally, the product doesn't really sell across the country, so one phasing. But in 22 coastal towns, we're selling 80 pieces a week per store.</p>
          <p>So we're now able to really tailor those stores, put more range and more space. And fish oil vitamins, 3% of stores or 12% of sales mainly Asian stores. So we're putting a much bigger range of Asian vitamins in those stores. And that's the insight we get from the Cat Lab, and that's really helping us make better decisions for customers. We've done 95 customer talkback sessions and we also added now a staff talkback so also our staff gives feedback. And that's the priority of the things we do for our customers and our staff.</p>
          <p>Great new offers. I think we're most proud of the performance of Macro, 92% produced in Australia and in own brands, which really covers the customer needs the brands don't cover. It's organic, it's free range, it's natural, it's good for you and it's the fastest growing product in our range. Select supporting as well, growing by 20% and we would like to grow both of these brands significantly more in the future.</p>
          <p>We've also made good progress in making cooking easier and healthier by introducing Ready to Stir Fry, Ready to Roast, Ready to Steam and Ready to Bake vegetable components. But if you look at own brands, only 6% of SKUs are in own brands and only 11% of sales. So we've got a long way to go to make sure that we are hitting a much more advanced level of own brand penetration based on customer preferences not because we want to push own brands, because our customers asked for it.</p>
          <p>We continue to tailor our ranges, and I spoke about the vitamins, but we also introduced new ethnic ranges and we've got 10 stores where an expert chef is making sushi every single day. Our online experience continues to strengthen. We've got 1.8 million downloads on our app. It's fully transactional. And when we launched our transactional app, we also set up a virtual store in Sydney and Melbourne. And for those two stores, we got an award last year but we don't sit still.</p>
          <p>We also introduced an iPad app, which takes all the functionality of the mobile phone app. But added to this is a fully iPad customized Fresh Magazine. So if you like a recipe in the Fresh Magazine, you can now put it in your table in your kitchen top and you get a video how to cook, your ingredient list. You can download it to your shopping list, you can push a button and it's delivered to your doorstep or you can pick it up, click then collect, in 93 stores all across Australia. That's in a nutshell the updates on our strategy. Good progress but much more to come.</p>
          <p>But what will be a supermarket offer in Australia without a petrol offer. Petrol for us is a way to say thank you to our customers by giving them a $0.04 discount whenever they shop with us. We've been able to grow our sales quite significantly, admittedly still helped by higher fuel prices. But total volume is up. Comp volume has slightly declined. It was mainly because of a conversion from petrol to diesel, so much more fuel efficient cars. And customers are really, really focusing on managing their budget every single week. But 18 new communities are enjoying the benefit of great fuel with a great discount. And this weekend, if you shop for A$50, you get 10% fuel all across the nation.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much. I would like to hand over to Brad Banducci. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. My name is Brad Banducci. I'm the Director of Liquor for Woolworths. For those of you whom I haven't met yet, I joined Woolworths last May as part of the Cellarmasters acquisition. So it's my first time to be talking to you, so delighted to be here. Also delighted by the weather outside, which is warm. And we're all hoping for a great warm summer for beer sales.</p>
          <p>Let me just start by going through the financial highlights. It was a good year for the Woolworths Liquor Group, as Grant has alluded to earlier. We had sales of A$6.6 billion, up 11.9% on last year. That A$6.6 billion, just to be clear with everyone, includes sales from our traditional retail channels, Dan Murphy's, BWS, Woolworths Liquor. It also includes for a full year the Cellarmasters direct sales and the bar sales that go through ALH.</p>
          <p>So it was a good year in terms of revenue growth. Even more pleasing, profit growth grew faster than revenue. In terms of what drove that growth, it really was materially on the back of the continued rollout of Dan Murphy's, we rolled out another 20 Dan Murphy's in FY 2012. In fact, we rolled out another two in the last two weeks, so we're at 162 now, we started at 120 just over 12 months ago. So good continued momentum in Dan's, and we've seen sales growing in line with that.</p>
          <p>As importantly, by the way, we've continued to develop our convenience business which had a good year in complementing in Dan's. We opened 46 BWS's last year but also closed 23. And I think that's a good thing. We've got to continue to focus in convenience in particular on trimming the tail, so we had net growth of 23 stores. Woolworth Supermarket liquor stores, we grew by 23 and closed three, so a net 20.</p>
          <p>So good growth on the back of continued store rollout, mainly in Dan's but with support from BWS and Woolworths Liquor. I should also add that five of the BWS stores we closed was related to a transfer of liquor license from BWS to Dan Murphy's and that is an important part of our strategy how we optimize the overall network and how we best use our liquor licenses.</p>
          <p>Those are the financial highlights. Let me turn to some of the other highlights, if I may, for the year. We have continued, as Grant again mentioned earlier, to sustain our leadership in multi-option retailing by, best I can tell from the numbers, more than 50% of all online traffic in Australia comes to one of our liquor sites. An important part of that is Cellarmasters, the integration of which now is complete and it's fully integrated into the Liquor group. But it's also been a great first year for Dan's to be transactional all year. And Dan Murphy's is the only full-breadth transactional liquor website in Australia that sells beer, wine and spirits, which I think makes it unusual.</p>
          <p>I just wanted to dwell for a moment on the chart that we've put up there, just to try and explain how we see our different brands working together in this new world of multi-channel. Just on the X-axis, we've got bricks and mortar and direct and online and then the Y-axis really is the target customer that we're talking to. And what you see is that BWS and Woolworths Liquor, our convenience offer, is really in the short term still going to continue to be a bricks and mortar strategy about driving people into convenience and the issue and opportunity for us is being much more tailored in terms of catering to what kind of convenience opportunity presents itself. They're quite different with the drive-through versus the high street versus a mall-based opportunity.</p>
          <p>The way we'll be using digital for BWS is to drive traffic into the store or improve in ordering, an ease of ordering, sort of a click-click type opportunity. Dan Murphy's, which sits in the middle of that chart, really is quite broad in terms of how we can stretch what clearly is a material bricks and mortar business, but already today has a very strong and incredibly high growth online business and really caters to all three customer segments.</p>
          <p>And then further to the left, we've got our focused direct or multi-option online plays, which &#x2013; our WineMarket, which is just a real value trading offer which competes with some of the other, in fact, the prevalent model of selling wine online right now, which is high discount, which is WineMarket. We've got Cellarmasters really catering to the middle of the market. And then the business which is quite small for us but actually has had the highest growth for us this year, which is Langtons, which is at the premium space. And we've really taken Langtons from just being an auction business and added on to that brokerage component and email and also increasingly working with the key wineries in Australia to assist in selling to their customers. So, 30% plus growth, small but important in how we cover the market. So that's how our brands fit into the world of multi-option and it was a good year for us in that space, but obviously, we have high expectations going forward.</p>
          <p>The other thing worth referencing is that we've worked very hard this year to consolidate our own brand manufacturing around the manufacturing assets acquired by Cellarmasters. There's a winemaking capability in the form of Dorrien Winemaking and a bottling and packaging capability in the form of Vinpac.</p>
          <p>As at the end of the year, within only 13 months, Dorrien now manages all of the wine flows for the group. That does not mean it produces the wine, but it gives a quality assurance process across every wine that's made, ensure it's made to the right quality and cost specification. We've got 12 winemakers on staff. We appointed a new chief winemaker this year, Corey Ryan. He comes to us from McWilliams, previously with Villa Maria and Henschke, and we're very happy with the team and what they're doing.</p>
          <p>And our strike rate in terms of medals for wine shows, for wines we've entered under our own brands was 51% for the year, which is in line with any other notable wine company benchmarks. So a good year in consolidating our wine plays and making sure we've got the quality we want behind that. We've also done the same with our packaging and bottling. Vinpac today, excluding our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:54) program, manages all our bottling and packaging for the group.</p>
          <p>So we really feel we've got &#x2013; we've leveraged the assets acquired and got the synergies that we wanted to out of them. We've also continued selectively to launch some of our own brands into the marketplace. And I emphasize the word brands, some of the major brands we've launched really were ones that existed and had a long pedigree inside Cellarmasters, know most notably Stonyfell. Most of you may remember Stonyfell Metala, a very famous brand; and the Bin 62 from Langhorne Creek, the first winner of the Jimmy Watson; Krondorf, a brand made famous by Grant Burge in the 1970s, but actually quite an historical brand; Cat Amongst the Pigeons, which is a personal favorite. And we've also continued outside of wine to look at beer and we've launched Tun Beer. Those are just some of the brands we've launched in the last few months.</p>
          <p>The other highlight for us is liquor retailing is really all about sales. It's a selling business more than a service business, selling and service obviously do go together. But if you tell people stories about brands, there's no doubt you can get upsell and we are incredibly committed to upgrading the product knowledge and service capabilities of our in-store team, both inside BWS and Dan Murphy's. And we've put a lot more effort into doing that and have some really good momentum there and look forward to sustain it in the next year.</p>
          <p>So that's the Liquor group. Grant, did you want me to quickly touch on ALH? I'm cognizant that Bruce Mathieson, Jr. &#x2013; where are you, Bruce? Somewhere &#x2013; he's over there, he's in the back. So any tricky questions, please send them to Bruce. I think Grant has already again talked about hotels. The revenue you see here is the revenue from the hotel, not from the retail, which often goes alongside ALH. We're partners really in how we approach retail with our ALH colleagues.</p>
          <p>Sales were up 4.4%, as you can see, and EBITDA was up slightly higher. This was on the back of continued growth in a number of venues, the Compass acquisition in January, February. And then most recently, the Laundy, Waugh and DeAngelis acquisitions, which are still underway, and I think the next store we get into the group is Caringbah on the third of September. So good underlying our hotel growth, which has ancillary benefits back to retail, quite clearly in terms of those stores give us ability to launch new Dan Murphy's or BWS's.</p>
          <p>The other two points I think worth mentioning is that particular area of growth was in food and sort of the value families-orientated meals that the group are launching, which has gone very well for the year and explains a slight drop-off in gross margins as we've invested in growing that part of the business. And the fact that Bruce tells me we are the biggest booker of entertainment in Australia today and, again, another high-growth portion of the business, driving live music and other forms of entertainment back into local pubs and using that to drive traffic.</p>
          <p>The last point worth emphasizing is the continued investment, again which Grant has referenced, in us being the most responsible service and our commitment to the driving industry and setting standards in that area.</p>
          <p>That's it from me. Thank you, everyone. I'm now going to turn over to Dave Chambers to talk about New Zealand's Supermarkets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. Well, more of us would say it's afternoon anyway. I think it's afternoon in New Zealand. Really pleased with the numbers, so I'll go straight to those.</p>
          <p>Sales were up 3%, which was good in a very difficult trading environment. The trading EBIT up 15.9% was a terrific result and really, really pleased to be able to deliver that. We delivered that by getting growth in our market share both in dollars and units, so it didn't just come from one or the other. We grew our customer numbers, our basket size and also the number of items sold altogether. So it was a real clean sweep right across the board.</p>
          <p>Food inflation continues to be low at only 1.1%, that was down from the prior year and continues to be low. And in fact in some key categories that we have driven by our friends at Frontera, there is quite some deflation going on in dairy categories, milk, butter and cheese in particular.</p>
          <p>Our GP improved quite dramatically, up 63 basis points. We have made quite an investment in our logistics and our supply chain, so you'd expect to see an increase in GP and we're really pleased to deliver that. That was one of the issues. We converted nearly 1,400 SKUs from direct-to-store delivery to DC-delivery. But we also had a real focus on shrinkage in conjunction what Tjeerd was talking about earlier. We've picked up on the learnings that Australia have had, applied those to New Zealand and into our own marketplace.</p>
          <p>So our shrinkage was down dramatically and our merchandising range reviews, whilst not utilizing the Category Lab to-date, we have been doing similar merchandise reviews, changing our merchandise and really working hard on our mix. And that was the other key item in driving our gross margin improvement.</p>
          <p>CODB I think was an excellent result. Dollars did go up, which you'd expect. We handled a lot more merchandise through our supply chain, and through the year. Coca-Cola ended up in our warehouse, which in New Zealand hadn't been the case. So we've only had Coke in our warehouse since October of last year. That did drive a $1 increase through our logistics, but obviously, as we look at the GP, we're more than offset that dollar increase through the GP benefits.</p>
          <p>Insurance costs went up in New Zealand, no surprise to anybody. I think insurance costs in New Zealand following the Christchurch earthquakes have risen and that's a marketplace effect, but we had that. We didn't sit back though and say, we got these cost increases, we're just going to have to wear those. We said what are we going to do about it? And we worked really hard to mitigate those by working on our variable costs.</p>
          <p>A little story I'll share on our Christchurch warehouse that's recently opened. One of our engineering team, in fact, I think he is our engineering department and logistics, looked at it and looked at carbon footprint and has put together LED, light technology, WiFi technology, and sunlight sensors to actually develop a world first, where our lighting in the warehouse is variable from 0% to 100% of the LEDs. Not much perhaps on net, although in the early going, our lighting costs at Christchurch are down 88% on prior introduction of the system.</p>
          <p>So dramatic reduction in power usage in the warehouse and it's just one tangible example of what the team have been working through to work with other providers that are contractors in order to try and come up with new innovation to reduce cost rather than just accepting things that are coming through in the marketplace. So a really good set of numbers, very pleased with those.</p>
          <p>Countdown continuing to grow. Countdown is New Zealand's largest supermarket brand. And whilst we do have a competitor, they have a couple of brands. So we compete against the brands that they have as opposed to them as an entity, and Countdown is New Zealand's largest supermarket brand. We're really seen by our customers as a popular choice for the balanced customer, who is looking for value, of course, and value really, really important to the New Zealand customer. But also range and quality is a big thing. And with the private label programs that we have, it really helps deliver quality to the New Zealand customer.</p>
          <p>For second year running, Countdown has been voted New Zealand's Most Trusted Supermarket Brand. So I think its tangible example of the work that we've done to establish the Countdown brand in the minds of New Zealanders. And worthwhile mentioning that other retailers around the world and even perhaps here in Australia have tried to change brands without a lot of success. So this is a real tangible example of success for the work that we have done in establishing the Countdown brand and getting some recognition from our customers. We opened seven new stores during the year, and one earthquake damaged store at The Palms in Christchurch was reopened. We did close three stores, so that takes our network at the year end to 161.</p>
          <p>We're 73% of the way through our stores in terms of extension and refurbishment and they're in the New Zealand 2010-2015 format, based on the format that's here but tailored to our market and to our customers with a change in department size, a change of mix to really help drive our own business by picking up on the formats from 2010 and 2015.</p>
          <p>We're quite well through that program and that will continue, but perhaps not at as fast a pace as we've had in the past compared to perhaps to new store development. But we plan to open four new Countdown stores by Christmas this year.</p>
          <p>Multi-option. Multi-option continues to go great, 140,000 app downloads in New Zealand, perhaps not as many as Tjeerd's able to speak about. But there's not that many smartphones in New Zealand. So we're really pleased with the download and even more importantly that our customers are actually using it to buy items. So downloading it's fine. But they're actually buying items and we track every single week how many customers or how many new unique customers buy either from a smartphone or from an iPad application. We've got 117,000 fans on Facebook. It really gives us a good interaction and we have a Countdown on YouTube as well with recipes. So if you're in New Zealand, don't know what to cook, log on to Countdown on YouTube. We'll give you some tips. We'll sell you some stuff. We'll help you out.</p>
          <p>Our franchise network has also continued to grow and part of our strategy is actually to grow both Countdown as well as SuperValue and FreshChoice. FreshChoice is a small &#x2013; a local supermarket mainly in rural areas. But we're looking at infill in Auckland. And through the year, we now have only two FreshChoice stores in all of Auckland. Both of those opened in the last 12 months, both in a new format and been extremely well received by our customers and by the franchisees who are investing their money in this business with us.</p>
          <p>We also reopened a SuperValue in the Edgeware Village in Christchurch that had been shut since February of last year, also in a new format for that business. SuperValue is a small convenience store, anywhere from 100 square meters, 150 square meters up to maybe 700 square meters or 800 square meters. All three stores trading extremely well and our franchisees are really encouraged by what we've achieved and really looking to reinvest in their businesses, which will give us further growth in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Our market share, as I said, to grow both in dollars and units, which we're really pleased about and our supply chain is almost complete. At the beginning of the year, we opened our national DC in Auckland and Wiri, which was our Woolies New Zealand warehouse completely refurbished and extended, going really well for us. And at the end of the year, we did have two smaller warehouses in Christchurch. We extended one of them and that opened right at the end of the year, really giving us an opportunity to target direct imports into New Zealand, pick up on the programs that are operating here in Australia with both Supermarkets and BIG W and really provide better service to our customers and be able to bring unique ranges to help Countdown stand out.</p>
          <p>And over to Julie Coates from BIG W. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I'm really pleased to be able to announce a positive result for BIG W both in terms of sales and profit for the year. In the second half, we saw positive comp sales and profit so that EBIT increased by 13% for the half, which meant, as I said, that we improved on the full year. We served more customers and sold more items in FY 2012 which reflected our strong brand position. And our gross margin increased by 109 basis points, which reflect the benefits of our stronger inventory management in markdowns, improvement in our global sourcing and improved buying. Our costs for like stores were flat and costs that we did incur were in the opening of the new DC, seven new stores and the investment in our multi-option platform.</p>
          <p>At BIG W, we're building momentum on the things that I outlined for you in November of last year and updated you on in February. At BIG W, we offer the lowest prices on the widest range of branded and quality product every day. And we do that so that our customers win on value every day. Last month, we launched our new brand campaign, Everyone's a Winner with Australia's lowest prices, Cha-Ching! Our focus on price, brand, quality and range actually provides us with a very unique proposition for our customers. It's a point of differentiation. Our power key value program has seen a very positive response with double-digit unit growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>Our womenswear Emerson brand offers great quality at a great price and it's exceeded our expectations since we launched that last year. And yes, I am wearing it today including the shoes. The shoes are killers, girls, fantastic.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, we launched our exclusive Guy Leech fitness and Michelle Bridges One Active brands. The success yesterday was fantastic, and we're looking forward to a fantastic season and ongoing in our business. We will continue to grow our store footprint and, as Grant said, we opened seven new stores during the year including our latest format store, for those of you that haven't seen it, at Canberra Airport and also in a little place called Mount Gambier in South Australia.</p>
          <p>We've got a strong property pipeline that supports growth to our 200 stores and we continue to lead in multi-option. We launched first fully transactional iPhone app to coincide with the BIG W Toy Sale event in our sector. It was the first app that worldwide you could order online but actually lay-by. We've had over 400,000 downloads of this app.</p>
          <p>This launch was supported by interactive brochures and virtual stores across Sydney and Melbourne, and that meant our customers could shop anywhere, any time. Our online sales were up 76% for the year, with our continued range expansion and we continue to engage in social media and digital marketing with our customers.</p>
          <p>We will reap the benefits of our supply chain overhaul, the third DC you've all seen, and we've disclosed in this announcement transition cost of A$6.4 million, which were both better than budget &#x2013; which was better than budget and better than what we expected.</p>
          <p>Our investment in our store footprint, multi-option, and supply chain are important foundations for our future. And in that context, the result for FY 2012 was a really good result. We had positive sales and positive profit, and we saw an improvement as we went through the year so that as we head into this year, we've got some really good momentum.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand it to Grant.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thanks Julie. Well done. I'm just going to touch briefly on Masters and Dick Smith, and then hand to Tom for financials.</p>
          <p>The comment on the Home Improvement business, it was the first of September last year when we launched our first Masters store. So it's still to be yet a year that we've had Masters stores trading. And today or yesterday, more accurately, we opened our 20 store in Carrum Downs in Victoria, so inside 12 months, 20 stores. Our ambition was to have 15 stores in the first 12 months. We've exceeded that with still some time to go. I'm not sure that we're going to able to fit in 21 or 22 but a good progress nonetheless.</p>
          <p>We've got a very strong pipeline that fits our ambition of having 100 stores trading within the five-year period and we've got 12 stores that are currently under construction. And we're fitting five out at the moment ready to start trading in the next little while.</p>
          <p>As I said at the beginning, what was important and has been important since day one of devising this new business was that it would be our first born multi-channel business or multi-option business, and the launch of the transactional site by the team was a tremendous accomplishment given that they were also in the process of launching these stores.</p>
          <p>We've set our targets pretty high with the Masters business and we're well on track to meet that. I just wanted to answer some of the guesstimates that were going around in the marketplace as to where the business was at and where &#x2013; what store turnover was and those sort of things. In relation to store turnover, I've heard figures that our stores will do something between A$15 million and A$17 million. I can tell you that our targets are well in excess of that. Our targets are well north of A$20 million a year, and I can tell you that we're hitting our targets.</p>
          <p>So the stores that have been trading from the early days, so far some of those 20 stores are well north of A$20 million already, and we've not met our first anniversary yet. So we've still got the summer and spring seasons to come for our Masters business and that's the Christmas for the Home Improvement business, and that too will increase and improve, I think, our outlook for the stores in Masters.</p>
          <p>So, it's going well; it's hitting its targets. That's the situation that we're in with Home Improvement and there's much more to look forward to as we both roll out our store network around the country to meet that 100 store ambition, and as we roll out more and more stores and more and more products on our transactional site to make it a truly Australia's first multi-option Home Improvement business, plenty of upside there.</p>
          <p>Dick Smith is the next one that I wanted to talk about, and really just to mention the trading result, the trading result being the EBIT before the restructure provision is what I wanted to point to. The A$24.6 million EBIT number was almost a 12% increase in EBIT. And there is a provision that we've spoken about before that we've accounted for and provided for this year, but a strong trading result and wanted to pay particular credit to the Dick Smith team who've delivered that result in a pretty tough sector and a pretty tough environment as we undergo the divestment of the Dick Smith business.</p>
          <p>So the part of the morning that you've all been waiting for is the numbers, and I'll call on Tom Pockett to help us through those. Thanks, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thanks, Grant. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll go through this reasonably quickly because there's no real great surprises in the balance sheet and cash flow. So on the balance sheet, inventory increased about 8%. A lot of that was due to our investment in and building Masters as we stocked new stores and stocked the DC. When you take out the Masters inventory, we're up about 3.3% on a much higher sales growth. So that's not a bad outcome.</p>
          <p>Fixed assets were up about A$1.1 billion, really just relating to our CapEx offset by depreciation. Intangibles were up a bit because of some of the acquisitions we made and net repayable debt was up about A$300 million. Cash component of that was about A$200 million, which you'll see in a minute, and the rest was really the mark-to-market of hedge assets and liabilities.</p>
          <p>One thing you just need to be aware of, when you look at all the balance sheet numbers, when you're going through, we've reclassified Dick Smith as asset for sale. So it is going to distort all the components, and you just need to factor that in when you're looking at it.</p>
          <p>Average inventory days on &#x2013; for average, they were up &#x2013; they were 33.8, up from 31.4. There's quite a few things in there in terms of Masters and increased indent. On a closing inventory days basis, we actually had quite a good reduction in stock as we move towards the end of the year. We're only up 1.2 days and when you exclude the Masters increase are up 0.4 days, well, we're actually down 0.4 days. So it's sort of a good end of the year. We had high inventory levels during the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow, EBITDA was up about 3%, just over 3%. And cash from operating activities up from 1%. The main drag there is the net investment in inventory, as one would expect. Net interest paid is higher because of CapEx and the full impact to the share buyback we did in the prior year. Tax paid was up primarily due to timing of tax payments, and last year, I think you can remember, we got some real benefits from R&amp;D and investment allowance deductions in that particular year.</p>
          <p>In terms of total cash used, A$2.0 million compared to A$2.1 million last year. We bought about A$145 million of businesses compared to A$400 million last year, so we're down a bit on that. And the other key note is the proceeds from the sale &#x2013; disposal we sold, just under A$400 million mark last year but A$200 million this year. And as I've said before, we're still in the process of looking at all opportunities to move the assets off our balance sheet &#x2013; at the right price, of course.</p>
          <p>We used about A$200 million of cash for the period when you add it all up, and borrowed that amount. Our cash realization ratio was about 94% for the year and if you back out the Masters loss, we were over 100%, so that was the thing that pulled it down. In the last three years, we were about 100%, 101%, 97% and 100%, so we've been floating around that 100% mark, obviously, with the Masters investment that pulled it down.</p>
          <p>Shareholder payouts, pretty straightforward slide, strong payout history, A$11.9 billion since 2001. So good returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital management, the main focus this year has been a very successful debt refinancing program. These are just the key ones. A$1.2 billion syndicated revolving bank facilities, A$700 million in hybrid notes, A$500 million in medium term notes. There are now no maturities left to refinance. We've got a very well staggered maturity profile going forward. So that's a really good outcome; it's really the end of that whole refinancing program. We've go about A$3.4 billion in undrawn bank facilities. So that's all pretty good. There was no share buybacks this year and there won't be any in 2013.</p>
          <p>One thing I think we need to point out is over the last few years, just to remind everyone, we've really been using our strong balance sheet. And we are in a very fortuitous position with the Woolworths balance sheet and our ability to maintain our credit ratings during that period. So we've been utilizing it to build our business, build property development portfolio, invest in add-on type businesses, including Laundy and Cellarmasters and Compass, et cetera, plus invest in Masters.</p>
          <p>So obviously, the net cash can't go on forever and we probably expect that to continue next year, but then probably in the years following that, we'll see a return to overall net cash generation. I think that's just an important comment to make that that's how we see our position going forward.</p>
          <p>Fixed charge ratio is 2.9 now compared to 3 last year, so that's very similar. Our gearing is about the same and the credit ratings are the same. So we're pretty comfortable with where our balance sheet strength lies.</p>
          <p>Our return on funds employed, you can see that it's been impacted by two things during the year. One is the investment in Masters and the other is development. And we just show the impact of development on this slide so that you can see that when you take out the development component, it's pretty much consistent over the last three years. The issue with development is that there's a drain in our &#x2013; on our ROFE because we build assets prior to them earning income and, therefore, you've got the asset but you don't have the income. When you have a developer do it, of course, you just take the asset over and you'll get the lease expense and you get the operations from the stores straightaway.</p>
          <p>So on that note, I'll hand back to Grant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. So the remains from the formal part of the presentation today is the outlook, to give you our view on the financial year 2013 year. And just to recap on a couple of items that we've covered in the presentation so far, and that is that we've got a clear strategy and that it's gaining momentum. And some of the benefits that we've spoken about and spoke about indeed at the beginning of November are starting to come to fruition. But it's just the beginning, as Tjeerd rightly said this morning.</p>
          <p>What I think we can point to is whilst we're making that change, we're delivering results and that's a resilient business and that's what Woolworths is, able to adapt and to change as needed. Both the Australian and the New Zealand markets are difficult retail markets, and we don't see that that necessarily will change at all over the coming year and that consumer sentiment will remain dampened.</p>
          <p>In relation to major items in our business moving forward, we called out the Masters investment last year of A$100 million, and we're calling it out again this year for the coming year. It's A$80 million when you take into account the Danks profit that offsets the investment that we're making in the Masters business. The amount of this is obviously, as it was last year, subject to startup costs, the stores opening as per schedule, et cetera, so there's our guidance in relation to the cost for Masters and Home Improvement moving forward.</p>
          <p>So in relation to the financial year 2013, our net profit after tax from continuing operations is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 6%. And to be clear, that's on a normalized 52-week period, not a 53-week period as the year is next year. That's subject to the uncertainties that we've detailed and are looking forward to with some confidence our capacity to deliver again as we've done this year.</p>
          <p>So on that note, I'd open it up and ask for questions, and probably if we go for questions in the room here first.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, start at the front, work our way backwards. So <mark type="ph" /> David (1:06:20), you're in the front. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Grant. Or afternoon. Just a couple of questions, if I could maybe &#x2013; this question directed to Tjeerd, if I could open up, the second half EBIT growth for Supermarkets seemed to slow a bit, I think on my calculations it was 3.9% EBIT growth second half. And that would have had a contribution from Cellarmasters in it whereas it would have been very minute last year, and also there's consternation that last year was a flood affected EBIT growth. So I'm just &#x2013; if you could explain if you perceive that as a slowing and if so, why was it, was it because the first quarter or that it was pretty tough or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll &#x2013; if you want to build on it, Tjeerd, but the issue really for us, <mark type="ph" /> David (1:07:11), was the sales in the first quarter. And that's really the answer to the difference between the first half and second half. I think from a positive perspective, the Supermarket division had a much stronger fourth quarter and as we've suggested and hinted at here this morning, we've seen that continue. So &#x2013; but the difference is essentially the sales result. We did call out the profit result last time but the unders and overs more or less even themselves out and I'd bring it back to sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And this is probably more directed to Tom, there's a couple of financial issues, capitalized interest of A$90 million. My understanding with capitalized interest is that's got to be on developments underway. And when you look at, say, 6% that means that you've got about A$1.5 billion of current projects that are &#x2013; the dirt's turned and the bricks and mortar are going up. Is that about the right number, because that's a lot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It would be. So if you look at our store profile, we've &#x2013; in terms of &#x2013; just look at the CapEx investment over the last three years, it's really ramped up. And they all start at different times. And we're peaking at the moment, so we opened 39 stores this year. That include &#x2013; and then there is 40 Dan Murphy's &#x2013; well, 20 Dan Murphy's, I think it's 40-odd BWS's, so it's a real peak. Next year is about 35 Supermarkets, that's &#x2013; I think there's about four or five BIG Ws, similar number of Dan Murphy's. So, yeah, we are going through a peak <mark type="ph" /> David (1:08:46).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's really the &#x2013; it's just really the volume that's gone up and our interest rate's at around 7.5%, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About that, yeah. On interest rates, there's a lot of talk from other companies that with the bond rate, the government bond rate, having dropped from about 5.2% to 3.1%, the discount on long duration has gone up significantly. Like I think Wesfarmers called out it cost them A$100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That they had to absorb. How did that affect you guys? Did that impact you guys by as much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Not as much as that, but it did impact us on the swings and roundabouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you use the corporate &#x2013; the government, the Australian government bond rate or do you use state-by-state?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at it different ways. The effective one is probably state government bond rate for the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you use state, which is about 150 basis points above the government bond rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you'd be &#x2013; it would be a lot. So your write-down would be a lot less than what Wesfarmers would have been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. And we've been talking to Wesfarmers about the absurdity of all this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's absurd, yeah, it's just that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry and I have had a real chat about it, but it's the accounting rule. So there is &#x2013; and there's not a great clarity  about what it is. So anyway, so yeah, it does impact but that's life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally, Grant. You mentioned the north above A$20 million for the Masters, can you call out what the breakeven sales could possibly be because even if was, say, just north of A$20 million, our estimates would be you'd have to be up around that mid A$20 million to even high A$20 million to break even.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Obviously, I won't give you the number, but why I mentioned it today, <mark type="ph" /> David (1:10:25), is because there's been a little bit of chatter as to where things might have been, and just to help people, it's well north of A$20 million, our targets. And I'm giving you a bottom, I'm not giving you a top. But it's not low-A$20 millions that we're talking about. And in terms of our pathway to profitability for these stores, that's what I'm talking about when I say we're on target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you'd still be beneath what your target &#x2013; like you'd have a target as to what your breakeven would be?</p>

      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We say that it takes two to three years for our Supermarkets to get to maturity, one to two years for them to be profitable, and it's no different with these boxes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, just following on from some of the comment around food and liquor, you mentioned improving towards the end of Q2...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that inflation driven or you're starting to see share gains accelerate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we called out our share improvement. But what I would say is I'm not &#x2013; we're not overly happy with where our comp sales are at yet. So we're not saying now this business is where it needs to be. This is a journey. And whilst we've made some progress and that there will be some benefit from the decrease, if you like, in the level of deflation, that's not what's been at play, we've improved our customer numbers, we've improved our units.</p>
          <p>The benefit from deflation really is going to come from September onwards. We said that really the level of deflation was still quite strong through until the end of August, and that's certainly been the case. So what has driven the business is an improvement in the underlying performance of the business but it's nowhere where we will sit back and say, we're happy with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second one from me, I was just trying to &#x2013; your CapEx guidance for next year...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Property developments, it seems like it's quite ahead of sort of the based on the guidance, you gave back in November and that CapEx to sales target, I think, 1.9%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Implies like A$67 billion of sales or something next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's driving that and it seems like it's refurbishment activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you talk a little bit maybe about some of the returns of why you decided to step that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup. We had one of our lowest years in terms of full refurbishments last year in the Supermarket division. I think we did 50 last year and it was probably 70 the year before. So it's a correction, somewhat, then in relation to the historical numbers of refurbishments that we've done. That's one level that we've called out in the deck under refurbishments. And there's the Stay in Business piece, which is about us implementing a quick touch refurbishment that's focused on the fresh areas of our business.</p>
          <p>And so it's those two areas that I would tie back to the increase in capital that we've got this year. It was, and as I say, both down to an extraordinarily low number of refurbishments last year and back to the more traditional number this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I suppose you would have known a lot about that back in November when you came out with guidance. Are you saying that a return from the work that you're doing in fresh or around the sushi <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:13:39).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we took you to Eastgardens, and I'm not sure whether you went, <mark type="ph" /> Ben,(1:13:43) but the &#x2013; I mean that's all a pretty recent thing in terms of us being &#x2013; getting to the point of where we're happy enough with it to say, we're going to go with it. We know what the costs are, we know what the return is. So it's a recent conclusion to a project that's been going on for quite a while but we're really comfortable with where we've landed on sushi, with our deli, with our produce and with our bakery enhancements, sufficient that we're going to invest this money and know that we're going to return on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Michael Simotas from Deutsche Bank. Just another question on the performance of the food and liquor business in the second half. You called out some of the issues weighing on cost of doing business, so there's obviously deflation as well as cost inflation. What about the fact that there was a record number of property rolled out in FY 2012, and as you've said, these stores take some time to ramp up? Can you give us some indication of what the drag on the EBIT margin was from that new property ramping up and how that will play out going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't got a number on it, Michael, but it's a statement of fact. 38 stores is what we put on the ground, which was I think it was 17 the year before, so quite a difference in terms of the number of new stores in the Supermarket division this year versus last. And the consequences of that are clear in terms of cost, in terms of capital, in terms of investment of stock and also start-up costs.</p>
          <p>So you wear quite a bit of pain through a period of time and given that it was such a difference to previous years, it can play with the numbers in terms of our return on floor space and the like as well. So that's the other outcome from this, but I haven't got a number that I'll give you in relation to what that's done by way of drag this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then maybe if we could just touch on the guidance, it sounds like you're assuming in that guidance range that consumer confidence remains at similar levels next year. Can you give a little bit more color on what your assumption is for food inflation if we normalize for the fresh deflation that was spoken about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got pretty much the first quarter travelling at higher levels of deflation than before but that comes to an end, as I highlighted earlier. As to what happens then to the other areas of inflation is again somewhat of a guess. So I think we're looking at lower levels of deflation in the packaged area than we had last year. But that's got to play itself out. So, we've &#x2013; we're not assuming historical levels of inflation or a return to that or anywhere close. We're just going to be watching it pretty closely and inherent in the guidance we've given is a watchful approach to what happens to inflation going forward.</p>
          <p>In relation to the consumer piece and the confidence from a consumer, consumer's got every right, I think as being stated by elsewhere, have got every right to be a little cautious and watchful and we as retailers have got to work a bit harder to get that. The environment is uncertain. Our guidance reflects that. It doesn't depart from our ambitions and our work that's being undertaken to make sure we keep growing in this business.</p>

          <p>Greg, I missed you. I'm sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Greg Dring from Macquarie. I just wanted to ask you about shrinkage, you've got a real workover and the trade, I think, refers to is as dumps and says that you're overly focused on shrinkage, in fact to the extent that you were so keen to get the number in terms of the price from shrinkage that you may well have sacrificed sales at a store level in doing so. So I'm just wondering, why did the price immediately become so big? Has something happened or have you found a new way to detect it? And is there more benefit going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a habit of ours where we focus on something and we make it a real target and shrinkage was no different. One of the things that alerted us to it, Greg, in the first instance was simply a process of benchmarking our levels of shrink versus other retailers around the world and we saw it as an opportunity. We got a team together who came up with a whole raft of initiatives that would help us address it and we've delivered on those.</p>
          <p>Now, a lot of that is changes to how we've treated these things in the past but it's never been done in a way that would put at risk either our sales or our customers. This is just us getting I think a &#x2013; one of the denominators in our business back where it should be and it's gotten the focus from Tjeerd and his team without any question and it's delivered a big number as a result. And there's more to come, I've got to tell you.</p>
          <p>Fresh food and perishables is a really big part of our business. And the level of dumps, as you call them, has been a really big number in our business. So even just to improve that by a bit gives us a nice return.</p>

          <p>Just one question for Tom if I could, the old minority interest line or non-controlling line, it's an unusual movement there, because you would probably have a home improvement movement in that line or not.

          <p>Craig, I think we're on to you, working our way back.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Grant, Craig Woolford from Citigroup. Just wanted to explore the guidance. I'll try this question but I don't expect an answer. Do you have a view about FY 2013 sales that you're prepared to share? And the reason I'm asking that, I'd like to understand whether the company expects margin expansion in FY 2013 ex the Masters business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're targeting expansion on most &#x2013; on both top line and &#x2013; because that's how we want to drive the business. So I said before across all of our business groups that comp sales is a real area of focus for us. Total sales is getting looked after somewhat by the new stores that we're rolling out and the growth that we're getting through space. I'm not going to give you a number in terms of the margin, but suffice to say that we're really focused, as we have been this year, on delivering on the changes that we know are going to improve this business.</p>
          <p>We've landed the ones we took out off after this year, and I'm confident that we'll land the ones that we're going to set off or are in the process of going after right now. The guidance is around the external environment and us having to be watchful just as our consumers have been. So, I've done a good job in not answering your question, I think. But it's a number I can't give you and &#x2013; but we've been pretty clear in looking at the guidance and realistic about the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the reason for asking that question, the company had wages growth of 5% in FY 2012. My best estimate is that space growth would have been 8% and wages growth from the awards of the enterprise agreements would have been 3%. So, to get a 5% wages growth with a lot more space was a pretty tight number, and I'm just a bit concerned. There is some feedback in the trade about fairly tight wages being put on some of the businesses, and impacts on service levels in store and on-shelf availability and all the things that go with a lower staffing level, so interested in your comments there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, a fair question. I think the nuts and bolts of a retail business like ours are control of costs and the wages are the biggest cost we've got in the stores. And just like we've looked at shrink, in answer to Greg's question, we've got a close eye on labor. The reality is we're getting 3% wage reviews coming through and we've got to manage those sort of things in a low inflation environment. So we've got to find new ways and new structures within our store, and that's what Tjeerd and his team are doing. We've got a permanent operational improvement team now in place that looks more closely at how we're managing our labor in-store, and we've been getting good results from that and continue to, but there's more to come in that respect. There is no ambition or tolerance given to poor service or out-of-stocks. That's not part of the plan, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. They're competing intentions, aren't they, of course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can be, but I think the point I'm trying to make, Craig, is that we're changing what we're doing. I think if simply you try and screw it harder, it is going to be competing. But if you find a new and better way to do it, which is what the guys are starting to deliver, then you can have both.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, Grant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I hope. Grant Saligari, Credit Suisse. I was just wondered if I could just circle back to the CapEx question from earlier. So if I understand correctly, some of the initiatives in Supermarkets are looking quite positive and, therefore, that's one of the reasons for fiscal 2013 being a little higher. Is that then &#x2013; assuming they continue to be successful, is that then resetting the profile for forward CapEx as outlined in the strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we've got quite a number of stores that are going to get this light touch that I was talking about. And the other part that I referred to is a return to historical levels of refurbishment, so that our network of stores remains in place. The environment, the supermarket environment is always in a state of flux. It was only a year or two ago, we were talking to you guys and showing you the 2010 and then the 2015 and the &#x2013; this is part and parcel of reinvigorating the supermarket floor space, and I don't think this is going to be any different.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't be attaching historical levels necessarily to this going forward. We're confident enough about this. The other comment I'd make, Grant, is that this also feeds back into the initiative that Tjeerd and his team are running in relation to tailoring. It doesn't mean we're going to do every store. So sushi is not going to go into every store, revisions of bakery layouts and fixturing is not going to go into every store. So we're wanting to make a quick move and a quick improvement with the investment that you see for financial year 2013. It doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to be forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah. The BIG W result was quite soft in the EBIT level in the second half. Was that, again, a third quarter story or was that &#x2013; what's the reason for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, EBIT for us improved really nicely in the second half for the BIG W result. And I've seen that that was put down to the stimulus payment in some of the commentary that's been written. What I can share with you is that BIG W has been on a path of improvement for the entire half. So &#x2013; and it's a nice, steady, sustainable improvement in that business that, as Julie alluded to, we're seeing continue into this year. And part of it has got to be what you're alluding to, the softer sales. But even within that, we've seen improving performance from that business over the course of the half, not just the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally just from me, just to clarify, the extra $120 million in provisions taken for Dick Smith, the lease tail provisions, are they to do with stores that are planning to be closed currently? Could you just clarify what's in the $120 million?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>72, yeah, yeah, now. And so we've got to &#x2013; looking at possibly another tranche here for this year, subject to, obviously, a sale process that's going on.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Can we give it to Shaun? He's been as keen as mustard, but he won't sit in the back row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He sits here in the front.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Punished for the back row, understandable. Just a question &#x2013; Shaun Cousins, JPMorgan. Just a question regarding gaming and Victoria in particular. Given the changes to the ATM regulations that occurred on the 1 of July in Victoria, how does that impact current trading and how does that impact the anticipated uplift you thought you'd get from the broader changes to Victorian gaming that occurred last week?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; what happens when changes are made in not only that environment but most environments is you get an initial hit and then things start to return to somewhat more normal. And in relation to the ATMs, it's hard to pin, Shaun, that on one thing, because what's also have been happening in the Victorian environment is of course has been an adjustment in machine numbers that's been occurring over the same period. So, being able to say that much for ATM and that much for the removal of gaming machines has been difficult. It's not changed our outlook in terms of what we expect as our return from the Victorian hotels over the coming year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think &#x2013; you still think you could get maybe A$80 million to A$100 million EBIT uplift out of Vic gaming changes, playing the operator role?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've come out and said what the number is, but we expect that we will get what we had previously taken aim at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a question maybe for Tjeerd. You made the point that a number of buyers had been through the Category Lab but not all. Can you confirm that all buyers and people in the supermarket business are on the same KPIs, because feedback from the trade is that that's not the case, that some appear sales-driven, some appear category growth driven, some appear margin driven? And it's a little bit of an inconsistent message that's coming from Woolworths in terms of what's important to them. And I'm curious whether or not those that have been part of the Category Lab, whether that's a factor in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tjeerd, you want have a crack at that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you asked me the same question when we were in  Eastgardens before, and I'll give the same answer. It's market share growth, it's top line growth and making sure we have right choice for customers. So &#x2013; and every category is different, so that's why every tactic is different, because sometimes we lead in market share, sometimes we underperform, sometimes we have better sales. So I think the inconsistency is because not every category is in the same shape, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a question, Tom, I think you indicated that Dick Smith sale was several weeks away a month or so ago. Can you just talk a bit about anticipated timing? Obviously, you've had a management change and is the possibility that Woolworths has to just shut all of these stores and &#x2013; if they can't find a buyer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe we're just in a process; these things can take longer, Shaun. It's just a matter of working through it and seeing if we can get an outcome. So I wouldn't read too much into it. It's just taking longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry, just finally one more. We're assuming that 3% to 6% NPAT growth guidance assumes that the EGM is not successful, the EGM on a dollar base.</p>

With the increase in the provision, are you looking to increase that number of stores that you close?

But, of course, when you have a look at industry best practice, we're actually sitting above where that is already only after two months of being online.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Grant, Tjeerd. Just a question on the impact of floods in the PPP, did you manage to claim back all the cost associated with that? I just wanted to understand how soft the base was for the second half 2012?</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said that there was a &#x2013; in last year's numbers, we said there was a A$38 million impact in the result which included a whole range of things. If we had recoverable costs, we would have provided for the insurance recovery expectation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And also just on the working capital and inventory more specifically, this picked up and I understand there's a Masters impact there, is there also a private label impact? Do you have to carry more inventory as a result of increasing the penetration there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not so much private label. The areas that we point out in relation to inventory is certainly the Masters, the increasing number of supermarkets, Dan Murphy's and the like that we've had this year. But the other element is the global sourcing and the level of global sourcing. We indicated that that more or less doubled and so we're carrying more stock as a result of that, incremental indent stock as we call it, and that's a pretty big increase. And we would expect that to increase again as we continue to grow our globally-sourced products.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I've just got a question on the property investments, please. Just firstly, what's planned around the exit of property assets, I guess, more specifically what's the amount that's ready for sale and what's the timing for that being offered to investors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the offered to investors, look we're doing that all the time. I've got a small team that are looking at people that are interested in that portfolio, so that's really just an ongoing process. In terms of what would be available, there's probably somewhere between A$800 million or A$900 million plus depending on what you say available because it depends what condition it's in and level of &#x2013; in terms of construction and level of specialty leasing, et cetera. So, yeah, it's a reasonable amount that we could put out in the market, but it's not a sell side. It's really the number of buyers that are interested in our portfolio and as you've seen, the level of demand is a bit lower this year than it was last year, but it does move around, and at the moment we are seeing some interest but it's a tough environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is it fair to assume that pricing at the moment is a little softer than what it has been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We're not giving this stuff away. I can tell you that. That's probably why we're not selling as much. We want to get a good yield. We're still pretty tough. We're just &#x2013; we sold some hotels the other day at pretty good yields. So last year, we sold a Dan Murphy's up in Coffs for 6% to 7% yield. So, we don't give a really good quality assets away. So, we can bide our time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. First question centered around some inventory levels at Masters. If I sort of backstop the commentaries you've made overall about inventory, it looks like there's about A$170-odd-million or about A$11 million per store given the sort of sales guidance of north of A$20 million which is just an inventory turnover about two times. I was wondering if that's a number that you're comfortable with or something that you think is going to improve as you go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, your number's not right and, logically, the number only improves as the stores mature as well. So we haven't disclosed the number in relation to the stock levels sold within those stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've said that the inventory number is 8.4% growth would have been, ex-ing Masters out. It would have been 3.3%. The numbers are pretty easy to work out, they're around about A$170 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've got stores that are open. We have stores that are opening and we have a brand new &#x2013; we have two DCs that we're stocking for the future opening of the stores. So the simple math doesn't quite work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess, on a store basis, perhaps it doesn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly in terms of depreciation, over the last five years, the depreciation of plant and equipment has gone from sort of 22% down to 17% or if you look at it another way, you've extend the life of your plant and equivalent from 4.5 years to 6. I was wondering if there's any different mix in the business that you would point towards why that is the case or if there's some different assumptions going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's no great change in the &#x2013; well,  there is no change in the useful life of the assets or anything or the depreciation rates. It's really would just be a function of sales going up and depreciation not going up as much. If you're doing a percentage of sale which I think is what I heard you say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just wanted to ask a question on Australian food and liquor. The margins were pretty low in the second half and I know that's in the outcome and not how you drive the business. But over the next few years, do you think there is a point where you're going to have to reinvest more upfront for the benefit to come and we could actually have a period where margins go down in the Australian food and liquor business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Philosophy has always been about growing dollar profit and that's not changed. We don't have a margin ambition as such and the plans that we've had this year, the plans that we've got for next year and future years are going to be about the settings we need to deliver increase EBIT for each business unit and for the group overall.</p>
          <p>So, it's a combination of a lot of things and we've talked about a lot them here today about where we can improve our GP margin through improved global sourcing, through improved management of shrinkage. We can improve our cost line through improved store operating costs and we can improve our sales by improving the productivity in our stores as the store network and the space increase that we've put into the market starts to mature.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a clarifying question, on the extra week in 2013, is there anything in that week that would mean that profit contribution would be unusual or should we just mathematically assume roughly a 2% benefit?</p>
