          <p>Please stand-by, we're about to begin. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Siemens 2009 Third Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. Before we begin, I would like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statements on page two of the Siemens presentation.</p>
          <p>This conference call may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore, subject to certain risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Ms. Mariel von Drathen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2009 Conference Call. The earnings release, the Flashlight and all other documents were published at 7:30 this morning. You can download all these files from our website. This morning's presentation is now online and this morning's call is also being webcast by the IR website.</p>
          <p>Our President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher and our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Kaeser are here this morning to review Q3 results. After the presentation, we will have time for Q&amp;A with Peter and Joe. And with that, I would like to now hand over to Peter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mariel. Welcome and good morning, also from my side to everyone to our Third Quarter Conference Call. Before diving into the details of the quarter, let me touch briefly on the macro environment.</p>
          <p>While the financial markets appear to have stabilized, we expect there to be a lag before we see the real economy recover in a meaningful way. Given this, the overall industrial environment remains challenging, with credit markets remaining weak. You can clearly see that &#x2013; this in our short-cycle businesses, which are still being impacted by the downturn.</p>
          <p>The most recent German VDMA data, which as you know, is a key indicator for us, shows that orders continued to fall in May, declining by 48% year-on-year in real terms after record decrease of 58% in April, due to weakness across all categories. Although some early leading macro indicators like the ICM purchasing managers index, the Euro-zone manufacturing PMI, upwards GDP revisions in the U.S. And China, and improvement in German Ifo, seem to have bottomed out and stabilized at low levels. But this also means, still pointing to the contracting economy, we have yet to see any real signs of recovery in the relevant markets for our short-cycle businesses. However, despite this tough environment, Siemens is handling the situation well.</p>
          <p>And turning now to our third quarter results, I think that despite all of the challenges, we delivered a solid quarter. We performed well relative to the market, and while year-on-year comparisons are tough, our results do reflect the underlying strength of our focused portfolio and the impact of our productivity measures.</p>
          <p>With these results, we are fully on track to deliver our targets for fiscal 2009. We have maintained our strong cash flow, and solid balance sheet, and the team is executing well. As I mentioned, we had strong relative performance in the third quarter, particularly in Energy and the Healthcare sectors. On the efficiency side, we took early actions with our SG&amp;A program, and we are fully on track. And we have maintained this momentum with our announced supply chain initiative earlier this year, and Barbara will give you a detailed review in our next conference call. We are also using the short work-week which as you know, gives us greater lever flexibility and where necessary we have adjusted capacities to match the realities of the demand environment, particularly in businesses like Osram and Building Technologies.</p>
          <p>In this respect, as can see in comparison to the beginning fiscal '09 we had 430,000 employees worldwide year-to-date the number is now at 409,000 employees globally. We also completed the divestment of our stake in Fujitsu Siemens Computers and while Siemens real estate sold its residential properties and this is just one other step forward in focusing our portfolio. Let me now turn briefly to some of the financial highlights of the quarter.</p>
          <p>As we expected the total book-to-bill dipped below one for the quarter. As the Industry sector's book-to-bill of 0.81 impacted the overall book-to-bill although the Energy sector maintained its book-to-bill still above one. The backlog at the end of the quarter remains strong at &#x20AC;84.3 billion. Orders for the quarter finished down 27% although the comparables are very challenging given near record level orders in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Revenues fell 4% in the quarter impacted largely by the downturn in the Industry sector's end markets. We posted solid margins of 9.6% on total sector profits of 1.7 billion for the quarter with a strong margin contribution from the Energy sector of 13.4% up both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Healthcare's underlying margin of 15.7% remains strong excluding PPA, OTC and charges of 128 million related to contracts in particle therapy, which I will come back to you later. And as I expected, Industry's margins remain under pressure in the short-cycle businesses.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share from continuing operations were up 29% over the second quarter to &#x20AC;1.35 per share and on the cash flow side improvements in working capital management led to a free cash flow of 1.7 billion from total sectors in the quarter with cash conversion of one. Let me now give you a bit more detail on the regions' and sectors' performance over the quarter.</p>
          <p>Starting on the left hand side you can see all regions, so orders declined year-on-year, with the U.S. seeing the greatest impact. Europe, C.I.S, Africa and Middle East felt the greatest regional effect on the slowdown, with revenues slipping 4% in total, and as you can see the &#x2013; here, the impact on German revenues was pronounced. Turning to Asia, the situation is more positive, with revenues increasing by 1% while revenues in China grew 5% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the right half of the slide, as expected the short-cycle businesses within the Industry sector are seeing the most direct impact from the downturn. Order and revenue declined across all those divisions, and we continue to see margin pressure. At Industry Automation orders fell 29%, and revenue fell 27% as the downturn in large factory automation continues to impact the business, which led to a fall in profits and margin.</p>
          <p>In our Drive Technologies business, the effect the slowdown is broadly similar to Industry Automation, although, as expected, with a delay of one to two quarters. The continuing downturn in the Machine Building Industry, a major part of the German Mittelstand significantly impacted the division with revenues declining 22% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Orders fell 42% year-over-year, as we are also seeing demand soften in some of the divisions longer-cycle businesses. Industry Solutions backlog has given the division some buffer from the full effects of the slowdown, but the Metals Business remains very challenging. Revenue fell 12% year-over-year while orders declined 44%.</p>
          <p>As we have said for some time, Building Technologies is being impacted by the slowdown in the commercial construction market, which will continue to slow. Given this, revenues declined by 7% year-on-year, while margins remain reasonably stable at 6% for the quarter. We have a very accurate picture of how the end markets will develop for Building Technologies and are aligning capacities accordingly. You can expect restructuring charges to be recognized in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Osram continues to experience a very challenging market, as we have discussed this over the previous calls. They are adjusting to the structural changes in the end markets, and you should expect restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, Mobility continues to see good revenue growth at 12% year-on-year with margins improving by 340 basis points to 6.2%, compared to the prior year. Although Mobility's order growth was down, it is set against a very tough comparison with last year's quarter, which included a customer order from Belgium State Railway worth 1.4 billion. Looking forward, we also expect that there will be a less favorable product mix over the second half of full year '09, compared to the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Energy sector, we continue to see strength in revenue and profit generation backed up with a high quality backlog. Although the sector's new orders fell 14% in the quarter, compared to the prior year quarter, the book-to-bill remained above one with a total very healthy backlog value of 48 billion, which remains healthy at Q2 levels. In the quarter, we saw margins and profits increase in all divisions, compared to the prior year. Overall, the sector margin remains very strong at 13.4%.</p>
          <p>In the Fossil business, the book-to-bill remains over one. Although the rate of order growth has slowed from the first two quarters of the year, year-on-year order growth was strong at 18% for the quarter. Revenues rose 11% with margins increasing to 14.5% up 440 basis points year-on-year. It's also worth highlighting that we are seeing a strong performance across our service organization, which continues to make very solid progress.</p>
          <p>Now to Renewable Energy. Renewable Energy continues to do well with revenues rising 18% and margin increasing to 13.1% in the quarter. Although order intake is lumpy, which makes revenue somewhat volatile in the near-term, this was the division's second best quarter ever for new orders, the best quarter being last year's Q3. The Offshore business remains stable with large offshore order wins securing revenues over the mid-term. However, the Onshore business is more volatile, with lower order intake and greater pricing pressure. Some of the wins at Renewables in the quarter include a large order to provide 175 wind turbines for the world's largest offshore wind-farm, the London Array project, with a capacity of 630 mega-watts, and an order for 80 wind turbines for the Butendiek offshore wind-farm in the German North Sea.</p>
          <p>The Oil and Gas division saw a healthy increase in margins to 12% in the quarter of a revenue increase of 11%, although orders remain very weak with a 47% decline, as customers defer new developments. In Transmission, revenues increased by 9% year-on-year with margins increasing to 11.9, new orders declined in the quarter although in line with the market. Distribution was impacted in the quarter by the slow down in its industrial businesses which resulted in a 1% decline in revenue while order fell 17% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>However, strict cost control measures led to an increase in margins to 12.6% although margin pressure remains an issue. At Healthcare there were gives and takes in the quarter. In a tighter financial funding environment particularly in the U.S. we performed comparatively well in Diagnostics and Imaging where we continue to execute well, with new orders for the sector dipping by 6% while revenue increased 2%.</p>
          <p>Imaging and IT's margin increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 16.4% while revenue increasing 2% year-over-year. Diagnostics' margin rose 180 basis points year-over-year coming in at 11.7% with an underlying margin of 17.6% excluding PPA and OTC. However, the 128 million charge booked in Workflow, and solutions due to the development challenges and delays with particle therapy contracts was an absolute negative in an otherwise solid quarter. I'm, together with Joe and others, are very disappointed with the situation in particle therapy. We are reviewing the situation and we will resolve it.</p>
          <p>And with that let me now turn over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. Good morning. Welcome also from my side. Overall I'm satisfied with our performance in the quarter. There are several areas of excellence in the business, such as the Energy sector, as well as the Healthcare Imaging. And adding to Peter's comments, of course, we are not very pleased with the Workflow Solution. So, it also may take structural measures to address the matter.</p>
          <p>But ladies and gentlemen, one area we are continuing to make great progress is the SG&amp;A program. We are executing well and we are ahead of plan. As you can see on the left hand side we have successfully lowered our SG&amp;A costs year-to-date 2009 by 270 base points and run at 14% of revenue, down from 16.7 on the baseline. You can find this evidence straight in our P&amp;L sent out with the Earnings Release this morning.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side you'll see that in absolute terms we have lowered SG&amp;A costs in Q3 by 600 million, or 19% year-over-year, and 1.5 billion year-to-date, as compared to the same period a year ago. So, the message here is we are delivering, our productivity and cost measures are also gaining traction. I want to caution you, though, that financial in fiscal Q4 may see some SG&amp;A increase due to the specific impacts in the quarter. The Supply Chain Initiative that we announced back in April is on track and we will update you on this and other related initiatives when we announce our fiscal Q4 results early December.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to use the short-time work model and have a number of businesses going through previously announced restructurings. While the structural impact of an off-peak scenario at some of our divisions is not yet clear, we are acting diligently on resource reduction that we have decent visibility, such as Osram, Building Technologies, and in parts Industrial Solutions. These are the divisions that you can expect ongoing restructuring in fiscal Q4 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on our cash flow and CapEx developments in the quarter. As Peter mentioned, our free cash flow in the quarter continued to be reasonably solid at about 1.7 billion for the total sectors, or 1.1 billion for the company as a whole. Considering that we have continued cash out-flows from actions taken in fiscal 2008 through event formational charges, our cash performance was, I would say, okay for the quarter. However, assuming a slowdown in large infrastructure orders, and respective pre-payments, you should be aware that the fourth quarter, which is normally seasonably strong for free cash flow might not see such strong levels as previously experienced in prior years.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on the development of our CapEx rate. As you can see we continue to apply a tight grip here. In the quarter, we successfully managed to further decrease our CapEx rate to 87% that means CapEx in percent of depreciation, which is well below our target range. For the full year you should expect us to be around the lower end of the target range. Just to give you a little more detail on the CapEx matter in both Industry and Healthcare and given the current difficult market environment we are taking a very stringent approach to CapEx. On the other hand in Energy, we continue to invest into the global footprint of both Renewables, as well as T&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, I'd like to update you on another topic which has been an important part of our TAP program, the so-called other operations. Another excellent example of delivering on what we said we would do. As you might recall, the line item Other Operations was made up of 187 small and mid-size business entities outside the sector, mainly located outside of Germany, and accounting for 2.3 billion sales but in parts heavily loss-making.</p>
          <p>We committed to exit these activities by the end of fiscal 2009 via transferring them to one of the sectors, selling them, or shutting them down. We have made excellent progress with 97% of the activities and revenues now resolved. We are on track to reach our target of a leaner, more focused portfolio as committed to in the TAP program and we will update you on the final outcome of other operations in December, 2009.</p>
          <p>And with that I hand it back to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As you have heard from Joe, we have got an intense focus on cost, CapEx and working capital and we are ahead of our plan to streamline other operations and focus on our three sectors. But we also understand that our business is about innovation, and here we are as committed as ever to invest and develop the most innovative customer solutions.</p>
          <p>A great example of innovation within the Industry sector is the new energy-efficient trams that the Mobility business has brought to market. As cities cope with increasing urbanization and the pressure it places on existing transport infrastructure, budget and environment, Siemens has introduced the world's first tram to not require any overhead power lines. And this uses 30% less energy than traditional trams. It's cheaper to install and has significantly lower CO2 emissions. This tram is already running today in Portugal and is an excellent example of sustainable innovation.</p>
          <p>One of the best examples of the power of Siemens innovation is our new H-Frame turbine. We are now moving from the testing phase into commercialization. It's clear that investments in energy infrastructure and energy efficiency are a major growth driver for Siemens going forward. While we may see a dip in the near term, the underlying long-term trend is clear, and that spending is becoming more discerning everyday. As utilities around the world replace aging infrastructure or install new plants and upgrade the grid, customers want the best as measured by performance and efficiency.</p>
          <p>This is a picture of our new H-Frame gas turbine, which some of you saw last year in Irsching. It will soon be entering the commercial phase, after achieving excellent results during the test phase. The turbine has exceeded expectations during testing, achieving efficiencies of over 60% in combined cycle operations. There's huge market interest, and we are in detailed negotiations with customers. This is an exciting area to be a leader in and a great example of the power of Siemens innovation.</p>
          <p>In Healthcare, we are continuing to drive innovation in the marketplace, having this year launched the world's fastest low-radiation CT. In a difficult market, the Somatom Definition Flash has been a major success, already gaining significant customer traction with a very compelling value proposition.</p>
          <p>Let me now sum up and give you an update on what we expect for the remainder of 2009. Despite the weak environment, we delivered solid results in the quarter. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we do not expect any meaningful recovery in the real economy. We expect the Industry sector, with the exception of Mobility, to continue facing challenges from the slowdown. The Healthcare sector, despite the challenges in the market, will continue to drive an overall solid performance as we saw this quarter, particularly relative to competitors. And finally, the Energy sector will continue to drive strong revenue performance, although we continue to expect a slowdown in product orders and further customer referrals.</p>
          <p>We are well on track to deliver our total sector profit and our guidance for the rest of this fiscal year is unchanged. As I said, last quarter, we are driving the business hard, we are taking action and we are delivering, as you can see from our execution of our SG&amp;A program. And with that, we would now be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>But before I hand it over, I also would like to communicate to you that we have today signed two major contracts. One, an order of 560 &#x2013; of 320 million with the Russian State Railway and in addition we have also signed a letter of intent for local passenger trains in relation to the Olympic Games for Sochi 2014 in the value order of &#x20AC;570 million. So, two great wins in Russia today as we speak.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to hand over and we're happy to answer your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions please. The first one, on your Industrial footprint, we see many companies in the sector, many of your competitors using this downturn to aggressively accelerate moving industrial footprint to Asian countries, to lower-cost countries for the production in their facilities. Maybe you could give us an update what Siemens plans to do there. And second, you mentioned this morning on the press call a strong interest in the solar space again, looking for acquisitions there. Maybe you could give us a bit more information what exactly there you're looking for and whether this is really &#x2013; whether making solar wafers is really a business Siemens should be in given its high CapEx, high volatility, the type of business that, like with Infineon, Siemens kind of exited 10 years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andreas, indeed. I mean, other companies are talking right now moving aggressively into the emerging markets. We've been there since more than 100 years. And this we see, particularly in the current downturn, a major advantage of our company from several angles. A, we have a third of our business already in the emerging markets. B, in all these markets, we are considered a global, local company and we certainly have therefore, and should have an advantage when it comes accessing stimulus programs and others also in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>Indeed this is also for us a major area of incremental research shift into the region but not just from a manufacturing footprint or supply chain footprint, it's also important in terms of how we access innovations, how we actually make cap into the innovation power of which is also happening in this part of the world. And of course, this is also for us an area where we look aggressively to build our footprint from an organic focus and perspective but also in terms of we're absolutely sure this will also an opportunity for potentially M&amp;A activities in the emerging markets as well or partnerships and joint ventures.</p>
          <p>In terms of our M&amp;A activity in solar indeed rest assured we are extremely aware of the situation what we used to have a couple of years ago. Our focus is certainly not the rooftop application and for obvious reason I don't want to go into great detail. But if you assume that projects &#x2013; visionary projects like Disatek is an area where we see our self as a major technology leader and then you would not be wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we expect Siemens to be a provider of basically solar cells to such large projects like Solartek in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The answer is definitely no, Andreas.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We've got our next question from Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions please. Firstly, I'm delighted to see that the SG&amp;A plan is ahead of schedule. When you launched that plan you were talking about 1.2 billion of net savings but about 2 billion of gross savings. Perhaps you could help us understand why it's ahead of plan. Is it because you managed to keep more of the gross savings therefore, the net is bigger? Or are you actually finding greater savings than you anticipated at the gross level when you started out? And secondly, I'd like please a bit more information about the charge at particle therapy. Is this is a one-off charge? Do you think that's as with the energy problems a year ago, you've taken enough of a hit to cope with future issues? Or is this going to be potentially a further drag on earnings for some quarters to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter. This is Joe. On the SG&amp;A plan we agree with you. We've come a long way and made decent progress. The &#x2013; the most important impact on let's say that we're ahead of plan was basically that we did not fall into the trap of continuing to increase also sales job-related posts. So, the majority of the savings comes from the fact that we did not increase our jobs in the sales area as originally planned for when prospects looked different as they are today. So, that is &#x2013; this an important topic yet.</p>
          <p>And one is also that we pretty quickly were able to making good on what is said in terms of consultancy and IT cost. That actually also where we are ahead of plan. We were able to do lots of in-sourcing on the consultancy side, reduce the complexity of IT cost by the number of legal entities and reporting units. So, this is where we made the major progress worth and that also is the reason why we are a little earlier than we had originally thought we would be since many of the actions we're considered would be on the tail-end of the period. So, we are making good progress and we continue to be active on the SG&amp;A environment.</p>
          <p>On the PT, Particle Therapy contract, you know we have four. The majority of them, which is three, are due to be completed in 2012. One is supposed to be completed in 2014. So, we have quite a way to go here. The division got hit by an unfortunate development in terms of the component supplier going bust so we had to eventually take it over to secure supply, which then basically hit us with about 20 and change million on higher cost, as compared to the originally planned cost structure here.</p>
          <p>The second topic was that software turned out to be insufficient for those three contracts. We needed to take more massive changes into consideration on the software. That accounts for about 60 plus million. And those two root causes together eventually cause a delay in executing on the project and that accounts for about 40 plus million. So, that's in essence the root cause of the projects and, as you know, we account for what we expect to be probable. By the same token we just have to say that we are currently at less than 20% of completion and it always of course, bears a risk for the remainder of the 80%, but we booked the highly probable impact of that was 128 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, guys. It's Mark Troman here from Banc of America -Merrill Lynch. Just three quick questions. Firstly, on cost cutting, you've clearly done good work at Osram and it looks like SB2 is more things are happening there. But the Automation business is sort of noticeable by their absence in terms of cost reduction, so I just &#x2013; give us an update on your thinking there, on how you plan &#x2013; what you plan to do with the Industrial Automation and Drive Technologies. Second question, lots of debates about pricing recently. I wonder if you could just comment where you are seeing the most pressure. Or is it not that significant? I guess the basic message from results so far in the market is that real life price pressure isn't that significant, but I wonder what your thoughts were. And finally, in the Fossil business, I wonder if, Peter, you could give an update on what the situation is with Utilities. Is the tendering activity busy? What are they looking to see? What are Utilities looking to see before they actually put pen to paper and sign more orders again? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. This is Joe. Maybe &#x2013; maybe start with the cost cutting and the pricing matter before I turn it over to Peter on the Fossil and Utility environment. It's definitely right, wherever we do have visibility on what structural impacts will look like going forward, such as Osram and DT, we are taking actions. And you might have noticed that we have significantly cut down resources in both Osram predominately but also starting now with DT.</p>
          <p>On the Industrial Automation and Drive Technologies, we have &#x2013; we continue to be very close at the output with our labor-related short time model. And the reason being that our working hypothesis is that in the second half of 2010, we will see &#x2013; we will see an up-turn on the short-cycle businesses. That's the working hypothesis. And that's why we continue to use the model of short time work, and as soon as we have more visibility on what structural impacts may be from the peak levels 2008, as compared to the end of 2010, we will give updates on what those measures will look like. And we've already announced it into the markets that December 3 we will be more precise about what we believe the environment will look like going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the pricing environment, it is reasonably stable in Energy especially on Fossil and in most parts also, in the Renewable, there is continued pricing pressure on the onshore area due to let's say over-supply. In terms of capacities, there are some pockets of weakness in the T&amp;D environment, especially on the larger project, substation and the likes. We've seen that for quite a while and we would not be surprised if that increases due to the fact that there has been massive capacities been built up in the last two years which are obviously now being completed and are available for the market. On Industry, so far it's reasonable. It, however, remains to be seen on what continued over-supply and capacities will do to prices going forward. So, currently no massive impact but on the next foreseeable quarters we would not be too surprised if there is some weakness also in the Industrial environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, on the Utilities environment, what we see, A, number one, we have still a great backlog in this business. B, of course, the key issue, what we see is actually the time pressure for Utilities to really put new energy generation on the ground is obviously is a different in today's environment than it used to be a year ago. So, it's really a question that negotiations for these reasons alone are dragging on longer and it's a question of how and when it will be impacted. We don't see yet a significant drop in terms of funnel activities, but the project what we're negotiating are probably at a different time scale today than they used to be a year ago. But overall the business is in good shape. As you can see from our development and we still have a great order book in this business.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We've got a question from Scott Babka from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Scott Babka from Morgan Stanley. Just two questions. First, I just want to talk about your comfort in maintaining the margins you've seen in the Energy division as we get through the end of this year and then into early next year, and I guess there's two points to this question. One is, what's driven the upside in Fossil in particular? Has it been services or just better performance on the turnkey contracts? And then what does the gross margin profile look like of kind of what you're booking now, which has been really strong orders, which would kind of give you an indication into the early part of next year and into 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Hi, Scott. If you have noticed in the, you might have noticed in the earnings release that regarding Energy, especially Fossil, we were somewhat cautious in the outlook on Q4, since usually Q4 has some seasonal aspects on the Service part. So, it may not be as great as we have seen in Q3, but it should be reasonably close. So, we continue to execute well on the projects, that's mostly also what comes out as an upside, very good execution. And if that continues the way we should see robustness in underlying margins. But then again, Q3 was seasonably strong, due to a higher impact on Services in Fossil, as it is usually over the average on the quarter, so maybe a little down in Q4, but still a robust environment. As far as the order intake is concerned, we still took orders which were at or mostly above the current gross margin levels, which we showed P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, that would give you confidence then as you, as you &#x2013; and what does that backlog carry you through to right now, if you look at turnkey contracts, particularly in Fossil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, all that depends when the customers give us the notice to proceed. So, one should not be too surprised if the current orders may take a little longer for the notice to proceed, as in the peak times of huge demand, but the environment on big orders is as such that once you book the order, there is a certain discipline from the contract partners to make good on what has been agreed upon. So, therefore, we are reasonably comfortable on the backlog margin. To give you a flavor in total on the total backlog environment, we currently are at about 84 billion backlog and 13.4 billion out of that are scheduled to turn into revenues in obviously Q4 2009. 32 billion will be &#x2013; are scheduled to turn into revenues in 2010 and the rest is going to be 2011 and above. So, is a robust underlying backlog, especially in Energy, because the corresponding numbers on Energy are 6 billion in Q4, about 18 billion in 2010 and then we take it further in 2011. So, there is a robust backlog. We need to execute well and that's what we are aiming for.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Guy DuPre from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Maybe the first one about Imaging and IT. Could you maybe explain what's driving the margin improvement on a sequential basis Q3 versus Q2? Are there any favorable mix or currency effects this quarter? And do you expect to benefit from the traditional positive seasonal factor that we currently see in the fourth quarter? Also maybe one question about the Energy division. Can you maybe just give us an update on the development of your new H-Frame gas turbine? I know there's a slide in your presentation. But maybe when do you expect it to be commercially available a bit more precisely? And is it fair to assume that this will become your key product offering and that it will largely replace the F-Frame? And maybe also for your utility customers could you quantify how valuable this new technology will be, maybe in terms of lifetime savings? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, I start off with the second one, with Energy. Obviously, and hopefully you fully understand this. We have just the first test behind us so the early signs are extremely positive. We have some early customer engagements with the H-Frame, but it's way too early to make statements like this. I think what it will be, it will be a great, great new offering which is exactly where the utilities would like to go with highest efficiency, productivity gains in an environment where obviously cost-effectiveness of power generation is hugely important. So, indeed we see a very, very good early customer interaction but, please, it's way too early to make statements like this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right then. I'll continue with the answer on Imaging IT division and Healthcare, I just think in all respect it that performance of that division just deserves the highest respect, and Peter and I specifically also conveyed that message to the divisional CEO and his team. They are just doing a great job. 16% in a difficult environment is definitely world-class. You may have seen that, also, in comparing the performance in the market.</p>
          <p>Now the difference between Q2 and Q3 was basically performance, and in some part also a favorable mix between MRIs and CTs. For Q4, I would not, let's say, forecast such a world-class thing again, but definitely the environment in a 14 to 16% should be achievable, also for Q4.</p>
          <p>Now, on the general aspects of Q4, as compared to prior years, I &#x2013; let's say, given the trend on what we've seen in short-cycle businesses, and also, in the sector itself, I would not be that enthusiastic about this great September wonder. I would rather be, let's say, stick to what we have said. We are fully on track in meeting our guidances and free cash flow could actually be worse from what we have seen in prior years, in Q4 where we had traditionally a very strong free cash flow, with also strong swings than in Q1. So, both this year might be softer. So, overall, as Peter said earlier, we are on track on making good on what we have been promising for 2009, and everything else we take from there in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just &#x2013; maybe a follow-up on cash flows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you maybe just elaborate on the cash outflows related to the expected lower down payments probably to come in the upcoming quarters? So what do you expect in terms of cash outflows here, maybe in Q4 and for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think for Q4, the jury is out on how the order intake and the related prepayments will be. As you probably remember, I've been guiding this aspect for several quarters now, which has to see that we might have reached, or actually passed peak levels on large infrastructure projects order intake. And therefore, it's a natural impact that at some point in time, we will be seeing a working capital build-up related to the slowdown of customer pre-payments, it's something we are &#x2013; have actually been getting prepared for. Now, whether or not that will already hit in Q4 at this point in time is too early to tell, but we are prepared for that, and we've been guiding that this may have impact on free cash flow. That's all, I think, what we should speculate on the matter.</p>
          <p>So free cash flow will be weaker in Q4, as compared to prior years and how much the impact will be on pre-payments or lack of pre-payments is something you know I just don't want to speculate at this point in time. We are diligently working on working capital and asset management improvements. As you know, we also have made the accounts payable terms and conditions as part of the supply chain managing program, since this ties together at the supplier level. We are very, very focused on accounts receivables, in both parts the quantitative aspect, as well as the qualitative aspect. That means that we are very focused on past-due developments, in order to make sure that we get our money into the company. But it would be too, you know speculating too much on how that would be in Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll take two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Nomura. Please, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. I have two questions please. The first question, just following up on this issue of working capital. I think you've been talking about inventory reductions for some time, two or three years, and now revenues are coming off. One would expect to see the inventories coming down, but the progress on that seems very limited. You know if I look at inventories now, they're about 15 billion, up 5 or 600 million from where they were in September. Payables are down about 1.9 billion. So, if you could talk a little bit about how you're focusing on inventories and how you're trying to get those down?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you know asset prices are a lot lower than they were a year or two or three years ago, and as you said at the beginning, a lot of the macro-type indicators are showing stabilization, but if I look at your strategy on divestments and M&amp;A, you're very focused on pushing through divestments in real estate, other operations, things like Fujitsu Siemens, but it seems like given your balance sheet and given the stabilization indicators, given low asset prices, it would be a much better time to be starting to think about acquisitions. I know you mentioned something in solar perhaps, but just more broadly, if you could give an update on how you're weighing out divestments versus M&amp;A in the current environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, let's start with the working capital program. The accounts payable obviously are the first &#x2013; you know this is the first line of entry on the asset cycle. We've done already pretty well in terms of the turns for material on hand, so that has been brought back in a massive way. We are working our way through now, it's a work in progress. And also, finished goods have come down. The impact you're seeing in inventories are predominantly coming from the cost in excess of billings, and that's in the long-cycle projects areas. So, the inventory turns are definitely a focus area where we expect future improvements going forward, and also, securing liquidity by bringing down the inventories as a whole. And you can expect progress here in the next quarters to come.</p>
          <p>On the asset pricing, disposals versus acquisitions, we are making good on what we have promised to streamline down the portfolio. And that goes especially for other operations as you have seen and heard from my report. We're pretty much done with cleaning that up and focusing on the three sectors, plus the two cross-sectoral divisions. The load-off on real estate has been continuing for two years in a row and we continue to look at that. It is more &#x2013; one aspect is to secure liquidity and get assets off the balance sheet, but the other one is also in the long-term, as they're trying to more variablize real estate related fixed cost in order to be more flexible in terms of how we can act and react on geographical changes on the global landscape. So, it has also a strategic direction here above and besides the cash flow and asset management.</p>
          <p>And on the acquisition, I mean, capital efficiency is the first and foremost aspect of acquisitions, as it should be. By the same token, we are looking into strategic aspects, Renewables definitely is an area. But it's always somewhat difficult to discuss acquisition projects in the public, because this is probably not just the place to do it. So, please bear with us. You can be rest assured we have a very, very detailed and well-developed deal book in both acquisitions and divestitures, and we'll take it just from there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wanted to ask a quick question about some of the sequential declines you'd seen in orders. I think if I looked at some divisions, such as Drive Technologies, Industry Solutions, and the Power Transmission Business, it obviously been quite a sharp decline in orders sequentially from the second quarter. And I just wondered &#x2013; I mean, is that level of demand what we should be basing as a view of what demand could be going forward? Or in those particular areas was there anything specific in the quarter which would have &#x2013; would have meant that maybe demand will stabilize at a higher level than where they've fallen to within that quarter? And my second question, really, was just in terms of the Industrial Automation and Drive Technologies Business, you obviously highlighted that your shorter cycle areas, maybe you are taking more inventory down, we just can't see that in the balance sheet. I just wondered if there are any costs you could quantify in terms of under-recovery within, maybe, IA, Osram, or maybe DT? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Simon. That's a series of, I think, very good questions. And this is also, of course, an activity that we are trying to find answers for in the company and there's been intense discussions on where will the bottom be in Industrial Automation, in DT, and how long is it going to take until we see signs of recovery? We are further ahead in Industrial Automation, as in DT. So, for DT I would not, let's say, call a stabilization, or a bottom finding yet. We will see further declines at less acceleration, but further declines in the quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Industrial Automation feels, from what we discussed and from what we see in especially the distribution area, there could be some signs of bottoming out. But the jury is still out on this one because the end markets are what eventually count, and they are still reasonably weak. On I think the &#x2013; one of the single most important areas we are looking at this point in time is Oil and Gas because in that Oil and Gas division, besides the typical product spectrum of upstream equipment, predominantly upstream equipment, we also do have some Process Industry related businesses there.</p>
          <p>And we have seen pockets of weakness in Process Automation actually accelerating, so that's an area we are reasonably cautious at, and have a closer look on what that will mean going forward. By the same token, what we see is that the Energy area on Renewables and Fossil still do have extremely rich order funnels, which are actually encouraging. So, a pretty mixed basket, we do see some weaknesses in the substation larger projects on Distribution and Transmission for quite some time. So, there are several areas of opportunities and also, risks, which we are very closely managing over time, actually every month.</p>
          <p>So Industrial Automation probably close to the bottom, DT will see &#x2013; will see further declines. Just have to say that, and this will also eventually translate into some weakness in the margin. Energy continues to be reasonably robust, and as we said, in Healthcare, we are making good progress in a competitive and difficult environment. That's probably as quickly as the guidance can be on the order intake.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mariel. Overall, our results show strong relative performance in the quarter, with an excellent contribution from the Energy sector and an impressive overall performance in the Healthcare sector, despite a very challenging environment. We're driving the business hard and we have an intense focus on how we execute against our TAP agenda. We have a clear strategy. We are well prepared and there's no question that today Siemens is a better, leaner and more focused company.</p>
          <p>You can clearly see that we are also making good progress to lower our cost base. We have an excellent backlog, and even though the market is volatile, we are ready. And as we go through this downturn, we are at the same time, also investing in our future growth, with an innovation pipeline that has never been stronger. And with that, let me say thank you for your time and good morning, and I wish all of you also happy holidays during August. Thanks a lot, and talk to you soon.</p>
