        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Steve and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2012 Anadarko Earnings Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to John Colglazier, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today for Anadarko's third-quarter conference call. I'll remind you that today's presentation contains certain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. So we encourage you to read our full disclosure and GAAP reconciliations outlined on our website and included in last night's earnings release. Also on our website, we provided a comprehensive summary of our global activities in our quarterly operations report.</p>
          <p>Our executive leadership is here today and ready to answer your questions later in the call. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al Walker, our President and CEO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good morning. We're mindful this is a difficult morning for many of you in the Northeastern U.S., given the impact of Hurricane Sandy. The safety and well-being of you and your family certainly in our thoughts today, and we thank you for taking the time this morning to join us.</p>
          <p>Apart from the unfortunate weather-related event, it's a pleasure to discuss our quarterly results this morning. And during the third quarter, we continued to meet or surpass our near-term goals, while delivering strong operating and financial results, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies, reduce controllable costs on a per-unit basis and, where we can, deliver exceptional <mark type="ph" /> portfolio effect (2:03) with our capital allocations.</p>
          <p>Highlights for the quarter include, record liquid volume <mark type="inaudible" /> (2:10). In the third quarter, we achieved sales volumes growth about 80,000 barrels of equivalent a day, representing a 12% increase over the comparable quarter of 2011. Included in this growth was an increase of 41,000 barrels per day of higher-margin liquid sales, resulting in a record 222,000 barrels of daily liquid volumes during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We continued to generate free cash flow during the quarter, and when you include the $501 million collected from the Algerian tax resolution, our adjusted free cash flow totaled $516 million. As a result of the strong cash generated year-to-date, we've definitely strengthened the balance sheet by reducing borrowings under our revolving credit facility by $1.5 billion and retaining $2.5 billion of cash on hand and improving our net-debt-to-cap ratio to 36%.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we want to highlight the value-enhancing results at two of our largest projects. First, in the Wattenberg Horizontal Program we increased our estimated recoverable resources in four of the fields to a range of 1 million BOE to 1.5 million BOE. This increase resulted from the exceptional performance from both the Niobrara and the Codell formations coupled with identified down-spacing opportunities. Our focus on maximizing the performance and the value of the asset has led to a very positive early result for the drilling of longer laterals in the fields.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, the Wattenberg Horizontal Program continued to deliver record sales volumes and rates of return in excess of 100%. As a result, we increased sales volume in the field by 23% year-over-year, averaging 91,300 BOE per day despite incurring unexpected shut-ins due to third-party export construction. Our large and growing infrastructure here in the midstream positions us to be in a very competitive opportunity in the future to be able to do things that others can't.  We have undertaken additional investments to support our future growth in the field through equity positions in the Front Range and Texas Express Pipeline and the construction of the Lancaster plant.</p>
          <p>The second area of material success was at Mozambique. Here, we had significant increases in our estimated recoverable resources due to the positive results at Golfinho and Atum. We recently completed a four-well appraisal drilling program at Golfinho and Atum, and the successful results enabled us to increase the estimated resources to a range of 15 Tcf to 35 Tcf of recoverable natural gas, located entirely on our operated offshore Area 1 Block.</p>
          <p>Now, we've begun to integrate well testing at this complex and hope to have results from the first flow test at Golfinho 2 in the very near future. We completed our final well testing in the adjacent Prosperidade complex with a testing of three zones instead of two. Each of the three zones flowed at facility-constrained rates of around 100 million cubic feet per day, <mark type="ph" /> incurring the (5:50) tremendous sand quality, deliverability and connectivity of these wells.</p>
          <p>As I stated in yesterday's release, in the coming weeks we expect to announce our FEED contractors for the first of two trains with liquefaction development while planning for future expansions with as many as 10 trains capable of producing 50 million tons of LNG per annum. To put some context around that, this project alone has the potential to transform Mozambique from having no LNG today to becoming the world's third-largest exporter behind Australia and Qatar.</p>
          <p>Overall, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our portfolio. Our employees have continued to focus and execute safely upon our objectives, and we've delivered another strong quarter of results year-to-date. As a result, we are increasing our quarterly sales volumes guidance by 3 million BOE with no corresponding increase to our capital program.</p>
          <p>At the midpoint, this new range represents 7% volume growth this year, which is consistent with our long-range plans as you've seen we have targeted per annum. And we continue to be on track to deliver objectives we established a few years ago for year-end 2014 despite a very challenging North American natural gas price environment.</p>
          <p>With that, we look forward to taking your questions. And, operator, we turn it back to you. Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At Jubilee, it looks like production for the quarter has turned out pretty well. Can you guys just provide some context in terms of where you are at from a remediation standpoint and then how 2013 looks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we'll be happy to do it. I'm going to let Doug Lawler, who's our Senior Vice President for International and Deepwater Operations, handle that. But you're right, the results there are very encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al. We're really pleased with the performance of the acid stimulations that we pumped. To-date, we have pumped five acid jobs which have significantly increased our production. We've seen a record production rate there at Jubilee in the 86,000 barrels per day to 88,000 barrels per day range on a gross basis.</p>
          <p>We look forward to pumping a few more acid jobs in the near future. One is planned for the fourth quarter. And we also look forward to the Phase IA wells. Initial production there from the first few wells is also scheduled for the fourth quarter. And we anticipate that we'll continue to monitor the performance of the wells, and should the acid jobs which have proven to be successful be required, we will continue to implement and execute those in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any sense of where are expectations right now for 2013 production just for Jubilee?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't provided that guidance as of yet. I just will reiterate that we're very pleased with the performance and anticipate that these new wells from Phase 1A and the continued good performance for the acid jobs will result in really strong rates from Jubilee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, this is Al. I think we will probably defer to the operator, Tullow, on expectations of that sort. So if I were you, I would encourage to sort of looking to Tullow for that answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We will, thank you. On the Niobrara, you guys are increasing the resource range, talking about good performance out of both the Niobrara and Codell. Could you break out maybe some of the Niobrara lobes and talk about what you've done to test the different intervals there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we can talk about that. I am going to have Chuck Meloy, who handles onshore E&amp;P, do that. But I think you will find that we don't really do anything different in any particular zone, but I am going to let Chuck go into a little more detail there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, first I think the big news there, Wattenberg, is the production continues to climb. I don't know if you had the opportunity to look in the operating report to see the tremendous growth rate that we're realizing at Wattenberg.</p>
          <p>The zones that were producing there are both the Niobrara and the Codell. About two-thirds to three-quarters of the wells currently are Niobrara and the balance are Codell.</p>
          <p>We have been testing both the B&amp;C bench generally in the Niobrara and having outstanding results in both, and we continue to look at various ways to cut across the different zones and stimulate them to continue to increase production EUR from each well.</p>
          <p>We're going to see continued growth. We have 10 rigs running now, and the production profile is just &#x2013; is essentially straight up. And its really exciting. As we crossed over 90,000 barrels a day for the field. And we'll see that continue to climb towards the end of the year, and we should approach 100,000 barrels a day for the field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons &amp; Co. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on the Niobrara, in your ops report, you talked about down-spacing potential. If you guys could give us maybe some more color in terms of total locations or what kind of down-spacing pilots you're planning on doing, that would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Dave. This is Chuck again. We are going to a number of experiments in the various areas of the field to decide how many wells ultimately we put in each section. We are going to test up to 16 wells per section from the &#x2013; in total, including the Codell and Niobrara benches. And from that data, we will evaluate even further down-spacing if it demonstrates that it is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>We have just seen outstanding performance in these wells. And our EURs are continuing to come in over 350,000 barrels. The other thing we've done that I think has a lot of opportunity for us is we are evaluating the various lateral links. And so hopefully, we can extend the lateral links out so that ultimately there's fewer wells, and we drill more section in the pay, as a percent of the wells. So we get more exposure to reserves for fewer wells.</p>
          <p>All that's going on right now. We won't really know the answer for that for some time. But the experimentation has taken place. And like I said, we are up to around &#x2013; we are evaluating 16 wells per section. I know others in the field are continuing to increase that count, and there's discussion even doubling that. So there's just a ton of opportunity. The system is working extremely well. Our completions teams are doing a fantastic job getting <mark type="ph" /> the frac salt (13:17) and our drilling guys continue to lower the cost per well each quarter, and we couldn't be happier with how things are going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I appreciate that. And then, in the past you'd mentioned about selling potentially some of your fringe positions around the Niobrara. Is that something that's still on the table or have the results have been so impressive that you want to keep everything you've got in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure you're aware that we have a large position in the Land Grant and it cuts right through Wattenberg. And so we're constantly doing small farm-outs and farm-downs in the area to attract industry dollars and leverage our surrounding position.</p>
          <p>And I think we'll continue to do that, both south and north of the field. And that's just an ongoing process. It's just to help expand our capital exposure and get us a few more looks without any more money. We're really focusing right in the gut of Wattenberg today, where our results have been outstanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I might ask Bob Gwin, if I could. Just I think your question may be more directed at the JV. If it is, maybe we can address that. If not, if Chuck handled you correctly with your concerns, in terms of how we're looking at the land itself, that's great. But if you are interested in a little more of the joint venture discussions or evolution, we can address that, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add to what Chuck said is that we're no longer looking at a traditional or a JV in the central part or the core part of the Wattenberg field. We're focusing on our own capital dollars in the field, on maximizing the benefit of the infrastructure and takeaway capacity, the processing capacity we've put in place over the last year. And we'll look to, as Chuck mentioned, more traditional monetization vehicles outside of the core Wattenberg &#x2013; primarily to the south, and also some to the north.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very helpful. One last just maybe big corporate one, and you may not be able to answer it at this point, because it's too early. But any kind of early indications towards how to think about 2013 CapEx? Again trying to live within cash flow? Any color you can give us would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm going to have Bob again address that one. We do have some early thoughts, and I think as you've seen in the last several years, we've been pretty efficient with our allocation of capital, and you can anticipate that will be the case again in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have any specific numbers to share at this point. We're going to be announcing those in February, following the request and receipt of approval in February from our board. We look probably somewhere around February the 25th, 26th to have some dialog with investors.</p>
          <p>That said, we expect to still spend within cash flow, as we have for the last several years running. We would expect a modest increase in spending year-over-year. And that's driven by continued improvements in production and increases in cash flow year-over-year next year in our base-case model.</p>
          <p>But we look forward to sharing with you greater detail in the future. I think you could look for it as more of the same, but expansion of the various programs that are doing so well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Really appreciate all the color, guys. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, fellows. I got a couple of quick ones, if I may. First of all, the FEED on Mozambique, can you just give us an update on any thoughts on how you might go forward with the project, in terms of your ownership? I guess we've been kind of anticipating that maybe you would take a similar route to Lucius before FEED was actually in place. So can you maybe give us &#x2013; any information you can share now would be appreciated, and I have got a couple of follow-ups please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you bet, Doug. And I promise you we're going to have the operator pronouncing your last name correctly next meeting. I bet you never get that. But to your question, yeah, I think we've been reasonably consistent in saying between here and FID, we certainly will take a hard look at selling down some of the 36.5% position that we have. The optimal time for that is really a function of market activity. We, as you might expect, get a lot of inbound interest. We are continuing to assess that when the timing is best for us.</p>
          <p>And I would tell you that nothing really has changed on that front. The timing of it really is the function of when we see the right terms and conditions and consideration being established with people who are quite keen to get into this part of the world &#x2013; that in some cases, if not all, are very active in the LNG markets.</p>
          <p>So I think what we have here and what the country has is unique opportunity, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, to see a situation which is very unusual, where a country today has no LNG and some time in the very near future will be the third largest exporter in the world.</p>
          <p>So, I'm going to let Doug Lawler answer the question related to FEED, but I think you should, as we've said before, continue to expect that at some point between here and FID there is a good chance that we will sell down some of the 36.5% interest that we have today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Al. We're working very closely, Doug, with the government of Mozambique, and we anticipate that the onshore and the offshore feed will be awarded imminently. We are nearing a final agreement on the land on which the LNG liquefaction facility will be constructed, and so you can expect that FEED to be awarded for both the onshore and offshore very soon.</p>
          <p>And we look forward to, as Al mentioned, with continued cooperation with the government as we move forward there, that we'll continue to progress towards FID, as we've stated before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great stuff. Thanks. I'm not going to take the zinger on the name. We'll deal with that one later.</p>
          <p>But my follow-up is really &#x2013; is kind of a two-tier question, and it's a tough one to answer, I realize. But we had gas prices up I guess 75% from the low, early this year. You are still fairly gas-levered, you've got a Tronox uncertainty that &#x2013; I guess any update you could share there would be appreciated, but I'm guessing you can't say much.</p>
          <p>But the bottom line is you've got a share price which has continued to struggle. And I am just wondering &#x2013; I know we've gone backwards and forwards on this for a bit, but at what point do you lose patience with that? And just give me your thoughts as to how you feel about the terrific operational progress but the failure for that to materialize in the stock? And I'll leave at that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, those are very fair comments as well as observations and questions. So I'm not surprised. You're reflecting some things that I know a lot of people feel and think about.</p>
          <p>I'm going to let Bobby address the Tronox part of your question. What I will tell you is that, yeah, we're as frustrated as anybody that the operating success of this company now, for quite a number of years, if we're not at the top of the list, we're certainly in an industry-leading with our operating results and our exploration success.</p>
          <p>We did a see a period of time there between the resolution with EP and before Tronox became a media event in January, where the share price did quite well. So, we have reasons to look back in the very recent memory of knowing exactly that there is a share price out there that the markets embraced previously. And consequently I think that the executive management here as well as the employees believe that, once we get Tronox in the rear view mirror, the market's shown us in the past what they think the value could be, if not more than that.</p>
          <p>So I guess our reaction is it's frustrating to be where we are, given the kind of operating results we've had, and we're just going to have to be very patient with the process that we don't have a lot of control over, in terms of the timing of when this court process comes to conclusion and a judgment comes to the bench.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me let Bobby address the churn offs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Al. Good morning, Doug. If you have &#x2013; I think it's worth taking a looking again at the 10-Q that was filed yesterday and the extensive disclosure we've provided to shareholders about the Tronox dispute. We're still very confident in our case. We still believe a loss is not probable.</p>
          <p>We were pleased with the testimony through the end of the trial in September. We're gearing up now for closing briefs and closing arguments before Judge Gropper in the second week of December. It would be speculation on my part to tell you when we might get a ruling from the Judge, but it could take some time. There's thousands and thousands of pages of written testimony and lots of witnesses over the summer, and we want him to do a good job and provide correct reasons for ruling and findings of fact.</p>
          <p>Still believe the merits of our case are sound &#x2013; that we don't believe KerrMcGee had anything to do with the financial struggles or bankruptcy of Tronox, and that Tronox in fact was properly capitalized at the time of its spin-off and IPO.</p>
          <p>So with that, I think that there's no news in that, but we still remain confident in our position.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. In looking at your guidance, it looks like the oil production was cut a little bit, and gas came up a little bit, as well. Is that very similar to what we saw last quarter, in terms of where you're seeing from some of your non-operators in places like the Marcellus, where they are drilling a little bit more and may be some infrastructure constraints on the edges cutting back on the oil a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me try to bifurcate that if I can. Certainly on the gas side, the volumes that you are seeing and others for us year-to-date are largely through non-operated positions in the Marcellus.</p>
          <p>We've been surprised by just how productive Chesapeake's been. We see them doing things frankly that are well outside of what we anticipated, as we budgeted for what our non-op volumes would be for the year. So it's fairly isolated to that. And I'm going to let Chuck, if I can, go into a little more detail there as well as talk about the oil.</p>
          <p>But we're surprised. I can't say it any other way. It's just higher volumes coming out of the Marcellus than we had anticipated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, the only thing I would add to what Al's commented on the gas is that the Marcellus results really speak to the quality of that resource and the high productivity of those wells in our core areas, which encompasses both Chesapeake-operated and our company-operated AMIs. And it's just a fantastic resource and we produce at very low cost.</p>
          <p>So we're excited about the results there. It is a bit of a surprise, just the magnitude of them,  because we are now producing almost 1.3 BCF a day out of that area from a standing start back in 2008 or 2009. So, it's done extremely well.</p>
          <p>On the oil side, we continue to grow. You've seen the increases year-over-year. And the thing that we continue to run against is that, despite our efforts to keep up with the ever-expanding oil and liquids production in our operated areas, particularly in Wattenberg and Maverick, where you've seen a lot of growth just quarter-to-quarter &#x2013; I mean I think we're up about 8,000 barrels just quarter-to-quarter &#x2013; as we sell that, we've seen constraints. And it's not always on the oil side, but it has impact on oil.</p>
          <p>For instance, in Wattenberg, the Overland Pass NGL line that goes into Conway is being retrofitted for expansion, and there has been a number of shutdowns that costs us almost 0.5 million barrels of production in Wattenberg just this year.</p>
          <p>So the capacity of our production is right on our expectations and we're generally very efficient getting it out, but occasionally we see these impacts like Overland Pass &#x2013; and even down in the Maverick with either gas or natural gas liquid production constraints &#x2013; downstream of our field. And we continue to work those. I think this is part of the growing pains we talked about several quarters ago. These things are growing so rapidly, nobody anticipated this &#x2013; where you can't react as quick as we can grow it.</p>
          <p>So we've seen just such tremendous results. And that's bumping up against all the natural constraints, all of which are under expansion. And I think that's the great news, as Wattenberg clears 100,000 barrels a day and the Maverick clears 100,000 barrels a day gross, it takes a lot of work to get that product to market.</p>
          <p>And I think we're proactive in getting it done. We've got lot of expansions that are under way, and as does the industry, that will help us move product. And we'll see interruptions from time to time, and I anticipate seeing some more in the fourth quarter and maybe even into early next year. But it's just indicative of the rapid expansion of the production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean that all makes sense. And then, when you look at some of your operated stuff that has associated gas &#x2013; I'll pick out a couple plays like the Avalon Shale in the Permian, the East Texas liquids-rich play. Are those coming out as expected with the liquids cuts you all want to see?</p>
          <p>And as a point of context, on the East Texas, your data shows that you've been running somewhere around 25% to 30% liquids. And I think when you kind of laid the play out in your Analyst Day earlier this year, you were talking about 35-plus percent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The expansion on the liquids, if you just want to talk about the Carthage Haynesville in particular, we've grown the liquids production year-over-date of almost 37%. So it's running up the curve.</p>
          <p>We've reallocated investment around the portfolio and taken activity out of that area, and put it in the more oil-prone areas that we've ramped up rig count in Wattenberg and Maverick. We've seen outstanding results. We had one rig line that we were drilling in &#x2013; that was little lean in Carthage. But we moved away from that area and got right back into what we wanted to do.</p>
          <p>So I don't see any indication that we ought to change our direction. We've had outstanding results. We've got great economics and low costs of operations, and the liquid yields are sufficient to deliver good economics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could do just one last one. Obviously we've talked about gas prices now moving up quite a bit, and you indicated your returns in the Marcellus are very robust, or at least your performance has been robust.</p>
          <p>At what point in time &#x2013; at what price do you guys start to think about whether or not you need to slide a couple of rigs back in the Marcellus? What is that breakpoint relative to competing for capital against other plays in your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Scott, that's a question you might imagine we get asked a lot. And certainly the place that's going to see capital from us first is a dry gas place, Marcellus. And so I'm going to let Chuck address the Marcellus.</p>
          <p>But I tell you, beyond the Marcellus, as just a general comment, I think we need to see a sustained $5 gas before you see us commit a lot of capital back into the gas portion of our portfolio. And that's really driven by getting the kind of rate of return, first off, that we want to see. And second, a portfolio that frankly from a competitive perspective has a lot of other places that can get return without having to chase dry gas that has a lot of volatility around price discovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, specifically with relation to the Marcellus, you see really good returns anything north of $4.</p>
          <p>And the thing we're dealing with up there, as you would imagine, is the same kind of things we're dealing in lot of these areas, where we're trying to schedule our rig activity with the capability to export our product.</p>
          <p>And so it's not only gas price that drives our activity, it's all the other ancillaries that go along with that. But if it was only on price, I'd suggest that around the $4 mark, maybe a little north of that, you'd see rigs pick up and start moving. But that's just speculation of my part. I don't know how others would view that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, thanks. We've got three wells going up in the Shenandoah mini basin. We've got our operated Shenandoah Well and then Coronado and Yucatan.</p>
          <p>They're all kind of about the same place. They have got ways to go. I would say that probably the end of the year, at the earliest, we'd expect to have something out on those, because they do have quite a bit of hole to drill. These are deep wells, 32,000 feet, 33,000 feet below salt. Sub-salt wells. But they're going to take some time.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, you mentioned Phobos. That will be drilled &#x2013; probably spud towards the end of the year. And we've also got another one called Raptor out in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, that we hope to spud by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So quite a bit of more activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and we got a ways to go on the wells we are drilling right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, we got one well in the Paon discovery well right now, so we have to figure out how big that is. It has the potential to be a significant discovery. We will be appraising it next year. We also plan another exploration well on that block at the same time, so we'll have a two-well drilling campaign that we're working through the system. As to the exact timing of when that will happen, I don't know when that rig will arrive and start that activity.</p>
          <p>But we do see a good potential there. It's just to the west of the Jubilee area, and the Paon discovery looks like it has some potential to be significant for us. So we will test it. And beyond that we're going to be moving up into Liberia again on Block 10 where we anticipate drilling a well up there, and then potentially going back into Sierra Leone and drilling an appraisal well to one of the discoveries that we have up there.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on a couple of the earlier questions. In the Marcellus, in your modestly higher year-on-year total company CapEx plan, should we expect that Marcellus rig count will increase? And can you talk broadly about the strategic importance of the Marcellus position in the portfolio, given the competition that it has, even with its high return relative to other dry gas plays, with the competition for capital from some of the liquids-rich opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And that's a very understandable question, and we'll go back to Mr. Meloy for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brian. So we haven't concluded what our 2013 plan looks like today. So this is just really speculation, if you want to look at it like that. Right now, I don't really anticipate seeing a large rig ramp-up in the Marcellus. We have a very robust program in our liquids-rich plays around the country in Wattenberg, in the Eagle Ford, and out in West Texas in Carthage, and those continue to attract capital because of the higher returns as we sit here today.</p>
          <p>If prices were to rise significantly on the gas side, I would think that you might see a shift in that, but not a substantial shift. I think we're pretty much locked into what we have there. We're planning expansions on the export markets. Those take place in 2013 and beyond. And so we'll continue to feed in capital where we can get good returns. And like I said earlier, it's not just price, it's also capacity to move the product. And that all starts coming together in late 2013 and 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess from a strategic perspective, particularly with regards to some of your non-operated acreage, do you see opportunities from monetization in the Marcellus? Or do you think that ultimately you will commit capital to that play in an investable time horizon that you think will be returns-accretive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, this is Al. I am going to answer a part of that and ask Bob Gwin to answer part of it.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the Marcellus, we see that I think the way industry does &#x2013; as one of the leading onshore gas plays we have in this country. Consequently, today, with gas prices being where they are, we are not really an interested seller. And I'm sure you are not going to be surprised by the comment that there is probably not a deep market at good price discovery with buyers.</p>
          <p>So I don't see it really being something today that we are motivated to monetize. I'm going to let Bob talk a little bit more about how the market is for that, but I think in our mind today, we see it as a maintenance mode &#x2013; how we are developing the play, how we are allocating capital to it.</p>
          <p>As both Chuck and I said earlier, it is a play that doesn't require the same threshold for price to have even better rates of return, in a portfolio that's as deep as ours. So in the near term, it does get a chance to feed on capital a little bit sooner, but I think strategically we see both the op and the non-op in the Marcellus being a hold position for us. Maybe there is a day when the market gives us a reason to look at it a little differently from a monetization.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me segue to Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I'd add there is that as you might expect, we looked at across our portfolio for monetization opportunities or ways that we might see disconnect between its value to us within our portfolio and its potential value to others in the market.</p>
          <p>But we've spent a lot of time looking at Marcellus, given its dry gas. And to Al's point, it's one that you hang on to. That's one of the best gas resources in North America. It's going to be one of the most attractive assets at almost any gas price in North America. And we've got a very significant and attractive position there. So I think that's one of the ones that's core asset going forward, regardless of the gas price environment.</p>
          <p>That said, how much capital it's going to attract over time, how many rigs you'll move into the area over time is going to depend upon the rates return available on the marginal rig compared to other places in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And then, lastly in Mozambique, how should we think about ENI's role as a competitor or partner with Anadarko in the LNG and LNG development?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would put them more in the partner category. We don't see them as a competitor. We've had very good discussions with ENI. I'm optimistic that we're going to find ourselves on agreement on some pre-unitization terms and conditions that will lead to a more near-term discussion with the government of that unitization in general.</p>
          <p>So I've been very encouraged with the way in which our discussions with ENI have gone. I participated in some of those and don't see them as a competitor. In fact, anything but. I think we are today much more aligned, and I think our ability to &#x2013; hopefully in the very near term &#x2013; have some additional discussions jointly with the government are pretty likely.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had a couple of quick questions. Going back to the Wattenberg, is there &#x2013; with respect to the resource range being moved up, is there any contribution from EUR increase for a given size lateral? Or is this more about more zones and tighter density in those zones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We drove this primarily by just the confidence in the results that we've seen. We've seen just outstanding results. We're leaving our per-well results around 350,000 per well for about a 5,000-foot lateral.</p>
          <p>And what we've seen in our testing program as our laterals extend, you see a proportional increase in EUR. And so we're continuing this experimentation with that, making sure that we've got good economics and we're not taking incrementally larger mechanical risk by doing that. But the early returns look good and we'll continue to test that theory.</p>
          <p>And I think the other operators in the area are seeing similar results with regard to better EURs with longer laterals, and it makes common sense. So right now we're just &#x2013; we're planning on the 5,000-footers, but those could creep up with time, and EURs would do likewise.</p>

And I think with LOE, we've seen that over time. I mean, we always think that we had kind of found ourselves in the position of being as efficient as we can, and then our drillers do certain things or our field personnel do certain things or Chuck and his guys do certain things. We have a lot of people who have done a lot of things to make this happen.</p>
          <p>But Chuck is pretty good at how to squeeze a little more juice and my guess is there may be a little more juice there. But he's done an awfully good job year to date, as well as if you go back several years, when we put Kerr-McGee and Anadarko and Western Gas together. The success we've had in taking cost out of our system, particularly LOE, I give Chuck a lot of credit for that. So with that, don't bet with him on the first tee.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take your question on this. We've had a lot of success driving down cost, and I think it's quite a tribute to our field organizations and their creativity. What we're doing, of course, is using all the tools that are available to us right now, which inclusive of automation and surveillance tools in the field, it's reduced the need for men to run back and forth to wells all day long. And so we're driving fewer miles, we're maintaining our production better because we can see it on a real-time basis and we can improve the up-time as we move along.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's helped us immensely is the success that we've had at the Marcellus and Wattenberg and Maverick and these other horizontal plays, which are mostly flowing wells. So our lifting costs are low. We've been able to &#x2013; as the mix has changed and we get more and more horizontal flowing wells, it's helped us drive it down.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, if you look at the company perspective, we haven't had any significant deepwater workovers in a while. And those are big movers in our OpEx. So the combination of incremental flowing wells, good performance by our field organization, operating organizations, really working to push cost down safely and using all the available tools and technologies, as well as the mechanical integrity and capability of our offshore fleet &#x2013; offshore wells &#x2013; to not require workovers has been a great combination. And as our volumes grow, our denominator gets bigger and that's helped it as well.</p>
          <p>So it's the perfect storm right now. Everything is working in our favor and I'm really encouraged by the way the organization is performing and the assets are performing. And I think that &#x2013; I don't see a huge move down, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see it float down from some quarters, particularly when we don't have major workover activities.</p>

          <p>Thanks. That's great detail and exactly what I was after. And then the one last quick hit. I think at one point you guys were talking about a test at Deep Nansen in 2012. Has that kind of been pushed into 2013?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, guys. Quick question for you. I wanted to get back to the Gulf of Mexico as well. You had a nice appraisal well at Vito last quarter. Just curious if you could provide some color as to how things are progressing and how you expect to bring those volumes to the market? What kind of timeframe potentially could we be looking at for that, what looks to be now like a Lucius-size volume base that you have there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I could, I'm going to let both Bob Daniels from an exploration standpoint and Doug Lawler from an operations development perspective address your question. Because there's elements that both need to touch on, if I could. Bob, why don't you start?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Eliot, on the Vito appraisal, we've had real good success out there. It is a nice field. It's good thick sands, very continuous. We've got the structure fairly well pinned down. We've got one more well that's going to be an appraisal well to just prove up the rest of the volumes. But it's been a real good success for us and we've pretty much handed that off to the development team now. They're working with the operator on the development plans. So, I'll let Doug talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Bob. Just to echo Bob's comments, we are encouraged about Vito. It stacks in the line of the continued project and portfolio success that we've had in the Gulf of Mexico. Because of where it sits at present and the timing, we probably are looking at several years out before we see first production. But the size of it definitely is a commercial resource, and we're very, very encouraged by it, following the success of Heidelberg and Lucius. Just a really, really good run of good oil opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico as we continue to get back to work there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. I appreciate it. And kudos to the operator for getting my last name right. I just want to at least give him credit for that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Ross Payne from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Al, can you talk about your general strategy surrounding hedges and where you are for 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet. I'm going to give you a few comments and then I'm going to have our VP of global marketing, Scott Moore, give you a little more detail. Philosophically, if you're not familiar, though my guess is you probably are, we look at hedging to help us give the cash flow statement a little price insurance. It's really done to ensure balance sheet integrity and to not have big price swings move around on us. Because a lot of our capital spending, when we go into a year, we can move if we need to into different places. And certain of what we do, certainly from an exploration standpoint, we're not looking into the next 12 months to 24 months with what we think prices are going to be.</p>
          <p>So we don't really want to get in a situation where prices move away from us and we didn't have enough price insurance with our cash flow statement to ensure good balance sheet integrity. So what we try to do is we try to take a fairly measured point with both gas and oil, and try to give ourselves some safety nets, if prices do things that we don't anticipate, so that we don't put that pressure on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now, specifically, you've seen us in the past use three ways more often than not. We have started using more swaps, and I think you will continue to see us do some of that. We've actually done a little of that this year.</p>
          <p>And rather than taking all of the thunder away, I'm going to have Scott walk you through what we've done and what we're looking at doing and why.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to add to Al's comments on the strategic nature of our hedging, we have added in this quarter to our current natural gas position for next year a modest increase on our fixed price swaps, as well as we initiated a Brent crude oil hedging program, both in three ways adding 26,000 barrels a day in three ways and 34,000 barrels a day of Brent fixed price swaps to that program. And we continue to evaluate the forward markets relative to these types of structures for opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you speak to what percentage of your natural gas and oil is currently hedged for 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2012 or for 2013, Ross?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>2013. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in round numbers, we are approaching a quarter of our crude oil production hedged and not quite half for natural gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our current view today, Ross, is if we can get the kind of price thresholds that we are looking for, I wouldn't be surprised to see us end up at about 50/50 with hedged volumes or use of a variety of derivatives versus an unhedged position. And if we can see that, we're not concerned that we're taking the top off of it and kind of like the price insurance for the reasons I mentioned that it buys us.</p>

      <speaker id="2">

          <p>Okay. Well, thank you. I want to reiterate what I said earlier today. I know a lot of you that are on the phone and some that aren't are going through a very difficult week. Our thoughts are with you. We wish you well as you move through this, both professionally and personally. We hope you and your families are safe. And I will extend, if there is anything we can do, please let us know. We know this is a tragic event. It's got a lot of things still to go before probably the market opens again.</p>
          <p>So your thoughts &#x2013; our thoughts, rather, are in the forefront of what we're trying to do this week. We're still trying to run a company, but we know a lot of you are going through some pretty difficult situations, so best wishes with that.</p>
          <p>And, operator, thank you. And we'll look forward to seeing everybody in another quarter.</p>
