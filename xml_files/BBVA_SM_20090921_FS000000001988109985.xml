          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Vanessa , and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BBVA Compass U.S. Regional Watch Third Quarter 2009 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you. I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Bilek. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thank you, operator. Thank you for joining us for the BBVA Compass U.S. Regional Watch conference call and webcast. We would also like to extend a warm welcome to our new clients joining us from our recently completed acquisition of Guaranty Bank. Today, we come to you from the Leeds School of Business on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder.</p>
          <p>The format of today's call will include a short presentation by Nathaniel Karp, BBVA Compass Chief Economist. Following his presentation, Nathaniel and Dr. Richard Wobbekind, Associate Dean, Leeds School of Business, as well as Gary Horvath, from the Leeds School of Business will be available to answer questions.</p>
          <p>A copy of the U.S. Regional Watch and today's presentation can be found on our website at www.bbvacompass.com. We have a link on the site labeled BBVA Compass U.S. Regional Watch, and if you click on that link, you'll be able to get to the presentation as well as U.S. Regional Watch.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's conference call is being taped. A replay of the conference call will be made available shortly following the call for two weeks. The replay can be accessed using the information contained in our press release that was issued last Friday. The webcast replay will also be available on our website for two weeks as well.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the presentation over to George Boltwood, Vice Chairman and Head of Corporate Banking at BBVA Compass.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Ed. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to the BBVA Compass clients and our new clients from Guaranty Bank, our city Board members, members of the media, both international and U.S. and other guests who have joined us on the call today.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased that as we expand the products and services that BBVA Compass offers its clients that we are able to provide tools like the U.S. Regional Watch to help businessmen and businesswomen. In fact, to my knowledge, we are the only bank in the United States providing its clients a quarterly economic publication in order to help them navigate this challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>The report, which is compiled by the BBVA Compass Economic Research Department, offers in-depth data and commentary on economic factors and trends impacting the United States and specifically the BBVA Compass Sunbelt Region, which includes Texas, Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and now California. Obviously, we read that &#x2013; there is an awful lot of information about the U.S. economy that's out there. However, I think it's important to highlight that individual regions within the U.S., and for that matter, each state individually is a separate piece to an economic puzzle. Individual states or regions of the country are impacted differently &#x2013; sometimes more, sometimes not at all by national issues. In fact, according to the U.S. Regional Watch, the Sunbelt Region continues to outperform the U.S. economy as a whole, led by Texas.</p>
          <p>At BBVA Compass, we firmly believe that our success, as well as those of our customers and the communities that we serve, are inextricably linked. The U.S. Regional Watch is one of the ways we are taking the initiative to share information that can lead to the kind of thoughtful, intelligent decisions that will fuel our mutual success.</p>
          <p>In this quarter's issue, we offer analysis through the fourth quarter of 2008 and provide a closer look at key issues that are impacting economies across the U.S., and in particular, in the Sunbelt Region, while presenting the data in a manner that outlines specific local, regional and national implications. Also included in the publication are industry-specific economic reports for commercial real estate, energy and healthcare.</p>
          <p>In providing both a focused and broad-scope breakdown of information, readers can find a state-by-state economic growth report that compares short-term pressures to long-term prospects as well as an analysis of the national oil market post-Hurricane Ike. As the economic environment continues to post challenges for all of us marked by uncertainties across the United States and abroad, a strong financial foundation has become more important than ever for consumers and business owners alike. At BBVA Compass, we provide a solid foundation for our customers to help guide them toward financial success and stability. We believe the U.S. Regional Watch provides our customers and communities with information they need to make sound financial decisions.</p>
          <p>Again, thank you for joining us. I'd like to now turn the presentation over to Nathaniel Karp, our Chief Economist in the United States. Nathaniel?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, George. Thank you, everyone, good morning and I'm very happy to have you here and also to the University of Colorado for inviting us and hosting this presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me start with slide number two, where you have the current summary of our forecasts. Basically, the global growth is going to be driven by emerging economies, particularly China and the rest of Asia whereas developed countries will underperform in the current recovery cycle. Within developed countries, the U.S. will outperform Europe for several reasons and we'll see them in greater detail ahead. But, basically, the recovery process that we are forecasting is one of very low growth rates, as consumption will be limited by the increased savings in the deleverage process that households in the U.S. have to adjust to the new financial conditions. In addition to that, with elevated economic slack, the inflationary pressures will remain contained despite the fact that we have this very aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus package, it will take some time for the economy to return to potential growth and therefore inflation will remain low.</p>
          <p>In this environment with a very weak recovery and low inflation, the Federal Reserve will remain cautious in terms of increasing interest rates. Therefore, we continue to anticipate that interest rates will remain low for several more quarters. And at the regional level, the BBVA Compass footprint remains a very strong region within the U.S. and some of the economies within this footprint will certainly remain outperforming other states.</p>
          <p>Let me move to slide number three where you have basically the difference between developed and emerging markets for the next two to three years, and you can see that developed countries will basically return to the pre-crisis levels in terms of GDP growth. So, the net impact will be zero basically, whereas emerging market will increase about 15% in the next two to three years, and this growth is going to be driven basically by Asia. On average, Asia will outperform other emerging markets, particularly China and India and Hong Kong and so on. There is some positive news in South America, with some of the countries like Brazil and Peru, but basically the major risks are in Eastern European countries and this is the region that will probably experience the lost decade and a very deep financial and economic crisis in the short &#x2013; in coming years.</p>
          <p>The main reason for Asia to outperform the rest of the world is basically the transformation of these economies from export led to a higher share of private consumption. Chinese private consumption is one of the lowest in the world and the process of economic recovery will imply a greater share of private consumption. Also, the share of rural to urban population is still very high in these countries and that will also support mid and long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, slide number four where you have the U.S. and the European Union, here, you can see that within &#x2013; comparing these two regions, the U.S. outperforms Europe. One of the reasons is obviously that the U.S. has been more aggressive in terms of the fiscal package but also the U.S. is better positioned to benefit from global growth because the U.S. has higher links with Asia than what Europe has, and with Eastern Europe, the U.S. has lower links than what the European Union has. Therefore, the asymmetries in terms of global growth are going to help the U.S. more than what it's going to help Europe.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think that something very important that we should consider is that the U.S. has been very aggressive in trying to solve the financial crisis and the exposure to toxic assets. And Europe has been lagging the U.S. in this respect. It continues to be very cautious in terms of policies and this will broadly limit growth and particularly the recovery of the financial sector in Europe.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, you can see here the Financial Markets Tensions Indicator that we calculate, and you can see that we've come a long way down from the Lehman crisis, when Lehman collapsed. But we're still relatively high, about two times higher than what we had before the crisis. Therefore, while conditions have stabilized and the recovery has been very positive, we're still averaging higher level than what we had in 2006 and '07, and it's very difficult to imagine that we're going back to a financial environment with such conditions. Therefore, going forward, one of the main elements that we have to consider is that financial markets will not be &#x2013; will not experience the easiness that we had in the pre-crisis levels.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you have on the most recent economic indicators the BBVA Compass Surprise Activity Index and the Weekly Activity Index, you can see that things have really improved over the most recent months and that shows or confirms that the worst of the economic recession is over. The Surprise Activity Index is starting to stabilize, meaning that the incoming data is very similar to what the market is expecting. Therefore, we don't have these sharp negative surprises, but at the same time the economic indicators are starting to come up better than in previous months, suggesting that we're heading towards positive growth in the short time.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows you one of the reasons why this is happening. We have this very aggressive fiscal stimulus package that has increased government outlays to levels that we haven't seen for many, many decades and the fiscal deficit as you know is going to be the highest since the &#x2013; just after the Second World War and this obviously will help to generate some growth going forward. The question or the main risk here is, how sustainable this is and also, for example, in the third quarter, we're expecting a very strong stimulus from the cash for clunkers program, but the question is how can you sustain that over the next few quarters and if that's not possible, the same strength that we have in one particular quarter will be the weakness that we'll have afterwards; therefore, it's very important that the economy starts to generate sustainable sources of growth.</p>
          <p>If we move to the next slide, you can see that things are &#x2013; appeared to start moving in the right direction. Inventory sales and industrial production have reached bottom. They are starting to come back and that's very positive for the labor market, because as soon as production starts to increase, we could have a jump in labor demand. But the most recent data is just beginning to show positive results and therefore, the recovery process is still a very slow-moving process.</p>
          <p>On the housing sector in the next slide, you can see that for the first time in three years, home prices have started to increase. That also supports the idea that the economy has bottomed out and that we're starting to see some &#x2013; an upturn in the housing sector. It doesn't mean that we're going to have a significant contribution from the residential market in terms of construction or job creation, but it does mean that residential wealth has stopped declining. And this is the most important impact, because at the household level, families are not seeing their residential wealth being destroyed as fast as what we had in previous quarters and that's a very important positive element for the recovery of consumption.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you have the National Activity Index that includes several dozens of variables and you can see that it's about to reach zero, meaning that the recession is about to be over. From a technical perspective, the recession might be over anytime soon. But most importantly, the probability of recession has come down to about 20% and that's very important in terms of the double-dip or triple-dip or what &#x2013; all these different scenarios that generate uncertainty in terms of their recovery process. This probability model what suggest is that basically the economy is in a more positive environment and the double-dip &#x2013; probability of a double-dip is relatively low.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, if we move to the following slide, you can see the recovery in the labor market in the current cycle compared to previous cycles and you can see the sharp contraction in the current cycle, even sharper than in 2001-2002 when we had the jobless recovery. So, this generates the biggest uncertainty in terms of how the economy is going to create six to eight million jobs that need to be created just to come back to the pre-crisis levels; on top of that, the annual needs that the economy has. And there are very few sectors in the economy that could do the trick and therefore, the scenario that we are thinking of is of a jobless recovery going forward with very low consumption growth, particularly limited by the jobless recovery.</p>
          <p>In fact, if you turn to the following slide, you can see that personal income has edged down a little bit and even with the stimulus package, what families have done with the additional income is that savings have increased and it's not so much that the fiscal stimulus has translated into higher consumption levels, but rather that the savings rate and families are being more cautious, more defensive going forward, because of the uncertainty of the labor market.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, you have non-residential investment and also, if we compare that to previous recessions, the recovery this time around is extremely weak, because of the global recession, the dramatic fall in our exports and domestic demand, and businesses need to see a significant improvement, before non-residential investment starts to recover. Therefore, if consumption remains weak and non-residential investment remains weak, the pace of recovery is going to be significantly lower than in previous recessions.</p>
          <p>In the following slide, you have in addition to the consumption and non-residential investment, the problems that we are seeing in the commercial real estate market. Vacancy rates are going up. Obviously, this lowers the returns on commercial properties and charge-offs increased, because problems are obviously at the local level, where some of the smaller banks, but this also generates some problems for the economy going forward. The size of the problem is nowhere near what we had in the residential market, but nonetheless, it generates uncertainty, particularly in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you have the GDP forecast for the next years. You can see the strong rebound in the current quarter, because of this increase in durable goods consumption. But as we move towards 2010, 2011 and beyond, you can see that our scenario calls for lower potential GDP growth, because of lower productivity growth and lower capital to the output ratio and that's driven by the dramatic adjustment in the domestic side of the economy, particularly the non-residential investment.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see that in this environment, where excess capacity is relatively high and labor costs remain pretty thin, the pressures to inflation are relatively low. In the next slide, you have inflation expectations. The long-term inflation expectations are very stable. Our Leading Inflation Index or Core Inflation has come down significantly. It's starting to pick up, but nonetheless this calls for very low levels of inflation, at least in the short-term.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you have the Federal Reserve forecast. We'll have a new statement this week, but they've been very clear in terms of signaling that interest rates are going to remain low for a significant period of time and even though the market expectations are of higher Fed rates in the coming quarters, we don't see that the economy has reached a level where the Fed will be willing to increase rates anytime soon. In addition to that, the monetary or the quantitative stimulus has to be withdrawn before the Fed starts to increase interest rates and so far, the Fed is just starting to implement the exit strategy.</p>
          <p>On the following slide, you have some of the regional data, particularly the fiscal pressures across our footprint. As you know, this is a major issue for some states, because even though we have the Federal stimulus package at the state level, the budget cuts offset some of the Federal stimulus and at the same time, long-term growth is affected. Some of the biggest impacts are in California, Arizona, the states that are suffering the most and would have to implement significant budget cuts.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, you have the comparison across the U.S. of the states that have been impacted the most, with the darker color being the worst situation and the lighter being the better. You can see that the coastal regions are the ones that are experiencing more significant pressures in addition to the Great Lakes region. Obviously, home prices increased the most and the excesses were higher in these states. Therefore, the short-term pressures are also higher in these states.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, having said that, moving forward and thinking about the long-term, in this issue of the U.S. Regional Watch, we present an interesting article on capital stocks at the state level, which helps to explain potential GDP and you can see that states like Colorado and Texas are better positioned to benefit from this new environment of low investment, low consumption and this will keep growth in these states outperforming the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the final slide, you have our forecast for the U.S. and the Sunbelt Region. We've included California to the list and basically, the main message is that in 2010, Florida, Texas, and Colorado will continue outperforming the rest of the country and will be &#x2013; as a whole, the Sunbelt will also increase at a higher GDP growth rate than the U.S. And that's all from my side and we'll move to the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, we do have a question that was e-mailed in. So, I'll go ahead and offer up the first question. With the flu season upon us and the H1N1 spreading rapidly throughout the United States, have you taken that into account as you looked through your forecast, and what would be the potential impact on the current economic recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the risk of a pandemic environment is obviously out there, but we believe that the probability of that remains relatively low. And in our baseline scenario, we have just the usual type of environment. We don't believe this is going to be something that in the baseline scenario should be considered. Nonetheless if we think about the risk scenario where we can have this and several other issues coming up, would obviously imply a much more negative growth rate for 2009, and even 2010 with a very weak recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Operator, we'll take a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question comes from the line of Ann Joel Gally from BBVA Compass.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have one clarification and one question. Regarding the clarification; if consumption is expected to go down, if supposedly companies will decrease their CapEx and that will result in more jobs being destroyed, so, does your number on page two include that rationale or page three where you have your estimates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're forecasting positive consumption growth for 2010, but it's a very low growth rate. So, the main message is that the forces acting against the strong recovery like the deleveraging, the lower wage gains, relatively low productivity, financial tightness and so on will limit the base of consumption recovery. But it's still a recovery. It's not a decline in consumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the question is relating to commercial real estate, can you give a very general idea of how that can affect the banks that have most of these commercial loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this commercial real estate at the local level, it's a very significant business for smaller banks, which are less diversified. They don't have the same capabilities of mid-size and large banks, and their exposure to commercial real estate is very high. In some of the states where we have the biggest pressures, many of these commercial banks will face bankruptcy and failures will increase. Therefore, we're very negative in some of these states and particularly, with some of these smaller banks that have limited possibilities of facing the downturn in commercial real estate. Obviously, there are some states where pressures are lower; for example, Texas, pressures in commercial real estate are relatively low to the rest of the country. In some other states, for example, in Nevada, pressures are significant and some of the problems can be &#x2013; can give us a big surprise, negative surprise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tim Eaton from Austin American-Statesman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I had a couple of questions and they were all sort of Austin and Texas related. First of all, we're curious about the employees in Austin and also Dallas; are there any plans to eliminate some of those positions or what are the &#x2013; what's the plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; Tim, this call is about the economic. Nathaniel is our Economist. This isn't a specific BBVA Compass call. So, we are not prepared to answer those questions. But if you have an economic question with regard to the U.S. Regional Watch, that's something we can address.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, mostly these have to do with the bank in Texas and how about Texas plans going forward? Can &#x2013; is that something that falls under this arena?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, this isn't BBVA Compass-specific, but economics, general economics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. I guess I got nothing then.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Baker from BBVA Compass.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a question on &#x2013; here in our discussion in our office on the U.S. employees have more money and so &#x2013; that one of your questions?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The U.S. growth rate as opposed to the European growth rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>European.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe than America. Nathaniel, could you expand a little bit on your differing view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think there is any difference. I think there is a widespread consensus that growth in the U.S. is going to be stronger than Europe. We're talking about the European Union and the developed Europe, right? The Eastern European countries are facing a very negative situation because of the traditional emerging market crisis with foreign debt, currency mismatch, a very strong excesses in terms of lend -- loans and so on. And some of these currencies and the economies and the financial markets are going to be tested and the most probable scenario is one of very negative surprises.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the U.S. and Western Europe, the key issue going forward is that the U.S. has been much more aggressive in terms of solving the financial crisis. The transparency, the accountability despite the criticism that we may have or the opinions that we may have in terms of how the crisis resolution has been implemented in the U.S., the fact is still that the U.S. has been more aggressive than Europe and therefore, the U.S. has a greater success &#x2013; chances of success going forward and also the fiscal stimulus package has been larger in the U.S. than in Europe. The monetary response to the crisis, the Federal Reserve, for example, has also been more aggressive.</p>
          <p>And also, what I was talking about if growth in the world is going to be driven by emerging markets, particularly Asian economies, the U.S. has a greater share of trade with Asia than what Europe has. Therefore, growth in Asia is going to help relatively &#x2013; it's going to help the U.S. more than what it's going to help Europe. And the U.S. has &#x2013; the European Union has a much closer link with Eastern Europe than the U.S. has. Therefore, if there is a crisis in Eastern Europe, the U.S. will not suffer as much, and those are basically the fundamentals behind &#x2013; or why the U.S. is going to outperform Europe.</p>

          <p>At this time, there are no further questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we have a couple other questions that were e-mailed in. This question is specifically to Rich and Gary. The Colorado budget gap is approximately about 20% projected in 2010. What if any programs are being implemented by the state to address this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this time, the Governor has a balanced budget for the coming year and the legislature when they go into the session is going to be given a new budget projection where they're going to have to go through and &#x2013; go through the budget balancing exercise. Through the first set of cuts, it has been &#x2013; I won't say painless, but relatively painless, but the next time around is going to be very large cuts to &#x2013; I believe, continued large cuts to the present system, the health and human services and higher education, they are all going to be I think put in place, cuts to be put in place to handle that.</p>
          <p>The state legislature will also be has to consider some legislative processes this year to free up I think additional tuition dollars and other things to help the higher education fees, but I do think the prisons and the health and human services areas are going to come under a lot of stress. And I guess the direct answer to the question is, there is no new programs being put in place, there are a couple of task force being assembled to sort of deal with the state's future budget issues, because the problem doesn't go away even when the economy recovers, unfortunately the problem remains.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have another question, Nathaniel, in the U.S. Regional Watch, you speak specifically about commercial real estate. Are there any areas both by type or geographic location that are faring better than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we're seeing is that the states that have no bubbles are doing better in general. So, states like Texas for example and the Midwest where the economy is still weak, but it's not as weak as in the coastal regions, this is probably the places where &#x2013; in states where this will have this bubbles and the economy is not declining as fast or the job losses are not as strong, commercial real estate is holding up better. So, I would say that states like Colorado and Texas should see more limited pressures than what we can see, for example, in Washington, Oregon, and Florida, and California where we will see more pressures there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another question. The Federal Reserve has said that very likely we are over the recession at this point; as well, we've seen some positive economic indicators over the last week. In addition to you and leading economists are somewhat optimistic, are there any concerns or what are your biggest concerns that could hinder this rally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, from a technical perspective, the recession is over or is about to be over because a lot of the economic indicators that are included to determine the recession are doing better than what we had in the previous months. But from an overall perspective, the fact that employment remains negative and the fact that the uncertain &#x2013; we have uncertainty across the economy in terms of how are we going to generate enough jobs moving forward, which are the sectors that are going to be driving the economy in the next couple of years, what's going to happen in sectors like the energy, the healthcare sector, how is the U.S. going to reposition itself as the leading IT center of the world to attract the brightest minds in the world and so on, these are the uncertainties that we have in the mid and long-term in terms of how the U.S. is going to face its long-term challenges with new economies competing with the U.S. for the same high-skilled, high-tech industries and sectors.</p>
          <p>And we're optimistic from a fundamental perspective and that's because the U.S. remains as the most competitive economy, institution &#x2013; or the institutional framework is very strong, the links between universities and the private sector and so on. But nonetheless, the recovery process, since that in a baseline scenario, it's going to be happening at a lower rate than what we had in previous recessions. Therefore, the biggest challenge is to generate sources of growth that can generate a stronger growth rates and a stable high-growth environment in the long run.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our last question again is to Rich and to Gary, Colorado obviously is one of the states that can help with alternative energy sources. Can you speak to what is going on in the state with regard to alternative energy sources?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the past two years, we've seen an influx of companies such as RES out of Boston, Texas, ConocoPhillips has agreed that they're going to move a facility to the area. Siemens has moved a facility to the Boulder area. Vestas has put plants &#x2013; turbine-making plants in Northern Colorado and in Middle Colorado. Alamosa has one of the largest solar plants in the country. We have the National Renewable Energy Lab [NREL] located in Golden. So in many areas, Colorado positions itself to be a focal point for research and growth in renewable energy. Two other companies I forgot about were Abound Solar and Ascent Solar, they're making solar panels. But there is a lot of great technology coming out of the State of Colorado that will hopefully position the state as a leader in the area.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is an official organization, Ed, it's called the Collaboratory between the University of Colorado and Colorado State University and the Renewable Energy Labs, which is specifically focused on generating new technologies in renewable energies, and it is certainly one of the things the Governor has put his political hat on, he is pushing alternative and renewable energies as a major prong of the state economy going forward. I think the most recent relocation was REpower out of Portland moved their corporate headquarters here, announced it a month ago. So, there has really been a very, very strong push in that area and we think it's a very promising area. I will say I don't know how many jobs it's going to generate in the near-term, it's a smaller area of the economy, but we think it's a very positive development.</p>

          <p>Well, I believe that was our last question. We'd like to thank everybody for joining us. I would like to thank Nathaniel for his presentation as well as Rich and Gary for being on the call today. Again, this call was taped and a replay will be available shortly after the call for two weeks. And next quarter, we look forward to bringing you a fourth quarter U.S. Regional Watch. We'll be at the University of Arizona in Tucson and we look forward to bringing you up-to-date on as we enter 2010. Thank you for your participation and that ends our call today.</p>
