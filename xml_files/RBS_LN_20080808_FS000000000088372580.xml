        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Interim Result's Presentation for 2008. Before we begin, could I remind everyone to switch-off their mobile phones and could I also draw your attention to the first slide in your file covering the usual Safe Harbor provision.</p>
          <p>As you all know this morning, we announced a loss before tax of &#xA3;691 million. We are all deeply disappointed to be announcing such results and apologize for the pain this has caused to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We are determined, however, to do everything we can to ensure outstanding performances from our businesses going forward. And to deliver results, which will restore the company's value as soon as possible. We are all absolutely focused on creating sustained shareholder value.</p>
          <p>The results we announced today were broadly expected following the previous announcements associated with the markdowns underwrites issue. So in a sense, there's no surprise. This morning, however, gives us a chance to set these results in context. And to share with you our analysis and the reasons why we believe we are now well placed for future.</p>
          <p>Let's remember that in 2007, RBS delivered &#xA3;10 billion of profit. Yes, we've taken major hits in the credit markets. But as you will see the underlying earnings power of the Group remains strong even through these difficult markets.</p>
          <p>In view of the deteriorating environment, in April, the Board acted quickly and prudently to set out a new capital plan for the business including significantly raised target capital ratios. Towards the balance of risk had changed for the worse in the early months of 2008. And it was the Board's view that they would likely remain so.</p>
          <p>Again, start by job, we signaled that these conditions would lead us to take 5.9 billion of write-downs in our credit market exposures. The next step in the new capital plan was the completion of a &#xA3;12 billion rights issue and we are grateful that over 95% of our shareholders supported the issue.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to say, we're also making good progress with other elements of the plan. And I've asked Fred to update you on the disposal program and the steps already taken to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet. We are now in a position where we will only dispose of other assets if the valuation is attractive to us.</p>
          <p>Turning to the headline results. I have already mentioned the pre-tax loss of 691 million, which resulted from the markdowns. But as you can see from this slide, the underlying earnings quality of the Group is satisfactory. Excluding write-offs and other one-off items, the business delivered an operating profit of &#xA3;5.144 billion. And adjusted earnings per share 21.3 pence. Guy will shortly review the contribution from our diversified businesses, and I'm sure highlight the excellent performances many of them achieved.</p>
          <p>In the current climate, credit conditions are high on the agenda of the Board and of our investors. We've included significant additional disclosure in today's presentations. Many of you are particularly interested in the UK economy where the consensus forecast and this week's IMS assessment still point to growth of around 1.5% in the next 18 months. We would buy that as a note today if we could. But in the meantime we've conditioned our risk appetite for a tougher credit environment.</p>
          <p>Indeed disclosure is an important theme of these results. The Board is keen to ensure all of our stakeholders have access to the right information on the Company's performance and its balance sheet. We have listened to what investors and analysts have said and we are responding.</p>
          <p>Another element of the Group's new capital plan relates to our dividend policy. As we announced in April, the Board believes it's prudent to issue new ordinary shares instead of paying an interim dividend. The Board agreed that the capitalization issue would be calculated on the basis of the interim cash amount paid in 2007, which was &#xA3;950 million. We have, therefore, decided on a capitalization issue of one new ordinary share for every 40 shares held. It remains our intention to pay the 2008 final dividend in cash.</p>
          <p>The final important feature of today's presentations is the acquisition of parts of the ABN AMRO business for a net consideration of &#xA3;10 billion. The Board is fully engaged with the integration plan and in the delivery of the synergies. Fred's presentation will show we're on track to deliver the original promised synergies and more.</p>
          <p>But there's more to ABN than synergies. This acquisition accelerated our preexisting strategy of earnings diversification and expansion into Asia. RBS now has well diversified product ranges in mature economies, and exciting franchise opportunities in the fast growing economies. We're well positioned to thrive in the competitive landscape the current storm will leave behind.</p>
          <p>But the Board is realistic about the challenges facing our sector. We face a set of financial and economic conditions whose eventual impact is hard to predict. We are determined to learn the lessons for risk management and capital adequacy stemming from this turbulent period.</p>
          <p>You will see evidence of this in today's presentations. We have already taken tough decisions and made a good deal of progress. But there is a lot still to do. I'm confident we have an experienced management team who will continue to take the right actions in the interest of all of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And now I'll hand over to Guy to take you through the results for the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Tom and good morning ladies and gentlemen. The results this morning, as you've heard from the Chairman, will and have been ultimately overshadowed by the credit market write-downs of &#xA3;5.9 billion inline with estimates that we indicated back in April and resulted in the loss of &#xA3;690 (sic) [691] million. But underneath that, I think these results will also illustrate a very strong underlying business performance and material progress towards our rebased capital targets.</p>
          <p>Total income declined one percentage point, principally driven by weakness in financial markets. Costs were reduced by &#xA3;118 million or 1% down to just below &#xA3;8.3 billion. Our claims recovering from the flood affected 2007 fell &#xA3;488 million and pre-impairment profit rose 6% to just over &#xA3;6.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Impairment costs rose by &#xA3;540 million. Operating profit from our divisions is &#xA3;5.1 billion, a decline of three percentage points over a record first half in 2007. The impact of credit markets, which I'll highlight in a couple of slides, was &#xA3;5.9 billion inline with estimates.</p>
          <p>Other items including amortization of intangibles, integration costs and the shared assets of ABN were more than offset by a &#xA3;800 million gain on the fair value of our own debt. The combination of those items resulting in a loss before taxes &#xA3;691 million.</p>
          <p>On the important capital ratios, our core Tier 1 was up by 170 basis points to 5.7%, Tier 1 at 8.6%, total capital at 13.1%, on a proportionate look-through basis well ahead of the estimates that we published back in April.</p>
          <p>Just highlighting the credit market write-downs overall, they are inline with the rights issue announcement, the holdings and valuations of our subprime CDO exposures are inline and as we published back in April.</p>
          <p>Our US resale mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and leveraged finance exposures all been reduced at prices and within marks above those estimated in April.</p>
          <p>However, we have against our monoline exposure reserve an additional &#xA3;300 million, since April recognizing perceived deterioration in that sector. Overall, the write-downs of &#xA3;6.1 billion before hedges and 5.9 after hedge effects.</p>
          <p>Just a brief word on monolines, our net exposure now has come down from 2.5 at the time of the rights issue to &#xA3;2.4 billion of which &#xA3;170 million remains to non-investment grade counterparties.</p>
          <p>We have reserves and hedges against 62% of our gross exposure, which total &#xA3;3.9 billion. And this is slightly more than the gross exposure that we have to our insured CDOs and retail mortgage-backed securities. The vast majority of our remaining net exposure is to the higher rated monoline counterparties.</p>
          <p>Across the board, our exposure to credit markets has been reduced, through largely significant impact of course because of the markdowns but also some material disposals, notably a large reduction in our inventory of US mortgages and leveraged finance. Leveraged finance has come down from year-end 14.5 billion on a funded and unfunded basis to 10.8 billion at the end of June. As we stand here today an additional &#xA3;1.3 billion prices within the marks indicated were sold in July. Our net exposure now stands at &#xA3;9.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Pre-credit markets divisional operating profit was &#xA3;5.1 billion, our growth outside GBM which was heavily affected by levels of activity in financial markets, growth was 10 percentage points. And I'm now going to run through very briefly each of the divisions.</p>
          <p>GBM income fell 10%, costs were held back and reduced by 14%. Impairment rose &#xA3;294 million from a negligible number in 2007, were up about &#xA3;178 million versus the second half of 2007.</p>
          <p>We saw a notably strong performance in local markets rates, currencies and commodities, up 87% and a very good start to our Joint Venture with Sempra, which closed on April 1st.</p>
          <p>Credit markets remained weak with lower origination volumes particularly securitization and leveraged finances and also some considerable costs in de-risking the balance sheet. These are partly offset by the sale of Angel Trains with income overall in credit markets was down 80%.</p>
          <p>We made material progress in de-risking the balance sheet with over &#xA3;100 billion of nominal assets coming off of GBM balance sheet in the period. And risk-weighted assets shrunk by 1%, including the acquisitions of Sempra on a like-for-like basis were down 10 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Back on to our Global Transaction Services delivered much of the hoped and expected, much of what we hope and expected at its formation. It is a highly complementary customer product and revenue opportunities follow the Group and income rose 12 percentage points, profits rose 15%.</p>
          <p>Average balances is an important driver of income rose 13%, over the time period. We saw a particularly strong growth in our international activities with cash management up 21% and Merchant Acquiring up 14%, and Trade Finance growing by 60.</p>
          <p>In our UK retail and commercial banking businesses, we saw strong performance across all of the major business lines, we saw steady growth in income and falling impairment costs. Retail impairment charges fell 8% or &#xA3;50 million largely on improving unsecured loan book. These are partially offset by &#xA3;34 million, increasing corporate provisions.</p>
          <p>Our Retail Banking profits were up 9% in the first half of 2007, our Corporate and Commercial profits rose by 6% and our Private Banking businesses rose 14%. Good loan growth was complemented by a rise in average deposits of 10 percentage points.</p>
          <p>In the United States, facing a tough economic climate, income grew by 2%, expenses grew by one and impairments rose markedly leading to a 31% decline in contribution to just over $1 billion and a 41% decline in operating profit after the allocation of manufacturing costs.</p>
          <p>Within the impairment rise it is important to know there are two main elements to this. There is the core Citizen's portfolio, which I think has been recognized a long time as a high quality book of business, which continues to perform very well in its marketplace. And the, as we previously disclosed, a line of home equity business, which was originated through broker distribution channels and known as the SBO portfolio, which continues to perform quite poorly.</p>
          <p>And I'll just highlight, couple of those columns. The core portfolio here, well diversified across consumer and corporate lending activities with charge-off rates currently running at around 73 basis points on an annualized basis. The corporate commercial and commercial real estate books all performing well. Charge-offs at 80 basis points across those portfolios with reserves now standing at 1.6 times the non-performing loan amount.</p>
          <p>Our retail books, mostly the Citizens-originated high quality credits, continue to perform well and certainly very well against their US peer group. The Core Home Equity and Mortgage books with a FICO score of 748 average and loan to value of 64 continues to experience I think industry leading credit performance at this point. And just for clarity, we provide a little extra information here around the distribution of loan to value, which again continues to illustrate the overall strength of the main part of the book.</p>
          <p>The SBO portfolio has been a greater problem. It is now closed to new business, it was closed last year. We've seen run-off exposures there have come down from a nominal 9.3 billion in the middle of last year to now 7.7 as of June 30th. We've taken cumulative provisions of $675 million against this portfolio and our current reserves stand at $413 million or roughly 2.7 times the non-performing loan amount. We remain cautious about its outlook. The delinquency graph which you can see there is showing some signs of leveling. And certainly at this stage the book of business is performing inline with the estimates that we announced at the time of the rights issue.</p>
          <p>Within Europe and the Middle East, we saw a 13% growth in profits. Principally you see benefits of a strong euro. In constant currency terms, income rose 7%, costs rose 15% largely reflecting the completion of the journey to one investment program in Ulster Bank. Impairments rose &#xA3;27 million from the run rate of the second half of 2007. In local currency terms, profits declined by 1%.</p>
          <p>Encouragingly, we're seeing new business margins now rising, especially in Ireland, and I highlighted the bottom of both point to the Middle East and are still only a small part of this division, representing just 5% of Europe and the Middle East. And we're very pleased to see an income growth there of 39% from the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>In Asia, very positive story, the regional commercial banking business has moved into profit in 2008 with a 13% uplift in contribution and strong growth as you can see across all the areas of consumer finance, affluent banking, business banking and private banking. And certainly an opportunity here for us to leverage the Group Manufacturing for going forward we would expect to see good profitable growth coming through in this division.</p>
          <p>RBS Insurance rebounded from the 2007 floodings with profit with a headline number of 56%, and we continue to define differentiation between our own brand distribution channels and our partnership channels. Own brand income rising 3%, Partnerships' income fell 8% as we discontinued a number of relationships. Importantly, the Partnership contribution grew by 18% to the bottom-line.</p>
          <p>Net claims fell 13% to &#xA3;1.86 billion on a headline basis and fell 6% on an underlying basis adjusting for last year's flood effect, reflecting the de-risking of customer selection that has been progressing well over the last year or two. Underlying profit rose 5% and the combined operating ratio fell from 95.8 to 94.6%.</p>
          <p>In Group Manufacturing, we continued the same productivity gains largely offsetting continued investment and business volume growth. Results there were impacted by the foreign exchange rates, on a constant currency basis costs grew just 2 percentage points, and certainly contributed towards holding the cost income ratio to the Group flat at 48.2% versus the first half of 2007 despite the slight headline decline in income across the Group.</p>
          <p>Net interest income grew by 30% in the first half of 2007 to just over &#xA3;7.5 billion and represented 45% of Group income. Business margins remained broadly stable in the first half. And mix effect basically higher mortgage originations contributing to the decline in UK retail and commercial banking.</p>
          <p>Across all of our Front books, we're starting to see margins rising as the risk premium in the marketplace has been added to new business origination. Whilst we saw picking up some lag effect on back book pricing more notably in Europe and the Middle East. Underlying NIM for the Group was stable at around 2.02%.</p>
          <p>Credit matrix remained stable in the first half of 2008 whilst offering some evidence of leading indicators flagging weakness ahead. Certainly the first half result shows strength and quality of the portfolio. Our loans grew 7% during the period and non-performing loans by about the same amount leaving our non-performing loans to loan ratio very similar the levels of the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Our impairment charge rose from 37 to 46 basis points principally in -- as a result of GBM and the US retail and commercial business. Provision coverage declined slightly, reflecting charge-offs low to high proportion of the non-performing loan book being in well-secured assets where we have a reduced expectation of loss.</p>
          <p>And finally on a half that has been, I think, dominated by capital and discussions around capital, made substantial progress towards our rebased capital targets, obviously supported by the &#xA3;12 billion rights issue the Chairman to referred, but coupled with very strong balance sheet control.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets across the Group were up by slightly less than 1%. We made material progress on de-risking the balance sheet. And our core Tier 1 at 5.7 is well ahead of the 5% that we indicated at the time of the rights issues and Tier 1 at 8.6 and total capital of 13.1 on a proportionate basis are already ahead of our revised targets. We are well on track to meet our core Tier 1 target of being above 6% at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>On a consolidated basis, capital ratios showing the strengthened support from the rest of the consortium of 6.7% core Tier 1 and 9% on a Tier 1 basis.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll hand over to Fred. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy, and good morning everyone. I don't want to go back over all the ground that Guy has covered. So what I will do is just pick out a couple of themes, which I think are important, then address the outlook and then we'll go on to the opportunity to try and answer any of your questions. And the themes I'd like to talk about are ABN AMRO separation and integration, capital and outlook.</p>
          <p>ABN AMRO, we tend to think of it in terms of integration, but of course because of the way in which the business was acquired by the Consortium it's actually quite a big task to go on out there and separating ABN AMRO into the parts which belong to each of the consortium members and transferring them to the Consortium members. And that is going on in parallel with the integration of the business.</p>
          <p>A quick reminder back to one of the slides we used last year and we were characterizing what would happen in terms of separation in two parts through the, there was this sort of snipping off of the connections of some relatively discrete business units within ABN AMRO. And then the altogether more complicated separation of BU Netherlands, which was enmeshed with the part of the business at the center which RBS was taking.</p>
          <p>And as we got into the business and formed our detailed plans, that is precisely what has happened and how we're going about it and also precisely how things have progressed. The last piece in the equation to be separated will be the BU elements although I think we might be moving up the timescale and rather more quickly than we first thought.</p>
          <p>To give you a sense of how that all looks in terms of value, the overall transaction as you well remember was in the region of &#x20AC;70 billion. But what's remaining is our piece starting at the bottom was only about 14 billion. LaSalle there is there in a slightly different color just to remind ourselves that by the time the deal is completed we obtained the cash disposal proceeds of the LaSalle business which obviously had found its way to -- obviously been sold to Bank of America. The separation of LaSalle to Bank of America took place during our period of ownership.</p>
          <p>Since then what has happened, broadly as follows. Asset Management was transferred to Fortis during the first half of this year. And Antonveneta was sold, as you know which came out of Santander share. And in July, post 30th of June, but before, obviously an historic event now Banco Real was transferred to Santander.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of the whole business, Santander has pretty much already got all of its parts. We have acquired LaSalle cash, as you can see on the left, in a situation now where with about 34 billion of the nominal 70 left, principally belonging to Fortis. Two major parts of separating that now, BU Private Banking, which will separate in the early part of 2009 and BU Netherlands, which will separate some point during 2009. I think that is the way it hangs on a piece of IT separation, which is well advanced at this point.</p>
          <p>Some shared assets and they're relatively small, again very good progress has been made there. Some of the foundry stakes and residual bits and pieces have been transferred to the respective owners as sold, business unit private equity, about 75% completed, there're some very small round positions now being disposed of.</p>
          <p>The last remaining item of any substance is to sell the stake in Saudi Hollandi Bank, a minority stake. And then the Scotland. That's pretty well advanced as we speak. So very good progress in separation. Not finished yet but we are down to a discrete and small number of items.</p>
          <p>And turning then from the separation aspect to the integration aspect, we set out in the original offer document some synergies, both cost and revenue and we revised those earlier this year to a rather higher figure. I guess, I think we'll stop talking about the synergies in Europe now and just go flip them into sterling. 1.15 cost savings, 500 million and thereby net revenue benefits that what we plan now to deliver. Just as a passing observation, now represents about four times the annual profit of the businesses which RBS acquired, about four times their annual profit in 2007. So I think a material element of the transaction and the benefits which accrue to us.</p>
          <p>How are we progressing? As you can see in the document, progressing well. Hopefully this is helpful information not just in terms of how we're doing, but also in giving you a sense of how these benefits will flow through. Remember these are recurring annual benefits, so that is to say from 2010 onwards we could expect as a result just with the cost synergies to be delivering &#xA3;1.15 billion incremental profit year in, year out.</p>
          <p>And the figure you see in the other columns are the annual profit impact, not the amount of synergies we've implemented because obviously as you implement a synergy in a year, you don't get the full year's benefit in that year. So, I hope this is helpful to you and not information that you've had before. I know you'll probably take a swing at it, but now give you a sense of how we plan to -- originally planned to deliver.</p>
          <p>You see from the dark blue bar on the left hand side, we got over the blocks, pretty quickly. We're materially ahead in terms of the P&amp;L effect, which we've generated. I'm sorely tempted to suggest to you that will translate into higher benefits. I think in the interest of prudence at this point, we just leave it that we're going to deliver the benefits faster. So the value created during the integration period will be greater than simply adding the light blue bars together but let's not rush our fences. We've got out of the blocks very quickly and we feel good about the synergies. And they're all now in train. We've always had a sense when you have a plan, now, it's all very interesting, it's only when you start to roll it out, you start to get a sense of how deliverable it is, we'll be pleased with those numbers and pleased with that progress.</p>
          <p>Turning to the revenue side, revenue synergies are always a much more difficult thing to get your mind around, they're more nebulous sort of concept, can I just take a moment to share with you our sort of thinking around revenue synergies? These are synergies, which come from specific things which we are doing. They're not intended as a proxy for growth in the business.</p>
          <p>So we would expect to be able to stand up in front of you, and take our total income, deduct these amounts and answer to you in terms of the growth of the net figures being respectable having regard to what's been going on in the world of the businesses that we own. So this is not a proxy for the growth we expect to see from the businesses. This is the incremental revenue, which we think we will get from specific revenue synergies.</p>
          <p>A story similar to that cost that we got out of the blocks pretty quickly here. And the numbers are obviously smaller. But again they're tracking well ahead. And I am tempted, less tempted than I am with costs but nevertheless tempted to suggest that we'll get more than this. But, for the moment, I think we'll settle for getting quicker delivery of the synergies.</p>
          <p>A little flesh to go on the bones; what we have been doing behind the numbers. The new Group structure, which we announced to you in February, actually took quite a lot of engineering to get it into place with our people. Management appointments have to be made, reporting lines have to change. Not an end in itself but an exercise as we're folding two organizations together it is, of course, of critical importance to make sure that we choose the best person, whether it be the so-called ABN person or the so-called the RBS person. They're all RBS people now but we went through quite a convoluted process as part of that, involving third-party consultants to help us conduct interviews because it's very important in the early days of integration not just to be fair but to be seen to be fair, we're through that now but it was a long process. It was tempting just to push on at times but I think we got the right outcome or needed to take a little bit of time.</p>
          <p>Rebranding around the business, there are no two countries in which the story is the same. In terms of what the regulator thinks, what the legal position is, what the practical position is. But we've now made significant inroads in all of the large jurisdictions to re-branding the business and making it look and feel more like RBS, which is an important part of the cultural shift in all of this.</p>
          <p>Very good reaction from customers in all of this as we've written to customers to also draw their attention to the trailing of RBS with ABN AMRO, and have a very good reaction and no negative reaction to speak of so that is another important piece.</p>
          <p>IT systems, we have been scaling GBM systems to expected ABN AMRO. A huge proportion of the business is now conducted on a commingled basis. And ABN AMRO numbers don't exist. Their books and businesses have been folded in and now already being run on an integrated basis with a lot of scaling up of IT systems to enable that to happen.</p>
          <p>In how we arrive at delivering the synergies ahead of plan, ranges from the sublime to the screamingly obvious I suppose but the head count reductions have been accelerated. We have about 2,200 or so people who have moved out in the first half of '08. And there will be, I know it's never politic to describe what the number will be in the second half but the process continues to get people, to move people out of the business as the synergies are being realized. We have ramped that in the ABN AMRO head office activities in the Netherlands rather quicker than we had first thought. And then we come to the other end of the spectrum which is we're just in buying things, stationary items for ABN AMRO.</p>
          <p>We're achieving significant savings by putting them through a combined group purchasing processes. Interesting I think as a commentary on the economic situation, the supplier must certainly have very sharp pencils at this moment in time when it comes to quoting for business on the scale of the business which we can offer up our end. So the purchasing synergies are very encouraging.</p>
          <p>So integration -- separation and integration are both going well. I know it's a subject we'll return to again but off to a good start. The start is always the most difficult part just to go from a piece of paper, but synergies are going into actual delivered momentum.</p>
          <p>Looking to as Jim had mentioned earlier, we didn't buy the business for the synergies. We bought the business for the underlying businesses. And again as we've taken ownership, brought these under control and started to move forward with the combined management teams and the new business structure, we've been running through and validating the business rationale -- the strategic rationale, what was in our mind at the time we took the businesses over.</p>
          <p>And so far so good. What we thought was possible and those businesses still looks possible. And we believe it will happen. It does move us forward in the way we try to anticipate it. Clearly, what's different than other trading prospects, some of the businesses, some but not all, a very crude assessment on the chart that I grant you but give you a sense of the real areas, they're not small areas but the areas where current market condition fall short of what we might have expected at the time we set off on the transaction.</p>
          <p>And equities, difficult equity market, not the end of the world but more difficult than would have been ideal for the business and in credit markets where I need hardly tell you what the markets have been like that's impacted on the RBS business and the pieces we've acquired from ABM AMRO. But by no means, despondent about the prospects for credit markets going forward but just as to how things currently trade against where we thought. Those are really the areas of where it's pinching at this point, but the strategic rationale for the business is the net acquisition remain intact.</p>
          <p>Capital -- Guy has already covered the issues and I don't have anything additional to say in that respect. We're well ahead of where we expected to be at the half year and we're much closer to, as a consequence we're much closer to the year in targeted core Tier 1 but already through it in terms of the overall Tier 1 measure.</p>
          <p>One of the features, which I talk about are the disposals and firstly, the disposals are on track. What does that mean? For all of the things, which we had in mind to dispose of when we spoke about this in April are have either been disposed off or are still in train. Of course a disposal and train falls well short of a disposal completed and settled number of material items out there. I know the one that will be the top of everyone's mind is RBS Insurance.</p>
          <p>We continue in discussions for RBS Insurance with interested parties. We have not concluded a deal, obviously, we'd announce it if we'd concluded a deal and until you sign a deal you haven't signed a deal. So we continue with that process. It carries on. We have a figure in mind that we would expect to get for that business. It's a figure that I don't think you would view as unreasonable, but we're determined not to sell the business at an undervalue, not to be a full seller. This is not a trivial asset.</p>
          <p>One of the benefits, which the capital ratios have moved on more quickly towards our target is that that pressure on disposals -- there are more disposals out there being progressed than just RBS Insurance. Indeed the Tesco Personal Finance disposal, which we announced recently is not reflected in the figures yet the loan would increase core Tier-1 ratio to 5.8.</p>
          <p>As you know, the business tends to generate more capital in the second half of the year and as I'll talk about in a moment our de-leveraging activity continues on to the second half of the year. So it feels like we've created some more flexibility in terms of the ways in which we can deliver core Tier-1 ratio.</p>
          <p>But all the businesses that are up for sale, remain for sale and all of the process continues. And as soon as we get anything to announce, we'll announce it to you.</p>
          <p>We're about 25% of the way through delivery of the 4 billion contribution to capital as a result of disposals that have already been contracted.</p>
          <p>De-leveraging is an important theme as well. I think I mentioned to some of you and certainly we've talked in the intervening period about the numbers at 31st of December were pretty much pushed two balance sheets cross cash and that was it. We all knew as part of integration and as part of bringing the two organizations under control there was a lot of meshing together of balance sheets to be achieved and clearly as market conditions have changed a lot of de-leveraging to bring about.</p>
          <p>The chart there gives you a sense. Just for one part of this, and is clearly a rather important within GBM is a nominal values on RWE. Just to give you a sense of how it went, there was still momentum in the businesses through late 2007. But we saw a capital plan and the de-leveraging plan starting to bear fruit from February and March time driving the numbers down.</p>
          <p>There's a cost attached to this, there is an opportunity cost attached to this and it's clearly the right thing to do for the business. And after the initial squeals of pain from customer facing colleagues as we start down this path actually we're managing down this in a less painful manner. We'll see these gains and improvements continuing in to the second half as we further de-leverage the balance sheet. The focus on improving the risk return, there's nothing clever about this, just want an improved risk return metric as we go forward and generally have a smaller balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The outlook, put this slide up to start with, as you know, I'm not an economist and I know, you're not here for an economics lecture. So I'm not going to spend a lot of time here. I put these up just because I tend to do it historically sometimes for inspiration as we start to think about outlook.</p>
          <p>Picking up again a comment that the Chairman made, I think if we could get those July '08 numbers and bank them we would. I find it interesting looking at us actually how little numbers have deteriorated from the start of the year through to now. It certainly feels as if things have deteriorated more than that.</p>
          <p>We shall see. The numbers do show growth in most of the major markets in which we operate. As you can see in Asia-Pacific, well, the numbers are certainly coming down from this level. They're still relatively high compared to the rest of the business we operate in. But, in truth, we tend not to see the world through the lens of forecast like this, we see the world through the lens of the businesses that we operate and the customer franchise that we operate.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to go thorugh all of this, but just sort of a vignette as it were of some of the business trends, some of the factors, some of the elements of growth during the first half of the year. And whilst it's right that we focus on some of the areas that are particularly stressed. However, some very, very strong rates of growth in parts of the business, many of which are new parts of the business to RBS.</p>
          <p>So growth, there's a lot going on out there and you may be surprised to go around the Group to discover how busy people are in the customer facing parts of the Group.</p>
          <p>Also in thinking about the outlook, I thought it might be helpful to you to again have a split of our income within the business units, these are pretty big chunky business units. And we've set out here, but also in the appendix. I didn't want to troll through them and waste time in this first part of the presentation. But if you look in the appendix, we've given a breakdown within each of our operating businesses of their main income streams '07 compared with '08 just to give you a sense of the moving parts.</p>
          <p>I think as you, well, even just flick through those slides, you would see quickly that by far the most volatile part of the businesses is GBM and you can see that from that slide just looking at the total markets by the big gaps between light blue and dark blue bars in both directions highlight just how much volatility there has been within individual business lines. I think the stories behind each of them are pretty well known to you.</p>
          <p>But draw your attention to the fact that global markets are actually less than half of the Group. In income terms, we are actually achieving very good growth of our customer franchise, a new customer basis that we've accessed through the ABN AMRO transaction; the ability to bring RBS products to bear on there has given us an important fillip at what's quite a difficult time in the market.</p>
          <p>And going to speak to customers about new products, or bringing into new markets with new products is quite a good recipe for growth at times when economies are generally under downward pressure. Also important and I am sure this is a theme that I'll return to again in the course of the -- in the morning, is that margins are widening out and that one of the positive aspects of the dislocation we've seen is that the risk premium has re-emerged and our margins are moving up as you can see that in the Group margin and you can see that in individual product margin as you go through it.</p>
          <p>Another very significant part of this business &#x2013; Global Transaction Services as you saw in Guy's slides just some of the very significant growth we're now achieving in international cash management. Again, a product we didn't really feature in before. So, strong income streams in GBM, is a very up and down story, but we feel that we have opportunity for growth in the second half and beyond.</p>
          <p>Similar run through regional markets cause immediately you put the slide up, you can see what I was meaning about the gaps between the light and dark blue bars, far steadier performance across the piece. Now, you go and look at the individual components of this, whether the UK, the US, Europe or Asia the picture is very similar, but those bars are all up a little or stable and that's very much the nature of this business. So that's 40% of the Group income, Group underlying income.</p>
          <p>We see good growth in here in the Commercial segment as well as in Personal. Private Banking has remained strong. We're interested in how strong that remains as the economy slow down, which we shall see. And Personal Business is growing despite difficult market conditions.</p>
          <p>And again in common with what I was saying about global markets, we're starting to see new business margins improving. So in conclusion then, we're making good progress in ABN AMRO both in terms of the separation and in terms of the integration.</p>
          <p>The capital plan remains on track. We're ahead of target at the moment, which is where we expected to be at the end of June and we've already completed the TPS disposal since which is about, say about 10 basis points into those numbers. The outlook for the global economy is challenging for sure. You'll have your own views on that and I wouldn't necessarily disagree what they all are, but I think we're all in a place we expect for the global economy to become more difficult going forward. It does feel as if we're better placed. It does feel that you would want to have a stronger capital base facing into this kind of environment. It does feel good to have the opportunity to grow out income not by doing more of the same old, same old, but to actually have new products to go to existing customers with and new markets to take new products into.</p>
          <p>And to be able to do it at of time where we expect to meaningfully improve our efficiency by completing the integration of ABN Amro and realizing 1.1, 1.2 billion of cost synergies. It feels like an important card to have in our hand at this time.</p>
          <p>That was all I was proposing to state at this point. I invite my colleagues now to join me. We'll be happy to try and answer any questions you have.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Fred. And before we take the first question, could I just ask people to state their name and affiliation before they place their question so. I will start up here and walk my way around.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin from Fox Pitt Kelton. Actually, I've got a question on -- just on the balance sheets and then a question on impairments if I may? Just on the balance sheets, I was just interested in what's happening in terms of the customer deposits? Because it looks as if in the first half of this year, customer deposits across the Group seem to have grown by only about 1%. I think it's 6 billion or so. When I look at loans, it's grown by 7% or 45 billion. And so obviously, you don't need to be specific but where is it -- why is that happening? Is it because you're not wanting to complete as aggressively as maybe some of your competitors in that market? But how much longer might that sort of trend go on for and where does that take the loan deposit ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You partly answered the question, Leigh, and I'll pass it to Gordon and Johnny to give you their respective versions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've seen I suppose, partly it's a take, and partly to give to some customers -- I think you've clearly seen the personal sector, I would say, reducing liquidity actually available. Several banks have reported figures on current account balances, they're not as bad as some of the figures which are shown. But I would certainly say flat is probably an average.</p>
          <p>And what you would normally see at this point in the year, you normally see balances which would have had a peak say in last December then come down to March and then come up. So it's not at all surprising actually to see the corporate balances actually showing a lowish figure at this point in the year. I'd normally be expecting to see momentum going upwards just through natural activity and we're not seeing that at the moment. I think it's showing something similar.</p>
          <p>So I think you are seeing a available-in-the-market point of view there is less available and then there are people out there who are clearly, I'll not use the word more desperate than us but there are clearly rates out there, which suggest people have a greater demand than us. That is something we're clearly going to have to look at in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>When you say lending growth, lending growth is essentially at the moment really mortgages. So to some extent that is discretionary if we continue to get good margins in the mortgage market then clearly we will have to look at a way of funding that growth. Into and after the last few weeks we've actually seen some of those very strong new business margins already begin to tail off which suggest that the banks have sort of already beginning to lose sense of reality, perhaps, but I think it's going to be an interesting challenge for the second half year. I think it's a market issue than our issue particularly. The corporate market we're still seeing very strong opportunity to lending growth and deposit growth and if we want to do one we'll have to find a way of doing the other, there is no question about that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In GBM -- not GTS, but GBM the distinction between cash deposits and money market deposits is somewhat artificial. There is a lot of strange things going on in the money market as you know, the LIBOR and the LIBOR fixings and so on. We've got absolutely no shortage of deposits at levels that we want them at, is a short answer. But everything we take is tends to be at the money market rates. We've done slightly better than most. So I don't know if you could see any trends and I don't know you should read anything into the trends in customer deposits in GBM. It's more a question of what we want to do and the price at what we -- which we want to do it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. If I may just the second question. On impairments, I just interested in what's going on in GBM, there's a tick-up in impairments there and in addition on the US SBO portfolio, I think, going back to April you were guiding that there may be a provision of $1 billion you envisage taking against that portfolio, and I wondered if you could just clarify please, that the amount that you've shown for the first half how that squares with the $1 billion you're envisaging for the year?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll repeat myself again, it's quite difficult to talk about trends in GBM in the sense that provisions are somewhat lumpy, but there is a tick-up and I don't think that's surprising given the economic environment in which we find ourselves, I'm not sure I can add anything beyond that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We, again for the purposes of capital funding, we estimated to charge of around $1 billion &#x2013; and as I tried illustrate in my slide, we've taken around 675 of that where we continue to manage it as a loan book in decline in several expect to recognize those on a sort of as incurred basis going forward, but I think, that overall number still seems to be a good number.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. There's clearly a lot of focus on bad debts at the moment. I'm actually very interested in the levers that you can pull, I was interested, Fred, you mentioned margins, how did they stabilize and look like they've reached an inflection point. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit and more about that? But also on cost, if I look ex- outside of GBM, it looks like your costs on a divisional basis are flat to down pretty much everywhere. So I was wondering clearly we know about the opportunity you've got in ABN. I was wondering what cost opportunity you've got in the old Royal Bank franchise? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of, what sort of levers we can pull on the credit front, I mean, there are still a variety. The most effective lever you can pull is getting in early, getting a hold of the customer early, start working things to opposed to waiting for the phone call to tell you that the receivers have been called. One of the metrics that we look at quite closely is the flow of business into SLX and some of you if can remember back to 2001 to 2002, we put slides up &#x2013; the movement of KCs into SLX.</p>
          <p>We operate on a basis with our relationship managers, basically it was an amnesty, if they move the thing into SLX, they are not to blame. Whereas if it sits on their books and goes less well for them, in terms of their budgets and their performance they get immunized from it if it goes into the -- into the center.</p>
          <p>The flow of business into SLX is moving up, it's been moving up since early '07. The important thing with an SLX it runs about 60% of what goes in comes out, back into the normal banking business having been through a period of intensive care. So, I don't know if you'd call it a lever or not, Michael, but that's one of the tools we use to get in early with these guys. If you get in early enough, you can still sometimes give someone an opportunity to re-bank, which is one lever we can pull. But getting in early is simple key and of course we don't always, but that's certainly the best thing there.</p>
          <p>To the remainder of the business and costs, we have our cost opportunities and as we move forward with our scale it helps a lot. A lot of the scale benefits for costs tend to come in Manufacturing. And Guy's slide he put up, Manufacturing headline is up 5%. At constant currency though, it's only up 2%. And if you take out the property element in that where we're kind of increasing the amount of property we occupy then the growth in that and Manufacturing bears the cost of the properties around the Group. Costs of actually just supporting customers sell in constant currency, so that model that continues as we go forward. We're all ABN. ABN had their own, had got the manufacturing concept. So there a lot of progress had already been made at ABN AMRO. RBS has had the manufacturing concept for a long time, if you bring the two together, we do see quite powerful opportunities to bring down costs.</p>
          <p>The big issue in the divisions tends to be the very direct cost for the front end, not the numbers of people out there doing business. So it tends to have less scope to come down, particularly in something like GBM. If we aren't doing the business then you're not incurring that cost. So that may be a long-winded answer in cost that there are plenty of levers, but a lot of them in Manufacturing, more than the individual business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on margin, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think actually a lot of moving parts with margins, but the fact of the matter is that the prices gone up. I had customer in to see me on Monday and someone who, if I mentioned his name, you would all instantly know who it was and realize it isn't a customer just chatting around or just sounding us out whether we would be interested in something. I said, well of course, there's no question about us being interested in that other than a materially higher pricing. Oh, yeah, yeah and just everybody understands that the price of credit has gone up materially, it has to us our funding costs have gone up too. So it's not all good news.</p>
          <p>So, but if we had been having that conversion not so long ago, he'd have been telling me the price or trying to tell me the price for the deal. That has now turned around quite a lot. And if you go through product-by-product, it's hard to see in products where the margin hasn't gone up. Deposits could be an exception where some people pushing lower deposits for what I would consider strategic reason and structural reasons. It feels quite good not to have that immediate need to do that. But, if you look at mortgages, mortgage margins have gone up almost 100 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But some book margins have basically doubled from the low and but even then I would argue only modestly. So I would say, that they are only getting higher, not getting lower. And the risk profile is considerably significantly worse than it was in 2004. So I would see more gravity in the upwards direction still in the mortgage market before I got too excited.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And thanks. It's Mike Trippet at Oriel. A couple of questions actually. Just on the increased synergies in ABN, maybe sort of sound like a slightly cynical question. But I was just wondering, how much more cost would have come out anyway, given the sort of de-leveraging that's going on in the market's business. And just simply there is probably, going to be less business about anyway, I'm just really trying to understand what cost would have come out from the two organizations, naturally versus the increased synergies? I have second question on impairments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, to the RBS side of the question, we run the business fairly tight. But you've seen how our cost base moved around over the piece, and it may well have been costs that would have come out of ABN AMRO. It wasn't a business that was normally associated with costs coming out. I will observe the numbers we put up on the chart are numbers which we put up in June or so of last year, June, July time of last year, that's the starting point. So, we'd already identified synergies that weren't going to drop in activity anything like we're seeing just now. When we revised them upwards in February, I don't think even then we would have necessarily forecasted some of the activity falling away as much as we have. But also remember those two columns of ticks that we've got there, I think so far as the business is doing less well or market conditions are less favorable. It's really just an equities and credit market, not small parts of the business, but an important part of the business but by no means the whole business. But another way to come at your question, I might get out, I would acknowledge that at staff level there will be some rightsizing going on as well to reflect those businesses coming down. But I'm &#x2013; we'll also see cost coming down as remuneration costs come down. But the synergies, the savings are promising out there at 2010, recurring synergies. So I'd be disappointed to think that we're still seeing variable remuneration coming down in 2010, but I acknowledge in the short-term you'll see variable remuneration reducing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this is the second question, on the US impairments outside of the SPO, which also have gone up quite significantly, I just wondered if you could give a feel of where we are in terms of the impairments versus charge-offs, and whether there is a reserve building phase, or whether impairments are inlinewith charge-offs? Just trying to get a flavor where that goes in the second half?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>A good question for Ellen Alemany our CEO in North America.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Outside of the SPO portfolio our impairments of roughly 388 million are about 70 basis points. Most of it's been in the retail sector, consumer-originated home equity, auto portfolio, et cetera. And if just we feel we're performing much ahead of the rest of the other US banks in the sector, and it just reflects the overall deterioration in the consumer segment, but it's a combination of reserves and provisions.</p>

          <p>Hi, John [sic] (Mike). Could I just make a comment on your -- the first part of your question on synergies. The Board sees every month an integration report and it's extremely detailed made up of individual projects. So the numbers you're seeing here are all clearly identified projects and the delivery against those is tracked monthly. And the Board sees that, you know, this isn't some kind of rolling up of things that are happening anyways, these are all absolutely discrete projects.</p>

          <p>It's Jonathan Pierce with Credit Suisse. Just got two question, the first just some disclosure about the Angel trends' pre-tax gain was within these numbers and then also if you can give us some idea on page 52 as to what the fairly sizeable negative items are within the other income lines of non-interest income?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That'd be page 52. It's around 570 million of the Angel gain, reflected in the  line on page 52. Some of the other markdowns relate to a number of valuation adjustments on carrying value to certain assets, some of those are mapped into the weak credit markets numbers, which I highlighted in markdowns on certain assets and that function as part of the de-risking of the GBM balance sheet. Overall, across the GBM division other operating income came down from around, I think, it was around &#xA3;950 million this time a year ago to around 675 this year and that would include the Angel gain of 570.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is on risk-weighted asset progression in GBM again. I'm interested really in the extent to which the reduction in credit exposures, some of the risky credit exposures has assisted that. And in particular if I look at the LPO book, sort of a 3.5 to 4 billion reduction. I think those assets were risk-weighted at about 390-odd percent. So for that portfolio in its entirely, can you give us some feel as to how much of the decline and expose contributed to the fall in risk-weighted assets in GBM and perhaps more importantly why you see the risk-weighted assets trend moving into the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you some flavor around it. I'm not sure I can actually simply answer the question as phrased. There is a huge effort going on to manage risk-weighted assets in GBM. There are a number of initiatives are going to, just naming a few when we bring ABN and RBS together if we're both lending to the same company we don't tend to add one plus one to equal two. That will be a reduced exposure and that's one thing. We are doing a number of treasury initiatives to manage the RWAs dealing with financial counterparties to parts of the risk of &#x2013; certain assets to those counterparties, that's the significant activity.</p>
          <p>It always has been in ABN and RBS and that continues what you say is true but -- in terms of leveraged finance reductions will have gone towards a reduction in our RWAs. But I don't think it's a very significant driver, if you like. There are so many other moving parts. There is the BAL 2 exercise the switch from BAL 1 to BAL 2 and the opportunities that gives again around central management. And that's also shifted the -- where RWAs are, if you see what I mean into the lower end of the credit spectrum. So there are a growing many moving parts.</p>
          <p>I think that the main thing to emphasize is that there's a team absolutely focused on managing this, working with the front end of the business, so we have a very rigorous process to look at our deal pipeline and our incoming business, making decisions early about what sort of things we want to do, what sort of things we don't what to do. And then the team looks at how it affects us like the backend of managing what we do take in to make sure that we hit our respective assets target. And it starts fundamentally with a target. What are we trying to achieve and working towards achieving that target.</p>

          <p>Guy and I are involved in this process, resetting it but our target is set to move those down. And to try and be helpful without answering your question, the moving parts where the meshing together of the business units, a lot of which took place in the first half. And also against that we have some drawdowns from customers, that happen now which we proven up. And we continue to do customer business as we're going to the second half, I think you would not see drawdown part. That's been contained and you wouldn't see so much of the meshing part on the other side of the equation where you see through the weekly process the continuation of the downward momentum and guidance, do I need to touch on?</p>

          <p>Hi. It's <mark type="inaudible" />. Fred, can I just ask you to clarify a couple of your comments on the Insurance business please? I think clearly you've said that if you get a good price for it then you'll sell it, but you're now saying that if actually somebody doesn't offer what you consider to be a sensible price then you wouldn't be too uncomfortable on the capital position to keep it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I'm very anxious not to get teased in this, James, and RBS Insurance is up for sale, full stop. But I think there's been enough value destruction without compounding it by selling a business of that size and importance at a price that is not respectable or reasonable however you want to put it. We have a sense of what that would be and we have a belief we can get to that place. But if we don't then I think we'll give the guidance for the RBS Insurance and you would hopefully have got the sense from my remarks that in terms of where we now said that to where we sat in April.</p>
          <p>The capital ratio is how to move forward more quickly, the de-leveraging has gone well and we'll continue. And there have been a number of disposals &#x2013; there are a number of disposals out there still not just RBS Insurance, which would leave us today sitting in a better place to have confidence that we'd be able to north of 6% without having to sell RBS Insurance. But it's not about RBS Insurance because when we think about growth we have a lot of people working in RBS Insurance and I don't want to be playing with any of the business is for sale and we will progress.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can I just have one more on GBM costs as well? Is there an offset in the GBM cost line, which are the credit write-downs? So, basically what I'm asking is the 2184 the adjusted GBM profit numbers, is that got the negative of write-down stripped out but not the positively cost offset?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The remuneration &#x2013; the compensation number for GBM is an accrual. The final determinant of what the variable compensation will be, will not be taken until the end of the year. But the accrual does, it's 25% down year-on-year and that obviously partly reflects the performance of business net of write-downs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. It's Simon Samuels, Citigroup. It's kind of quite reassuring, actually you seem to have as much trouble forecasting your capital ratios as we do. Because -- I mean I think you said you're well in excess of what you thought you'd be back in April. So, I guess, the question I'm interested in is, I mean how much of being a long way different from what you expected? I see most of that's not to do with higher earnings. It's to do with softer balance sheet contraction. How much of that should we think of as kind of just bringing forward what you thought would have developed in the second half of the year? Or do you think the capital ratios will now be meaningfully in excess of what you thought they'd be at the end of the year back in April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- first of all Simon, I don't think there was any bringing forward of the second half. So I feel the second half is it will &#x2013; what will happen will happen. But I guess when we were sitting back in April time looking at a capital plan going forward. We were very cautious -- I mean at that time the market wasn't exactly what you would call liquid and it's hardly liquid as we speak, although it has improved. So in making assumptions about de-leveraging and so on, we were pretty cautious. We were cautious about the earnings in business, though there's earnings in business it has performed better.</p>
          <p>We'd also -- perhaps one thing that's been brought forward slightly as -- a degree to which we'd have completed disposals in the first half. You remember when Guy was quoting numbers -- where we went north, we'd assumed there'd be no disposals in the first half. So in that respect it's possible bringing forward only in relation to disposals.</p>
          <p>It feels that we've got that kind of mindset thing about de-leveraging the balance sheet of the business, they don't especially like it. That's not to say that we're resisting it. I think for a relationship manager that's usually not what most want to hear. But actually what we've experienced is that, it's not as that as difficult as how you first thought. As with many things once you start it becomes easier. So as I repeat in both that Johnny and Brian and I have and with Guy. So this is nearly comes sort of industrialized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's -- when I look back at slide, what number is it? 41 of yours -- which was showing the -- the 157 billion reduction in GBM assets since March. I mean can you give us any sense -- I mean just concerned about the forecast, can you give us any sense of what kind of pace of decline in assets you think is reasonable for the second half or maybe into '09? I don't know how you're going to answer that but in some way, are you a third of the way through the process or a quarter or a half or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking for a forecast...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean it's a pretty dramatic, a step-change from growth to shrinkage. I mean, I understand why you're asking Simon, it's perfectly fair. I don't have an answer because the other slight uncertainty is about the growth in the business and in terms of loans and advances and the offset there -- was only a big risk. And that's why the thing to be thinking about is this meshing together of the ABN and RBS balance sheets, as Johnny mentioned it'll combine the limits and one and one doesn't make two. We're well through that. And that's a non-recurring element of it. So I mean I don't expect to be seeing the same sort of reduction in the second half as in the first half. But the process will continue.</p>
          <p>As far as 2009 is concerned, we do want to get to a place where the balance sheet is delevered as far as it can sensibly be relatively quick, this is not -- I don't want it to be a long running saga. We want to get down and then do it a little slower from there. So I'm looking at Johnny, I'm looking at Guy for any more specificity we can give?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might add a statement of the obvious, which is we're not heading to zero. I mean we have got a business and there is a central balance sheet that goes with that business and that's where we aim to get it to. And I think all banks all around the world in their activity perhaps a bigger balance sheet than needed to service their customers. But we want to keep the balance sheet that is appropriate to service our customers.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's Tom Rayner from Citigroup. Can I ask more sort of conceptual question on your capital ratios, just looking on page 58 because I noticed that both yourselves and I think Barclays yesterday don't make the sort of Tier-1 deductions from your measure of core capital ratios. And clearly you've indicated that a range of 6 to 7% is where you want to be. I think again in both cases, if you were to make those deductions it would knock about 0.3 off. Now, I'm really interested in what is the right way of thinking about those deductions? Because if I understand them correctly, they largely represent the difference between what Basel II modeling will tell you the losses are likely to be amortized. So accounting actually allows you to take as provisions to your balance sheet and I'm just trying to asking you if that is the correct interpretation and how you think about that in setting what is the right capital ratios for you to be managing the business towards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I concur with your analysis, first of all, I think it's entirely right. We do use the accounting definition of core Tier-1 is consistent with the 4% that we disclosed at the full year results and the 170 basis points improvement is entirely on a like-for-like basis from a regulatory point of view. Some of the deductions that are mandated now are principally the expected loss deduction we have chosen to taken out of a total Tier-1 perspective than from capital point of view total Tier-1 if total Tier-1. So the target we have set have been based off the accounting definition.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things also, Tom, is that -- in size to consistency and transparency they seem to be the most important part of this, what's in core Tier-1 versus total Tier-1. As long as we're consistent in setting our targets and articulating to you, we have been consistent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a quick follow-up just on the de-leveraging question. I'm just trying to get a sense of what's really driving it. I mean do you think at the end of the day it's going to improve your return on equity because you're going to get rid of a lot of low margin maybe inefficient assets? So is it really about helping reach the capital ratio as you want to get to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems to me it's about good business. On the balance sheet, the balance sheet was too big. And as a result of putting ABN and ourselves together. And also in context of the world changing the balance sheet was too big. So that's first and foremost.</p>
          <p>But clearly it does play through into capital ratios. And it will also play through into return on equity. However, cash earnings on cash equity are pretty respectable figures in the first place. But there's been no harm in improving them. But, first and foremost we start from a prudential point of view, and the balance sheet is not where we want it to be for the current climate. So let's move through that. It does impact in capital and it does impact our ROE as well.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's John Kirk with Redburn Partners. Sorry to carry on on the issue of leverage, but I guess I'm interested in whether you can give us an indication of how much actual risk has been removed from the GBM business because the risk-weighted assets are broadly flat on the year? And the trading value at risk has gone up quite a lot. I know that there's probably some ABM AMRO positions missing from the number given for the full year -- sorry for the second half of 2007. But it's still gone up an awful lot between now and then. So, how much risk has actually gone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A big moving part of those would be Sempra. Sempra came in in April. Sempra would be about 20 billion of risk-weighted assets. So if you took that out of the GBM line then it would be down about 10 from a Basel II start to a Basel II half year. And the Bahr is similarly impacted by the inclusion of what's not only stated in ABN AMRO but on Sempra. Bahr is not meant to be a change the risk taking stance but it just mechanically goes up when you include a business like Sempra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, fair enough. But I guess the position is still the same, though? There is as much risk probably if not slightly more in that business now than there was last year? Or am I misinterpreting the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the lessons of the last 12 months is that there is no one ideal measure of risk. There are lots and lots of measures of risk. You comment on Bahr, there's also the market risk input to risk-weighted assets. Actually the market risk input to risk-weighted assets has not gone up by anything like the increase in Bahr. The market risk rating is affected by other things, not just by Bahr.</p>
          <p>But to answer how much risk has been taken out of the balance sheet is a sort of how long is a piece of string question. We definitely have de-risked it. You'd have to take sort of a dashboard of measures and look at them all and take a holistic view say, I can't say it's down 10% or 11.3%. It's just not a question you can answer in those terms. But we have de-risked, undoubtedly. And the overall outcome has been flat notwithstanding the growth in loans and advances to customers, I think is the best sort of, best combination of facts to dwell on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Stolen. Don't worry, I'll hand it over. I only have two. The first question relates to the unrealized losses of 750 million within the AFS that was driven by ABN assets. But just looking for a bit of more color as to which feature of these drove that? And secondly, if you could comment on the &#x20AC;2.5 billion payment that Fortis has flagged as part of its recapitalization plan that its said is owed by yourselves and Santander. How much of that &#x20AC;2.5 billion is your share and when you expect to pay it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The AFS, just in saying totaled around 1.3 billion of which something like 400 or so related to the changing value of the Bank of China investment. Over the balance, about half of that related to ABN conduit business. And no sort of impairments to flag those change in carrying value of those assets reflected through reserves.</p>
          <p>On the Fortis piece, on the 2.5, it was always envisaged in part of our capital plans and as part of the separation plan that we would be both ourselves and Santander providing some additional capital over and above the tangible equity they acquired with the businesses at the time of the acquisition and that was to say indicated around the &#x20AC;2.5 billion. There is a plan to do that by way of pressing share in the second half of this year. And we estimate the impact on our capital ratios would be around 3 basis points and that's taken into the plans that we have.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. It's Sandy Chen from Panmure Gordon. I'm trying to sort of carry on the risk-weighted asset discussion I think between Jonathan and Johnny. I noticed on page 68 on the credit derivatives line item, just on the face of the balance sheet, there's been a big increase both on asset and liability side in credit derivatives from about &#xA3;34 billion at the end of last year to about &#xA3;63 billion on the asset side end of June. Now I think Johnny had talked about using risk to transfer to sort of mitigate any increases in risk-weightings. My question really is given what some others have been taking in terms of CDS write-downs related to counterparty risks, is there a risk that the sort of one do you see any counterparty risks in that CDS position, especially keeping in mind that the notional contracts have probably grown from the 2.4 trillion that it was added year-end? And would there be an associated risk-weighting impact as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, then the size of those exposures are a function both of nominal contracts outstanding as well as volatility in the underlying asset class. But as we do with all derivative contracts, we provide a credit valuation reserve against the size of that exposure. And if the exposure has increased to whatever counterparty it is and we will be providing and depending on the underlying financial strength of that counterparty a larger or smaller reserve to be taken into consideration in completing our risk-weighted assets.</p>

          <p>Obviously, the more risky the counterparty is we've sort of demonstrated, for instance, with more reserve we put up there. If you have highly rated financial institutions and banking groups in your counterparties you'd have a correspondingly smaller number.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert Law of Lehman. I've got three bites and I'll try to keep them brief. You've in the past given the size of your investment portfolio. Could you update us on where that is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>12. I think you could say 12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's a very different sort of portfolio these days. That 12 is mostly made up of ABN assets, which are typically fixed income assets, four of which are rental assets. They have got some equity upside but eight is much more debt securities type assets. So don't think that we've got probably enough equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly on the risk-weighted assets question, can I ask you to comment on the effects of pro-cyclicality in Basel II in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will depend on sort of ratings migration over the course of the second half and how things have gone. I think we still, I think we mentioned at the time of the rights issue, we estimated this sort of year one impact of a 1990-style recession as being in the sort of 30 to 50 basis point range. You could probably narrow that down to something like the 40 to 50 basis point range that have been talked about. And sort of still remains our estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, can I ask you to give some more color on the increase in impairment charges in GBM up to the 300 million? Is there any particular region there? Is there any particular type of loan or indeed the size of loan that's caused that because I don't see other banks are seeing that at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, not really Robert I mean there are half a dozen that's sort of 30-odd, the tight numbers and there's no common feature of that half dozen so I don't think it's useful to try and generalize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was 294 and that does include about &#xA3;100 million of an impairment recorded against an IFS security, that's again as part of the de-risking exercise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we have one remaining question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Alexander from M&amp;G. It's a question about impairments again. I'm a bit surprised by the small growth in the problem loans and non-performing loans in GBM given your well-known appetite for rather risky leveraged-property transactions around Europe. And a German bank did announce a rather large provision a couple of days ago and for I think a transaction that you are co-leading with them in. They announced &#x20AC;250 million and you don't seem to have announced anything if outside. And I'm just wondering what's going on with the Spanish property lending, German property lending that you've been doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We answer in the first half of, first of all, I don't accept the premise about the where we do all the risky lending in Europe, if I can just part that point. Secondly, the definition of non-performing loans and potential problem loans is run by Risks and they bring forward that's the number and that is the trend. Again it probably might reflect the de-risking point. I don't know whether that is why it hasn't gone up as much as you would expect, but that is the number produced by the Independent Risk department. And thirdly, Spanish property, yeah, a difficult market. We are working with some of our customers there. We have appropriate provision today. And I'm very comfortable with that looking forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The property exposure in Spain is about...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, what we are looking like today, can't be that good given the number of bankruptcies going on, it's probably developers and you have to be proactive in lending to property developers so I'm wondering how you're not seeing more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We tend to be very much at the larger end of the high quality end. We haven't got a big property developer book. We've got two or three, maybe four or five names. And they're pretty good names, notwithstanding the comments you made about the German bank and our share exposure there. By and large, we're with the better quality names. Obviously, we're all watching that closely and are working at, working with our customers to see it through. But we are provisioned appropriately as of the 30th of June.</p>
