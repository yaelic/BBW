        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Cecilia, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, no surprises in the fourth quarter. Three takeaways: first, solid execution with strong margin expansion on the back of sustained cost traction. Secondly, commercial aerospace and long-cycle commercial construction markets remain tough, but we did see some improvement in our short-cycle businesses. And finally, very strong cash flow performance as a result of our continued focus on working capital.</p>
          <p>So the story remains the same. We're continuing to focus on structural cost reduction, process excellence in our factories, in our supply chain and back-office functions, as well as focused portfolio realignment and disciplined cash redeployment.</p>
          <p>None of this is new. All of these actions contributed to full-year segment operating margin expansion of 50 basis points to a record 14.3%, adjusted for restructuring and one-time items. And we accomplished this in a declining revenue environment.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was 118% of net income and included 1.3 billion of total pension contributions; that's significantly more than we anticipated. UTC also announced strategic acquisitions such as GE Security while divesting lower-return noncore businesses, particularly at Carrier. Full-year revenues were $53 billion, and that's down 11% year over year. Earnings per share were $4.12, and that's down 16% versus 2008. Absent restructuring and one-time items, earnings were down 8%.</p>
          <p>Fourth-quarter performance was solid across our businesses, despite continuing end-market weakness, and we returned to EPS growth excluding restructuring and one-time items. Full segment operating profit grew 8% on a revenue decline of 3%. And nowhere was this solid performance more evident than at Carrier where portfolio rationalization and cost actions allowed operating profit to grow 34% in the quarter on a revenue decline of 12%.</p>
          <p>Four of six business units improved margins, with Otis, Carrier and Fire and Security increasing margins by more than 100 basis points each. Sikorsky's 10.4% operating margin in the quarter puts it firmly on track to achieve its margin targets in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.15; that's down 7%. Excluding restructuring and one-time items in both quarters, earnings per share increased 5% on 4% lower revenues. Foreign currency was a tailwind with an impact of about $0.04 from translation. Organic revenue declined 6% in the quarter with declines across all businesses except Sikorsky, which saw 22% organic revenue growth and delivered a record 84 aircraft in the quarter, bringing the total to 244 large aircraft for the year.</p>
          <p>Restructuring and other charges were 135 million in the quarter. That's 830 million for the year. We continue to drive productivity throughout our operations and UTC's head count is now down by nearly 18,000 since the beginning of the year, before the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Fourth quarter order rates remain stable, although continuing at the low levels we saw in the third quarter. However, as I noted before, trends in our short-cycle commercial businesses have improved. For example, U.S. residential gas furnace and split-unit shipments were up 13% in the quarter. In addition, new equipment orders in China grew about 15% for Otis and around 20% for Carrier. Akhil'll take you through the orders detail by business unit in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, free cash flow was 107% of net income at 1.2 billion, and that included 637 million of contributions to our global pension plans. Solid cash flow resulted from good working capital performance across the business. Inventory was again a source of cash. We reduced inventory by 550 million in the quarter on top of over 450 million in the third quarter, so more than $1 billion of inventory out in the last half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Share repurchase in the quarter was 320 million, bringing the year-to-date total to 1.1 billion. Acquisition spend in the quarter was 146 million. And just as a reminder, we expect the GE Security deal to close early in the second quarter now. We ended the year with a strong debt-to-capital ratio of 32%; that's down from 41% last year.</p>
          <p>So no surprises here. Just as we told you in December, it's a quarter where we saw continued margin expansion, excellent cash flow, and a still difficult end-market environment.</p>
          <p>I'll come back and talk a little bit about 2010, but for now let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Turning to page three of the webcast, let me remind you that I will talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and nonrecurring items, as we usually do.</p>
          <p>Otis had another exceptional quarter, with profits up 20%, despite a 1% decline in revenues. Operating margin expanded 390 basis points to 22%. Excluding currency and last year's charge for inventory and other adjustments in Brazil, profits grew 6% on 7% lower revenues, due to aggressive cost reductions, lower commodity prices and continued strength in the contractual maintenance business.</p>
          <p>New equipment revenue was down 14% in the quarter, excluding currency, with declines in most major markets partially offset by a double-digit increase in China. Service revenue was about flat, as continued growth in the contractual maintenance business offset declines in both modernization and repair.</p>
          <p>New equipment orders in the quarter were down 15% at constant currency. We saw growth in China, where orders were up about 15%. Orders for Europe as a whole were flat, while orders in North America were down around 50%. For the full-year, margins expanded by 250 basis points to 21.8%. Operating profit was up 2% despite a revenue decline of 9% from swift cost reduction actions and commodity tailwind. At constant currency, operating profit increased 7% on 5% lower revenues.</p>
          <p>On slide four, turning to Carrier, consistent with guidance, Carrier returned to profit growth in the quarter with operating profit up 34% on 12% lower revenues. This translates into 230 basis points of margin expansion, bringing the margin to 6.7% for the quarter, the second highest Q4 margin in this last decade. Carrier continues on the path of aggressive transformation to a simpler, more focused, higher returns business. In Q4, the benefits of ongoing aggressive cost reduction and organizational restructuring, combined with lower commodity costs, more than offset the impact of lower revenues.</p>
          <p>While organic revenues were still down 8% in the quarter, we are seeing improvement in the rate of revenue decline at Carrier. In fact, volume is up in the U.S. residential HVAC and truck trailer businesses. Two full shipments of U.S. residential splits and gas furnaces combined were up year-over-year for the first time since Q1 of 2006. For Carrier transit coal, in total, orders were down only a little over 10% at constant currency, an improvement from the nearly 40% decline in the first three quarters of 2009.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there was no meaningful change in the rate of decline of longer-cycle commercial HVAC business, where revenues were down mid-teens organically and we saw new equipment orders there fall by about 20% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>For the year, Carrier results were in line with guidance, with adjusted earnings down $523 million on 24% lower revenues. Operating margin for the year was down 170 basis points. However, proactive cost reduction and restructuring actions contributed more than 275 basis points of margin and partially mitigated the impact of the steep volume decline.</p>
          <p>UTC Fire and Security delivered another solid quarter with operating margin expansion of 130 basis points to a record 13.1% on 2% higher revenues. Organically, revenues contracted 9% with high-single-digit declines in both Fire Safety and electronic security. Foreign currency translation and net acquisitions increased revenue by 8% and 3%, respectively. Operating profit was up 14%. Excluding the impact of FX, profits grew 5%.</p>
          <p>Fire and Security continues to realize the benefits of integration of the field operations, organizational delayering, restructuring and cost controls. Despite the lower revenues, productivity initiatives drove down overhead by more than 100 basis points in the quarter from a year ago. Consistent with our guidance, Fire and Security held profit flat year over year, while revenues declined 14%, resulting in 150 basis points of margin expansion for the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Aerospace, on slide six, at Pratt &amp; Whitney revenues declined 9% in the quarter, driven primarily by the lower overall aftermarket volume and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada engine shipments. Engine shipments were down at Pratt Canada over 30% from last year's strong fourth quarter. Large commercial engine space were also down over 30%, partly due to tougher compares as 2008 Q4 included the benefit from a JV 90 distribution agreement. Book to bill in the quarter was about one. Military revenues were up mid-teens on higher engine deliveries.</p>
          <p>Operating profit at Pratt declined 9% in the quarter. The impact from lower revenues, particularly of higher margin spares, and unfavorable foreign currency at Pratt Canada was partially offset by fewer large commercial engine shipments, lower E&amp;D and restructuring benefits. Also, you will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2008 Pratt &amp; Whitney had recorded a favorable adjustment to a commercial engine program worth less than $0.02 of EPS. For the full year, Pratt &amp; Whitney operating profit declined 8% on 10% lower revenues. Operating margin at 16.1% was up 40 basis points for the year in spite of 25% decline in higher margin large commercial engine spares.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, in the quarter Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were down 8% with Aero OEM down high single digit, industrial businesses down low teens, and Aero aftermarket down slightly. Commercial spare revenues were down high teens, with book to bill of about one. Provisioning order rates remained depressed and were down over 35% as airlines continue to conserve cash. Industrial orders were down slightly over 10% in the quarter on constant currency. However, they were slightly higher on a sequential basis from Q3.</p>
          <p>Operating profit declined 14% primarily from greater volume reductions in the higher margin businesses and the absence of an acquisition-related liability adjustment last year. The decline was partially offset by lower E&amp;D expenses, primarily on the 787 program as expected. We continue to invest in the program although at a lower rate as Boeing moves toward certification and entering the service of the 787. For the year, Hamilton Sundstrand revenues were down 9% with operating profit down 13% from the decline in higher margin commercial spares and industrial businesses, partially offset by benefits from restructuring and cost reduction actions.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sikorsky, record levels were achieved in Q4 for revenue, operating profit and aircraft deliveries. Operating profits grew 33% on 22% higher revenues. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 84 large helicopters, 57 based on military platforms and 27 commercial. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 10.4% from higher helicopter shipments and product cost reductions. During the quarter, Sikorsky's BLACK HAWK helicopter fleet surpassed 1 million flight hours in Iraq and Afghanistan without a single significant failure. For the year, Sikorsky delivered a record 244 aircraft, above the high-end of its commitment of 230 to 240 aircraft deliveries. Consistent with the guidance last December, operating profits grew 29% on 18% higher revenues. Operating margin of 9.7% for 2009 is up 80 basis points year over year, and as Greg said, puts Sikorsky firmly on track to achieve its margin targets in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Just on slide nine on the webcast, just to summarize 2009, excellent execution through structural cost reduction and portfolio realignment, along with strong cash performance in a difficult end-market environment. Margins improved despite lower volumes, and we positioned the business for continued margin expansion when volume does return. This is evident in our earnings-per-share conversion.</p>
          <p>Excluding restructuring and one-time items, EPS declined 8% on a revenue decline of 11%. Free cash flow was 118% of net income, and that included 1.3 billion of global pension contributions. We drove down working capital by over $1 billion, and inventory was down 8% for the year on an organic revenue decline of 7%. We also returned about 2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends during the year.</p>
          <p>Although 2009 was a tough year, there was a lot of good progress made across our businesses. Otis improved its industry-leading operating margins with best-in-class products, service and operating performance. Carrier completed two-thirds of its portfolio realignment agenda with simpler, more focused, higher returns business. Fire and Security significantly enhanced its geographic and product breadth with the GE Security and GST acquisitions. Pratt &amp; Whitney launched testing of a full-scale GTF engine core and delivered its final development JSF CTOL engine as it readies for decades of production.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Sundstrand systems successfully supported the 787 first flight, and Sikorsky continued to increase its production velocity with record aircraft deliveries in the fourth quarter and for the year. On ACE, we achieved Louis's goal of 70% ACE gold and silver sites across the business by year-end 2009. We also made significant progress towards deploying ACE at our key suppliers. In fact, 50% of key supplier spend was at ACE gold and performing sites at the end of 2009. This is the type of performance that you've come to expect from UTC and gives us confidence that we have positioned the company for earnings growth in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Turning to 2010, in December Louis provided EPS guidance range for 2010 of 4.40 to 4.65. That's growth of 7 to 13% on revenues of 54 to 55 billion. And we're affirming that guidance today.</p>
          <p>Okay. So let's take just a couple minutes to talk about calendarization. First, on organic revenue growth. While we still expect to see full-year growth of 0 to 2%, organic growth in the first half of the year could be flat to slightly down, and we'll likely see decline of 2 to 3% in the first quarter. And while that is down, it is still a significant improve from the 6% organic revenue decline we saw in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The pressure on growth comes from the fact that we saw good backlog conversion into revenues in early 2009. As an example, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada shipped almost 1000 engines in the first quarter of 2009, and that dropped to about 700 by the fourth quarter, and that's the rate we expect will remain through most of this year. Otis new equipment backlog is also down about 15% from last year, and commercial Aero aftermarket activity is only expected to pick up as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>In spite of these headwinds, we expect restructuring benefits, a continuing focus on cost control, and favorable currency translation to provide earnings growth in the first half consistent with our full-year earnings growth expectation of 7 to 13% growth. On cash flow we continue to expect free cash flow equal to or in excess of net income. As Louis stated in December, the acquisition placeholder is 3 billion, and that includes the GE Security transaction. Share repurchase guidance is 1.5 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>With our seasoned management team, structural cost reduction and significant aftermarket content, we are well positioned to resume earnings growth and outperform in 2010. So let's stop there and open up the call for questions. Cecilia?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to pick up where you left off on calendarization, can you talk about how you expect restructuring net of gains to stay severe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for the full year we're expecting about $350 million of restructuring, about 200 million in the first half, probably spread evenly across those two quarters. We also expect gains for the year of about 100 million, and I think we'll see 25 million of gains here in the first quarter and then 75 some time in the third, fourth quarter, so 250 net.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; that's very helpful. And then turning to Otis margins, can you maybe just talk about what you've seen on the OE pricing and maybe if you throw in the OE margins. Are you seeing any pressure on the OE margins within Otis? And then, if you adjust for mix, you know, a normal mix of between OE and aftermarket, where do you think the long-run margins for Otis are? Is this a low 20s business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start with the last part of that question. Absolutely; we think this is a 20%-plus margin business going forward. I think with the cost that Didier and team have taken out over this past year and with the strong aftermarket franchise, 20% is a goal that ought to be achievable, not just for one year but on a continuing basis.</p>
          <p>As far as pricing, pricing has been difficult. As you would expect with new equipment orders down 50% here in North America, we've seen very difficult pricing. And as a result I think you're going to see a little bit of pressure on new equipment margins coming into 2010.</p>
          <p>Saw pricing pressure in China; that's a continuing thing. Even in Europe we saw pricing pressure. In fact, I think we have been or Didier and team have been disciplined. We lost a little bit of share in 2010 at Otis, but I think we did not give up on pricing. And that cost us share, but I think it's good discipline for us to keep pricing where it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that's right. And then just finally, can you remind us on the other temporary cost reductions in 2009, how much of that is coming back in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's about $750 million of &#x2013; let's call it &#x2013; temporary cost reductions; you know, that's furloughs, merit deferrals. Probably see about half of that come back in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Joe Nadol, J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank. Greg, just first of all on the calendarization of the sales, is that different than six weeks ago or you just giving a little bit more color on that now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's exactly as Louis had explained. It's just, as we started to look, revenues had been getting better, although still down throughout 2009 and that trend's going to continue where you're going to see slower growth in the first half than the back half. We've always talked about kind of a back-half recovery in the economy. So nothing new; just trying to get a little bit of specificity out there so we don't surprise people if we see earnings &#x2013; not earnings but revenues down. Earnings'll certainly be up in the first half, but revenues could well be down, especially in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything that's changed? So what would you highlight across all the businesses from when you gave your guidance six weeks ago then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's changed in my mind is really some of the performance we saw at Carrier short-cycle businesses, where we saw really good traction I think in the U.S. res business. We also saw good traction at transit coal in the truck trailer business in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, U.S. res turned for the first time as you mentioned in I guess almost four years. Do you think that's sustainable? Do you think you'll be in the black every quarter in terms of growth rate in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that I want to comment or predict quarterly growth rates, but yes, we see growth throughout 2010 at Carrier in the res business. It's going to be on the back of housing and an economic recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Joe, Geraud can give more color on that certainly at the March meeting when we're together with you guys.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Greg, just on this phasing discussion, just make sure I'm clear, you're saying you would expect the 7 to 13% EPS growth for the full year to be kind of consistent throughout the year. And just to make sure we're on the right starting point, $0.78 Q1 '09, so we're sort of implying a range of 0.83 to 0.88 for the first quarter. Just want to be clear on that. Am I missing something there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well, that's how the math would work out. But yeah, I think what we're trying to do is just make sure everybody understands that first quarter there's going to be a tough compare versus last year on the revenue line, because again you came out of 2008 with very strong backlog and still good production out of Pratt. So revenues are going to be a little challenge. I think you're going to see good cost traction the first quarter. Sikorsky's going to have a good first quarter because they're not going to have the settlement cost from the union negotiation. We're getting good cost traction. See, I think I'm not going to give quarterly guidance; I just want to make sure everybody understands it's just a tough compare. But yeah, 7 to 13 each quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then on the commercial spares at Pratt, I just wonder if you can calibrate kind of what happened sequentially there and kind of what you are expecting in the first quarter there. The down 30% was down more sequentially on a year-over-year basis, but did the spares number go down sequentially as well? And would you expect we're sort of running along the bottom here in the first half, or could there be another leg down there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, this is Akhil. We typically see a pickup in the fourth quarter of spares; that is just a normal calendarization. We saw that again this year. The reason why year-over-year compares were tougher was because of this agreement we had last year on JV 90, which propped up these spares last year in fourth quarter. So if you adjust for that, the year-over-year run rate would be about 25%, which is consistent with what we have seen through the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And at some point the airlines will have to buy these spares. The question is, when does that happen as traffic improves? Probably first half may be a little difficult, but I think second half should be strong.</p>
          <p>A &#x2013; Gregory Hayes&gt;: Yeah, I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Go ahead, Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just we don't expect, Terry, to see another leg down here in commercial Aero. I think it's been &#x2013; what we saw last year we think was the bottom. Airline profitability is still a challenge going into 2010, but we are seeing better inductions into the engine centers and we would expect to see spare pick up, as Akhil said, kind of gradually through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to be clear, there really is nothing changed on your commercial aftermarket view overall for Pratt and Hamilton relative to December. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. We still think they're kind of up 6, 7% for the year, about half of that on rpm growth and the other half on pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on China, Greg, you had talked about China running a little bit better in December. And the order rate that you called out on the commercial side certainly reinforced that. I'm just wondering your take on kind of the tightening efforts and what impact that might have on kind of China in the second half of your 2010 year at this point in terms of what your field people are telling you in terms of conversations with customers and so forth there. Do you think that we're going to see a little bit of a moderation in growth in some of those numbers in the second half, or how're you looking at that now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Terry, what we are hearing from our folks in China is that the bank lending is starting to tighten. I think we've seen that across the headlines here for the last couple of weeks, and that's really focused on trying to keep some of the economic growth, the factories and some of the residential housing prices, in check to eliminate the possibility of an asset bubble there.</p>
          <p>We're still seeing good order intake, though, on the infrastructure and on the low-end housing market, which is where Otis plays primarily, as well as Carrier. So we're still expecting a good full-year 2010, and in fact they're still going to spend &#x2013; what? &#x2013; 250 billion of stimulus in China this year on the infrastructure projects on that low-end residential housing. So, yeah, again, the idea there is you got to keep growth from getting out of control, but I think we still are expecting 9 to 10% GDP growth kind of evenly throughout the year there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean at the total commercial level, is there a way &#x2013; Can you call out what growth in China was overall in '9 and maybe what you would think is a reasonable range for 2010 to calibrate us there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, I can give you the specific details later on. I think the &#x2013; for the fourth quarter we saw roughly, you know, 15 to 20% kind of growth in the order rates across all our commercial businesses, and I think in terms of revenues because there's a little bit of a lag, probably little less than that, but still pretty good growth, double-digit growth, in China across &#x2013; in revenues and 15 to 20% on orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to be clear, though, Terry, orders were down for the year. Otis orders in China were down about 15% for the whole year. For Carrier it was down &#x2013; I want to say &#x2013; about 10 to 12% for the year. So it was a very tough first half. We saw good traction in the back half and that traction's really going to continue throughout 2010.</p>

          <p>Hey, David.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Greg, your flattish revenue forecast for Carrier for the year, can you just walk through all the different moving pieces there between what you're expecting specifically out of res and commercial and transit coal and then the offset with the divested revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; let's start with divested revenues first, David. There is about 500 million of divested revenue impact next year. That's just for the annualized effect of divestitures done in 2009. There is organic growth of low single digit, call it 3% or so, in the assumptions overall. And the breakdown of that would be growth, a double-digit growth in U.S. residential, you know, 10 to 20% sort of level for transport refrigeration, offset by a decline in commercial HVAC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Terrific. And at Otis, are you still thinking on the new equipment side down mid- to high single digits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think given where we ended the year with orders down and backlog down about 15%, it'll probably be towards the higher end of that range on the downside, probably closer to 9% or so down for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the guidance you gave for 2010 back at the investor conference, I think you talked about 0.20 to $0.25 contingency at the midpoint. Obviously the dollar's moved a little bit against you since then. Is there anything that's made up for that move in the dollar, or you've kind of <mark type="inaudible" /> your contingency a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when Louis stood up, we talked about a contingency at the midpoint, which is about 10% growth, where we had about 275 million of contingency. I think the Euro this morning's about 1.41 versus our guidance of 1.48. And that's cost us &#x2013; let's call it &#x2013; 100 million, 75 &#x2013; Akhil's going to correct me here &#x2013; $75 million.</p>
          <p>But we have had some good news on the pension plan. The discount rate on the pension plan, we'd assumed assume 5.7 back in December; ended up being around 6% for the U.S. plan. We also had a little better returns, and we did a little bit more funding for the pension plan. So you add all that up and it gives us about $50 million of benefit versus the guidance that we gave you in December. So that's a long way of saying, contingency's probably about 250 today at the midpoint.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple. Hi, Greg and Akhil; good morning. Could you talk for a minute about foreign military sales for Sikorsky? I know that's going to be part of what happens going forward &#x2013; the opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the biggest opportunity in front of us right now, Howard, is with the international BLACK HAWK, and I think the biggest opportunity on that program is going to be in Turkey in the near term. That's a very large contract that's up for bid right now; we're competing with AgustaWestland. So I think we'll see &#x2013; we'll hear on that contract shortly.</p>
          <p>But the key for us on the international BLACK HAWK is low-cost sourcing and low-cost manufacturing. We're gearing up in Mielec in Poland to build the international BLACK HAWK there, significantly lower cost obviously than Stratford. So we think there's a huge market out there. The U.S. market, the European market, is pretty well spoken for. But international, BLACK HAWK, still opportunities, we think, in Taiwan and Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second, you know from time to time, the JSF has been a topic and this might be good opportunity for you to give us an update on the progress on the engine and how well it's going, so that you eliminate some of the confusion that's floating around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Howard, I don't think there's any &#x2013; there shouldn't be any confusion on the development of the engine. The engine is performed beautifully in the flight test program. We had a little hiccup about a year ago with a blade, but I think all of that's behind us and we are on track; we're delivering engines under the LRIP [low rate initial production] program right now. The Stovall version is in test; that's also performing very well. So we see nothing but upside on that program right now for about &#x2013; from an engine standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, that's encouraging. And then second, when you &#x2013; and then last, frankly, when you look at your outlook for Carrier, how are you weighing the risks of the stimulus for housing abating and maybe even market petering out? How are you balancing that risk versus Gs at 550,000 units a year? It's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the 550,000 was obviously a low point, and we do expect modest growth, I would tell you, in housing this year. But you think about U.S. res, it's really become an add-on replacement market. Over 80% of the revenues in res now come from add-on replacement. So housing, new housing starts, make up a very small percentage of total revenue there. So again, AOR, as we would call it, is really more dependent upon overall economic growth as opposed to growth in housing. So housing price stabilization is important, I think, for consumer confidence. And we expect all of that to be positive this year, but not in a big way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're sizing for &#x2013; I know you hurt &#x2013; you modest growth, but you looked at the downside and feel like some of this stimulus is &#x2013; you're just being careful that if some of the stimuluses has a transitory effect, it won't impact your business plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think &#x2013; I think, Carrier's pretty well calibrated on the res side. We don't expect much impact from the elimination of the housing tax credit here. I think that happens in March or April, but quite frankly, with 550,000 starts, it's hard to imagine a lower 2010.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Can we get an update on transit coal? That looks like that you recovered nicely from last quarter, the ordered falloff. Is that &#x2013; do you have some visibility on that business now? You think the worst is behind you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think, Deane, as the truck trailer business clearly seeing improvement North America, Northern Europe, but both grew in terms of orders year-over-year. The container business is still down year-over-year in orders, but lot better than the 80% numbers that we quoted earlier in the past. So clearly some signs of improvement there. Like the U.S. HVAC &#x2013; residential HVAC market, I think we believe transport refrigeration is probably an early indicator and that's an encouraging sign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then the other early indicator, as you say, Akhil, is the residential HVAC business of Carrier. Now we've got a different dynamic this year with the Watsco joint venture. Is there anything in terms of how we'll be watching inventories in the channel? Is it &#x2013; will it be more difficult for us to track that, and what is the assessment of inventories today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Deane, that our visibility to inventories remains the same. Remember, this is a joint venture we have with Watsco, called Carrier Enterprises. So we still see what is going on in the marketplace, and as we continue to divest out of some of the distribution, we'll continue to have equity stakes in these ventures to give us visibility. Inventory is down across the channel, and I think that's actually an encouraging sign for us because when we see a pickup, any pickup in economic activity, we're going to have our factories back up and running to support that. So I think it's, it's down in line with the market, but upside for us for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just to clarify, and you updated the numbers on restructuring expectations for 2010. And can you just reaffirm or &#x2013; on the savings for expected incremental savings on the carryover from '09 and then the new restructuring initiatives on 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deane, we have about $350 million of savings in 2010 from the restructuring actions taken in 2009, and a little bit from the 2010 program that we have on the anvil here. Keep in mind that those savings will come more early in the year and then little less as we got some good savings last year, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So the 350 is what you talked about in December. And can you calibrate the expected on 2010 yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think 2010 you're looking at probably less than 50 million of incremental savings this year. Most of that payback is going to really come in 2011 and 2012 as we're <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; we're taking on some of the longer-haul restructuring, some of the more structural things like factories and such that you don't see the payback right away, but it's still maybe 50ish million this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And just to be clear, the 350 we said in December contemplated at 15 net. Because, as you recall, the 2009 restructuring savings are profiled at 300 in '09, 300 in '10 and another 100 in '11.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see the equity markets every day. You know &#x2013; the fact is, prices have recovered, right? And I think that's maybe the message of the day, as we think about the M&amp;A pipeline, that there's still a lot of targets out there. But pricing has certainly firmed up from what it was a year ago when we talked about being aggressive on the acquisition front.</p>
          <p>I would &#x2013; there's really nothing to talk about in terms of the pipeline, except to say that it's full. We're going to be disciplined and we're not going to do a big deal; we're not looking to do a big deal. What we're looking for are more deals like Clipper Windpower, where we can add to some of our capabilities and take advantage of some good valuations. And you may see more smaller deals like that during the course of the year. But again, it's more in the core. We're not looking for the big deal.</p>

          <p>Yeah, we &#x2013; the engine is on test. It started in mid-December or so on full-scale testing up in Canada. It's performing as we expected. The program, the C-series program, continues on track. Lots of talk out there in the market about the C-series. MRJ or the Mitsubishi Regional Jet &#x2013; that program has slipped a little bit, as you know, but the engine continues to work. And we're working with the other OEMs as well on potential re-engining opportunities, and I think there's lots of pull from airline customers for what the GTF has to offer, which is 10 to 15% better fuel burn and lower noise, lower emissions and all those good things. So, again, we think 2010'll be a very good year for the GTF. We see lots of opportunities, and we'll just update you as we go along.</p>

I just wanted to follow up on the comment you made about the spares and if you ex out the JT90 comparison, pricing usually changes on Jan 1, and I guess I'm wondering, one, did you see a prebuy in December ahead of that, and can you talk about what the realized price actually was at &#x2013; for spares in 2010 versus 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Sam, that's &#x2013; we typically see the prebuy at Pratt and this year was no different than that. The level, I would say, is also consistent with what we've seen in the past years, and the pricing realization is also consistent with what we see every year. So it's no new news there, no surprises. Everything as you would expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the $577 million reduction in inventories in the fourth quarter &#x2013; can you talk about where that mostly came out of? And as we think about a recovery in the businesses during 2010, are you going to be able to hold inventories at these levels, or should we start to see that grow in 2010 versus '9?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's clearly the challenge, Sam, is to keep inventories in check and to improve turns as we some of demand come back.</p>
          <p>In terms of the reduction for the fourth quarter, about 450 million of it, of that five &#x2013; let's call it 550 ex acquisitions and all that, five &#x2013; 450, came from Carrier, Pratt and Sikorsky. It's good news at Sikorsky; you would expect that on those high shipments. Otis also had a good quarter, taking out almost $90 million of inventory. So really good &#x2013; in fact, each one of the businesses actually took out inventory during the fourth quarter. So good performance across all the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just one last question. The deferred income tax line of the 415 million or so in terms of the cash &#x2013; what is that related to in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really related to the pension contributions that we made, primarily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Covered a lot of ground. I got a couple things, though. Greg, just on the inventory, both for the quarter and the year, was &#x2013; did that end up being a net negative or positive to the P&amp;L? In other words, you had absorption issues as a result of that, but you also probably cut into some LIFO layers along the way. How do you think that shook out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in total it was a net negative to the year. We had big absorption across most of the businesses, as you can imagine, with Carrier's volume down as much as it was. At Hamilton, I think the absorption impact was over $100 million alone.</p>
          <p>There was a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from LIFO. That came partially from divesting of some of those Carrier distribution businesses, but also just on the lower volume. So on a net basis, I would tell you it was a big negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The flip side of Howard's question on stimulus. Stimulus for energy retrofit on commercial has been kind of AWOL. Have you guys seen any uptick in energy performance contracting or anything on the commercial side that mutes the negative headwinds in 2010 on commercial OE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've certainly seen good traction at the NORESCO business, which is the energy services contracting business that we bought in late 2008. They've got a very strong backlog. The problem there is, it's a $200 million or so business as compared to the total totality of the commercial HVAC business, so it's going to be improving this year. We have seen good traction on the government side, which is where they focus. But in terms of stimulus impacting or energy efficiency impacting the rest of the BSS, it's really pretty moderate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only real benefit, Jeff, has been in the U.S. residential business where the mix is better because of the rebate for 15 seal equipment. That has driven the mix up which has helped the margin a little bit; again, not meaningful, but that's certainly been the most positive impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on Carrier resi in particular, can you give us a little color on how price cost dynamics are playing out? Obviously, everybody's hearing some footsteps on cost and we're running at real low utilization rates. What do you think is the shape of pricing as the year unfolds here? What's going on in channels right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think pricing is probably the one question mark we have and maybe the biggest risk when you think about Carrier for the year. And that's going to &#x2013; as volumes pick up, we know that there's excess capacity in the channel out there.</p>
          <p>I think that the good news from a Carrier perspective on a cost side &#x2013; over the last year and a half, Carrier has actually reduced the break-even point at its factory, the big res factory in Tennessee, from about a 50% volume to 25%. So we think we've got a cost advantage out there. Obviously, copper could be a headwind if we see that start to pick up here as we have in the last quarter. But from a cost perspective, I think we feel pretty good. Pricing is the great unknown, and again, we have to stay disciplined, just like Otis stayed disciplined last year. I think Carrier's going to have to remain disciplined and not give up on pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess just finally on GTF, obviously there's been a lot of development dollars expended along the way here for years as you work on this, but if one of the big commercial OEs kind of actually hits the bid, if you will, on an re-engining program, what kind of inflection in E&amp;D spending would that trigger as it relates to the GTF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you could &#x2013; obviously there would be a big bill associated with any re-engining of one of the large commercial transports, be it a 737 or A320. The good news of course is, we have partners out there that would absorb a big chunk of that, but you would see an inflection. You probably wouldn't see it in 2010; it's probably more a 2011 phenomena, because even if something were &#x2013; Pratt were selected this year, that's a ramp-up spend, and I don't think you're going to see it til 2011 and really probably even 2012, 2013 before you get to the bigger dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an idea, though, of order of magnitude even after once you dish off pieces to partners and the like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, well &#x2013; it's a big number. I think the question is, you know, how much of it to goes to the partner share and how much of it ends up on our P&amp;L. But if you think about it, Pratt spends $700 million a year on E&amp;D now, so obviously other programs will go down. This'll replace a piece of that spending, but you'll probably still see an incremental number, but it's not &#x2013; you're not talking about 2 or 300 million a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Greg, going back to the aerospace aftermarket on the commercial side, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how orders in this area have progressed over the last quarter and if possible into this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to get down to daily and weekly order rates discussion here. I think the market is trending as we expected; I think that's probably the best way to put it. Obviously fourth quarter was pretty similar to the third quarter when you adjust out everything. So we didn't see a big change sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. But the market is really progressing as we would expect. That's kind of this slow gradual recovery that we talked about earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as you talk to your airlines customers, Ed, do you get the sense that this de-stocking trend is coming to end or there's further to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, you know, again 2009 was all about cash conservation. I think the airlines'll probably lose money globally again in 2010, but they are still flying and I think as we see in the reported results of such that the U.S. majors, you know, it looks better. They've done a great job on cost, raising revenues. And I would expect as they continue to fly these aircraft that they're going to need parts. You know, we expect rpms to probably be up about 3% this year and as long as they fly, they're flying our engines &#x2013; we haven't seen a big uptick in parked aircraft &#x2013; again, I think that all bodes well for a recovery here in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, on the acquisitions and disposal, you said GE is expected to close early. Do you expect that to be material?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry &#x2013; what do you mean by &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; material?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said that GE was going to be &#x2013; GE Fire and Security acquisition was going to close slightly earlier than you expected. Is that going to have a material impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think as you think about, we talked about first half, we just got U.S. and Canadian antitrust approval. We're in the queue in the EU to have approval in late February. So we'll probably close, you know, 30 days or so after that. If you think about it for the whole year, we're not expecting any type of net pickup in terms of accretion dilution. We're going to issue some debt to pay for the deal; we'll do that right around the close time. So we think interest expense, it offsets what we expect to be about $80 million or so of profit that we're going to see for the year from the acquisition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just as a reminder, Rob, I think when Louis said in December, it's consistent with that. Our guidance assumed about an April close at that time with 800 million of revenues and 75 to 100 of earnings. That was part of our guidance in December and this is consistent with that.</p>

          <p>So R&amp;D looked a little bit light in the fourth quarter. Where do you expect R&amp;D for the year to be in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when Louis gave guidance back in December, we said up about 75 million. Given that E&amp;D came in a little light in Q4 we would now expect E&amp;D to be up about 100 million for the year, and most of that's going to be at Pratt, with a little bit at Sikorsky. I think you're going to see E&amp;D flat, flattish at Hamilton where you got good news of 787 spend coming down but really replaced by C-series and the A350.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. And, you know, to follow-up to Jeff's question, what sort of progress have you made in terms of integrating the GTF into, you know, the IA &#x2013; the international Aero partnership, given that that's something that Airbus views as important?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it has always been our goal to have the GTF be a part of the IAE joint venture and to go to market through IAE. Obviously that's all subject to approval by our partners and we're still working through that. I think we're going to continue to work through that with Airbus during the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's the impact &#x2013; you know, looking out, you'd mentioned that the JSF engine is all upside and yet there are rumors that DoD is going to cut by 20% F-35 production through 2015. And the F-16, it looks like the 2012-'13 customers, Turkey and Egypt, are Brand X's engine, versus today you've got the production. Should we worry about that a little bit more as we look out there in terms of what's happening to the military engines or do you still think that aftermarket and biz jet can outweigh that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I &#x2013; take me through the question again. Are you specifically concerned about JSF production in the next couple of years? Because I think that's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="inaudible" /> would be sort of as we get out to 2012ish, '13, before we had GTF contributing if there's less, you know, JSF engines, if the F-16 is going down, C-17 is going down, do we have &#x2013; and you know, and you have R&amp;D at a relatively high level for the GTF, is there a growing concern that Pratt would be flat. or do you think that Pratt Canada and aftermarket and restructuring can still give you growth during that period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's no doubt, I think, 2011 will be a kind of a low point on the military engine business. You're going to see the engines for the F-22, they start to go away after this year. And JSF does not ramp up to replace all of that until 2013, 2014. So it'll &#x2013; I think Pratt's going to be challenged next year.</p>
          <p>But to your point, we're going to see benefits from restructuring next year. You're going to see a little bit of a recovery in spares continue, and you're going to see better outlooks from Pratt Canada. So again, it's a little early to give guidance out of 2010, but I think Pratt understands the challenge, and the military is certainly going to be a headwind for them in the next couple of years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; hi. Thanks very much. A question on Hamilton Sundstrand. Greg, and Akhil, if you could give me a little more color. I know you talked &#x2013; we saw a 10% decline in revenues and a 32% decline in profits; clearly weaker in spares and you gave us color in industrial and commercial, but can you add even more color on what we saw and talk about the sustainable margins in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heidi, I think for Hamilton, the numbers you quoted were reported numbers. So when you adjust for restructuring &#x2013; and Hamilton did a lot of restructuring as you would expect in this environment &#x2013; I think the numbers are closer to down 13% for the year on earnings. That primarily is because of the big &#x2013; both their spares business and their industrials business were down about 20% for the year, year over year, on revenues. That's a big decline on their highest margin businesses. So that put a lot of pressure on it. They did do a lot of cost actions like everybody else &#x2013; furloughs, travel restrictions, medic deferrals and restructuring. All that gave them about $200 million of good news in the year, but that wasn't enough to offset the declines from the higher margin businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm sorry. Those numbers I quoted &#x2013; I backed out the restructuring and I still found that it fell short, but that &#x2013; but it was just a significant weakness more on the commercial side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mostly spares and industrials. Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then what about what we should think about then about margins in 2010? And also touch on when will we see provisioning spares on the 787 ramp up. Does that happen in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so, Heidi. I think, you know, margins ought to be up at Hamilton this year, just on the back of the cost reductions that Akhil talked about. Revenues will be challenged there, again, primarily because of the regional jets going down, as well as some of the military vehicles that have been a big piece of the revenue for the last couple of years. So they're going to be challenged on the top line, but cost reduction will actually give them some margin expansion of this year.</p>
          <p>As far as provisioning, provisionings was a big piece of the aftermarket. We saw that down significantly last year and don't expect it to pick up much this year. And specifically on the 787, with entry into service probably here towards the end of 2010, we wouldn't expect a big uptick in provisioning orders in 2010, especially since the first customer, which is ANA, they're actually on our long-term, we call it a care program, where they don't actually provision, but they just pay us a fee for the provisioning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a quick question, Greg, for you is on GTF, another way that I'm wondering about it is how do we think about the risk to the C-series given that Boeing and Airbus have lodged complaints on unfair subsidies, even though that is a little like calling the kettle black?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's actually a &#x2013; it's great testimony to how good the GTF is, that Boeing and Airbus are concerned about the C-series. So I think again it's a good aircraft. Bombardier's going to have it to market ahead of any re-engined A320 or 737, and we think there's nothing but upside with GTF.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Myles Walton of Oppenheimer and Company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning; good quarter. Question for you on the cash side of the house. You obviously added another 500 million on the pension and I think you had a placeholder for 2010 of 400 million domestic, 200 million international. I assume the international hasn't changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has the domestic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did a lot of prefunding in December as you noted. We still have a $400 million placeholder out there. And I think again cash ought to be strong again this year. So we're still anticipating another 400 million. But it'll really depend, I think, up on the market and cash, but 400's a good placeholder for now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the other cash item was on CapEx. Obviously you pulled back the reins pretty hard in 2009 on CapEx. Do you go back in 2010 to more the 1.2 or equal the D&amp;A kind of rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you &#x2013; yeah, CapEx was down a little over 30% last year. Obviously all the businesses that we saw the economic environment, they tightened up, and Louis put out an edict out there to cut back on CapEx; the guys executed on that. You're going to see a little bit of an increase this year, not back to the levels that we saw in 2008, but you're going to see a little bit of uptick in CapEx year over year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of pure program-related investment that need to be made. For example in Pratt you see the setting up of the Turkish and the Shanghai engine centers. There is CapEx which got pushed out from '09 into '10 which'll put a little pressure. But we don't expect it to be anywhere close to the 1.2 billion, Myles. It could be maybe a double-digit increase, but not much more than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I'll stick to two. Thanks.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you on Carrier walk through some of the actions that have been taken. I know you've done a lot on overhead: head count reduction, you've talked about R&amp;D consolidation, exiting underperforming businesses. I'm trying to get a sense of where you are right now in terms of actions that have pretty much been completed and what you have ahead of you in the next year or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we said in opening comments, we think about two-thirds of the structural work has been done at Carrier; the other third is still to come. I think the key &#x2013; and Geraud will take you through this in more detail in March &#x2013; is you're going to see some more on the international res. We'll be exiting some of those and of course discontinuing down the path on the U.S. distribution business; and we'll probably see more of that here in the first half. But the big tough things have been done. I would say the heavy lifting is behind us, but still some more. And Geraud can give you a lot of detail here, and he'll spend some time in March on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then similarly on Fire and Security, I know one of the things that Ari has emphasized was the need to do consolidation around service centers. Where are you on that? Is this at a point where it's being implemented, or are you still in the planning stages for that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We're going full tilt there. We started last year in France; we've got some more teed up around Europe this year. You're going to see in fact a lion &#x2013; or a big piece of the restructuring cost this year are going to be at Fire and Security, not just for GE Security but also to continue on the branch office consolidation. That ought to be wrapped up by the end of 2010 or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should actually see savings impact from that in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, some savings, that from the actions &#x2013; as you can imagine this is a geographic business, so we started actions in Australia; we're seeing benefits from that. There are actions in France as Greg talked about which are starting to yield some benefits in 2010. Bulk of the benefits will come in '11 and '12.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question, then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>From George Shapiro of Access 342.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted you to run through sequentially both at Pratt and Hamilton Sundstrand. The margin was down despite revenues being up. And I thought I heard you say, Akhil, that a normal seasonality is that the spares are up a little bit sequentially in Q4 versus Q3. So I was just looking for the reason for the margin decline. My guess is maybe it's more OE zero-margin engine deliveries, but if you could provide the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. George, I think let's take Pratt first. The normal seasonality in the space is also followed by seasonality in E&amp;D, where E&amp;D ramps up in fourth quarter typically. So we saw from Q3 to Q4 an increase of approximately $50 million in the Pratt E&amp;D number.</p>
          <p>The second thing to keep in mind there is if you go back to our third-quarter call, we mentioned a one-time benefit in Pratt numbers associated with several contract adjustments. We talked about a $35 million number there, which was on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter the number was more like 50 plus. So if you take those two factors into account, higher E&amp;D and the one timer in Q3, you pretty much explain the margin change there.</p>
          <p>And for Hamilton actually, sequentially there is really no change in the margin. The margin is pretty consistent, about similar level of profit and similar level of sales. And the little increase there &#x2013; the little decline there is also a function of E&amp;D being higher in Q4 as compared with Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George. Okay. Maybe just to close, just a final word on 2009. You know, a great year for execution; it's positioned UTC for earnings growth in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening today. We appreciate your time and look forward to seeing everybody in March at our annual investor meeting. It's going to be on March 12 in New York City and Akhil and team'll be happy to take your calls throughout the day. So thank you.</p>
