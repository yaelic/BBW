          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Enel 2012 Interim Results Conference Call presentation. I am Luca Torchia and I'm here with Mr. Fulvio Conti, the Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Luigi Ferraris, the Chief Financial Officer. We are going to have the presentation that is posted on the website for you and then, of course, we are going to have the Q&amp;A session right at the end of this presentation.</p>
          <p>Thank you again for convening, and let me hand over to Mr. Fulvio Conti.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the interim results presentation. Thanks, Luca. I'm using the presentation that has been posted on the web. On page 2, as usual, I would like to start providing a quick overview of the macroeconomic trends in the areas in which we operate. As you can see on the chart, most recent data confirmed that Italy and Iberia continued to experience a decline in GDP as well as lower industrialized outputs.</p>
          <p>In July, overall business activity contracted for the sixth month in a row, showing the weakest results since June 2009. This trend is expected to continue during 2012, unfortunately. As a result of that, electricity demand evolution during the first half of the year has been weaker than expected in Italy and Slovakia, experiencing declines of minus 2.1% and minus 0.1%, mind you, not adjusted for working days and temperature vis-&#xE0;-vis our assumptions of 0.4% positive and 1.6%, respectively.</p>
          <p>In contrast, emerging markets continued to experience growth mainly sustained by demographic expansion, organization process and resource availability. More specifically, as you can see, Brazil, Chile and Colombia are experiencing electricity demand growth ranging from 4.3% to 6.6%, which actually to be Chile.</p>
          <p>As far as Russia is concerned, the recent development are meeting the Economic Minister to restate the expected growth from previously forecast 3.4% to 4% during 2012. With that in mind, let me focus your attention on the two key topics that we have on the table right now, Spanish regulation and the rationalization of our Latam business.</p>
          <p>Let's turn the page 3, Spanish regulation. On April 1, as you know, our first tranche of regulatory review was approved. Among many other issues, it brought a reduction in distribution remuneration, which will have an impact on our revenues of about &#x20AC;278 million on a full-year basis. Additionally, the same tranche contained a 10% cut to the national coal volumes to be used in generation as well as a 10% cut in capacity payments. These two measures have an impact on our revenues of another &#x20AC;18 million for 2012. On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Spain approved a resolution against the present scheme of financing on the social bonus affected by the utilities companies, therefore, we have not reflected any social bonus financing in our first half 2012 results.</p>
          <p>For the entire year 2012, this resolution of the Supreme Court would have an estimated &#x20AC;112 million positive impact. So all in all, you can reassess what we already commented during the first quarter results. The first tranche of this regulatory review is going to have an impact on our 2012 consolidated EBITDA of about &#x20AC;120 million, which as we commented and I confirmed that to you we are going to absorb in our 2012 EBITDA guidance.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, another tranche rule was issued on July 14, the one affecting our industry in particular includes the possibility of applying for progressivity on access tariffs. The suspension on quarterly PPA reviews as well as the pass-through of local original taxes to final customers and an update on non-mainland generation remuneration. It removes the remuneration to some recurrent expenditures decreases the financial rate of return and costs were all items applying since the beginning of 2012.</p>
          <p>This, according to our calculation, implies an additional impact of approximately &#x20AC;100 million on a full year basis. But even with that in mind, we will be in a position to absorb during the expected remaining months of the yea, as we are showing you resilient good results for the first half of the year, which is an indication that we can absorb the other &#x20AC;100 million as well. So at any rate up until now, we will not change the guidance. However, we are rumored to have a third wave of regulatory review to be introduced in near terms by the Spanish government. Let me underline we still don't have a clear idea what is going to be introduced by the government, but we will continue to follow this evolution very closely. And once we will have a clear view of this position, we will still put in place all the managerial, legal actions aimed at minimizing further negative impacts, which will be introduced.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about the Latam rationalization on the following slide. Enersis, our main holding company in Latin America, will convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on September 13 to give shareholders the opportunity to vote on a capital increase proposal, in which Endesa will participate through the contribution of all the stakes in Latam held directly by the company. The remaining shareholders of Enersis &#x2013; the minority shareholders of Enersis would be able to participate in the capital increase with a cash contribution so as to maintain their existing level of participation in Enersis if they wish to do so.</p>
          <p>This project is an essential part of our Latam rationalization process, and it is in line with the strategy already outlined in our recent industrial plan presentation. In this specific case, let me underline the cash raised through this operation will remain in the availability of Enersis, will strengthen and reinforce Enersis to become the largest vertical integrated energy operator in Latin America. And once this capital increase is finalized, again, through contribution of assets and cash, Enersis will have enough financial resource to support its growth and reinforce its leadership model in the areas where it operates, namely, South America.</p>
          <p>Let me try to summarize the benefits of this transaction for Enersis and on the consolidated base for Enel on the following slide, which is the number 5. Enersis will use this capital to increase, first, their consolidation on their industrial position in the areas, which will obviously also be associated with the contribution of assets that we will be contributing to. I think the Group will increase its critical mass within a very competitive contest where the industry is growing aggressively and taking advantage of the overall growth of the economies.</p>
          <p>As a result of our capital increase, Chile will become the investment hub for growth through a more visible and a straightforward platform able to cope with regional businesses and to take opportunities in their hands. The reinforced presence of Enersis in the five Latin American countries in which the Group operates will contribute to boosting its leading position as a key player in the economic development of each country.</p>
          <p>Finally, to obtain larger financial resources to finance growth through purchase of minorities, development of new greenfield projects where we can count on the 5.2-gigawatt of pipeline projects. Therefore, let me stress once again that cash raised by this operation will remain available for Enersis development plan.</p>
          <p>Now as I commented already, Luigi's going to show you a set of resilient and, let me, say higher than planned results for the first half of 2012, and I will be ready for question-and -answer. Luigi, it's your turn.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio, and good afternoon everybody. I will begin with an overview of our key financial highlights on slide number 7. Group EBITDA decreased 7.2% versus the same period of 2011. This is mainly the results of the impact of some positive non-recurring items recorded during the first half 2011 for an amount equal to about &#x20AC;400 million. If we do not consider these effects, recurring EBITDA declines by about 3% year-on-year. On top of this, first half 2012 results also takes into accounts the perimeter effect on generation and energy management, infrastructure and network in the International division by an amount of &#x20AC;113 million. Net of this, adjusted recurring EBITDA declines by 1.5%, so substantially in line with previous year.</p>
          <p>Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.8 billion or down 28.6% versus last year, mainly as a result of the abovementioned lower EBITDA and higher tax rates. Group net ordinary income equals to &#x20AC;1.6 billion and takes into account a capital gain on Terna stake for a total amount of about &#x20AC;180 million.</p>
          <p>Net debt has increased during the first half 2012 by about &#x20AC;2.9 billion to &#x20AC;47.6 billion versus December 2011 when it was equal to &#x20AC;44.6 billion, but I will provide more details on this, as usual, later on.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide number 8, EBIT decreased by about 12% mainly due to the combined effects of lower EBITDA and higher depreciation and amortization versus the first half of 2011. Our net financial charges stand at &#x20AC;1.5 billion, registering an increase of &#x20AC;91 million versus 2011. This variation is mainly due to the increase of other items by &#x20AC;64 million due to a positive non-recurring item tax resolution in Endesa recorded last year. The revaluation of retirement and other funds and other net financial charges partially offset by the pre-tax capital gain from Terna stake sold during the first quarter 2011 &#x2013; 2012, sorry. Interest charges are nearly aligned versus last year. Our normalized average cost of gross debt stands at 4.9%, stable versus last year.</p>
          <p>Finally, group's tax rates increased to 38.4% in the first half 2012 versus 32.5% of last year. On a normalized basis, our annualized tax rate including the Robin Hood Tax is about 36%.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with an update on forward sales on slide number 9. In Italy, we have hedged about 95% of our 2012 production at an average base load price of &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour and 70% of 2013 at an average base load price of &#x20AC;73 per megawatt hour. In Spain, we are fully hedged for 2012 in 35%-40% for 2013 at an average price of about &#x20AC;58-&#x20AC;59 per megawatt hour for both years, excluding ancillary services and capacity payments. Please note that the percentage of production sold forward in Spain for 2013 has not changed as much versus the first quarter of 2012 as it takes into account the impact of an area forecasted production base.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we are 75%-80% hedged for 2012 and 65%-70% for 2013. In Slovakia, we are 100% hedged for 2012 and about 75% for 2013 at an average price of &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour for 2012 and &#x20AC;52 for 2013.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our overall EBITDA evolution on slide number 10. I will go through the EBITDA of each of our division in detail, starting with Generation &amp; Energy Management Italy on chart number 11. Overall divisional EBITDA in the first half 2012 was equal to &#x20AC;694 million, declining by &#x20AC;551 million, excluding perimeter and revaluation effects of about &#x20AC;261 million, EBITDA decreased only about 30%. This was mainly the result of a decrease in the generation margins of &#x20AC;151 million, mainly caused by lower hydro volumes and lower clean spark spread partially compensated for by higher margins and volumes on coal.</p>
          <p>This has been partially compensated for by the positive results in trading and gas margin and also, we recorded a decline of other items of &#x20AC;212 million in which the positive contribution of the ancillary services has been more than offset by some positive operating non-recurring items which affected the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis of the Market division on chart number 12. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;328 million, maintaining the same strong level of profitability of last year. This has been possible, thanks to free market, which is in line with the first half of 2011 as a result of lower electricity margins compensated for by higher gas margins and volumes sold both electricity and gas, and a slight increase in the regulated electricity market related to higher prices and margin, partially compensated for by the ongoing reduction in volumes sold on the regulated markets related to the liberalization process.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 13 on domestic Infrastructure &amp; Networks division. EBITDA in the first half 2012 amounted to &#x20AC;1.973 billion, nearly in line versus last year. This is the net effect of the following: the positive effect of &#x20AC;118 million in the energy market, thanks to higher prices after the tariff review and higher number of clients versus last year; lower connection fees by &#x20AC;35 million; and a decrease in other item by &#x20AC;136 million, mainly due to the positive one-off recorded in the first half of last year related to a provision release.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 14 on international operations, EBITDA decreased by &#x20AC;41 million versus last year, taking into account the perimeter effect of the assets sold in Bulgaria during the first half 2011. Excluding these effects of &#x20AC;82 million, EBITDA increased by 5.7%. In particular, Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne recorded an increase of &#x20AC;27 million, mainly thanks to higher unit margins. South Eastern Europe recorded a decrease of &#x20AC;104 million explained by the abovementioned perimeter effects on Bulgaria and lower results in Romania for &#x20AC;23 million, mainly related to lower energy margins. Finally, Russia increased by &#x20AC;36 million, thanks to generation supply activities which accounted for &#x20AC;15 million and &#x20AC;18 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on Endesa's results on slide number 15. First, as usual, let me remind you that the numbers we report in this slide and in the following one are the results of the application of Enel Group's accounting principle, which might differ from Endesa's principle due to local standards.</p>
          <p>The Iberian division has recorded an EBITDA in line versus last year. This has been the outcome of an increase of &#x20AC;97 million in the liberalized business mainly explained by higher unit margin, thanks to higher prices to final clients, which were partially offset by energy costs related to the higher level of Spanish pool price versus last year and higher commodity cost, as well as the decrease in the Last Resort Tariff.</p>
          <p>Regulated business decreased by &#x20AC;113 million mainly due to lower distribution revenues after the recent changes of the regulatory framework. And finally, other items for &#x20AC;25 million mainly related to lower personnel cost.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Latin America on slide number 16. The Latin American division has recorded an EBITDA increase of &#x20AC;24 million. This has been mainly the result of a decrease of &#x20AC;117 million in the generation business, mainly due to lower margins in Chile and Argentina, partially compensated for by higher volumes and prices in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. An increase of &#x20AC;88 million in the distribution business, following higher volumes distributed in all the countries in which we operate; and finally, a decrease of &#x20AC;8 million in other items.</p>
          <p>And now let's have a look at Enel Green Power chart number 17. EBITDA decreased &#x20AC;69 million or about 8% versus last year, taking into account the fair value revaluation of net assets in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:28) and Star Lake land expropriation, which positively impacted the first half 2011 by a total amount of &#x20AC;181 million.</p>
          <p>Excluding these effects, EBITDA increases by 16%. In particular, Italy and Europe increased &#x20AC;36 million, thanks to higher volumes in Europe despite the shortfall in hydro production. Iberia and Latin America increased &#x20AC;67 million, mainly thanks to the results of higher volumes in Iberia and Latin America. North America increased &#x20AC;14 million, thanks to higher volumes partially offset by higher operating costs.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt is concerned, you see on slide number 18 that net of discontinued operations, overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;47.6 billion. The &#x20AC;2.9 billion increase during the period has been mainly affected by the payment of the Robin Hood Tax for &#x20AC;600 million and by the foreign exchange effect for &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>Net of these items, the increase in net debt is substantially aligned with the seasonality typically seen during the first half of each year. Also, our liquidity profile is more than adequate. During the first half of 2012, we have been able to raise total funding for about &#x20AC;8 billion at an average weighted cost below 5%. As a result of this, we can now count on about &#x20AC;22 billion of available liquidity which already covers existing debt maturities throughout 2014.</p>
          <p>In the second part of the year, we expect to benefit from the usual operating cash flow improvement which, coupled with the positive contribution coming from the ongoing extraordinary activities, will improve the net debt position versus the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now let's open the Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I understand that the first question is coming from Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. So please, Alberto, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luca, and good evening all. I have three questions if you don't mind. First of all is if you can update us on the status of the power generation market in Italy's profitability particularly in light of the ongoing solar additions and if you can give us perhaps an estimate of what you expect in terms of gigawatts added this year. And perhaps, if you can also elaborate a little bit on the gas market, we have recently seen statements by the CEO of one of the major gas suppliers talking about imminent re-negotiations. So where are you on re-negotiations and could the re-negotiations bring downward pressure on Italian power prices?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the debt, the debt is somewhat higher than I was estimating and so can you talk about a little bit, maybe I missed it, the currency effect in the debt. And what was exactly the change in working capital in H1 and if you can perhaps help us understand the different pieces there? And very lastly G&amp;EM was &#x20AC;694 million in your slide at the EBITDA level, did I understand correctly that it's a clean number, there's no non-recurring items in there? Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, let me try to attempt to answer. Power generation in Italy when it comes to photovoltaic. I believe the numbers of photovoltaic installations, as of June 30 would be in the region of 14 gigawatts right now. So there's been a kind of a 3-gigawatt incremental capacity being installed during the first half of the year. We see a slowdown, of course, into the pipeline of projects as the fifth account of energy as they call it. Conto Energia, is coming on-stream in the next few weeks, August 26, I think there will be definitely a much lower than expected early on end result. The expected number I guess will be in the region of 16 gigawatts at the end of the year, something in that region.</p>
          <p>The positive side of this, which is becoming now in this very peak days of consumption, the positive side of it, this is increasing the need of ancillary services to back it up on the volatility of the generating capacity of those capacity of photovoltaic, and this will be shown in the numbers starting with July, and I do expect to occur also in August and September, which are the, traditionally, the peak consumption, just to give you an idea unbalancing of the current market will be in closer to 4 gigawatts of capacity. So this is confirming the importance of adding the fleet of generation capacity that Enel has to provide a kind of backup system.</p>
          <p>The second question related to re-negotiation of gas, indeed, we have been re-negotiating things. We do have, I guess, reached an agreement but before commenting on the positive impact of this re-negotiation, I want to have the final document signed, which may occur pretty quickly during this coming next few weeks. The result will be positive, and I will be reporting back to you the positive impact of that re-negotiation, which refers to a good portion of our imports for Algeria. But I am a prudent person and before speaking about it, I want to see the final documentation on my hands. When it comes to the debt on GEM, Luigi, you want to take in that question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, let's start with the debt first. We reported 47.5%, 47.6% as I said before and net of the two items that I mentioned, the impact of Robin Hood Tax and the impacts of the exchange rate effect, we have an increase of our net debt at the end of 2011 at &#x20AC;1.7 billion, &#x20AC;1.8 billion. This is mainly driven by the net working capital variation and particularly, the trade payable variation. This is one of the effect of our seasonality, and every year is substantially the same.</p>
          <p>If you look at the level of our CapEx at the end of June, it's substantially in line versus last year but, by far, behind the plant's CapEx profile, which means that we are going to see an acceleration in the second part of the year, and we are going to see the payment of the supply in the first part of the following year as basically it happened in the first half of 2012. So that's why when I said I expect to see an improvement of our net debt position at the end of the year versus the end of June 2012, one of the reason is the recovery in the net working capital because of the improvement in the trade payable coupled with, of course, the usual cash-in at the end of the year of some regulated receivable and the cash-in of some extraordinary transaction like, for instance, <mark type="ph" /> Arla (30:13), which is expected to contribute to net debt reduction in the region of &#x20AC;400 million very likely in the third quarter. So all-in-all, we are basically in line with what happened last year. We have to expect in the second part of 2012, a strong recovery in terms of cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Generation &amp; Energy Management, I confirm you that this year, the number you see reported does not include any non-recurring items. So it's a clean number as you call it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Pablo Cuadrado, Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luca, and good afternoon everyone. Just three quick questions. And the first one is a follow-up on the net debt. My understanding, I guess, is that given that there are some non-recurring items on this working capital, I guess you'll keep thinking that you can move the net debt by the year end at around &#x20AC;43 billion, just &#x2013; I wanted to have a confirmation on that front.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the Latam optimization that you have proposed. Just to confirm that you don't expect any kind of EBITDA or minority impact looking to this year, assuming that the deal is approved in the current terms that they have proposed. And on that front as well, looking to the different options that you have going forward that you have described perfectly, do you have any preferred option to use when talking about the development of the greenfield projects or talking about acquisition of minorities there?</p>
          <p>And third question, very quickly, is on the committed credit lines. I see &#x2013; I saw that during Q2, you have taken or used &#x20AC;5 billion of the committed credit lines versus Q1. I was just wondering whether you can give us a little bit of flavor about the pressure of those committed credit lines. I am basically looking to rating. I mean are those committed credit lines independent of the rating or if you suffer a rating downgrade coming from sovereign, you might have problems with those credit lines? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me dwell on some of this and then I'll hand it over to Luigi if there is any remaining curiosity. Starting with the last one, no, there's not currently any impact on that. I think we are with a BBB+ stable outlook and that will be okay. And we have been, to some extent, departed from the vagaries of the sovereign state problem.</p>
          <p>Back to EBITDA impact, no impact on 2012. The EBITDA will remain the same. We do expect closing the operation to be towards the month of December and this will have, of course, some incremental EBITDA consolidation for us but it will depend on the outcome of the capital increase. And the preference, let me tell you, there is no preference. We'll seek into improve our presence in Latin America when you see the continent with the, what I call, the three Ds: demography, democracy and development. And therefore I think this is the right place to allocate capital and is a good opportunity to clear all of the intricate maze of participations through the rationalization, and making the hub &#x2013; the platform and Enersis the preferred choice. Once we will have the extra cash available, we will be looking at the highest return investment profile, where we'll want to be buying out some of the minorities remaining, it's just the minorities, or to possibly use those funds for the many green grass facilities project that we have in hydro in other countries like Chile and Brazil, or possibly coal plants if there is an opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p>So basically, we're giving ourselves the flexibility and it will be possibly unwise to give you specific targets. At this time I give you targets, as you know, I will be negotiating through you with other people which I don't like to do. But the flexibility doesn't mean that we have no clear ideas. We do have clear ideas and order of preference, and as we move forward based on the capital increase, we'll be presenting you with the numbers.</p>
          <p>And the first question you raised, of course, we're working towards maintaining our targets. I think the explanation that Luigi has given you about the seasonality effect of the working capital and the management of our many different instruments as we usually had available will make it possible to be landing around that &#x20AC;43 billion that we committed to. Luigi, you want to add on something?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a very quick additional information. Let me just highlight that we used the cash coming from the utilization of the committee credit line to repay some commercial paper to reduce the level of volatility of these instruments. And of course, as you know, we have also had to pay in particular in the month of June, the dividend and the tax, in particular, Robin Hood Tax. And as Mr. Conti said, there are no issue coming from the downgrade result by the two rating agencies both in terms of availability of lines and in terms of cost.</p>

          <p>Your next question is coming from Mr. Javier Suarez from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Javier Suarez of Nomura. Many thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on details on your numbers in the slide number 11 when talking about the EBITDA evolution of the Generation business based adjustment of &#x20AC;212 million as others. Can you explain us which is behind this &#x20AC;212 million?</p>
          <p>And then on slide number 13, when talking about the Infrastructure and Networks business in Italy, also there is an adjustment of minus &#x20AC;136 million, if you can kindly explain us the reason for that. And also on the International business side, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:08) Southeastern Europe, there is an adjustment of something like &#x2013; if I'm not wrong, minus &#x20AC;104 million, if you can also give us the details.</p>
          <p>A second question is on the Spanish market, I know, excuse me for coming back to this. I think that we are all lost with the timing for this regulatory review, so I cannot refrain from asking you you're bringing about the decision for this delay, and if we could expect <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:36) in your view <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:38) more significant delay that most of the people is expecting. I think that on the whole restructuring of the Spanish energy system seems to be much more complicated than most people tend to believe. And I'll just question myself if this could not suffer a significant delay.</p>
          <p>And the third question is on, obviously, on the macro situation. It seems that obviously, we are not going to see any significant improvement any time soon. And just question myself if you can give us an update on your managerial flexibility of doing things in reaction to what we're seeing in the macro situation. And if you feel the necessity of doing something more to reduce that quicker &#x2013; quickly? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the question on reverse order, then I'll leave Luigi to explain the numbers behind the other items. Honestly, I believe that there are some concerns within the Spanish government on the way forward to take further measure or to possibly progressively transform these very complicated regulation into a true genuine free market operations, which I think is the aspiration of the current government of Spain.</p>
          <p>I think the delay might result &#x2013; is the result of the many different approaches that we have been offering for the government to explain the reason why we believe that what they have done is already enough for the industry to bear. And whatever they're doing on top, they will lose on the other side as income on their taxable &#x2013; in their income taxable income, they will lose in terms of lower income taxes of what they might be gaining in terms of excise taxes or other taxes on the revenues.</p>
          <p>I don't expect anything more than this. I had the opinion that they will be presenting sometime in the near future. I don't know whether in the month of August or in September a draft law to be passed to the Congreso and to the House of Parliament for the discussion which will leave again a possibility to further discuss whatever regulation change they might want to take into account. So I'm confident that good common sense will prevail in the end, to the extent that they already made a lot of provision, and I think it will be in the interest of the government of Spain to maintain an industry that is obviously up and running and providing opportunities to further investments. So they are conscious on the need of carefully examine whatever new measures they have to take. I guess that will be, in a nutshell, what I can say. And Luigi, can you elaborate on those numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me start with Generation Energy Management Italy. We have reported in the chart an adjustment of &#x20AC;212 million, this is basically regards some positive operating non-recurring items, which we have recorded during the course of the first half of 2011. And they mainly refer to a positive refund CO2 emission credits for new entrants. In particular, we referenced to Civitavecchia to the new coal power plant in Italy and the sale of Green Certificates that we have done last year. So the two item are equal to more than &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>Moving to Infrastructure and Network, the &#x20AC;136 million are mainly related to a positive one-off effect recorded in the first half of 2011 and specifically, they refer to provision release related to personnel costs, in particular, lay-off provision for a total consideration of &#x20AC;80 million, then we have other minor items.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the International division, the &#x20AC;104 million negative variation regarding South Eastern Europe area, which includes a change in the perimeter because of the sale of Mariso, Bulgaria that we have done last year for &#x20AC;80 million, and it includes a negative performance of Romania for &#x20AC;23 million.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Antonella Bianchessi of Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Just a quick question again on the debt. First, if you can clarify that your target of &#x20AC;43 billion is before the rights issue in Latin America. And always on the debt, I noticed that you have &#x20AC;8.8 billion of cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet, can you explain why is that, why you're not using this cash and what we should expect by the end of the year, and how much does it cost to keep such a lot of cash on the books?</p>
          <p>The second question is really on Enersis. With 60.4% stake, do you see a material risk that the rights issue is not approved or you think that we should rule out this type of scenario? And last, if you can quickly explain why you have increased your estimate in terms of output for Spain for 2013? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to answer the one on the debt. Of course, when we plan our targets for this end year results, we are not taking into account the capital increase in Enersis. We will be working on as we go improving our cash flows during the second half of the year is based on experience, seasonality and the available instruments, we will definitely do our best to match all the expected targets.</p>
          <p>The cash is available in turbulent times, of course, being as we keep saying and showing, we tend to be conservative in assumption and the use on the instruments. We have, of course, maintained a line of treasury availability just for whatever turbulent times might come ahead of this. So far, so good, we'll continue to believe that we will be passing through the storm without any major problem as we have piled up enough ammunition to withstand any force seven seas.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the Enersis, it's a capital increase, Antonella. You have to explain shareholders what is the purpose of that. You have to go around and talk to them, which we are doing. Of course, no one wants to pay the higher price, everybody wants to pay a lower price for the asset. There is an external independent expertise that has been, by law, claimed by Enersis to say this is the amount of the value of the assets that we have listed full contribution. This is the maximum amount &#x2013; maximum value, therefore, the road show is on for us to explain the other shareholders what is all about it, and I'm confident that being most of the shareholders, Latin America or, even better, Chilean investors, they will take the opportunity to invest in one of their best company &#x2013; one of the largest company, which shows the ability to offer growth and sizable results. So I'm convinced that this will be a success. But as in all capital increase, you have to work around making your case to the investors, which we are doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question regarding the increase &#x2013; the expected increase in the output in Spain. Well, this is due to the increased competitiveness of the coal production, in particular, imported coal, which is expected to increase its output as long as, as I said, we expect an increase in the power prices because next year, we are not going to have only three clients but also the components regarding the Last Resort Tariff which is going to be added on top of the expected prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonella, I believe that we in Spain as well as in Italy, we have a better mix than our competitors. So we can continue to be one of the most efficient, if not the most efficient operator out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is coming from Susanna Invernizzi, Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Can I maybe go back a little bit on your best target, and I understand if you have more CapEx flexibility in case, for example, in Spain, the outcome is worse than what we might expect.</p>
          <p>And the second, in terms of working capital, I clearly understand the seasonality but given also your lower volume of activities in Italy, I was wondering if you had, in many case, seen a deterioration in terms of payment vis-&#xE0;-vis what we have seen last year in the first half or if what you see it's an ongoing ordinary trend in working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The good news is that we have not any deterioration in our payment profile &#x2013; on our collection profile, I'm sorry. To be honest with you, citizens and industries are continue to support their commitment to paid invoices. And that's good news.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the question, Luigi, you want to take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me remind you that on top of what I already said, we have to consider that in the second part of the year, we are not going to pay any more the dividend &#x2013; the first installment of dividends, which compared to last year means &#x20AC;1 billion less of cash-out. So this coupled with the already explained working capital evolution, the finalization of some extraordinary transaction already in the pipeline will allow us to reach the target that we have already committed to.</p>

          <p>The next question is coming from Alberto Ponti, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. I have two question. One is if you could give us an idea of what is EBITDA for ancillary services in the first half of this year? And the second, an update on capacity payments that are being discussed what's your view there? And if at all, if you have an idea of what technologies could receive such capacity payments if approved? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second part of your question, Alberto, and welcome back, by the way, the idea is that the law that has been approved and passed was being discussed in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:02) is a law that says that, for instance, the old oil and gas &#x2013; turbo gas plants, which are instrumental to defend the interest of a country when the tough winter times as occasionally it happens, they need to be started up again with the remunerators on the basis of decision taken by the authority &#x2013; the independent authority.</p>
          <p>And the discussion about the capacity payment, as you know, is foreseen for 2015 onward will be to advance it to the 2013, 2014. The discussion is on. The debate is on. The more we see the intermittent energy becoming more of an opportunity, they will also see the issues related to the management of that incremental capacity of intermittent renewables, and therefore it is becoming more evident that capacity payment will have to be offered. The question is where do you think the incremental revenues for those capacities available and the discussions whether they have to increase remuneration with new tariff schemes or to rebalance the allocations of revenues among the various sectors, namely possibly reduce some further down the level of renewables remuneration to pay for it. The debate is on, but the need of having some capacity payment in Italy is becoming well-known opportunities and needs for the industry which the authority is entertaining at the moment. Luigi?</p>

          <p>The next questions are coming from Enrico Bartoli with Fidentiis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. First of all, I have a question about the outlook for hydro production in the second half of the year, the first half was very weak. Do you expect any improvement, which would obviously have a positive effect on your margins?</p>
          <p>Then I have a couple of questions related to the capital increase at Enersis. Do you expect any synergies or, let's say, benefits also in terms of financials for Endesa from the transfer of the asset to Enersis? And secondly should Endesa increase its stake above the 65%, which is allowed by law in Chile. Do you have a plan B, so would you also consider the disposal of the stake in the company?</p>
          <p>And thirdly very briefly, there were on the press some articles about the Mayor of Civitavecchia threatening to challenge the operation of your Torrevaldaliga plant? What are the risks that you see there that there could be some shutdown of the plant even if temporary? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one. Torrevaldaliga Nord, the power plant of Civitavecchia is a state-of-the-art technology-wise and operating-wise plant. It has been visited by many different authorities including the EPRI of the United States of America that issued a statement saying this is the model for future development of coal plants in the United States, just to give you an idea of how well-managed and performing this plant is.</p>
          <p>But because we live in Italy, this is not enough. I mean everybody is entitled to say something about it. The local court has been trying to see whether we are fully compliant with all the commitment in terms of environmental impact. Just to give you information, we have been inspected 111 times over the last year and a half. They have been looking in and out, inside and outside, within the operations, outside the operation, measuring all the emissions for about 118 times, they never found anything out of order. So I don't feel menaced to that effect. Of course, in a small city, a large investment like a power plant is one source of income for everybody because we give work to about 1,000 people. We spend tens of millions of euros in maintenance, in services, and whatever. So we are a major factor of the economy development of the region and, in particular, the city.</p>
          <p>So I think a wise man like the mayor is, even though he might be menacing whatever, at the end of the day, I think we'll come to term with the <mark type="ph" /> following (55:58), if he shuts down the plant of the wrong reason because there is no reason why he should do that. It will be cutting back into the very flesh of the Civitavecchia economy. So he can do that and it will &#x2013; might take the burden of that. So I don't want to say that I'm happy and relaxed but I'm saying I'm vigilant and I will make sure that this will be the 112th inspection which will prove that we are good citizens and well-performing plant. Luigi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to your first question, the weakness of our output in the first half of this year, well, let me remind you that this is due to, again, a decrease in the hydro production which seems to be unusual if we compare this first six months versus last year. So we have at least three tower less than last year, out of which master of this decline is concentrated in Italy in Generation &amp; Energy Management and Enel Green Power as well. So it's difficult to predict what is going to happen in the second half of the year. We have seen some improvement in the level of our reservoir, but for sure, for now, we are below the average that we used to see in the past.</p>
          <p>Making a follow-up of your question about the capital increase in Enersis, well, of course, we cannot and we do not expect any synergies since we are talking about contributing assets and investments which are already &#x2013; where most of them present in the Enersis consolidation. The result of this contribution will be of course a rationalization of the legal structure and we expect also the possibility of having more visibility of this portion of assets today controlled by Endesa Latin America.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the possibility of increasing our share beyond 65%, well, there is &#x2013; of course, I mean from our side, we are more than happy to stay where we are and we welcome all the minority shareholder to support these projects and this is our first, of course, target and commitment. Technically speaking, there is a maximum level which is 65%. Beyond that, we need to get the approval of the shareholders' meeting &#x2013; of the two-thirds of the shareholders meeting to change the by-law.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's Exane BNP Paribas, Jos&#xE9; Ruiz. Just two questions. First of all, I was surprised a little bit by the flatness of sales division in Italy considering that forward price is falling in Italy, I would have expected a little bit of improvement and is that going to come in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to Romania, if you are going to exercise the option to buy the 13.5% stake in Electrica Muntenia Sud? And my last question is regarding some comments that were made yesterday <mark type="ph" /> by Italy (59:31) relating to a draft law concerning the revaluation of hydro assets, according to those information, this should be a lot of value or fair market at the end of their concession, if that that affects Enel at any point. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to, if I understand correctly, your first question, the performance of the sales division in Italy, I mean we are substantially in line with last year. There are no major changes. If we look at the level of the price, we have seen, of course, a slight decline versus last year in terms of electricity prices. But the reason why we're being resilient is because, as usual, we sell forward our electricity to the final customer, and about 50% of our sales in terms of solar power is addressed to the small office &#x2013; some office segment and to the residential, which is quite resilient and less sensible to the volatility of the prices, thanks also to our 24 months contract. When it comes to Muntenia, we do not have an option to buy but the Romanian government has a put to sell. This of course, I mean, is part of the original agreement and we will see how the way and when this is going to happen &#x2013; if and when this is going to happen.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the revaluation of hydro asset, if your refer to the transaction that we have done last year, in particular, if your refer to the step-up evaluation that we have done of the assets sold, well, this is the result of the application of the international accounting principle, we had to revalue our existing assets because of a change of control in the Hydro Dolomiti Energia. So this is a pure application of the accounting principle and not something by law.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Few very quick questions, if I may. The first one is about GE&amp;M. The first quarter results, you said that the target you gave at the full year presentation was actually &#x2013; could be considered bottom. I see the ancillary services are still strong, so can you confirm that statement? And also, can you just give us an indication what do you see in terms of price, not just in terms of sold levels and the prices?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding Bulgaria. Do you have a price in the put option or there is room to negotiate there? On the net debt target for the full year, is the net debt target, excluding ForEx impact, I mean if the foreign exchange stay at current levels, is the target still confirmed?</p>
          <p>And finally just quickly going back to ancillary services, what are your views going forward, I mean the future years? Because my sense was when you revised the guidance for generation needs and you've caused a drop in the ancillary services was a big part in terms of this pessimistic. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Anna Maria, let me try to answer your first question about Generation &amp; Energy Management in Italy. When we presented our business plan in March, we gave a guidance with regards to Generation &amp; Energy Management of an EBITDA equal to &#x20AC;1.3 billion for the entire year. For now, I think we are on track to reach that target.</p>
          <p>Is that going to be the bottom? I mean I think it's too early to say. We see in our forward sales, as I said, a decline in the price of &#x20AC;3 per megawatt hour, but we also some decline in the spark spreads and in the dark spread. So I think we will be in a position to definitely state if this is going to be the bottom or not very likely at the end of third quarter.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the put option, the put option is in Romania and not in Bulgaria, Bulgaria has been sold, so this is the minority stake that the Romanian government has, and this is part of the agreement that we have signed in the past.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the ancillary services, well, the first half of this year has been definitely quite good and much better than expected. We do not foresee for now in the second part of the year the same performance, we think we will go back to the level that we have seen in the first half or in the second half of last year. But as Mr. Conti said before, there are some positive signs that could be confirmed during the course of the next months in particular because of the volatility due to the increase in the renewable output.</p>
          <p>Just to the last question if I'm not wrong, was refer to the net debt target &#x20AC;43 billion. Yes, that's what we have said before. So for now, we confirm this &#x20AC;43 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening. I'm happy to listen that you're close to the renegotiation of the gas needs, and I wonder if you can provide a proportion on how much of the gas you're currently discussing over the total needs of the Group. You said a good portion. I'm wondering if you can be more precise on that. And if you can give additional indication &#x2013; I know it's a critical element, but maybe you can guide us on which pump prices have you got in mind in the medium term when you run the renegotiation and to which spark spread are you targeting while closing this contract, if you can give some detail on that.</p>
          <p>And on the Latam deal, just wondering if the EBITDA contribution in terms of additional consolidation is material or not on Enersis account. And if there is any first, let's say, preliminary indication on the forward sale for 2014 in terms of percentage and prices. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Some of this question you might be willing to wait the introduction and discussion of our next strategic plan. It will be foolish for me to answer detailed question related to future years before we had developed our plan. When it comes to the first question related to the renegotiation of the gas, let me first of all say that we have three majors, a  gas contract, one comes from Nigeria, it has already been renegotiated and as a matter fact we're trading at a profit for that gas.</p>
          <p>The second one is that one from Sonatrac, and this is obviously one that is under final re-negotiation now and possibly, as I keep saying, in the next few weeks you will hear positive news about it. And the fourth one is the one related to Insular Gas, which might come next in the round of negotiation. The first two are, one done and one being done; and the third one will have to be done. Once we completed all of this, you will see that we'll be sizably improving our margins on the generation side in Italy.</p>

          <p>Okay. I understand that there are no more question on the table. So of course, the Investor Relations Department would remain available for any further invites, for any further questions. We thank you very much again for convening and good evening.</p>
