        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My presentation is going to be divided into four blocks. In the first one, I will be referring to the evolution of the group in the first quarter of 2008, then our CFO, Jose Antonio Alvarez will comment in greater detail on the business's areas. I will then briefly report on the current state of the ABN AMRO operation regarding Santander. And lastly, I will also give you conclusions on the quarter and how we see the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>So my first idea is that we are living in a very complicated environment as you all know, but in this difficult environment, Santander has shown its capacity to generate profits. We are going through an economic slowdown and uncertainties in markets, but nevertheless, we continue to show our capacity to generate recurring profits.</p>
          <p>Our business model and our capacity to execute project and to anticipate and adapt to market conditions has enabled us to observe the slowdown and some of the markets and businesses where we operate, offsetting it will be excellent situation of others. This is the advantage of our high degree of diversification.</p>
          <p>Also, as you can see, the quality of our results in vertical as well as horizontal terms in other words, the way in which the cascade of the account has been brought as well as in terms of businesses. Our geographies of the units are in an excellent path of growth.</p>
          <p>The important commercial units which is our core business, the retail banking business that represent 80% of the group's profits and that is growing consistently. Therefore, we are making progress and we're progressing toward our goal of increasing EPS by 15%, which is our target.</p>
          <p>Quarterly profits in the first quarter is &#x20AC;2.206 billion, 22% more than in the first quarter of last year. This figure includes, as you can see in the graph, the contribution of &#x20AC;151 million from the Real Bank -- Banco Real, which is a difference between profits of 252 million and the financing cost net taxes of 101. So, that would give us a net figure of &#x20AC;151 million.</p>
          <p>As you know, until we have the definite separation of Banco Real, these profits are recorded in income accounted for by the equity method in financial management and equity stakes. These results therefore are not included in the operational business. They are not included in the operating businesses. They are included in the corporate center, or what we call financial management and equity stakes.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to remind you that in terms of earnings per share, we are already including in the denominator the total number of shares. So this is for you to better understand what the EBITDA means, what the earnings -- profits before taxes are.</p>
          <p>So the important year-to-year growth as of profits as well as earnings per share, I think these show the great softness of our business, and right now in the circumstances where that we're living, I think it sets us apart from many of our international competitors that are presenting strong fluctuations in their profits, and even losses.</p>
          <p>We offer a fourth quarter in the row where profits are of more than &#x20AC;2 billion with 22% growth as compared to the first quarter of 2007 and with a 4% growth or 4% more than in the fourth quarter, the last quarter of 2007. And we can say the same thing regarding EPS which was about 4% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>And all of this -- if we look at it by business units, where I repeat the Banco Real part is not included, then we can see how all our units are growing consistently. Our retail banking units in Europe, mainly the Santander branch network and Banesto, all these retail banking units are growing at about 15%. I remind you, we're talking about Santander Banesto, Santander consumer finance in Portugal.</p>
          <p>The U.K increase results by 17% in sterling, growing 13% more than the fourth quarter of 2007 and our businesses in Latin America are growing at rates of 22% in dollars, which is a currency with which we manage the region. And this may be repetitive -- I repeat that ABN AMRO contribute -- is contributing what I've mentioned before. But it's not included in any of the operating businesses but in the corporate center.</p>
          <p>When we take a look at the different business units, Jose Antonio Alvarez, our CFO, will be more specific unit-by-unit and business-by-business. In order to describe these results of the first quarter, I am going to use a little house, that we have been using on other occasions, which I think that summarizes very well the pillars on which the growth of our results is based on -- are based on.</p>
          <p>The first aspect is the strong growth in earnings per share, its sustainability and the quality of these results. The second point would be the strong rise in recurrent revenues. In this regard, we must say that although we are experiencing in some markets a slowdown in the volumes, we are focusing on improving the spreads of our assets and going deeper in our relations with our customers and this has given us this strict to our recurrent revenues. It isn't by chance, but it's very helpful to have a largest distribution network in the world.</p>
          <p>The third idea is an improvement in our cost to income ratio. When we present that results in the month February, we said that one of our tactical priorities in 2008 would be to emphasize on the cost in order to keep our jaws wide open and this has also been achieved in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>All of this cost and revenues management has allowed us to absorb an increase in provisions, which although it is part of our forecast within our budget nevertheless, it is true that there has been an increase in our provisions, a significant increase. And all of this is surrounded by strong balance sheet in terms of credit quality as well as in terms of liquidity and solvency.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at the results for the first quarter, we can see that growth is strong. Perhaps, we haven't grown as much as we have been growing in terms of earnings in previous quarters, but nevertheless it is significant.</p>
          <p>In the chart you will see two things, two visions. The vision of the group including ABN AMRO, the Banco Real and the group excluding the bank -- the part from this unit, both are excellent, very difficult call to imitate by our international competitors, but if you can get these results 19% is by how much income has increased. This multiplies by three the increase in cost which is only 5.7%. Last year revenue grew by 21% and cost grew by 11%.</p>
          <p>Well, now the income has gone 19% and the cost has been under control. They have only risen by 5.7%. So the net operating income has risen 31%, very similar to the figure we obtained at the end of 2007, 32% practically the same figure as in 2007 and this enables us to observe the rise in provisions and offer an increase in the net operating income less provisions of 21%, which is very similar to what we see on last line which is 22.4% rise in attributable profit.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at the series, because we can see that there is a consistency of revenues and we can see how the core part of our business, which is the net interest income excluding dividends and fee income and insurance activity has been increasing every quarter over last three years and yet again in the first three months of 2008. And this clearly reflects the good performance of all our units. The soundness provided by our high degree of geographic and business diversification in circumstances as currency consensus. And within this performance the main source of growth is the net interest income which in like-for-like terms excluding the cost of financing ABN was 19% higher than in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Why this growth of 19%? Well, basically because of the improvement in customer spreads -- asset spreads basically in the past two quarters. The growth in business volumes which well slowing down are still increasing at around double-digit rates and these -- as a result of these spreads, volumes of good management in the cost of the whole to be financed, but it's the actual difference between loans and deposits of the retail units and Continental Europe, Abbey and the main countries of Latin America are registered and notable raises in net interest income. All grew up more than 10% and of note where Santander branch network and Banesto which combined increased 24% and Abbey which in the British market which is very difficult to competitive market is growing at rates of 15% in terms of revenue, which is what I'm referring to right now.</p>
          <p>The third point of our little house that I showed you earlier is the improvement of the efficiency ratio. Before I said how our management of revenues and cost enabled us to end 2006 and 2007 was result of about 10 point in 2006 -- in 2007 and this is also how we've started the year 2008. I think the Santander Group has a track record in cost management. We ended 2007 with an increase of cost of 10.5% and we began 2008 with growth in cost of 5.7%, however, pace in this trend will continue. And we believe that by the end of the year our growth and cost will be below this figure that we have right now 5.7%.</p>
          <p>Well, for many years, we have been continuously improving our cost to income and we will continue to do so in 2008. We closed the quarter with the cost to income of 41.9%, four points less than in the same period of 2007 and nine points below that of 2006. We are, I think among the most efficient banks in the world.</p>
          <p>And the first point is provisions. The Group's loan-loss provisions were 69% higher than in the first quarter of 2007 and 5% more than in the fourth quarter. The year-on-year rise was due to several factors, as these referred to previously on the one hand the growth lending, which in some Latin American countries is still growing at more than 20% and this justifies part of this growth. On the other hand, we are change of mix in some units where we are growing basically more in market segments of individual customers. And thirdly, that in the first quarter of 2007, and then what we call global banking and markets. We have made provisions that did not occur in 2008. And of course risk premium has increased in some markets because of the less favorable macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I remind you and this is proven on the graph on the right hand side that the net operating income deducts pre-provisions, growth of 21%, very similar to growth in earnings. If we compare now more in detail these figures by all the provisions by business area, if we start by the right hand side, I wanted to point out that we are still making provisions and we are still making generic funds. They were less in retail units because of the lower growth in lending and that we made some in global wholesale banking releases in the first quarter of 2007, the next figure was almost the same on the Europe side.</p>
          <p>In specific provisions these have increased in Europe and in Latin America and following the latest trends, well perhaps actually it was a little bit higher, but in the other countries, we still keep the same trend that we had in preceding quarters. And in Europe we have two increases which are the most important in consumer lending with growth in Europe's units and drives. And I've said repeatedly in other presentations that drives is a business that where, it has very low cost, but it is very intensive in provisions and the Santander branch network is also growing in provisions, but I have to ask something to this because part of this increase is a business meeting, because it occurs because in the first quarter of 2007 it was a very good quarter in terms of recovery, so the network made no specific provisions. In fact that we released some provisions and this is why if we compare to 2007, it looks little bit different. And lastly, lower provisions are the -- whose credit quality remains excellent. And luckily the last point of this summary of our results is the higher strengths of our balance sheet. If we start by the credit quality, as we have been anticipating in previous quarters, there is an increase in NPLs in category of markets. Nevertheless, I remind you it's important to remind you of this that in many markets and particularly in the Spanish case, NPLs are at historical minimum levels. And in this context, overall, it is clear that the group has shown an increase in NPLs, nevertheless, it has excellent quality standard. The NPL ratio is 1.16% and coverage is 133%, if we compare with international standards of European banks, this group is 2.5% in NPL and hasn't reached end coverage of less than 80%. Our higher coverage is partly due to large volume of generic funds, which at the end of March amounted to 6.077 billion.</p>
          <p>As you saw in the chart, we continue to build the generic provision quarter-to-quarter and this situation is also very positive by geographic areas as stated, the NPL ratio is 0.84%, much better than the sector. And the coverage is 202% and the U.K Abbey also had credit quality ratio of clearly better than its main competitors. And in the Latin America, we are among the best in all markets.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>When we talk about strengthening, and to talk about liquidity and solvency. At this point in time, we know that our business model cost for less liquidity and less capital. In terms of liquidity, we're very comfortable -- very comfortable and this is for three reasons. First, because of our retail banking nature, we're more liquid than many of our competitors and this is precisely due to the fact that we have a larger relatively share of customer deposits. Also, our financing structure is appropriate for our needs. We have a higher residual maturity period of over four years, and this is very important. We have access to liquidity markets, which is ample in the short and the medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>As you know, we've had -- we've had to the tune from &#x20AC;4 billion, that's our reopening of the Spanish market with two senior debt issues. And also when we talk about capital and we talk about solvencies, we have to say that we're doing very well. Now, that we see that many international banks are currently effected by the loss of value of their assets. They have to go to capital markets seeking further income where we in historical terms are doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>We are very efficient in terms of managing our capital and we have a core capital ratio, which is in excess of 6%. And this is ladies and gentlemen the end of the first portion, the first summary of our presentation.</p>
          <p>And I want to give the floor to Jose Antonio Alvarez, who will take the floor, talk a little bit about our performance, our business area performance. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Yes, good morning. As our CEO just said, I am in fact going to make some comments regarding the business unit. We aspire to have questions-and-answers afterward, so some of the information that we use to read out in the past, might be read out on this occasion, but is available to you in the documentation that's been distributed. So let's talk about the business areas, but first I'd like to make a reference to three specific subjects, which have been discussed briefly by the CEO and which allow us to understand our performance.</p>
          <p>So first and foremost, we need to make a reference to the impact of the dollar, depreciation of the dollar and the sterling. We know that that's impacted by some &#x20AC;190 million, negative. And this will be offset, if you will, by the corporate center without hedge and we'll be seeing the detail, whereas in the future we see that that's a positive 210 million. So, it's fair to say that one against the other what things are made for, very important we have to make a reference to the year-on-year filing the profits of global wholesale banking.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at those numbers, we see that numbers have been good. Look at the chart and you'll see how, if we compare with previous quarters, the results have been good. The first one in 2007 was exceptional and we'll see the <mark type="inaudible" /> efforts, we see that from negative comparison with the quarter one '08. So we're talking year-on-year and these are the numbers. And finally, the ABN issue has been discussed, I am not going to focus on this at this point in time, but it's -- as we've not incorporated into the operating areas.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look as only briefly and let's summarize, the generation of results, pie chart which I think talks about our numbers, what we see is that the commercial units in the euro zone represents 41% for retail the rest of Europe contributes to 8%, I think you'll see the evolution of global wholesale banking. The UK 12%, Latin America, we split into two, we have ex Real, that's 29% Banco Real, in other words, represents 10%. And this I think allows to understand pretty clearly where results are being generated. I'm talking about geographical areas. Santander</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, the consumer financing in Portugal are growing at 12%, and this can be compared with the fourth quarter which was 15. The rest of Europe, I talked about the fact that it reflected growing <mark type="inaudible" /> market that divide into two. Latin America growing very healthily and Europe, basically the operations allow for the kind of business that all of us have, we're talking about loans, we are talking about parts of the equity, which are doing a little bit less. We see a significant loss of 51%.</p>
          <p>And in the UK, Abbey is performing very nicely indeed. We are talking about 17%, if we compare with the previous quarter. And let's look at Latin America, Latin America is growing at 22%; that's how they're doing. If we compare it with the fourth quarter, we're doing above that.</p>
          <p>So let's look a little bit more at the different units, the European units. We see double-digit growth. We are talking about income and we are talking about operating income and profits, so we're seeing 13% gross operating income and we are seeing 12% in profit.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the Spanish networks, Santander Branch and Banesto. That's a nice combination I think. We heard our CEO make a reference to the "jaw", we're talking about 15% roughly, those are the results of the bank in Spain.</p>
          <p>Santander Consumer Finance or SCF is growing very nicely, 16%. Remember that there have been that loss in 2007. However, we've seen, as I say, healthy growth. However, we do need to remember that there are start ups and costs are high. So we know that they will be growing, but a little bit more weakly perhaps than the underlying elements.</p>
          <p>And finally Portugal, Portugal's profits grew by 20%, that's retail banking, and we're looking forward to seeing one-off. We're looking at releasing of provisions, and that's going to be I think the competitive element there. But as I said before, retail banking profits are growing at a very healthy 20%.</p>
          <p>Now I want to see if I summarize this. You have this information, I said at the beginning, we have Santander growing 9% and profits 14%. We see that improvement in the net interest income and we can say the same, Santander Consumer Finance and Portugal. In general, there is a slowdown of loans.</p>
          <p>With some exceptions, Portugal is doing nicely. The cooling down affects Spain perhaps more, and in the case of <mark type="inaudible" /> and consumer finance, we would be talking about other countries such as Germany and so on where rates are even improving. So to summarize, when we look at the volume, we are talking about adapting. So we're talking about an improvement in our net interest income as we compare with ATMs in all of the commercial units in Europe.</p>
          <p>Let's look a little bit now at profit per unit. On the one hand, we've got the Santander Network, we're doing 14% there. We made a reference before to the net interest income before that was 20%, fees also are doing very nicely. Provisions, as I mentioned, we have got that comparison because of that freeing up and it was 2007. If we compare with numbers in the past Banesto, we said that there is a nice cost control and nice income, if we compare with that growth of over 5% and in Consumer Finance nice performance in Europe.</p>
          <p>There is an improvement in the commercial revenues at 4% over the fourth quarter. Because of Germany, because of cross-selling fees, you see that there is an improvement there. And in Europe in the past quarter, we've seen 5% over the fourth quarter. In terms of drive, Santander Consumer USA, that's good management there. In the past two months, we saw an increase because of the prices of second hand automobiles. This has been turned around. And in general, it's fair to say that this is performing better in the States, better quality. So we do not foresee major changes, at least not so far.</p>
          <p>It's also I think known by all that we have agreed with GE for an exchange, operations with GE. And the same with Royal Bank of Scotland. Basically that's the cards. That I think cedes nicely into our commission, that's going to represent an increase of 20% of the Santander Consumer Finance portfolio and probably will be generating higher synergies and costs.</p>
          <p>Portugal now. We have an excellent rate. Commercial revenues doing very nicely, 4%, 9% over fourth quarter and profit before tax at a positive 20% over the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's go to the UK. I think that it's fair to say that performance is excellent. If we compare with the competition and if we look inside, we are talking about the results in general. So really, we are at a distance from our competitors. We see a gross operating income of 9% in the upper part of our target range, 5 to 10%, we are up there at 9; excellent, excellent cost control 1%. And our net operating income and profits are growing to the tune of 17% in pounds. And quarter-on-quarter, when we look at the growth, we see that we are doing very nicely in terms of net operating income.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the spreads. We see that loans are growing at 10%, last year 8%, deposits 5 in comparison with 1. The absolute numbers I think are not twice what they were one year ago. This is true, but, however, because market activities have shrunk, well our net lending, our net lending I repeat, has grown. And what's grown more are the spreads with 76 basis points. He said 76. This I think talks about better capacity, talks about more magnetism. And we would see the very healthy trend, we are doing at 47, that's our efficiency and the quality is excellent, very stable. Our provisions also are stable. So I think that we can say that Abbey has performed very nicely.</p>
          <p>And we're talking about cost control, we're talking about a very, very nice series of numbers in the UK. But for Latin America now, in Latin America, again, growth is very healthy. If we see the net operating income, we can talk about 40, 50% growth. If we look at the attributable profit, that's done very healthy, very brisk growth with profits which are of some 1.092 billion; that's 22% higher than the first quarter of 2007. I am referring to the attributable profit. If you look at the information country-by-country, they are all doing over 30%. That's an increase of their gross operating income by more than 30% in dollars all of them open their "jaws", in the case of Chile 34%, in the rest of the area very nice. We see Brazil is growing at 33%, Mexico 41% before discontinued operations. That's very interesting. Chile doing better at 16%, 25% before discontinued operations and other countries growth, well, there is two impacts, one is provision. This is basically Chile and another impact for contingencies in Venezuela, other income Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Private banking is growing at a pace of approximately 20% in profit. That's been our tradition in the past few months and we're averaging, as I see that, 20% growth.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the units now. Exactly what we did in Europe, let's do it in Latin America. We see all countries are doing very nicely in terms of loans, but with some footnotes, Brazil 30%, retail 28, wholesale one-digit. In terms of deposits, we're doing growth of 32%. In Mexico, we are doing 19 with <mark type="inaudible" /> and we are talking about 20, 30% in the retail portions. In terms, let's see, of deposits in Mexico, 20% growth. So we know that we need to continue to attract money. And in Chile, we're also doing double-digits. So I think it's fair to say that performance was good, not surprising, because some of these countries are growing to the tune of some 4 or 5% GDP. So if we compare with the scenario, these are -- this is the kind of growth we have seen. We believe that it is sustainable if things continue as they are.</p>
          <p>If we look at the spreads, the focus on spreads, yes, in fact there has been improvement in retail banking in Chile and Mexico for different reasons: in Mexico, because of loans and Chile, deposits and in Brazil is a reduction of 110 base points with a fall of 150 base points, which -- that's in the SELIC rate. And this can be explained by the fact that quarter-on-quarter, there is an erosion as our conversions start towards more sustainable levels.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look at the main Latin American units, at profits specifically. In Brazil, we see that revenues are backed by excellent fee performance and a smaller rise in cost, 12% growth in fees over quarter -- fourth quarter. And we are talking about inflation levels in costs. And that I think is what we're looking for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Risk premiums in line with fourth quarter '07 with NPL ratios rising and thus more provisions. However, growth, I think continues to be healthy and profitable. Net operating income excluding gains on financial transaction and net of provisions was 11% higher than in the fourth quarter. So we're talking about profitable business. Despite the downward turn of that 15 points in the risk premium. So, as I say, we're doing fine in Mexico. The trend is what we had in the past in commercial revenue, costs down and stable provisions. Retail banking is growing nicely and net operating income 15% and cards, that's doubled our risk premium. We're making a reference to that.</p>
          <p>Although the NPL ratio is still good, so that risk premium, as I say, has doubled in just one year. This is, as I say, due to that cards impact. And the NPL ratio I repeat is good, it's 1.3%. That I think is a very telling number.</p>
          <p>Chile now, lower growth because of our focus on spreads. And we see that growth is healthy. Again, we see that net operating income is 21% higher than in the fourth quarter. I think that this is a very telling snapshot of things in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Financial Management and Equity Stakes, major change in the first quarter of 2007, those 495 million, that difference, which is due to two factors. First, the contribution of ABN Real, as the CEO said, 151 million, not 100%, I think exactly, 151 million net. And the second impact, which I made a reference to before is the hedge of results, which is to the tune of 210 million. I think that this offsets the 190 million negative impact of exchange rates, which was the result of the business activities as I mentioned at the beginning of my presentation.</p>
          <p>Let's look at other business segments, now the secondary segment. We would talk about retail banking, which is doing, as it was in the past, our profits before taxes are doing nicely, 28%, and 24% in UK and Latin America. And if we see what the impact it will be the rate of exchange.</p>
          <p>If we look at global wholesale banking, and I am going to stop and focus on this a little bit more specifically, because this was particularly good. If you see profit before taxes on the left hand, we are talking about 882, that's in the first quarter and 592 first quarter 2008. However, that first quarter of 2008 is a very healthy one.</p>
          <p>If we look at the margin, the net -- the gross operating revenue, it continues to be healthy. There are three elements to take into account and we compare the first quarter 2008 and the first quarter of 2007, bit of a distortion. You will remember the very important operations in Spain, large operations in Spain, which were one-off.</p>
          <p>Second, the high trading revenues, which you see were reduced from 272 to 149 million. So things are not that bright. And finally in first quarter 2007, the generic provision, that's an impact. We see that 51 million were released and it's been 25 million in the same period. So if we focus on global wholesale banking now, let's look at the different geographies. There is two separate universes here. You have Latin America and you have Europe.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, we see a per product interpretation. We see corporate banking, your classical element if you were doing 37% growth rates. That business basically, Santander Global Connect, which we launched in Spain years ago, we have grown -- we are into Portugal, we're not going into Latin America which is doing growth of 25%. And we see the three businesses which are most linked to investment banking.</p>
          <p>We would see those credits. We're talking about &#x2013; that's following investment banking and the operations doing interesting numbers at the beginning of 2007. And variable income, which is not a factor. You have on the one hand a loss of 50% of activities; and at the same time, we see a growing demand of derivatives. We see that that is growing very healthily, and the net was a fall of 10%.</p>
          <p>From our vision, our interpretation is that it's good performance at this point in time, and we believe that we will continue to see this kind of performance in the second and third and fourth quarters. We believe that our platform is good and we'll be able to make the objectives that we seek.</p>
          <p>Finally, management and insurance profits before taxes increased 4%. On the one hand, we have insurance -- the insurance business that growth quarter-after-quarter, the bancassurance business, particularly in Spain and Latin America.</p>
          <p>In the asset management world, we also have two parts to it. We have the Spanish part where the asset manage have gone down significantly and therefore we have less revenue of some fees and commissions. But in Latin America, it is rising at about the 60% -- 40% sorry, for the impact of Spain and in mutual funds and the positive impact of mutual funds in Latin America. In bancassurance, we are growing very well and we think that this is sustainable because we are introducing the bancassurance concept in the new unit.</p>
          <p>And now I give the floor once again to our CEO who will go over the last two points of the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to talk about the next two points, the situation of the ABN AMRO deal and then I'll give you some final conclusions on the quarter. With regards to the ABN AMRO operation, as is well known, because this is public information, you know that we have signed a principle agreement, a preliminary agreement with General Electric to sell Interbanca and receive in return the consumer finance business GE Money in Germany, in Finland and in Austria as well as the cards and auto finance unit in the UK.</p>
          <p>In other words, we are exchanging a non-core asset for a core asset that reinforce our consumer finance business in Europe and that also allow high potential synergies with our current units.</p>
          <p>Plus we also acquired the asset management business for this in Brazil for &#x20AC;209 million. We did this for very clear reasons. This ensures the management and distribution of core product for Banco Real's customers, particularly retail one and the generation of synergies with the integration of the business in our global asset management unit. So these two operations fit like a glove within our strategic and financial criteria and make the total investment in the ABN operation of about &#x20AC;10.8 billion. In the appendices, you will find further details on both deals.</p>
          <p>Lastly, as regards the process of segregating assets, we have received the no objection from the Dutch Central Bank to the global separation plan. And we are working on obtaining authorization for each specific plan. We believe that the main dividing up of the assets with our partners will be completed during the third quarter when we will assume management of our units which are not going to be part of Santander. Also on a day-to-day basis, we are still not managing Banco Real. We believe it is necessary to provide some information on its performance during the first quarter, which I can tell you already, was very positive. These are our pro forma figures. This is a first approximation of the accounts following the Spanish criteria. And as you can see, the Banco Real is performing quite well, basically supported on the strength of its revenue, which increased more than costs clearly. In other words, the jaws are widening and this allows us to absorb provisions which are also rising. And so the profits before taxes increase in dollars by more than 40% for all.</p>
          <p>So this is a good snapshot, but I say it's just an approximation to Spain's criteria and probably won't coincide with the figures published locally nor with those of ABN AMRO because of accounting and perimeter differences.</p>
          <p>There are also some figures that summarize Banco Real's activity and management ratios, which are similar to those of the appendices on any of our units. Banco Real is growing briskly in loans faster than the market with a particular focus on SMEs. And it is doing so with no erosion of its good credit quality ratios.</p>
          <p>We can also see the improvement of its efficiency, has a very good cost to income, of course still far from the Group standards, which is good news, because that means that we have lots of synergies to achieve a lot of potential there. And I'm sure that we will be able to bring out these synergies in our integration plan.</p>
          <p>As you know in October, there is going to be a presentation dedicated to the Banco Real where we will have this meeting at the end of October in Brazil and we will present our three-year plan for analysts and investors. And there you will see the -- what our outlook is for this step -- just as we did when we acquired Abbey, we made a presentation on the Abbey business for investors and analysts as we will do this time in Brazil for Banco Real.</p>
          <p>So, conclusions. The first quarter saw active management of the key elements of business. In the first quarterly or earnings presentation, I talked about the priorities or the keys to managing this year. And if we go over how we have made progress along these priorities, well, the truth is that at the end of the first quarter, we can say that we have obtained very good results. In spreads, which was one of the most important management drivers for the first quarter, we have been able to increase all our spreads, assets spreads in all units. There is just a slight increase because of course this is a mixture of all markets, all product. But in the relevant businesses, the improvement of spreads has been quite significant. When it comes to managing costs, we're slowing down the cost. We are bringing down our costs, and therefore, we are going to keep those wide opened jaws here. Provisions are increasing in line with our forecast and are absorbed by the growth in revenues.</p>
          <p>In terms of deposits, which was another one of our priorities, we are growing at the two-digit rate, faster than the rise in lending. In quality of service, we have a large customer base which we are close to in order to respond quickly to clients' needs. The name of the game today is not to have the priority to increase our customer base, but work in order to loss least customers than the customers we already have.</p>
          <p>Our core capital is strong, more than the 6%, and we are actively managing our portfolio of businesses, investing in businesses and countries we know well and where we can obtain all sorts of synergies and also meeting our financial criteria.</p>
          <p>Although this can be summarized in an very good quarter. We are very satisfied by this quarter. We have reached a new quarterly record in profit, and our growth in earnings per share is among the best, if not the best, because our earnings per share has increased by 14.7%. The profits are based on the most recurrent revenues and on management of the "Jaws," as we like to call them. Which encourage us to continue along these lines, because these are recurrent profits.</p>
          <p>And moreover Bank of Royal has improved the EPS right from the start. All units are growing and growing well, all of them are improving over the last quarter and the balance sheet remains solid and solvent. And all of this in a very complex environment for banks, where a relative advantage over our competitors is becoming clear and clear. And this is why we have an outlook, very optimistic outlook for the future. We think we have excellent diversification in combination which is excellent between mature and emerging market. We have prudent risk management. We have a starting point when it comes to a risk company which is very healthy. We don't have "toxic" products. We have historically low NPL ratios, very high coverage levels. Our mortgage portfolio has very good quality. All of this allows us to continue this year to enjoy, a very comfortable position. And together with that we also have a very comfortable liquidity position.</p>
          <p>This is why we can maintain our vision for the next few quarters along the lines of the objectives announced in the Investors Day in September. So, very few banks in the world can say today that we can maintain the growth forecast that we make seven months ago. This is a clear reflection of the potential and soundness of Santander's portfolio and business model.</p>
          <p>That is all. Thank you very much, and we of course, at your disposal to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Yes thank you. As I said earlier, first of all we're going to take questions from &#x2013; take questions from the web. And when we are through this round of questions, we'll take questions over the phone. So the first question is from Antonio Ramirez from Keefe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now that the lending is slowing down in Spain, but it's not slowing down as much as in other places, is this going to be noticed on your market share? And what segments do you feel most comfortable to grow in, and what lending growth expectations do you have for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll start by saying that the figures perhaps might give us a less slowing down of lending than our competitors. But what I want to say very clearly is that we are not managing lending right now with volume criteria, we are managing it with spread criteria. As I said during my presentation on several occasions and as we mentioned in the earnings presentation that we did in February.</p>
          <p>Lending, yes is slowing down for the whole industry, also for us. And most probably the only explanation that I can find to explain why it is slowing down less for us than for others is because our bank, the Santander Group in Spain, traditionally has a very strong position among corporations and SMEs. So, our starting point is very strong, plus our experience is very good. And this industry is still growing in terms of lending, reasonable so. If I am asked, as I seem to tell from your questions, in what segments do we feel most comfortable to grow in, well we feel more comfortable in the traditional segments where &#x2013; that we know well and where we have experience in, where we are well positioned. And one of these segments is the company segment when it comes to SMEs and also allows for large corporations. Now, expectations, well the ideas we have, and in fact that's how we have it in our budget, we believe that lending in 2008 is not going to grow more than 8 to 10%; that is our forecast. And for the time being we still believe in that forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ignacio Cerezo from JP Morgan has several questions, and first of these is, can you breakdown the margins in Spain? How sustainable is this increase in margins? And are you going to keep your policy of not competing for deposits? Can you break down the fees and commissions performance in the domestic network? And what are the forecasts for the year? Also, the maintenance and sustainability of the risk premium in Spain right now: At what specific level do you think that you can start to use the generic provisions?  And lastly, why is there an increase in provisions in Santander Consumer and why have they gone down in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The margins in Spain, the spreads, we think are sustainable; the increase in margins. In any case when it comes to interpreting things, and this is something that you have to do more in detail, we have to look at the volume effect, we have to look at the spread effect and also the TTI effect; in other words internal transfer rate, which has had very strong movements in this quarter because of the difference between the basis rates and the swap or the interbanking rates in the different markets. But, of course, we will have to go into further details and break it down even further. But the truth is that we do believe that this expansion of spreads will be sustainable, for reasons I am not going to go into right now, but they are quite obvious and I think we all know what we are talking about.</p>
          <p>Commissions and fees; well, yes, the esthetics, the way it looks, well, it doesn't look very good. Fees and commissions in Santander are not growing very much; apparently, 3.5%. But let us not forget that fees and commissions, we have fees and commissions from mutual funds. And fees from mutual funds represent a third of our fees and commissions. So, when the volume of mutual funds goes down and when the industry is focusing more on deposits, this brings down the fees and commissions, but that is offset, more or less, depending on the case, by an increase in spreads from deposits. So, if we look at the fall, or the figure, the apparent fall of fees and commissions excluding this drop in mutual funds, we see that fees and commissions are behaving normally, with growth rates equivalent to the growth rate of the business turnover. There is nothing else to add there.</p>
          <p>Now, from what level on does the generic provision come into play? Well, it's difficult to tell. But it looks or we believe that generic provision because today the cost of risk in Spain is 0.30: 30, 31 basis points. And until it reaches 50 basis points &#x2013; in another words, until that &#x2013; this almost double from 31 to 50, well, until we don't reach the 50 position, you don't have to make use of the generic provisions.</p>
          <p>Why this increase in provisions in Santander Consumer? Well the normal impairment of lending that we see everywhere, so nothing special there.</p>
          <p>And lastly, what is the lending portfolio &#x2013; why is it going down in Brazil?  Well I don't know. I guess it's because there is less activity in financial markets in Brazil, but I can't be much more specific than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Cerezo from JP also has a question. Can you talk about shares in Royal and Fortis, and what are our plans in that field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No plans, actually. I mean it positions trading, financials, the amounts, I think, have been spelled out for you in the documentation. And to put it bluntly, well, we don't have specific plans. I mean, trading in general, we will decide on the basis of their vision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez from Keefe has a question about the possible need to recapitalize Sovereign. What would Santander do? Perhaps a subscription of more than 25%, would we talk about an IPO? What would happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll cross that bridge when we make it to the shores of that river.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question from Antonio, after the takeover one is reserves on the assets available for sale.  AFS is down 1.20 million, what's the impact, and also the difference in exchange rates, a negative 2.3. And hedged positive 758, and can you give us some update regarding coverage and so on. Can you talk a little bit about results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this question is going to be taken by Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez, who has an answer which I unfortunately do not have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are talking about adjustments.  We are talking about a number of different elements. Basically the first one is the one that has to do with exchange rates. As you know the hedge policy that we have is we cover our book value &#x2013; but there is also the element which is deducted from the core capital &#x2013; that's goodwill &#x2013; so it doesn't impact on capital, but when we talk about exchange rate variations, there would be a variation there too. So, I am not sure whether it would be 60, 70%, which is the direct result of exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The second effect comes from <mark type="inaudible" />, if there has been a sale, this will also result in a difference along these lines. So basically these are the elements that would explain the numbers, it depends on the period of time we're looking at, one or another we will have more of a relevant weight. And when we talk about fixed income, well, yes, there might have been some variation in those portfolios but nothing that leaps out at us. Those are basically goodwill and sales of shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Javier Bernat from Caja Madrid has the same question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you want we can give you more specific details at the end of our conference call, because there seems to be many questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Santiago L&#xF3;pez from Credit Suisse has two questions. One the NPL portfolio has grown by 1 billion in the quarter, could we perhaps know why Spain Banco Real <mark type="inaudible" /> not Banco Real, of course. Could you give us little bit more of detail regarding loss of core capital in the quarter, those risks and assets have actually shrunken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one, the growth in NPL; that's true it is practically 1 billion. Yes, 600 million in Spain, 133 in the rest of Europe, and 186 in Latin America. So that's where we see the growth of NPLs. Of the 600-odd in Europe, Santander has grown by 130. Actually I made a reference to that in my presentation. And the reason? Well, it has very much to do with the fact that in the first quarter of 2007 there was a freeing up. So that's the comparison. I think that we should remember that.</p>
          <p>Banesto grew by 110, yeah we saw that too when Banesto in the <mark type="inaudible" />; Consumer Spain, that's 52; and then we have another one &#x2013; that's UCI. The &#x2013; that's something we share with BNP, that's mortgages, that's 100 million growth. So, that explains the Spanish number. In the rest of Europe, I think it's 50-something, that's Portugal, and 50-something Germany. That's something they're consuming. So, again nothing that's especially noteworthy there. And in Latin-America, I think that I went into the numbers there when we talked about provisions: 50 million, Brazil; 50, Chile; and 38 million Puerto Rico. Then there is a little bit of Mexico, that's 20 million.</p>
          <p>And everything which I said, I think, does fit into those 900-odd million that we've seen in the growth of our NPLs in the past quarter. As to the drop in core capital, to the best of my recollection it would be the dividend issue. Dividend which was agreed upon, although not paid out, but yes agreed upon.  That is actually subtracts from the capital, which is 34 basis points. So that's what happens when you subtract. I think that that explains very nicely the reduction in core capital December-March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlos Berastain from Deutsche Bank has another question. Real in Brazil that's been taken. And he has a follow-up question. He wonders whether we could talk a little bit about the drop in the spread in Spain to 382 from yesterdays' <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this drop can be explained, but we need to talk not about the assets. I talked about &#x2013; I said that those are growing and will continue to grow. They will definitely consolidate, as we've seen. And this effect, which is referred to in the question is due to the reduction in spreads and deposits. It is true that there has been a reduction and it's due also to the DTI effect that I made a reference to before. In the fourth quarter of 2007 it was a very relevant effect, definitely, and that affected the spread. That would be the internal cost of transfers. That is something that we need to take into account when we look at this number specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marco Troiano from S&amp;P wonders whether we could perhaps elucidate further on those 338 million which have come in, because he seems to think that it's more than it was in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What's most important when we talk about the equity method is ABN, those results that we saw in ABN because the cost is a financial cost: 252 million, ABN; 56 million Cepsa. And that's practically it.  Eighteen Sovereign and Attijari, our bank in Morocco, and much, much smaller areas. The more important ones are ABN and Cepsa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez from Keefe would like to know about ROCs in Brazil and Mexico. He would like to know what the portfolios are, what the impacts are? And he also makes the reference to the IPO from Visa, and we talk about contingencies -- what are the proficiencies. He doesn't talk about the areas specifically. I imagine he is referring to Latin America, Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well to the best of my recollection in Latin America, there have been some sales in Mexico. I think that that was about $50 million. In any case in Mexico the results have always been negative. So, practically, every quarter of last year that was the case. So the basic effect is going from negative to positive: minus 20 to &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; plus 20, plus 30, plus 40. That would perhaps be the more significant effect.</p>
          <p>Brazil, frankly, I don't really remember anything exceptional or noteworthy happening there. As to the second question, the Visa IPO. Yes, we are talking about some 50 million, 20 &#x2013; 20 something Mexico; 13, 12, 14, Brazil; and the rest is Chile and Puerto Rico, basically. That would be the impact. So nothing Spain and Portugal, because that Visa does not include Visa Europe.  In other words it's all Visa in Latin America.</p>
          <p>And then another question, let's see. I think &#x2013; when you talk about provisions you talk about the corporate center, I imagine, I imagine.  I think that we're talking about other results there, a minor amount, a lesser amount. Which would basically be contingencies which can then eventually we passed on to the different areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think he might be referring to Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, in other results. Well, in the case of Brazil I think that it's a <mark type="inaudible" /> everything. We do away with quarter one 2007. If you look at the other quarters, look at their results, whatever the contingencies might be, <mark type="inaudible" /> is what they refer to. We're talking about a significant amount. In the first quarter 2007, I don't know why we didn't get that information, but if you look at quarters two, three and four that was in fact the same numbers. So there is really no major change then to refer to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergio G&#xE1;mez from Merrill Lynch has a question regarding the difference in behavior in the quarterly growth in NPL Commercial and the Santander Network in Spain. Well, 22 quarter-on-quarter what is it due to, could we perhaps give nuance information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well no there is no difference, there is no major difference, practically it's a zero difference. I mean it's just hundreds, if we look at the NPLs in Santander and Banesto retail banking. What happens is that in arithmetical terms the numbers do not match because in the denominator what we're doing is we're introducing different concepts. In another words Banesto introduces all of its credits, in another words, wholesale and retail where Santander only includes retail, doesn't include wholesale. If the Santander Network also includes everything there would be a plummet in its NPL ratio, because of course there is no NPL in wholesale. So, that's' how it is.</p>
          <p>If I then introduce, in the element there, a huge chunk of credit where there is no NPL, well that's going to really change my numbers. But that's the difference.  Banesto is a legal entity and includes everything, everything, when it calculates this NPL ratio. That's why the numbers are very different as we compare with Santander. Because global banking and markets take that information on board. So if were to play the game along those rules, the difference, as I say is now in the hundreds. There is no difference between Banesto and Santander, if we look at NPL. Because I repeat it's basically the same criteria. There is certain loss in consumption and mortgages. There is marginal worsening in corporate; and there is no change, if we look at key customers, what we call global banking markets, Santander what they call &#x2013; they call corporate banking.</p>

          <p>Marco Troiano from S&amp;P would like to know about the impact, the positive tax impact in the quarter. Could we perhaps provide further details?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is number of effects. First, it's well known. Germany brought down its corporate tax levels. And this is the first year we see the results there, but in Spain this happens also, perhaps a little bit more gradually. So I think that this year we see a reduction in further two points. Also, Mexico has sold off its NPL, they sold it to a third-party and this is reflected, not impacting recoveries. But yes it does have a tax impact. And finally the profits of Banco Royal, &#x20AC;250 million on the equity method, and ABN will bear their also. So, we are not talking about generating anything, which explains why the group's numbers are actually less.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Javier Bernat from Caja Madrid makes a reference to the increase in consumer finance in Latin America. With this growing trend could we interpret how this might evolve in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the risk premium has grown, yes obviously and this is as a result of the general vogue in this business in the markets. And we have presence here, and that I think, that's the vision. I think it would fair to say that this is how we see the market. We see a slight increase in our NPLs in some markets more visibly than another. But remember also that SCF has practically 40% of its business activities underway in Spain. So, this explains results in Spain, but in other markets NPLs are doing better. Germany, Northern Europe. But the mix, if we see the relative weight, we talk about <mark type="inaudible" />, that's SCF and Spain now.</p>
          <p>But we think that as to a certain point, yes, that's healthy. And then there is another effect, we talked about it on a number of occasions, and sometimes even we ourselves forget to take it into account, but it's a drive. Drive is a business, which really adds NPLs to the numbers in SCF, because although it is true that there is margin or there is income and the cost to income is low, but it does bring on NPL. Why, because that's how it is, because of the way the numbers work. I think we need to graph this in order to understand the variations in the NPL and SCF.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Fidelity would like to know what we think regarding capital ratios under Basel II, although the model, at this point, hasn't been fully approved by the Bank of Spain? And can we confirm whether Abbey is bringing the numbers from headquarters to reposition in some of the recent securitization and how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when we talk about capital, I want to give the floor now to Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez because he really has all this information at the tip of his tongue, but what I can say is that we have been debating whether we introduce the numbers according to Basel II or whether we do things as always. And we took the position at the end of the day to not go down the Basel II path for a very simple straightforward reason which is essentially, as we yet do not have the instructions from the Bank of Spain regarding implementation of Basel II guidelines, it seems to us that it might be misleading and that we might have to eventually undertake all kinds of corrections and <mark type="inaudible" />. So, we believe it's better to wait for the Bank of Spain to come up with clear instructions. And this is, I repeat, the reason why we've not gone down the Basel II path, but as I said before, and I'd like to give the floor to my colleague.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as the CEO said, the model has not yet been approved. We've always said, and we've said it during the Investors Day, we've been repeating this ever since that we believe that ratios will improve based on our assumptions, but we cannot say much more. Now, the second question was regarding Abbey and its liquidity. Abbey, despite the fact that the net lending figure &#x2013; the net lending market share which is much higher than it was before: 15.9. All of this, at the end, it's translated into a growth of the portfolio of about 3 billion. Deposits grow by &#xA3;1 billion. We are talking about the funding requirements of 2 billion plus maturities, which might be 2 or 3 billion in the quarter. You know that Abbey has a business that we call short-term market which was very large, and we have reduced this by 6 or 7 billion during this quarter. And this has given liquidity of 6 or 7 billion. That's more than enough to finance the growth and the financing needs of Abbey.</p>
          <p>Now, why do we securitize? Well that's part of the policy of having a more liquid balance we're discounting this. We have about 16 or 17 billion and we're not discounting anything in the parent company. We have a lots of assets that are eligible for discounts. Why in Abbey? Because it's the most homogenous portfolio, in terms of being efficient in generating more liquidity on the asset side of our balance sheet, but there is no further explanation.</p>

          <p>Jagoba Garcia from Fox-Pitt asks whether we can confirm a 15% of the growth target for base is excluding ABN AMRO, as you communicated last year, any talks about the profits of Bank of Royal 1 billion which is greater than the estimate of 890 that you gave a year ago. What growth of BPA can we expect including ABN and Royal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was not our estimate. That was the market consensus, if I remember correctly. When we did the presentation of the ABN AMRO deal, we mentioned the market consensus. What we're giving now are real; the actual figures. It's this &#x2013; we don't have an estimate, that was the market consensus, as we said. And that's why we have that.</p>

          <p>We have <mark type="inaudible" /> from Goldman Sachs. Is there going to be an impact in the Tier 1 when we consolidate ABN, Royal, with regards to the current equity method? Can you talk &#x2013; you said their provisions increased by 5% quarter-to-quarter, but if we exclude the impact of others it grew 9.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why those others have grown, I think we already answer this in part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And he asks whether we think that the current environment offers strategic opportunities for Santander &#x2013; additional opportunities for Santander as compared to previous crisis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am going to let Jos&#xE9; Antonio answer the first question. The current crisis environment &#x2013; it's a crisis environment, and it's a crisis environment for everyone. For those who do well in a crisis as well as for those who don't do that well in a crisis. So, we need to be prudent. And that is applicable to all cases. We've always said and we repeat it once again that we have ahead of us important organic growth, particularly in Brazil where we have to do a lot of integration work and try to obtain synergies &#x2013; very significant synergies. And therefore right now we don't need any opportunities to grow. We have growth opportunities in our own geometry, in our own parameter. With regards to the capital question, I didn't write down the question, so I am going to pass it over to our CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the question was about the exchange of the Royal. What impact does it had. 15 basis points is the impact it's had into integrating the Royal assets into our assets. But with regards to the core capital, this is a quarter as was said earlier where we made dividend &#x2013; it's a dividend which is more than double the other dividends. The bank in the current scenario, the generation of free capital is quite high. Therefore, what we can expect in normal conditions is for the core ratio, measured according to Basel I will grow in the next few of quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Arturo de Frias from Dresdner. As can we talk about the liquidity of wholesale market and the securitization market, if we're thinking about doing an issue of this kind soon. And he refers, once again, whether we have touched the liquidity lines for the European Central Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jos&#xE9; Antonio. Well the market situation, you know as well as I do, they're extraordinarily well in &#x2013; on the short-term. Short-term funding is very good as far as in the year, short-term. That has better prices than what we have in the market before the summer of last year. And as soon as we cross the border of the year, funding becomes much more expensive and much more volatile. Volatile in the sense that it depends on the latest market news, although in the past three weeks the spreads have improved significantly. I don't know whether this is going to last for long or not, but from the low levels in May, since then the situation has improved significantly.</p>
          <p>Issues: We've made two issues in April, the both in the senior unsecured euros. We think that it is good to have a market discipline, but we also want higher spreads and we think we are going to continue to issue in the market if circumstances allow for it. Our objective is not closing lending to customers who offer the right collateral, the right guarantees, if they do that we will continue to lend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two more questions from Arturo de Frias from Dresdner. One of them has already been answered, I think, which is about NPL, by how much can the risk premiums increase, particularly, in Latin America. What market shares are you achieving in new mortgages in England? And do you expect stability in these market shares for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, market shares in &#x2013; market share in mortgages, I wouldn't say new mortgages because in the UK most of the mortgages are re-mortgages. First mortgages, well there are only a few of them. So, yes we're growing significantly in this part of the market, 15% more market share. It's probably more than our natural market share in the UK due to the market conditions. The market has selected a lot the supply, that is. There has been a re-approaching of supply and also of the spreads. All of this has changed the competitive conditions and the players who are stronger, who are best prepared, who have a more customer liquidity, who have greater market strength and a more solid market position are gaining market share.</p>
          <p>The market is resorting to them more than before. This is good news. And it's good news because it's allowing us to do two very important things in Abbey. On the one hand to be more selective when it comes to credit quality. Abbey in the past few months has seized to have business clients that we could call quality of less than prime. Thereby to let the self-certified &#x2013; these are the sort of mortgages that have never &#x2013; we were never being too active, we had a small share there. So, we are selecting more and that's important, and we will see that in terms of P&amp;Ls, 100% of Abbey's mortgages. There is a classification in the UK that I don't remember right now, but I think they call it standard or something of the sort.</p>
          <p>I have it written somewhere. And if I find it right now &#x2013; standard they divide them into standard, buy to let, self-certified and light to severe adverse. So, zero, light to severe, adverse. Zero, self-certified; practically 1%, buy to let; and 99%, standard. This is what I mean when I say that we have a better credit quality, better selection. Am I doing right, Antonio am I right, okay?</p>
          <p>And the second thing, well, that we are also being very selective in the distribution networks. We have office branches and we have intermediaries. They are better intermediaries and worst intermediaries and <mark type="inaudible" /> we're best intermediaries. And that's our second thing, and then the third thing, we're also very selective in margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, is this sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope so. We hope it's sustainable on the very long term. I think that as the market goes back to shape some of these effect will continue, perhaps with less intensity, but other effects, for example, the growth of spreads that will be more moderate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Diego Barr&#xF3;n from Fortis. Most of the questions have already been answered. The only one that we haven't touched upon is Santander costs are growing at high rates: 6%. For the year, how much will they grow? Can you give us a guidance, a growth guidance for the future? And what management capacity do we have on revenues in the future? All of this reflect to the Santander branch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The Santander branch network has 3% cost growth. And I think I said this during my presentation that although growth is greater we will be converging towards environment roughly 2, 4%, which is the arrival point. That's what the budget &#x2013; the arrival point would be a bit lower. That's regarding 2008. In 2009 &#x2013; well, the truth is that we don't know. Because costs are very much associated to projects, to changes in the commercial infrastructure, to the new opening of our branch offices. So, these are decisions that have not been made yet for 2008. So, we can't tell by how much costs will grow in 2009.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think it would be serious to talk about the increase of costs in Santander in 2009, because I don't know. But if market circumstances continue as they are now, in other words, not too much growth of lending, 8 to 10%, in other words the less growth of activity in general, than we will have to make sure our costs grow as much the inflation does. And if it's less than inflation, well, even better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is cost subsidy? These are all questions related to Brazil, which are already been answered with the exception of one on Banco Real, it says that the net contribution of 150 million in the first quarter, including financial costs, how does that compare to the recurrent growth of the 70 million, more or less, of before, say, Q '07 &#x2013; of the last quarter '07. So can you comment on the operational trends in terms of volume and the comparison between Banco Real and Banco Santander, Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we have the trading gains of Brazil and Mexico that's already been answered. And the domestic interest income in Brazil and local currency has fallen quarter-to-quarter, why, the volume we already discussed. So two questions really that have not yet been answered. Well, I don't want to talk much about Banco Real, because as I said, Banco Real is not yet within our control. We are not managing it yet. So I can't say much about it yet. But I can say two things that the figures that are presented are not homogenous with the other figures of the group, because of the different accounting systems and criteria. And Banco Real is at an excellent growth rate, probably the comparison of the first quarter with the fourth quarter of last year, we're comparing three months &#x2013; quarter &#x2013; three month quarter with a quarter which last less than three months. Because we've been <mark type="inaudible" /> months in any case.</p>
          <p>All the issues, all the questions of the Banco Real. I know that they give rise to a lot of interest and we ourselves have to drop a detailed plan and a committed plan with the market. So we decided to have a presentation on Banco Real in October in Brazil, which would be equivalent to what we did in London for Abbey after &#x2013; 10 or 12 months after we acquired it. We will do the same for Banco Real. We'll talk about the rates of integration of the banks, expected profit levels et cetera. But now we can't really answer seriously any questions about Banco Real.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jagoba Garcia from Fox: If the results of ABN Real include the results of the Visa deal? And then another question on the transition to Basel II capital requirement, I think that was already answered so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, so, it includes Visa. I say I guess because I don't know it very well. If it includes the Visa, I'm saying yes. Yes, 27 million have been pulled. Yes, the Santander account include 1% that you had mentioned earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, two more analysts Mario Lodos from Ibersecurities would like to know about other results that include 208 negative for other contingencies, could you give us more details on that? You talked about the net interest income on average total assets, which costs more than other &#x2013; in other banks? And then, is it time for the re-appreciation of your portfolio, new spreads or is it due to a better mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes in other results or other earnings this is a comparison effect with Brazil &#x2013; but all the other quarters have basically that figure. There is something from Venezuela too. When you see the accounts from Venezuela you see that the operating that the net operating income is more contingent. These are the two things that have an impact on that line &#x2013; as we talked, that you're asking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly Giovanni Carriere from Execution; several questions. Consumer Finance, he talks about the &#x2013; that our operational costs are still growing at high rate 11%, as well as NPLs. He has two questions. What can we expect from the cost from the cost evolution, and strategically speaking, we think it's a good idea to put our stakes on this business at this moment of the cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the budget &#x2013; the cost budget is quite lower. The thing is that they still dragging the rates of 2007, but the level of cost we will see, how it goes down quarter after quarter to converge at levels that I think are of 6% by the end of the year. So this is a variable which is being re-driven. It's &#x2013; they're going to go down, as I said, quarter-to-quarter. Now, NPLs we already mentioned, this is a business where a slowdown, an economic slowdown, has an impact on the side of production, and on the side of NPLs. But this is part of the normal cycle of a retail banking business. And the same thing can be said about credit cards. Our consumer loans distributed by other procedures.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that strategically speaking, it's a very interesting business where the group has very clear capabilities, where we also have a size that would allow us to deal with much more efficient business models than our competitors. And therefore, we continue to believe, although, of course, we are going through a cycle where A. 2008 and '09 are not going to be your best years in history. But nevertheless, strategically speaking, we do think it's a very powerful business. And then there is another effect, which has an influence in this business, which is interest rate movement, because it lends at fixed interest rates basically. With the average relatively short-term as an average which gives us an exposure to movements in interest rates. Where interest rates go up, the margins tighten; when they go down, the margins widen.</p>
          <p>So, this in the Europe market has not really been in our advantage in the past few years, but it has had a positive effect on the American market. All of these things are the problems &#x2013; what are problems related to Santander Consumer Finance. But when it comes to strategy for Santander, given our position we have the right teams, we have the systems &#x2013; risk admission systems that are well tested, we have a critical mass; we have everything to make this business profitable. We have all the components for a profitable business, and therefore for us we do think it's a very good business, which doesn't mean that it's good for everyone, it's good for us.</p>

I was wondering given the fact that in euro terms it was much lower than we have seen in clearly <mark type="inaudible" /> this year against the euro. I was wondering if you &#x2013; do you assume already that you <mark type="inaudible" /> or in Consumer Finance bank or you are difference <mark type="inaudible" /> the beginning of the year? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Yes. It's about the hedge policy because of the difference in the growth in euros, pounds and dollars. And I also left out a question before which I am going to answer now. Our hedge policy continues to be stable, basically what we have our hedges, the book on the &#x2013; what we have in our book was in local currencies. Therefore we have a hedge that protects bank's capital and that's what we saw in the different portfolio valuations, and we saw the 700 million that somebody asked about that comes from that hedging of the book value and therefore other banks capital. And then we have a second hedge based on results. You have seen the results. We have a short-term position in pounds and dollars which tries to hedge for the profit expectations we have in the other countries. We're not changing that policy significantly and haven't done during the past few months.</p>
          <p>I don't think there are any further questions. Thank you so much to everyone.</p>
