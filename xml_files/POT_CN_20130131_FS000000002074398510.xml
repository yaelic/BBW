        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Denita, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us as we discuss Potash Corp's performance in the fourth quarter of 2012 and our expectations as we look ahead in 2013.</p>
          <p>As we review the year that closed, it can best be characterized as one with highs and lows. People speculated early in the year about the potential for a massive global crop and an oversupply of grains and oilseeds. Then drought hit the U.S. and poor growing conditions diminished crop yields in other regions. It was a shift that once again put a focus on the unpredictable nature of food production. This affected global fertilizer markets to varying degrees.</p>
          <p>For Potash and phosphate, robust fertilizer consumption in market oriented agricultural regions like Latin America and North America was matched by weaker demand in countries more influenced by government policy than economics. This dichotomy characterized our performance in the fourth quarter. The deferral of new Potash contracts with China and India resulted in fewer tons being shipped to those countries. This delay affected the psychology of buyers in other offshore markets with many waiting for greater visibility rather than re-engaging and securing new supply in the absence of immediate needs.</p>
          <p>While the strength of the North American response partially offset weaker offshore sales, our fourth quarter earnings of $0.48 per share and full-year earnings of $2.37 were below the comparative periods in 2011 and fell short of our own expectations. Our fourth quarter earnings also reflected the impact of a $41 million provision for settlement on U.S. antitrust claims announced yesterday. While we view these claims as completely without merit, engaging in a lengthy court battle could be even more costly and an unnecessary distraction as we enter an important time of opportunity. As much as we felt it was important to defend our reputation against the untrue allegations asserted in these cases, we made this unpleasant decision with the long-term interest of our customers and shareholders in mind.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenges of the fourth quarter and some ups and downs during the year, 2012 was important in terms of performance and preparation for the future. We generated $3.2 billion in cash flow from operating activities, the second highest total in our history and only slightly below the record level of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Nitrogen business earned nearly $1 billion in gross margin, a new record for our company. Even with lower gross margin contributions from Phosphate and Potash, our full year total of $3.4 billion was the third highest in our history. We continue to advance our Potash expansion projects which will play an important role in meeting the future needs of the world's farmers and hold significant potential for our financial performance.</p>
          <p>Our multiyear expansion program is now winding down, with more than 80% of the anticipated spending behind us. This has allowed us to further utilize our strong cash flow to enhance cash returns for our shareholders. We raised our dividend twice in 2012 and again at our Board meeting this week. We offer the highest yield among our North American fertilizer peers, the product of increasing our dividend more than 700% since the beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>Strides were also made in other areas that are key to our long-term success. We reduced the total recordable injury rate at our sites below our 2012 target, and we are continuing to strive for even great progress in this most important area. Customers, employees and leaders in our operating communities gave us higher marks in our annual independent surveys.</p>
          <p>These surveys act as benchmarks engaging the support of people who play an important role in our long-term success. We take pride in the fact that we are a place where people want to work, and that our company is viewed as one that helps improve the quality of life where we operate. These achievements give us a greater ability to seize the opportunities we see ahead.</p>
          <p>While market conditions for phosphate and Potash presented a challenge in 2012, we believe we are moving into an environment of growth. When crop prices surged in early July, many expected to see an immediate response in fertilizer markets. While supportive crop prices help to underpin demand, it's important to remember that our business is more closely tied to planting seasons than to swings in commodity prices.</p>
          <p>Crops aren't planted 365 days a year. So when farmers see the signs to increase production, it doesn't immediately turn into an order in our system. In many key markets, crops were already planted and fertilizer had already been applied when crop prices began to increase.</p>
          <p>Now as we enter 2013, there is a significant need to improve crop production and farmers in many regions are heading into their planting seasons with a chance to capitalize on the tremendous economic opportunity. Even as headwinds remain in India, where government policies have temporarily trumped underlying agronomic needs, we remain confident that the tide of change will come. While this market remains in limbo, we expect the relative strength of other markets to support global demand for all three nutrients.</p>
          <p>In Potash, we anticipate a significant rebound in global demand in 2013. Destocking occurred in many key markets last year, which matched underlying consumption. As we have often said, you can't empty the cover twice and there is now a need for buyers to engage early to meet expected strength in farmer demand. As a result, we see global demand for 2013 between 55 million and 57 million tons, well above the approximate 51 million tons that was shipped in 2012.</p>
          <p>In North America, dry conditions persist in certain areas, but many of our customers say farmers are talking about the economic potential of their land and the need to address declining fertility levels in their soils rather than worrying solely about Mother Nature. We anticipate Potash shipments to this market will be strong throughout the year, fueled by the need to rebuild depleted dealer inventories in preparation for increased fertilizer needs at the farm level.</p>
          <p>It is much the same in Latin America where our people just came back from meetings with fertilizer buyers and growers. Even as farmers in that market are preparing to harvest crops planted late in 2012, we are seeing our customers accelerate buying activity in preparation for the next planting season. We expect Latin American demand will surpass that of 2012 and we will be ready to meet the needs of this region.</p>
          <p>The market many people are talking about right now is China. After delaying new seaboard shipments in the second half of 2012, buyers there have secured significant tonnage for the first half delivery, including the highest six-month volume commitment from Canpotex in recent history. This is a promising sign. For many, the question now becomes China's second half plan, and the answer ultimately lies in its consumption pattern. We know China's needs stretch beyond this spring season, and if that country follows through on its stated goal of improving food security, we see its potash needs rising in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>The reemergence of China late in 2012 was a catalyst for demand in Asian countries outside of China and India and many buyers booked significant tonnage after new contracts were announced. We believe strong consumption in this region was overshadowed by a destocking of inventories during the past year, and that significant nutrient requirements in support of crop economics will drive increased demand. In contrast to the slow start witnessed during the first quarter of 2012, we expect to see a more robust environment to begin the year with potash requirements in this region rising from last year's level.</p>
          <p>India remains an enigma, a country that would truly benefit from balanced fertility, but is not fully engaged. While this region remains an important long-term customer, especially given its significant growth potential, we are not expecting it to be a major driver of global potash demand in 2013. Although we anticipate new contracts could be settled during the first quarter, the political challenges that effected demand during 2012 are unlikely to improve significantly this year. We believe shipments to India will increase from 2012's depressed levels due to limited inventories in that country, but anticipate there will continue to be a major gap between its actual consumption and the scientifically recommended application levels it requires to improve their lagging crop yields.</p>
          <p>Based on this global demand environment, we estimate our 2013 potash sales will be between 8.5 million and 9.2 million tons. Even with our expectation of higher sales volumes, our expanded operational capability has created important surge capacity in our system. This will improve our ability to meet the just-in-time needs of our customers as they ebb and flow through the year, but it also means we will likely need to pull back on the throttle in certain periods and take the necessary down time to balance our production to market demand.</p>
          <p>In phosphate, we expect the strength of our industrial and feed business will help offset potential weakness in fertilizer markets. While uncertainty in India has slowed global phosphate markets, the North American market for fertilizer products is expected to be relatively strong.</p>
          <p>In Nitrogen, our ammonia restart at Geismar is scheduled to come online in March. We believe relatively solid margins and the addition of these tons could help us achieve another record gross margin result in Nitrogen during 2013.</p>
          <p>Based on this outlook, we forecast first quarter net income per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.65 a share and earnings for the full year between $2.75 and $3.25, up sharply from 2012.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, we see tremendous potential for earnings growth. Like others in our industry, we benefited from a strong nitrogen market in 2012, and this nutrient, along with phosphate, will continue to play an important role in our success. But the big opportunity, the one that stood in the shadows of this past year continues to be potash. While we anticipate a robust agricultural environment will support demand for all three nutrients, we believe potash holds the greatest potential for growth.</p>
          <p>As the player with the greatest operational capability to meet new demand, we expect to participate significantly in this growth. We expect to begin to deliver on this potential in 2013 and we will continue to take the necessary steps to build our business for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>I'd like to thank you for your interest in Potash Corp. I'm joined today by our very capable Senior Management Team and we would be happy to answer your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Can you disentangle the dynamics of the change in FOB offshore potash prices from about $398 a ton in the third quarter to about $339 in the fourth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know what happened, in the fourth quarter we didn't have much business. And we had a very aggressive move by some of our competitors and for the little business that we did have, the prices declined Jeff. And so, that's what's behind it and I think that's what set us up for the negotiation in China, which was related to that decline during the fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Bill, could we talk a little bit about the pending U.S. crop in the &#x2013; how important is sort of the perception of that crop as we move through the year and get out of the spring season which I think we all agree should be quite robust. But I mean, are we expecting to be in another sort of bins are going to end the season empty scenario and volume as we move through and into the second half of the year could be &#x2013; move very slowly if there's concerns we're going to have large crop and corn prices are going to come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Vincent. I'll ask Stephen Dowdle to address that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Vincent, the &#x2013; excuse me, the outlook for spring is quite robust. The crop prices are very encouraging and fertilizer costs as a percentage of the crop prices or crop revenue are at historic lows. So the expectation is that we will plant again large acres and that there will be an incentive to maximize yields because of these crop economics. And I think the expectation we saw last year that we knew we were going to plant a big crop last year and of course, the psychology when we did plant that crop was that we were going to have a bin busting crop and it didn't turn out.</p>
          <p>And I think now, the psychology is that well we're going to plant a big crop and hopefully we'll get the moisture that we need to support good production and because certainly the markets need good supply coming out of North America for this crop. As far as the psychology of fertilizer is concerned, we do expect that people will continue their risk aversion and they will not want to carry over a lot of fertilizer, but this is now becoming the norm and we're certainly, we expect that and we will be able to accommodate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent, I would just add as Steven said, it's a just-in-time market now in the U.S. But our system has been custom designed to deliver. We're just finishing up the second build of 1000 additional rail cars. We'll have 2,000 new cars in our system over the last three years and we have a new large distribution center in Hammond, Indiana, which is ideal for unit train systems, much similar to what we do in the Canpotex area in terms of hook and haul type operations. Very, very efficient, quick movement. And overall, we see the market being quite a bit stronger in the U.S. going from 7.9 million tons to potentially as high as 9.5 million tons. So we think the U.S. is going to be a real strong spot of us in 2013.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Bill, just a couple of questions on returning cash to shareholders. I guess following the Board action yesterday, your annual dividend is $1.12 and if I look at the midpoint of your EPS range for 2013, about a 37% payout ratio. Is that about the right payout ratio investors should think about going forward or do you anticipate changes to that over time, and what are your current thoughts on potential for share repurchases or other means to return cash to holders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Kevin. We have not stated an exact payout ratio. What we have said is that we will return more cash to our shareholders than any other player in our industry over the next five years to ten years. And we certainly intend to keep up that promise. When it comes to share repurchases, we weigh the use of our free cash flow between dividend increases which we just obviously had, and share repurchase and M&amp;A activity. We really look for what's the best return &#x2013; long-term return that we can give our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit about what your expectation is for prospective changes to the Indian subsidy relative to last year that's embedded in your guidance range? And then also just how you think this is going evolve over the next few years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Chris, we'll let Stephen Dowdle answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, the Indian subsidy program is very, very complex as you know. But there are discussions going on right now in India as they prepare for their new fiscal year, which begins on April 1. And there have been discussions with regards to the subsidy particularly for potash and the discussions are centered around a reduction in the potash subsidy and a reduction in the MRP, the maximum retail price, in anticipation that when India does settle new contracts is that these new contracts will be at lower price levels than the previous Indian contract. So, I think this is a positive sign that these discussions are going on. It's positive as the recommendation will go forward to the Indian Parliament and it will be settled here sometime in the first quarter, which is one reason why we do remain optimistic that there will be a new potash settlement at some point during the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, when you think about India &#x2013; we've spent a lot of time talking about over the last few years, but when you look at the situation facing that country, India has 25% of all of the undernourished people in the world. It has one third of all of the undernourished children in the world. Their own Prime Minister, Singh, has said it is a matter of national disgrace. So when you look at the subsidy policy of the government, it really literally is penny wise and pound foolish, when you think about all the children in need of nourishment in that country. So they really need to address their food production issue. This is a very serious issue.</p>
          <p>And I can tell you an encouraging thing from our point of view is the private sector gets it. They understand this and they are pushing the government for change and it's just a matter of time. It is not whether India has figured out some way to grow crops without potassium, that is not the case. And the food needs are dire and need to be addressed soon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. I just wanted to dive in a little bit more detail on South America and specifically Brazil and your thoughts in terms of how the year is going to play out and your thoughts of the upcoming safrinha season and how Brazil is going to sort of manage their logistics. Because I know that this year &#x2013; this past year there was a lot of issues with poor backup. So if you could talk a little bit more about kind of the timing of shipments throughout the year in that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Michael. I'll ask Stephen to comment on that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we just had the Latin American fertilizer conference, which was hosted in Brazil here and the mood in Brazil is quite positive. Brazil is a agricultural economy that responds to the economics. And, with the soybean economics and the corn economics being very favorable, the Brazilians are very optimistic about this year.</p>
          <p>Last year, they imported just under 7.4 million tons, which was right near their record imports and the expectation in for 2013 is that the expectation right now is that we will see a record year for fertilizer in general and potash in particular. The crop is progressing well. They're expecting to harvest over 80 million tons of soybeans in Brazil for the first time. And the expectation is strong for safrinha corn and for fertilizer demand for that crop. We did see towards the end of 2012, we did see that Brazil drew down their inventories and because of that and after the contract settlements that occurred in Asia, we have seen stronger demand in the first quarter here than we did a year ago. So, we're starting the year I think with some momentum in Brazil, which we did not have last year and I think that supports the thesis that we will see a record year for potash imports.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, you asked about logistics. I think that's a really good question, because the question: is when you don't invest anything in your port systems, which Brazil hasn't to any appreciable effect, how do you get the 80 million tons, if that ends up being the number of soybean, how do you get them shipped? And that's a real question in the marketplace and I think a lot of people have &#x2013; there is uncertainty whether Brazil will be able to pull that off.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I would say when you're focusing on Latin America is, you got to look at Argentinean production. They've had some issues there as well, some weather issues that have caused a little uncertainty. If you remember last year, when everybody was saying we're going to have this huge global bin buster crop, Argentina and Brazil got off to a slow start, and then the disease passed on to the U.S. with the drought. And personally, I think that the market underestimates the difficulty, which the world has in meeting global grain supply &#x2013; global food supply. It is not a given, it is not as easy as people think it is. There are many challenges to growing crops around the world and if you don't fertilize, there's even more challenges. And so, I expect to see continued volatility in prices, but the trend is higher, not lower and we should not expect to see production exceeding consumption on a consistent basis because of these challenges that we face around the world.</p>

          <p>Thanks. This is Dean Groff stepping in for Ben. When we do the math on your 2010 MOU with China, we see about 400,000 tons to 700,000 tons remaining and the range really is depend on if they take up the additional tonnage or not, but based on how we've seen the Chinese border Spot market evolving, do you think it's possible they won't commit to the remainder in the back half of 2013? And if they don't, does Canpotex have any sort of recourse or and how should we expect 2H 2013 to evolve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well thanks Dean. We do expect China to perform in the second half and I would tell you that part of the agreement for them to maintain their exclusivity is they have to perform in the second half. So they will earn their exclusivity in advance now. In past, they earned it after. We gave it to them upfront and they didn't earn it in many cases. Now they have to earn it, and they have to earn it in advance of the second half of the year. And it's very clear when we had those discussions as to whether or not we would as Canpotex maintain that exclusivity.</p>
          <p>So I give Sinofert a lot of credit. They realized that the value of the exclusivity with Canpotex and they moved quick when they needed to at the end of last year. I think it surprised some of you in the &#x2013; on the sell side that this was &#x2013; this contract was concluded. But they know they have to perform and that same performance standard is there for the second half of the year. So we expect a very good market in China in 2013.</p>

          <p>Thank you, P.J. We've been disappointed, frankly, in our supply of gas the last 2.5 years, but understand BP has been going through these turnarounds and maintenance work on the platform. So we're being told that that should wind down here in 2013 and the gas plant interruptions may only impact us by up to 100,000 tons of ammonia in 2013. We've been negotiating with the NGC since middle of 2011. We've been explaining over and over again about the shale gas situation in the U.S. and how their contracts need to reflect what's going on in North America. We've taken that debate up to the Prime Minister. So we continue that dialogue. We have made some progress; we're not where we want to be yet and we're hoping to conclude those negotiations hopefully here in the first half of 2013.</p>

          <p>Sure. P.J., regarding our U.S. expansions, we just expanded our Augusta plant last fall by 64,000 tons per year. We'll be restarting Geismar, as Mr. Doyle mentioned, in March, if not a little sooner, and that'll bring on another 0.5 million tons per year. And we'll continue to evaluate all of our U.S. operations for further expansions. We think that that Brownfield expansion tons are a much better play for us than Greenfield investments.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, I had a question on your outlook for pricing. I know about &#x2013; last year you thought that offshore prices might move up to domestic levels. Obviously in a weak market, we've seen them both move down. Is it your sense that there isn't much pricing power out there or is the key to this shipment recovery keeping prices relatively low? So just wonder what kind of price assumptions are behind your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Don, as you know, you got to get some wind back in your sails to get prices on the moving up, and of course, the wind for us is volume. We focus so much on prices, as you know from our history, but you've got to have some volume coming back into the market. And I am encouraged with what I see here in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>If you just think about exports, exports are so important to us. Canpotex had, obviously, without any China and without any India and many of the major markets holding back waiting for clarity on China, we had a very skinny quarter in the fourth quarter. And I look at the forecast that we have for the first quarter, it's more than double what we had for the fourth quarter in Canpotex. So that's a very encouraging sign. And as we said in our remarks, we have people reengaging now. So the export side of the equation is looking much better.</p>
          <p>And then on the domestic side, January has been pretty good here as we finish up today and we're seeing some momentum build there. So I like what I see in terms of the fundamentals that you have to turn the pricing northward and the volume coming back in the system is greatly encouraging.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Good morning. Bill, your &#x2013; arguably your multiyear capacity plan and growth plan here has arguably served you very well in the past. But in the context of some market concerns around oversupply out there, have you ever contemplated scaling back or perhaps deferring some of the residual capacity growth you still have left?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Steve, well, I think that if you look at the concerns about oversupply, and then you start looking at where is it, I think it greatly overestimated the oversupply. And I'm talking about the next five years. A lot of people gave people credit for all sorts of things and new projects were coming at us left and right. Well, I think you've seen here recently some difficulties in Argentina. We know there continue to be difficulties in the project in Russia. We know that there are huge costs coming at some of the people in Canada. We've got, as I said, over 80% of our CapEx behind us. And gosh, I like being in our position rather than being in their position.</p>
          <p>And so you're going to see further delays in any of these new brownfield expansions and much more delay in any greenfield expansion. I think the market is going to be surprised to learn that this tremendous overcapacity that everybody talks about won't be there.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Bill, a question on your inventories. If I'm doing my math right, it looks like you exited the fourth quarter with a shade under 1.5 million tons of potash in inventory. Your guidance implies, at the high-end, production, a 74% operating rate. Just wanted you to reflect on that, how much flexibility do you actually have on your company on inventories from here, and beyond that, the ability just to really see kind of real positive pricing momentum in an environment where the operating rate at the high end is only in the mid 70%s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Adam. What I'd say to you is that we never like to have too much inventory. First of all, it ties up working capital. Secondly, your product quality, if you build up way too much inventory, you really have to watch the quality of the product that you ship. So we're very careful with that. And just we don't like to have it, because we don't like the tail to wag the dog. So we like to be able to match supply to demand, make sure that we're not producing too much that we've put any pressure on ourselves.</p>
          <p>We went out the year with about 1.4 million tons of inventory, and if you look at what would be normal, we'd be just a little over 1 million tons. So maybe a little bit higher than we normally would be and that's just because the fourth quarter was a stinker. I mean, we just didn't have much business. So a little bit of an anomaly as a finish up on inventories.</p>
          <p>But I will tell you, we've got a hell of a lot of flexibility in our system. I mean, we've got the largest warehouse in the world at Rocanville, 500,000 metric tons. If you go there, you could put three football fields with a bunch of people inside the place. You can't imagine how huge it is, that give us a little flexibility. And then you look at what we've got in our domestic system and all the other mine sites where we've got warehouses, plus what we've got at the port. We're never going to challenge our carrying capacity for inventory. We'll always have a lot more flexibility in the system than we'll actually have inventory.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just maybe you could comment a bit on the impact of the low water levels in the Mississippi. We take a look at your transportation costs, I think specifically on the phosphate side, they seemed a little bit higher. What are your thoughts as far as the spring season, how that plays out? Is there going to be any impact on pricing this quarter as you see it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Mississippi has had challenges due to the low water levels, although they have improved here recently. As you know, the Army Corps has been blasting rocks to keep traffic moving. And when the situation was at its most serious, the barge companies were forced to light load barges, which increased the transportation cost. But that situation has been alleviated. The barge companies right now are not light loading the barges. However, traffic is still impeded to a certain extent. I think as far as actual distribution concerns, it really, we'll see how the spring progresses and how the situation may change. Naturally, the imported product that's moving up the river would be the most impacted and that could have some concerns at spring, particularly for folks that wait and delay too long to position product. But as far as Potash Corp is concerned, our exposure on the river is very minimal and we don't see any impact to our business.</p>

We give people a lot of credit for a lot of things. That's a conservative view. When I say conservative, I mean we give probably more credit than what we'll actually see happen, but that's where we are at 2017. And that's up from 62 million tons in 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, first of all, most of the CapEx that we're spending now on the expansions is basically Picadilly and Rocanville, the Cory and Allan are basically done. If you want exact numbers, I think Dave might have those, but that's where those numbers are at.</p>
          <p>We did push the numbers up slightly in terms of the 2014, 2015 outlook on the CapEx. We do have some environmental issues that we're going to have to deal with in terms of tailings pond at our potash mines and it really has more to do with right sizing those numbers. So, frankly, we gave ourselves a little bit of cushion in that chart, but we have not made any decisions yet in the capital budgets for those years and what those actual numbers are going to be.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding the expansions, we have about $800 million left at Rocanville and $500 million left at Picadilly and around $40 million at Allan. We'll spend about $800 million in 2013, around $500 million in 2014. Regarding sustaining, we spend about $200 million a year between NNP and $300 million per year in potash.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reason for that is it's a little higher than what people have been used to historically, but if you think about the size of our potash enterprise, it is much bigger than it used to be. And so, obviously when you've got more equipment and more conveyers and all the things that you have there, you're going to spend a little bit more. And to give you sort of a rule of thumb on maintenance cap, if you look at our total asset base, we're running about 5% a year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Bill, I don't think you mentioned them by name, but you alluded to Malaysia and Indonesia, and given that biofuels in Asia aren't quite booming the way grain is, do you think there might be a more significant variability in demand from that region than we're used to seeing lately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Mark. Stephen Dowdle is my expert in oil palm and so he is best positioned to answer the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Mark, as you know, what drives Indonesia and Malaysia is oil palm, a very potassium-demanding crop and it's really not biofuels. That has helped add another dimension of demand for palm oil, but it's really the vegetable oil usage that is driving that demand. And that is closely tied to the economic growth and particularly in Asia, and particularly in China; China is the world's largest importer of palm oil. So, as we saw in the last couple of years, a little slowdown in China and we saw that reflected in some demand decline for Chinese imports.</p>
          <p>We have seen the decline in CPL pieces. However, I should say that they are still at very, very good levels. It's very profitable for the plantations and they really suffer if they cut back on potash. So, the tie between CPL prices and potash demand at this level is really not terribly significant. So, we do see demand in 2013 in Malaysia and Indonesia as being higher than it was in 2012. We saw some demand deferral in the fourth quarter of 2012 and we're off to a good start in both those countries and we think that we're going to have a very, very good year in 2013 in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>

When we look at your global forecast of 55 million tons to 57 million tons in relation to your regional forecast, should we assume that the regional forecasts are mutually dependent on a successful Indian contracting resolved in Q1, or are you confident in this forecast even if a contract potentially is pushed into the second quarter?</p>

We'd love India to be a little bit bigger piece quite frankly, but we just deal with reality there and we do think they've got a crying need, literally crying, in some instances and that we think they'll address that because it's just prudent to do so.</p>

          <p>There's no difference in someone putting a gun in your back and taking your watch and your purse or your wallet. So, but we made the decision as I said for &#x2013; because we thought it was in the best interest of the company even though we would have loved to take those people on. It has nothing to do with Canpotex, and this is U.S. domestic antitrust issue and Canpotex is not involved at all. But I would say we're &#x2013; it's in the rear-view mirror now.

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Bill, wasn't that long ago that you were talking about China migrating towards the spot market and of course they've since come back with some fairly significant contract signings. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your views with respect to China in the future and moving towards the spot market and perhaps price equalization with domestic and offshore?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all based on performance and it's performance in advance. And so, I'd tell you that Sinofert knows that. It's very clear, the difference between what you saw here at the beginning of 2013 and where we were. And if there is &#x2013; if the performance isn't in advance identified, then they know they'll lose exclusivity and we are prepared to go spot. So, they also know that. And I give them credit for understanding that new approach that we've taken. And so, I don't know exactly whether we're going to contract or spot there, but if they don't perform we're going to be spot. And everyone is clear on that. So, that's just where we are. It's a new era in China.</p>

          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Bill you talked a little bit about India in terms of their P&amp;K requirements versus where current demand. Can you remind us of what their P&amp;K demand should be if they were truly doing balanced nutrition for their crops?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. They are almost 9 to 1 right now N-to-K, they should be 3--to-1. So if they got 6.5 million tons, 6.4 million tons, 6.5 million tons of potash imports and they were getting that N-to-K ratio just a little under 5. And so they need to be up in the 10 million ton, 11 million ton range and they're not anywhere near that. And so when you see the potassium deficits in India &#x2013; and this is where the private sector, they're just so upset because they know what's happening and even the value of what they are producing the wheat and the rice not having the nutrient value that it should have because where do those crops get their nutrients from? They get it from the soil and if potassium is seriously lacking in the soil, the crop is just not going to get it, is not going to be as nutritious and that's part of the problem. They've got people that are undernourished. And so they really, this is an urgency in India and their private sector, their own agronomists would tell you it's a matter of national emergency. So that's why I say that they should move on the K-front. Stephen you want to comment on the phosphate side?</p>

          <p>They have a similar situation on phosphate as well. It's not quite as dire as in potash. India does have their own domestic phosphate industry, which they want to support, but there is under application of phosphate as well and over time, we would expect their consumption in phosphate to grow, assuming that they're going to address this imbalance.</p>

          <p>When Stephen says they have their own phosphate industry, of course, it is not indigenous, it's not based on phosphate rock. They don't have that, but they do import acid, they're number one in the world in acid, and they do produce DAP. So that's what when we refer to their phosphate industry, it's more in the downstream.</p>

          <p>Hi Bill. I think if I recall correctly, the nutrient based subsidy program as you mentioned was supposed to &#x2013; I think the original intent was to maybe drive the nutrient balance from six to one, down to three to one, but we've moved completely in a different direction and I think everybody would agree and intelligent analysis would indicate that's been a complete failure on that front. So, I'm just wondering it seems like a Gordian knot at sometimes, but what do you think it's going to cut it. Is it going to be like food inflation, crop failure or it's just simply a matter of passage of time, working it way the through the Indian bureaucratic system in terms resolving this situation.</p>

          <p>Hi Fai. It's great to hear your voice again Fai. So, I'm going to pass on your question to Stephen.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a very good question as to what's going to untie the Gordian knot. Politics are thick and a lot of the different parties with entrenched interests sometimes conflicting, but I would say that you know on a positive note that we do see genuine alarm and concern in certain sectors and particularly you know within the industry and particularly within the private sector of the industry that they know that this is not sustainable what's happening in India today. They see the damage that's being done to the soil fertility. They see that they need to correct this. They're in a bit of a pickle themselves, because they're trying to fight through their own political system and there's no clear answer. But I'm encouraged the fact that this alarm is being raised on many different levels throughout the country. And I do believe it's just a matter of time before we see a reversal of what's been going on here for the past two years.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fai, the private sector, a lot of people don't understand this, but their biggest receivables, outstanding receivables are from the government on the subsidy. And so, when you look back from their financial condition, I mean, the government's got them a little bit under the gun as well, because there are six month minimum delays on payments. And those are the biggest receivables these companies have, so they can't scream publicly, but they do privately. And so, we do expect the change coming.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys. Just a quick question. Where is the capacity of Potash Corp. in term of potash going to be yearend and then given that, you've given us guidance for the year's total sales. Assuming it's at the high end, where does that operating rate for the company at yearend, I mean how much room do you have upside from that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to have our guys tag team that answer, Charlie, I'm going to ask Michael, who is head of our potash operations to address the capacity that we'll have in 2013. Mike?</p>

          <p>Hi Charlie. At the end of 2013, we're going to have operational capability of 12.4 million tons and that increase is coming from our Allan and our Cory locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. Thanks, Mike. And Stephen. Second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As far as our sales are concerned, we've given the guidance and we feel that we are in a growth and a recovery year and as we enter the year in January and we're here at the end of January, we're confident that we are going to see the growth, we put a range of 55 million tons to 57 million tons, we see our domestic market recovering as we've mentioned. So, we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given you and we think that we're definitely seeing a recovery in potash consumption in 2013.</p>
