          <p>Hello and welcome to the Vodafone Year-End Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andy Halford, CFO of Vodafone Group. Go ahead please.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good morning, and thank you for joining.</p>
          <p>We announced our full year results earlier today in the U.K. and just wanted to give a quick overview. So just the key headlines in terms of our guidance for the year on both profit and cash flow; we exceeded the guidance range on both. Secondly, our revenue trends have continued to improve quarter-by-quarter assisted by the strong performance in data. Our free cash flow has enabled us to increase our medium term cash flow guidance and we have increased not only our dividend for last year by 7% but have targeted a further 7% per annum increase in dividends for each of the next three financial years.</p>
          <p>So just going into a little bit more detailed then on the numbers themselves, the group revenues for the full-year were &#xA3;44.5 billion; that was a headline increase of 8.4%. If one takes out the foreign exchange and M&amp;A aspect of that, there was a decline of about 2.3%. On organic service revenues, the equivalent underlying decline was about 0.6% which was a second successive quarterly improvement.</p>
          <p>Very briefly on the individual regions, the European region for the year as a whole had an organic revenue decline of 3.5% albeit it exited the year as a decline of 2.4% and the fixed revenues were 28.3 billion. So strong revenue growth, a big push on both data and on fixed broadband and 3.5% overall decline, In Africa and Central Europe, the revenues there declined 1.2% to &#xA3;7.4 billion but importantly in the fourth quarter the region got back into growth with revenues up 2.4% driven in part by Turkey, where the turnaround is now taking effect. The Turkish numbers in the fourth quarter were up 31% year-on-year and also helped by continuing strong growth in Vodacom, which was up about 5%.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific and Middle East, service revenue increase for the full-year there was about 10% to 6.1 billion, very much dominated by the performance in India where the business notwithstanding the difficult pricing environment has continued to perform extremely strongly. The customer base now stands at 100 million. We have added a significant number of customers since we bought the business and on average have gained about 1 percentage point of revenue market share. However, as a result of tougher competitive environment and the tougher pricing regime recently, we have taken an impairment charge of 2.3 billion which is partly offset by a 0.2 billion release relating to Turkey.</p>
          <p>Group EBITDA was &#xA3;14.7 billion, up 1.7% with a margin decline at 2 percentage points &#x2013; or about 2 percentage points very much in line with our expectation. The adjusted operating profit using our guidance basis was 11.9 billion, so just above 11 to &#x2013; 11.4 to 11.8 increased guidance of February. On a reported basis, which normalizes the effects back to actual rates that was 11.5 billion. Tax rate was similar on an underlying basis to the previous year albeit during the course of the year we did settle one of our long outstanding tax disputes in Germany and we got agreement to a &#x20AC;15 billion loss. That has had the effect of us recognizing a &#xA3;2.1 billion exceptional credit which relates to the elimination of the provision that we were carrying and setting up a deferred tax asset. More importantly in cash terms what that does, is means that the &#xA3;200 million per annum of cash tax benefit that we have been enjoying for the last four or five years, we should continue to get the benefit of that for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings per share was 16.11 pence, which after adjusting for a prior year tax credit, that is an increase underlying of 6.6% and our free cash flow was &#xA3;7.2 billion, the second highest in our history, up 26.5% on the previous year. In part, that number assisted by a focus on working capital, which contributed within year about &#xA3;0.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning then to our strategic priorities, we talked a while ago about operational excellence. We have continued to broaden the range of our value enhancement products. We have broadened our device portfolio during the period. In India, we have increased the revenue market share as I mentioned and our turnaround strategy is now evident in Turkey. We committed to taking &#xA3;1 billion out of the cost base back in 2008 and we have just closed that with that having being delivered one year ahead of schedule and we are now embarking upon taking the next &#xA3;1 billion out of our cost base as we announced in November 2009, which will happen over the current financial year and next financial year.</p>
          <p>Our second area of focus was on growth and the key data here on data revenues, we've exceeded &#xA3;4 billion of Group-wide data revenues for the first time, which was an increase of 19.3% year-on-year and we now have across the Group, 50 million active data users. Fixed line where we've also been focused, the revenues there grew by 7.9% to &#xA3;3.3 billion and our customer base has increased to 5.6 million.</p>
          <p>Our third area of focus was in the emerging markets where as I said in India, we have performed well and thus secured the number two position in that market and continued to see revenue growth despite the recent price competition. Vodacom also as I mentioned earlier continues to grow well. Turkey grew its revenues 31% and we have we think made some good progress in those areas.</p>
          <p>Turning then on to the dividends and the free cash flow, we have announced the final dividend of 5.65 pence per share which is an increase of 9%, making the total full year dividend 8.31 pence per share, which is an increase of 7% reflecting the strong underlying business performance and cash generation. We now expect our cash flow for the next three years to be between six and &#xA3;7 billion. Two years ago, we had a range of 5 to 6. We later updated that primarily for foreign exchange to 5.5 to 6.5 and given the prospects for the business and in particular over a period of time, some of the businesses that we are currently investing cash in like Turkey, which should become cash positive, we are now confident that we can hit the six to 7 billion range. As a consequence of that we have targeted to increase the annual dividend per share by no less than 7% for each of the next three financial years.</p>
          <p>Specifically in terms of the 2010-11 financial year, we have announced that we expect our adjusted operating profit to be in the range of 11.2 to &#xA3;12.0 billion with a return to organic service revenue growth expected during the 2011 financial year, will be at probably in the second half of the year. We have said that we expect our rate of margin decline to significantly reduce during the '10 '11 year again particularly in the second half. We've said that we expect our capital expenditure to be similar to 2010 levels adjusted for foreign exchange. And finally that we are targeting free cash flow in 2010-11 in excess of &#xA3;6.5 billion consistent with our three-year target.</p>
          <p>So overall, revenue trends gently moving in the right direction, cash performance very strong, cost performance very strong and a dividend commitment and a three-year cash flow guidance increased on where we were previously.</p>
          <p>With that operator, I will happily take any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have a question from Brad Desellam, go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much for taking my call. Can you give us a feel for the impact you're seeing on the business from the sovereign debt issues that are so prevalent throughout Europe and we're all hearing so much about. Specifically what are you expecting on local economic impact and is there anything from a currency exchange standpoint that we should be looking for and then how are you trying to manage that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Brad, a good and interesting question. I think it is quite difficult to sort of hook together the very high level sort of sovereign debt type issues with the on-the-ground experience that we're seeing in our retail stores. I guess it is fair to say that in the last year the Greek market has been a tough one for us and we have seen a higher rate of revenue decline there than in many of our markets and probably the other market that has been tricky in that regard is Romania. But overall, I think that it is more an issue of not the sovereign debt but the sort of spends that the people have got, the amount of money they have got available and through this last year we have increased the bundles, we have packed more into them in order to make sure that the impact upon our revenue streams is minimized. So my sense going towards obviously some of the austerity packages that have been put in place, will be interesting to see how they flow through, is that we need to keep on focusing on the value for money that we are able to offer our customers and we will continue to do what we have done in the last year and hopefully we will pull through and as we say get back into positive revenue growth territory.</p>
          <p>In terms of foreign exchange I suppose we have got operations in many countries with many different exchange rates. The most significant exchange rate issue for us is really the relationship between the euro and sterling because 80% or so of our cash flows do come from euro counties and obviously particularly with respect to our dividend we have got a sterling dividend commitment and hence why on our three year dividend target we have said that is assuming that that exchange rate stays within plus or minus 10% of our guidance rate of &#x20AC;1.15 to the pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any balance sheet impact that you're managing to from foreign currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we do and I think it is &#x2013; it is the best that we can do is that we make sure that those things we can control and in particular I'm thinking of the denomination of our debt that we have got the debt denominated in the currencies in which we have got our operating cash flows and hence the debt profile at the moment is very, very aligned with the earning streams that we have got.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you do any hedging activity at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next we have a question from David Geldon, Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I think that's me. It's David Geldon with Morgan Stanley. I appreciate it. Last quarter you made some comments, some interesting comments on data users and smartphone penetration. I think you said that smartphones had grown to 25% of handset sales in the December quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an update as to where that is? You had also make some comments on the number of data users, I think you said you had 30 million and that &#x2013; and some data usage of your base station at 7% of your base stations. I'm just reading through some of my notes from last quarter &#x2013; well over 90 <mark type="inaudible" /> peak times, if you can just kind of update us on some of those metrics and see how data usage is impacting you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure. So we had in that quarter as you say about 25% of our device sales were smartphones. In the most recent period that has probably been a little bit higher than that, just below about 30% and we've indicated that we would expect for this financial year, the one that we're now in that we will be sort of in the 35%, maybe a little bit higher range. So that is working up.</p>
          <p>In terms of proportion of the total base rather than the proportion of new customers, total &#x2013; proportion total base is about 11% to 12% who have got smartphones. So that obviously is a gating factor to being able to get the data revenues going up by near 20% and we are now actually in Europe have got more data revenues coming from our consumer customer base than from our business customer base.</p>
          <p>In terms of the impact of that on the network, that actually is in good shape. We had about 7%, as you say, of our cell locations a year ago were getting close to &#x2013; we've got a 90% threshold of their full capacity in their busiest hour. And that statistic one year later is still 7%.</p>
          <p>So the sort of capital spend that we've had last year, putting it another way, which has had a considerable focus upon addressing hot spots in the network &#x2013; we have within that capital envelope managed to keep the cells those are getting near to capacity, at exactly at the same level as a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. At 11 to 12% of your base with smartphones, you said 30 million active users last quarter. Is that the same number, or the 11 to 12% representing a higher number of them than 30 million right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a slightly higher number, because there are some other devices out there that people are using.</p>
          <p>We've got 50 million total active data users across the group. I think about 32 million of those are in Europe and roughly 30, 40% of them are regular, sort of contracted spenders, and the other 50, 60% are sort of ad hoc users.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is the &#x2013; what's the number we should use to compare to the 30 million last quarter? Should we use the 32?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean from a year ago, we've gone up from about 25 to 32.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, one last thing, if I could. You made a comment last quarter that people with mid-range feature phones were trading down to lower end phones. Are you still seeing that or has that changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we're sort of seeing depends a little bit on how we define the low end phones, but what we are seeing is a continuing move &#x2013; or what I'd call the middle tier phones, and probably the middle-tier moving upwards more so than the middle tier moving downwards at the moment.</p>
          <p>So the lower end of the range 45, 50%. The middle range if anything is moving up towards the smartphones.</p>
          <p>It gets a bit blurred because over time as the smartphones become a little bit less expensive, and as we've put some slightly less featured smartphones in, this classification is not a pure one. But directionally, I would say we are seeing a continuation of the reduction in the middle of the range, and hence slightly more weighting, particularly to the top-end and to some extent to the low-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's interesting, I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Okay, next we have a question from Andrew O'Neill, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi, Andy. With a view to India, could you give us a little bit of a sense for market conditions there, as they stand right now, particularly with a view to the impairment that you took? What were some factors that are sort of embedded in that impairment already? Is just the pricing and competitive environment or have you also reflected some of the recently proposed taxes on spectrum that you already have?</p>
          <p>And then finally on India, could you give us an update on just the mechanics around the production there? Is basically the price guaranteed, based on the original acquisition price? Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, Andrew. So the impairment &#x2013; I guess let me explain it this way.</p>
          <p>If we go back to our original business plan and compare it with how we now see the world, the rate of penetration increase has been as high in actuality as we had in the original business plan. The rate of revenue market share take that we had in the original business plan has proven out. The rate of customer growth has proven out. The capital spend has been probably 5% higher that the original plan.</p>
          <p>The thing that has fundamentally changed is the pricing in the market, which is at least a third lower, at this point in time, than we had envisaged when we bought the business. And that obviously is hugely impacted by the price war that happened back in the fall of the last year.</p>
          <p>So the key thing that really, really has changed has been on the top line, on the revenue line, and hence why we have taken the impairment. So in impairment terms, that's what happened.</p>
          <p>I would just add operationally, we are &#x2013; whilst the base is going through this re-pricing &#x2013; we've now got about 75% of our customers are on these per-minute and per-second price plans &#x2013; actually, we are performing well in the market. We have had sequential quarterly revenue growth. We've had year-on-year revenue growth. We are taking market share. So the issue is very much the difference in the pricing now versus in the original plan.</p>
          <p>On the put option, the put option is essentially in two parts. One says that if the Essar Group wants to, they can &#x2013; between about a week ago and a year from now &#x2013; they can put all of their 33% shares to us, and we will pay them $5 billion, irrespective of what their actual market value is.</p>
          <p>Or the other option, which is called a fair market value option, says that if the value essentially is higher than 5 billion, then they can put us a proportion of their stake, with that proportion essentially being their call, with an absolute cap of no more than $5 billion that we can be obliged to spend and fork out cash for.</p>
          <p>So as I say, we are in the very early part of that window at this point in time. We do not know genuinely what will happen on this, and it has now got just under a year to run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. So I guess the ball is in their court this year as to how they take that.</p>
          <p>On the market position of Vodafone in India, are you starting to see more signs that the market might shake out? Is there spectrum tradability that could help that? What's an update on that particular dimension?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, whilst we're still mid-3G auction &#x2013; and sorry, that's just triggered &#x2013; I didn't actually respond to one part of your question, which I will come back to &#x2013; I think it's just very difficult to know quite how the market will shake out, because it may in part depend upon who gets what spectrum -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; and obviously I cannot comment mid-auction as to where that is going.</p>
          <p>The situation is possibly a little bit more complicated because there was some pronouncements last week on the terms for some of the 2G license, which I think it is fair to say most of the players in the market were not happy with, and those are going to go through a period of some discussion.</p>
          <p>So it's the logic that there will be more players, and that some of those should want to sort of rationalize themselves out of the market. Yes, there is. Quite exactly how it plays out will depend upon how the 2G rules and the 3G auction actually eventually resolves itself.</p>
          <p>Just one point that I would like to make at this point. When we were looking at the size of the impairment charge, we obviously &#x2013; this is a slightly tricky one, because having to close our year-end books at the same time as we have an auction in progress is not the easiest of things to do. So we have taken sort of reasonable view as to where we think that the auction might end up for us.</p>
          <p>Obviously, I'm not disclosing that, but we have taken a reasonable view, and we hope that where the auction ends will be broadly consistent with our assumptions. We have not taken into account some of the 2G pronouncements, which we believe have got a considerable amount of discussion yet to be had on them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we have a question from Phil Cusick. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andy, thanks for taking the time. I think on the call this morning, you talked about the dongle business being about 85% of data. Did I get that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the data traffic volumes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and do you think that's the &#x2013; it seems like that's a pretty high amount of traffic being driven by a fairly low revenue business. Is that the effort you guys want to do going forward, or you want to switch over to handsets more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the simple answer is sort of yes. I guess that it is proportionately very high.</p>
          <p>What we need to do is differentiate between the customers who are high users but also high payers, and ones who may be unreasonably high users. And consequently, over a period of time, we have put in either different sort of price packages, or we ultimately have got the ability to impact the speed of service that customers get.</p>
          <p>So if we do find that we are getting people who are abusing the network, we have got more ways of controlling that and maybe discouraging that sort of activity. But to your broader point, for us, actually, it is more important that we have now take a bigger share of the smartphone market, where the revenue streams are good and the data usage is a mere fraction of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. I see. And so just sticking with the dongles for a second, do you think that business slows down from here and sort of stabilizes in terms of growth, or are you still trying to grow that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will try to grow it, but we will try to grow it within reasonable usage boundaries.</p>

          <p>Okay. And on the handset side, sort of moving towards smartphones, is that a question of, you've priced them more aggressively, you've broadened out the selection? How do you think about that? About customers there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean the simple answer is yes. There clearly are a number of manufacturers, and over time, an increasing variety of devices. It has always been our intent that we offer a broad range of devices, and that in the background, we are building the best possible network that we can do.</p>
          <p>So that the smartphones growth which we are very much driving at the moment will come both off good ranging of devices, but also on getting a good reputation for having a quality network.</p>
          <p>Bear in mind, quite a lot of the voice networks are very similar, and so quality-wise, not easy to distinguish these days. But on the data networks, where it does depend a lot more on how many users you've got, and how densely you've built the network, we are very focused on making sure that we have got at least as good, if not the best network that we can put in place within reasonable bounds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how do you think about operating systems? Does it sort of matter to you what people choose? Do you want to just have a wide selection of everything available? What are you working on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think broadly to have some breadth is important, because we are &#x2013; different customers have different desires and different likes and like, so it is very much a case of making sure that we can satisfy the different requirements of our customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then lastly, AT&amp;T talked recently about upgrading to HSPA plus. Can you remind me of what your &#x2013; European, anyway &#x2013; upgrade path looks like? What the timing of LTE &#x2013; or you're talking about latest &#x2013; and the path through HSPA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, HSPA we are pushing hard on. We're going to have a high proportion of our base on sort of 14, 14.4 pretty soon. So we think we've got at least a couple of years of HSPA growth ahead of us.</p>
          <p>LTE, I suspect, it is more of a mid-two to three years sort of type experience. And then it will be probably targeted at specific areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks lot, Andy.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Andrew O'Neill. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andy, just a clarification, if I can, on your free cash flow outlook for the next three years of 6 to &#xA3;7 billion per year. Does that assume that the current arrangement with Verizon Wireless &#x2013; that the sort of the tax-related dividend stream remains unchanged over that period? So it's sort of benchmarked in that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is assuming no change in the sort of contractual arrangement. So put another way, we'll get the tax related dividends, but we're not presupposing anything over and above that, in coming to those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, that was it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we have a question from Phil Cusick. Go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was actually going to ask the same question, but as long as you are sort of on Verizon Wireless, any update in thinking about Italy? It seems like that market is doing better. Does that become more or less attractive as a swap candidate, given that market picking up a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, I think that whatever happens in the long-term, with Italy, whatever happens in the U.S., I think they are probably intertwined, being realistic about it.</p>
          <p>Operational performance &#x2013; obviously our Italian business has done very well this last year and is taking market share, albeit I feel the economy there is getting a bit tougher now, so it's probably been a little bit late being hit by the recession. So we have seen the rate of revenue improvement decline quarterly over the last four quarters.</p>
          <p>But I think the heart of your question &#x2013; I don't see a change there, and I think the two will be intertwined anyway, if there were ever to be a change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And next we have a question from David Geldon, go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it is David Geldon again. Thank you for the follow up.</p>
          <p>How are you thinking, Andy, about content delivery networks in various parts of world? When you look, there are several models out there and Vodafone has some, Nokia clearly has Ovi, and that is successful in some parts of the world and less successful in other parts.</p>
          <p>There are some other places specifically in India, where I think yourselves and others are looking for the carrier to be the main provider of content delivery networks. And of course, there is Apple, that &#x2013; at least in the U.S. and certainly growing in Europe &#x2013; is being successful with a content delivery platform of their own, centered basically around the device, rather than around the network.</p>
          <p>How are you thinking about growth in content delivery networks and the revenue boost that you can get from them versus the revenue that you could potentially lose if some of these other systems from the device manufacturers, whether it's Nokia or Apple become too successful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, interesting question. So firstly which I know was not your question, there is no intent on us being a sort a manufacturer of content, producer of content, so this is about distribution of content.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And how one can enable that to happen. If I take something like the App Store, which I guess Apple have the sort of pioneered with the iPhone initially. We are working with the JAL partnership. Many of the European operators are getting together as well. And frankly, I think there will be apps stores that will be available from multiple sources over a period of time.</p>
          <p>The key is really to make sure that there is a sort of technical architecture that developers can work to and there are commercial arrangements that are attractive for them that I don't see that the concept of application stores is something which is unique and locked into any one provider. So over time I think that will become fairly ubiquitous.</p>
          <p>Access to things like maps and other applications, some players have gone out and spent a fair amount of money on buying capability in that space. We have said on that that frankly there are enough mapping capabilities out there that we can essentially use what's already available without having through invest in it ourselves.</p>
          <p>One of the things we have been doing ourselves though is a product which we call 360. It is a service which essentially is a very person-centric approach to the sort of main screen on the phone. So it pulls up all the contact points for an individual, it links across to maps and things of that like to make the devices more people-centric. And in part we are doing that because we are privy to a lot of information on the individual users. Some of the people you've referred to actually have other types of knowledge but they don't necessarily have that. So I think the &#x2013; not the simple answer but the answer to your question is, it depends which type of content, some of it we will be providing, others we'll be providing as well. Some of it we'll provide but it will be brought in service and some things like 360, we are pushing and pioneering on our own independently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the variable options that you have to generate revenue out of data and smartphone users, one is the data usage itself that you charge for but that becomes not necessarily a commodity but it becomes versus your other carrier competitors, it can be competed down and it is difficult to differentiate too much on the just pure data usage. The other way that you can generate revenue is clearly through the distribution through these content delivery networks. And is your strategy just to take a piece of that as time goes on because what we've seen mostly in many content networks on the wired side is that one or two winners whether it's iTunes for music downloads, in Europe Spotify and in another areas obviously Amazon for books and there are several winners but not a whole lot and there it seems like the brand names end up winning. And I am wondering it sounds like you are painting a picture of there are lots of different distribution networks and therefore everyone can take a piece of the pie. What we have seen so far in the wired Internet is there aren't lots of winners. There is usually one or two winners in each category and if you are not in that category it becomes difficult to make money out of that. And then so I am just wondering how else can you make and can you generate revenue from data users if not aggressively going after these types of networks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the key for us is having the highest quality of network performance for data applications that we can do because unlike voice, there is still a huge variety of performance experience from customers and irrespective what application they are using on it to have a service that works, the high speed works consistently et cetera is really, really important. So our primary focus is really on that and the secondary focus is I said earlier, on being present in different parts of the content value chain.</p>
          <p>It's not one of placing one big bet and then just hoping that we've hit the right bit of the content distribution, I think this is one where there is different aspects to content, we can play in each of those and it will vary market-by-market. What will take off in Europe on content will differ significantly over a period of time, from what will happen in for instance India and equally the mechanism for getting it to the customers will differ with 3G networks being well posed in some countries and much less developed or not even present in others. So I think you will see us approaching this on multiple fronts and hopefully over time we'll see which ones will win through.</p>
