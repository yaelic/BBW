        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We are going to start the presentation of the Result for the First Semester of 2010 and before handing the floor over to the Chairman, I would like to apologize on behalf of IBERDROLA for the delay in starting the event and for the sending out of the results for reasons outside our control. We had a control problem with the Securities Commission.</p>
          <p>And I'll now hand over to the Chairman of IBERDROLA, Jos&#xE9; Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I apologize for the delay and I want to thank you once again for you presence here, and also those of you who are connected by phone or through the web.</p>
          <p>As you know, a few months ago, IBERDROLA put its stakes on a project that could bring us all together and create the hope that we need in these difficult times. Today, we feel proud that our expectations have been more than fulfilled. We have the results outside of our stakes.</p>
          <p>The World Cup won by the Spanish team for the first time in history, led by my good friend del Bosque, who I think has done a magnificent job as usual, and I would like to make use of this forum to congratulate them. And we are going to continue to give them our support in the future.</p>
          <p>After this introduction, the structure of the meeting, as usual, we'll cover the main aspects for the results of the first semester and then the CFO will give more details on the results and the financial position of the group. And we will end with some brief conclusions and we will move on to the questions and answers.</p>
          <p>In these first six months of the year, the gross operating profits reached &#x20AC;3.836 billion with a growth of 11.7% and the recurrent net profit has increased by 7.3%, up to &#x20AC;1,324 million. Net profits were affected by the major or by the lower capital gains we've had this year, compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The solid performance of the group has been possible, thanks to two main factors. On the one hand, the investment carried out in recent years, which has made IBERDROLA a global Group provided with a diversified and balanced business portfolio by activities in geographic areas.</p>
          <p>As a result, IBERDROLA is capable of maintaining a sustainable growth based on one or another area depending on the circumstances. And secondly, the operating optimization carved out for each business in the Group. Thanks to this, during the first semester of 2010, the three main activities of the Group recorded a major growth in results, both regulated and liberalized and renewable activities.</p>
          <p>The production of the group has increased 14%, driven by the emission-free technologies and this shows, once again, our firm support for these emission-free technologies and we have invested &#x20AC;1.5 billion only in the last semester. As a result of that greater production and good performance of the regulated businesses, gross profits have increased by 8.9%.</p>
          <p>As you know, one of the fundamental pillars for the Group is a constant search for efficiency. Well, these measures have led to an improvement of 9% in this area. And I would like to specially highlight the operating, regulatory and financial optimization carried out in these six months in the regulated business in the U.S., the EBITDA, which has increased 40% up to June.</p>
          <p>Regarding regulation in Spain, I would like to clarify the remuneration framework for wind energy under conditions that will enable us to continue to develop our activity in our investment plans in a satisfactory manner as explained yesterday at the presentation of IBERDROLA RENOVABLES.</p>
          <p>Regarding the financial structure for the group, the June accounts show very clearly the commitment of IBERDROLA with a solid financial position. Leverage is 45.8%, with an improvement of almost three points since June 2009, while the main financial ratios have been strengthened significantly. Also, the success in the implementation of the so-called scrip dividend accepted by 64% of the shareholders. On the other hand, IBERDROLA closed a syndicated credit line amounting to &#x20AC;2 billion with a margin of only 75 basis points.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the total liquidity is increased to &#x20AC;9.4 billion, a sufficient amount to cover the needs of the group until mid-2012. Output for the group in the first six months of 2010 reached 80,000 gigawatt hours, a growth of 14.2% compared to the same period last year. And this has been possible thanks to the increase in the generation of 100% emission-free output, the contribution of which has increased 10 points to over 50% of the total.</p>
          <p>The combined gas cycle and thermal technology has also obtained more than 90% of the total production of the group and we have to consider that no technology provides more than 20% of the total, excluding combined cycles in Mexico.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight the increase of 21% of production in Spain. And to this, the increase in demand has made a strong contribution in our country, over 4% in the semester, as well as the increase in hydro and wind production. And the hydro reserves are at a historic level of 77% of the maximum capacity. This represents an increase of 51% over the figures for June last year.</p>
          <p>The growth in output together with good developments in the regulated businesses means that the gross margin for the Group has increased 8.9% up to &#x20AC;5,935 million. And I would like to underline that all the businesses have contributed to this growth. As we were also saying, the group has increased its efficiency by 9%. The increase in the gross margin has dropped 0.8% in the net operating cost, driven by the improvement in outside services, which dropped by more than 5%.</p>
          <p>And there has been a good performance of IBERDROLA U.S.A., where the operating expenses dropped more than 20%. We must also highlight developments in the energy business in Spain, whose expenses have increased slightly over 1% in homogenous terms.</p>
          <p>Regarding ScottishPower's, expenses are flat in pounds after discounting the non-recurrent income. The increase in activity together with greater efficiency has brought about a gross operating profit of close to 11.7%, and this once again shows the benefits of the diversified and low-risk business model that IBERDROLA has.</p>
          <p>We have to highlight the positive performance of IBERDROLA Renewables with a growth of 21% with regulated businesses which increased 13%, driven by good results in Spain, United States, Brazil and the U.K. And I would also like to highlight the good example set by the regulatory status, which started to be applied from April 1. And the stability and predictability of the legal and regulatory framework is without a doubt, one of the reasons why IBERDROLA has put its stakes in the U.K. since 2007. The new government has defended the need to have a sufficiently attractive regulatory framework to carry out large investments in energy infrastructures.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, liberalized activities developed in very different ways. In Spain, there has been an increase of 21% in output and a growth in variable low-cost technologies, while in the U.K., business margins have been reduced regarding 2009, which was exceptionally &#x2013; with figures in the case of U.K., similar to the ones we had in the year 2008. With all this, the global EBITDA for this area of activity has increased by 8% in the period.</p>
          <p>During the first semester of 2010, the IBERDROLA regulated business in the United States has experienced a significant transformation in all areas. Firstly, an agreement has been established in principle with the technical services of the regulator in New York. This agreement, subject to approval by the counsel on the State Public Service Commission, is expected for the month of September, and will improve the results and reduce the risks of the subsidiaries of IBERDROLA U.S. in New York, which, as you know, represents 60% of the total of the company. The new regulation will be in force until January 2004 (sic) [2014]. That is three years and four months.</p>
          <p>And with this, IBERDROLA U.S. aligns the regulatory stability period with its main subsidiaries in the U.S. since the tariff regimen for our subsidiary in Maine, closed in June 2008, will be in force for five years. As well as providing reasonable profitability over our own equity, the agreement in New York represents a very positive framework to carry out operating and service improvements in the companies and the new tariffs include the number of economic incentives for efficiency improvements that will be shared reasonably between the companies and consumers.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the risk of the companies is reduced, whose remuneration will no longer be subject to developments in demand vis-&#xE0;-vis our forecast and will also be protected against exogenous factors such as extraordinary expenses because of storms or increases in taxes or pension costs. On the other hand, the company continues to work to implement operating improvement measures, which have enabled an improvement of 20% to be obtained in net operating expenses in euros.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the company has carried out two operations amounting to very similar amounts that have represented an improvement in the business portfolio for IBERDROLA USA, both from the strategic and economic profitability point of view. On the one hand, an agreement has been established for the divestment of regulated companies amounting to &#x20AC;1.3 billion with Connecticut Natural Gas and Southern Connecticut Gas and Berkshire Gas. And on the other hand, the approval of a public service commission in Maine for the construction of a transportation line that would connect U.S. and Canada and will represent investments of $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight that the profitability over equity, close to 13%, is very close to that of divested companies and fits in with our electrical know-how.</p>
          <p>With all this, it can be said that the first few months of 2010 have completed the transformation process for our regulated activities in the United States. Now it's time to complete the execution of the investments and the operating improvements, which, on the other hand, have already brought about a 40% improvement in EBITDA in the first semester.</p>
          <p>Regarding the regulatory situation in Spain, I would like to dedicate a few moments to make a realistic diagnosis of the current problems and the causes of the same. In this sense and contrary to what is often thought, the cause of the electricity price increases in Spain in recent years have not been due to the so-called traditional generation. In fact, if we look at the price of the pool, we will see that since January 2008 until December 2009, it has experienced a major drop of more than 50%.</p>
          <p>And as you can see in this chart, that is based on information from the Ministry of Industry between '97 and 2009, traditional generation costs included in the tariffs have been reduced by 25%, whereas other costs have been increased very significantly, in particular, the premiums for renewables, which have grown 120%.</p>
          <p>However, I think that's fundamental to stress the differences between some renewable technologies and others, because their energy contribution and their economic impact vary considerably and they cannot be compared.</p>
          <p>So, taking data from 2009 wind technology has a practically total balance in an energy that provides 14% and its contribution to costs is 16%. Solar technologies only provided 2% of the energy, but they accounted for 16% of the system's costs.</p>
          <p>But if they were to revise the energy planning process and its execution, we can see that although the differences are not very significant in terms of wind or gas technologies, the installation of solar power has been seven times higher than what we had planned, which means that we'll have more than 6,500 megawatts installed by the end of 2011. And this means that premiums will grow by more than &#x20AC;3.6 billion a year, that's where we have the deficit.</p>
          <p>So, solar technology has a long way to go along the learning curve and nowadays, represents a cost for the system in excess of &#x20AC;400 per megawatt hour, which means that generation &#x2013; that we have generated many tariff deficits. So in order to solve this problem between the costs and the tariffs, constant changes have been carried out in recent years, so that is regulatory changes. That in the last 20 years have been based on more than 20 modifications in the laws, 100 <mark type="inaudible" /> decrees and ministerial orders and 200 resolutions and the final targets have not been achieved.</p>
          <p>So, once again in the month of July, the government published a document of the elements on an agreement for the energy policy with a total of 25 proposals under six major headings to try to do something about this problem.</p>
          <p>But if we were to stick to the contents of this document and beyond the rumors and speculations, we can see that it includes the main elements that are required to overcome the current problems. Firstly, the establishment of an energy mix for 2020 that allows us to fulfill commitments in terms of environmental issues of the EU. So it's not going to be necessary to have a coherent plan, but also to monitor its execution efficiently. I'm much more concerned about this, so that we can avoid the deviations we had in the past, as we've seen in recent years.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the document underscores how important it is to improve the current grid infrastructures and that new investments have to be made in terms of interconnections and Smart Grids. And once again, we have to achieve a full deregulation of the market, according to the Spanish and European regulations, and it is recognized that to implement this, it will be necessary to solve the problem of the deficit, according to the law, not any later than 2013, and it has been said that what we have to do is pay the amounts that have to do through their securitization.</p>
          <p>And another issue has to do with the regulated costs and the document, in principle, wants to adapt the remuneration mechanisms of renewables to the evolution that has been experimented by their technology. So this principle can be seen in the modifications that have been approved for the case of wind power.</p>
          <p>And likewise, the rest of the regulated costs will also be revised and I think we have to mention the progress made in the updating of the remuneration and the distribution with the approval of the National Commission for Energy, and the reference network that provides the necessary support. And finally, the document recognizes that we have to hold a discussion on the future of nuclear power, a technology that will be necessary to guarantee supplies in Spain and proposes a number of measures to increase savings and efficiency.</p>
          <p>As regards the time schedule and according to what the different politicians have said, this agreement should be made specific before the end of the month of July. As regards the fears we have after freezing the July tariffs, I would like to say that the government is already preparing a new Royal Decree to revise prices every quarter instead of every semester or whenever it is necessary to do so.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the different elements of the government document say that what we have tabled is a reform that provides more legal stability and also supports its fundamental principles, and it couldn't be otherwise, because the electrical legislation is based on the number of European directives that are mandatory, and which obviously are focused on deregulation and market model. And any modifications made have to be coherent with the Spanish legislation. So you must rest assured that we will be as strict as we have always been in the past. And this &#x2013; well, we can see this in the recent appeal we filed before the High Court, because we understood that the tariff freeze of July does not fulfill the legal requirements and we hope it will be solved very soon, because we believe that it goes against this legislation.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, and this is something that has been happening whilst I've been in this sector, every now and again, news appears in relation to possible changes in the regulatory framework that would have a negative impact for the electrical utilities. Well, in the 10 years that I've been in this business, together with some months, I can say that after this news is released, we always attempt towards applying a rational approach and we also apply our common sense after this noise and after these many rumors and we have the reform of the renewables sector. But what they have done is respected the basic principle of non-retroactivity and we have a reasonable level of remuneration.</p>
          <p>But in any case, you can be sure that as we've always done at IBERDROLA, we will cooperate with all the bodies of the public authorities to overcome these sectors' problems. But we will continue to work to achieve profits for our shareholders and will always defend their interests and will do as much as we possibly can.</p>
          <p>But going back again to the results of the company, I'd like to say that the profit and loss account of June shows the actions implemented in these last quarters in order to control investments that optimize the structure of debt. So leverage now stands at 45.8%, which is something like three points below the figure recorded 12 months ago and the main financial ratios have also undergone a significant improvement.</p>
          <p>And the solid operating results and the better financial position of the company have produced an increase of 7.3% in the recurrent net profit and now stands at &#x20AC;1,324 million and 15% in terms of the operating cash flow with &#x20AC;2,710 million.</p>
          <p>And I now am now going to give the floor to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, who is going to be talking about the results in much greater detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, President. Good morning, and now, I would like to review some of the most outstanding aspects that have to do with the profit and loss account of the first semester of 2010. And I am going to be talking about how the business has evolved and later on, I will be talking about the financial situation of the group.</p>
          <p>As has already been mentioned by Mr. Gal&#xE1;n and after a good second quarter, the company is still growing in the main lines of operating results, so that shows how strong our diversified business is.</p>
          <p>EBITDA has grown 11.7%, in line with the first quarter and the net recurrent profits have grown 7.3%. The sales figure have grown 16.9% and now stands at &#x20AC;15,318 million and thanks to the higher volumes in Spain, which has been offset by lower price of the <mark type="inaudible" /> regime and by lower level of remuneration distribution, because there has been strong growth in renewables. And Latin America as regards the provisioning of the group, 24.2% in increase, now this stands at &#x20AC;9.2 billion.</p>
          <p>The gross margin has grown 8.9% and has reached &#x20AC;5.9 billion and as the President has pointed out this is thanks to the contribution that has been made by all the businesses of the group.</p>
          <p>And in addition, IBERDROLA has benefit from very favorable evolution of exchange rates that account for &#x20AC;79 million as regards the gross margin and the basic margin. That covers the net effect of the emission rights. And the P&amp;L account has grown 8.1% and now stands at &#x20AC;6 billion, because the price is lower and because there is less CO2 consumption.</p>
          <p>And the net operating expenses, as the President has also pointed out, has improved the results of the first quarter and has dropped down to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. So although there have been increases in the rates of exchange totaling more than <mark type="inaudible" />. But the net operating expense have grown 1.2%, because there is a positive impact of &#x20AC;35 billion that have to do with external services in Q2 linked to the application of the IFRIC 18 regulations and to the recommendations made by the National Securities Commission, which means that we have reclassified the income that is related to the distribution business with a less net operating expense, which is compensated at the EBIT level with an increase of amortizations.</p>
          <p>And the net staff expenses have grown 3.9% and now stand at &#x20AC;894 million and net external services have been reduced by 5.2% and now stand at &#x20AC;867 million. As regards taxes, well, there has been an increase of 16.8%, and we have a figure &#x20AC;450 million. And this means that there been an increase in the payment of the nuclear rate and it's now &#x20AC;91 million in the semester. We have the social bonus and other rates in the United States that serve to offset the elimination of the detraction of CO2 rights, which represented a figure of &#x20AC;96 million in 2009. And the consolidated EBITDA of the group has reached &#x20AC;3,836 million, which represents a growth rate of 11.7%.</p>
          <p>And this evolution of EBITDA has been followed by an increase in the basic margin, which was 8.1%, thanks to the cost contingent efforts made and thanks to the efficiency improvements carried out by the Group that have produced a reduction of 0.8% in net operating expenses. And the strength of the currencies in which IBERDROLA has operated has been significant in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So the final net impact has been &#x20AC;63 million. The average rate of exchange with the pound has been appreciated by 2.7%, of the Brazilian Real by 18.2%, and the dollar, the average effect of the rate of exchange has been reduced by 1.4%, as I'll be talking about &#x2013; as I'll be mentioned later on.</p>
          <p>I am now going to analyze the operating profit by businesses starting with the liberalized business in Spain, which includes generation, commercial and non-regulated gas. And IBERDROLA has increased output in the ordinary regiment by 20.7%, clearly improving the ordinary system, which has dropped by 2.6%. This positive development is explained by the growth in demand of the system in Spain, 4.2% in the first semester or 3.6% is the adjusted figure and the main increase in the IBERDROLA hydro production, 152%.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our nuclear production has grown 10% and thermal technologies have dropped cycles by 39% and coal plus fuel, 69%. An average total sales price of around &#x20AC;56 per megawatt hour have been obtained with an output of much higher than planned. 70 terawatts hours have been sold in 2010 at a price of more than &#x20AC;50 a megawatt hour. This represents more than 98% of the output budgeted for the year.</p>
          <p>The European market forwards and Spanish market forward point to a price increase in 2011. The Spanish forward maintains the same trend as the German and French. However, there is a negative spread of around 8 to &#x20AC;10. And this reaffirms what was already mentioned by the Chairman regarding the lower cost of the energy under the ordinary regime in Spain compared to the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for the liberalized business in Spain grew 27% to &#x20AC;912 million because of the improvement in the base margin by 19.8% up to 1,470 million, because of the greater volumes and containment of operating expenses. There is also a positive impact resulting from the transfer of the last recourse tariff from distribution to the liberalized business. The increase in basic margin, 19.8%, is therefore greater than the operating cost, 4.5%, in spite of the increase because of the greater commercial activity and this transfer of the last resort tariff.</p>
          <p>Taxes went up 21% to &#x20AC;192 million. Since the increase in the nuclear tax, more than &#x20AC;50 million in this semester is also related to the increase in the eco-tax in Extremadura, which we have included in the accounts although we have appealed and this represents another &#x20AC;10 million. And higher IBERDROLA taxes related with the TUR and the commercial business, &#x20AC;19 million, and this has a much greater impact to the elimination of taxes related to CO2, which in 2009 represented &#x20AC;96 million.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for the regulated business in Spain increased 6.3% to &#x20AC;539 million and improved the drop of 7.5% in the gross margin, thanks to the significant improvement in the net operating expenses, which dropped 28.4%. And the area continues to improve its efficient by transferring the liberalized business to expenses related to TUR, as I mentioned earlier. Also the re-accounting, re-classification which is related to IFRIC 18, through which the charging of deferred earnings corresponding to facilities transferred is included in two accounts under operating earnings and amortizations are increased by the same amount. And additionally, in June 2009, there were expenses as a result of maintenance after the storms, while in 2010, these expenses have not been incurred.</p>
          <p>Regarding the reduction of 7.5% in the gross margin, this is a consequence of the provisional drop in the business remuneration after the adoption of the new ministerial order last December 31. These are provisional remunerations that are waiting for the definitive remuneration based on the reference network model and the investments made in 2009, as stated by the Spanish Energy Commission in its report.</p>
          <p>Gross margin grew to 20.5% to &#x20AC;998 million, so thanks to a major increase in output, 21.5%. And because of the greater operating capacity that grew 16.5% to 11,215 installed megawatts and also because of the improvement of the wind resources in Spain and rest of the world that offsets the drop fundamentally in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Prices have reached &#x20AC;71.2 per megawatt hour. There is also a non-recurrent contribution of &#x20AC;36 million from the monetization of the state line wind power contract in the second trimester, offset by the drop in the contribution of the gas business during the second quarter, because of 33 million in negative mark to market. A growth of 16.17% in operating costs below the growth showed in the gross margin means that EBITDA grew 21.5% to &#x20AC;706.6 million.</p>
          <p>The ScottishPower EBITDA in local currency dropped 9.4% to &#xA3;676 million, after a 4.8% drop in the basic margin because of the worse performance of the wholesale and retail business not offset by the improvement in networks, while operating expenses increased 5.2%. As the Chairman already said, the increase in the net operating expenses is due to the greater collection of insurance in 2009. Otherwise, there would been a slight drop in ScottishPower.</p>
          <p>In euros, EBITDA reduced its 47% to &#x20AC;771 million, after having a positive impact of 20 million, because of the exchange rate. Wholesale and retail contributes &#x20AC;393 million with a drop of 16%, mainly because of lower volumes and lower unit margins because of reduction in prices in 2009 and the high average cost of fuel. Networks provided &#x20AC;364 million, showing a growth of 8.1%, derived from a growth of 10.2% in growth margin with the favorable impact of the new business remuneration. Since the second quarter, the DPCR5, which is applied since 1st April 2010. There also greater earnings related to the new investments made both in transmission and distribution to connect wind generation.</p>
          <p>The IBERDROLA U.S.A. EBITDA, as the Chairman said, amounts to &#x20AC;328 million. The slight average devaluation of the dollar takes away 4.5 million and the post IFRS adjustments improve the account by 20 million, offsetting negative impacts from the previous periods. This growth of 40% is fundamentally because of the reduction of 20% in net operating expenses, since the growth margin grew by 6.3% to &#x20AC;777 million and this drop in net operating expenses, as the Chairman said, occurred because of improvements &#x2013; efficiency in the programs started by the group last year.</p>
          <p>The Latin American EBITDA had a strong growth of 16% to &#x20AC;489 million, the result of the evolution of 21% in gross margin, considering the increase in operating expenses, the net effect is positive since the real revaluation of 18.2% more than compensated for the slight drop in the dollar.</p>
          <p>In businesses, Brazil contributed $283 million to the EBITDA with a growth of 22%, with an improvement of 9.5% in demand and because of the positive effect of the exchange rate, in spite of the selling of sales in Chile and the increase of the operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Mexico contributed &#x20AC;206 million, a growth of 8% with an improvement, although there is a slightly negative change in the exchange rate. The EBITDA in the non-energy and engineering business had a drop of 9.7% to &#x20AC;127 million, because of less activity in the real estate business. Engineering is the biggest contributor to the gross margin with 43% of the total. And we highlight the reduction of 7.3% in the net operating expenses to try to palliate the drop in the gross margin.</p>
          <p>EBIT in the group grew 6.9% to &#x20AC;2,498 million, something lower than the growth recorded in the EBITDA level after the increase of 22% in amortization and provisions amounting to 1,337 million. Amortizations are &#x20AC;1,234 million, 15.8% more because of the increase in renewables, because of the greater average installed power and at ScottishPower, with the effect from the appreciation of the pound and more assets in operation in the networks area.</p>
          <p>Additionally, environmental investments increase in the liberalized business and we also have the liberalized business and we also have the reclassification in the distribution business. Provisions increased by &#x20AC;71 million to 103 million, in an unfavorable period compared to 2009, where there were some turnarounds.</p>
          <p>In regarding the financial results, there were two effects. First of all, regarding the first quarter, there is a change in accounting criteria as a result of the application of the IAS 27 regulations. This means that impacts because of the exchange rate derived from hedging from the balance sheet at IBERDROLA for IBERDROLA renewables are no longer included as financial expenses and now considering minority expenses.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there has been a major appreciation in currency, as we can see on the slide. And since the debt is valued at the exchange rate at the end of the period, the items on the P&amp;L account are valued according to the average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, only one quarter of the appreciation is shown in the account items, while the balance sheet reflects all the changes up to June 30. And the group has have reduced the volatility in the P&amp;L sheet by assessing the hedging for the whole year, although there are six months to go regarding the contribution made by the currencies.</p>
          <p>The increase in the average debt cost goes from 4.7 to 4.2% and this means that the financial result increased by &#x20AC;61 million with an average balance, which is stable. However, the net financial result shows an increase of 81 million to 13.4%, &#x20AC;686 million. The main items explained in this development are the following, apart from the drop of $61 million because of the lower financial costs.</p>
          <p>First of all, the lower deficit remuneration rate has a negative impact of 46 million. This is a remuneration system that is linked to Euribor of three months, which in 2009, was 4.3% and this year, is 0.73%. The value of the hedging derivatives have a negative impact of &#x20AC;45 million due to the temporary effect associated to reserve hedging, as previously explained.</p>
          <p>The sum of lower dividends collected by EDP after the sale of its participation and the effect on the shares has an aggregate negative effect of another 19 million. Then there are also financial provisions that explained the other 31 million in negative impact.</p>
          <p>The non-recurrent assets results, which in the second quarter 2009 include divestments of 10% in Gamesa and Chile, dropped &#x20AC;140 million, going from 223 million in the first semester of 2009 to 84 million this year.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, the result before taxes shows a drop of 3.7% to &#x20AC;1,907 million. The recurrent net profit shows a growth of 7.3%, amounting to 1,324 million. So the mentioned lower contribution of non-recurrence and an effective tax rate of 23.9%, almost three points higher than in 2009, is offset by the low contribution of minority spending through the application of the IAS 27 regulation as already mentioned, in the hedging in the balance sheet, which makes that the reported net profit is &#x20AC;1,467 million, 2.6% lower than the first semester of 2009. The improvement of operating results has increased the group's operating cash flow by 15%, amounting to &#x20AC;2,710 billion.</p>
          <p>Regarding the update of the situation, regarding the tariff deficit on April 21, 2010, as you know, the Royal Decree 437/2010 was published and since then and at a speed that is much lower than desirable, progress has continued to be made and the following landmarks have been achieved. The financial organizations have already been selected to lead the first operation, consultations were made to Brussels that were resolved on June 7, indicating that tariff deficits are not considered state aid.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, and I would highlight this as the most important, the fact that there has been already been an irrevocable commitment of transferring receivables, and this amounts to &#x20AC;3,684 billion as of June 6 and according to Article 5 of Royal Decree 437, the securitization fund must cover the full amount in a maximum of 12 months. Additionally, the selection of the &#x2013; or the appointment of the rating agencies has already been carried out and rating is given to the liabilities in the fund and that is the bonds with the Treasury guarantee. There are still some landmarks to be covered that are being made progress on and after this, we'll have the completed documentation and securitization ready to placed on the market. Of the landmarks remaining, the most relevant is registering the brochure at the Securities Commission.</p>
          <p>Equity at the end of the first semester of 2010 represented almost &#x20AC;31.5 billion, that is &#x20AC;3.3 billion more than a year ago, while net debt without considering the tariff deficit was &#x20AC;26,573 million. Leverage therefore improved; it was 45.8%, 260 base points better than in the first semester of 2009. If we include the tariff deficit in the debt, this amounts to &#x20AC;30,742 million, 1,422 million more than last year. Although leverage also improves 160 base points better than last year, reaching 49.4% versus 51% last year. This improvement in leverage for the group is in line with the objectives for 2010.</p>
          <p>The active financial management of the group have been capable of absorbing the increase in the debt generated by the tariff deficit and has managed the effect of the exchange rate to maintain the financial ratios in line with our solvency objectives. And as we can see on the slide, although the group debt was increased by 1,422 million, it's practically all because of the exchange rate, which is offset by the increase in equity and the hedging is almost perfect. The increase because of the tariff deficit, which is 1.293 billion, has practically been completely offset with the reduction in the debt linked to the business management, which is 1,100 million.</p>
          <p>The immunization policy followed by the company is key during the high volatility periods in the market. For example, today, with the dropping of the dollar compared to what it was on June 30, the debt would have dropped by almost &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>The strict control of debt to go with the immunization policy already mentioned for the P&amp;L accounts and the solvency ratios, as well as the growth achieved in terms of the operating cash flow, allow the company to show better financial ratios that are much better than the ratios of the same period of the previous fiscal year, excluding the tariff deficit and compared to first semester of 2009, FFO relative to net debt stands at 20% vis-&#xE0;-vis 17.6% of one year ago.</p>
          <p>FFO related to interest is 5.2 times higher and RCF vis-&#xE0;-vis net debt is nearly two points above the 12% figure we had for last year. And the improvements in the financial ratios shown in this first semester will continue in the second semester, when the positive effects that have <mark type="inaudible" /> by a scrip dividend are recorded, together with the divestures of the Connecticut gas distributor and the impact that the currencies have on the P&amp;L accounts, which means that would achieve the objectives for 2010.</p>
          <p>As regards the breakdown according to sources of funding, we have maintained a significant weight of debt finance in capital markets. As regards debt by currencies, the hedging policy reduces the risk of the rates of exchange in the P&amp;L accounts. And that means that we are minimizing the volatility of <mark type="inaudible" /> of the solvency ratios. As in this regard, the debt in euros account for 52% of the total, whereas debt in pounds and dollars stand at 25 and 20% respectively.</p>
          <p>As regards the debt structure by interest rate, we have a cautious structure with 47% at a variable rate and 53 at a fixed rate. And we also have hedgings for interest rates in order to gradually increase the percentage of our fixed rate debt to 60% in 2011. And we've made use &#x2013; we've benefited from these very high levels, long-term levels.</p>
          <p>And it has to be pointed out that our excellent liquidity position, right now, we have nearly &#x20AC;9.4 billion in liquidity and available credit lines, where we already include the &#x20AC;2 billion of the line that was signed on July the 8th. And as the President pointed out, this allows us to address upcoming years in a very positive manner. So the average duration is six years and the maturities of debt and loans, as you can seen, on the screen, offers a very comfortable maturity system that is pretty stable and thanks to the solid liquidity position with &#x20AC;9.4 billion, the group has covered its requirements, its needs until mid 2012.</p>
          <p>And now, the President will finish this presentation. He will conclude with his own conclusions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pepe. And I think that result that we've presented here show, as I pointed out at the very beginning, that IBERDROLA is capable of obtaining growth in any macroeconomic and market scenario, thanks to the geographic diversification of its business portfolio. So in this first semester, the group has increased its results by 11.7% at an operating level and 7.3% in terms of the recurrent net profit.</p>
          <p>Production has increased by 14.2%. And all of those countries in which IBERDROLA is present have made it possible to achieve this increase. The 21% increase of Spain is linked to the wonderful situation of the wind business in the United States, where there has been an increase to 22% and in Latin America, this energy has grown by 9% and in the U.K., it's been 6%.</p>
          <p>And finally, the renewable assets in other countries have increased their production by nearly 30%. But one of the <mark type="inaudible" /> of the group in recent years has to do with continuous efficiency improvement and these results that we are presenting clearly show the effects that have been produced by the savings actions in the different businesses. The contention of net operating expenses that have dropped by 0.8% together with an increase in the business activities has made it possible to improve efficiency 0.9%.</p>
          <p>But I would like to underscore that all of these businesses have achieved improvements under this heading, which are the following. In Spain, the group is carrying out a transition to a market that is completely deregulated and it's doing so efficiently, which has produced a very low increase in expenses, slightly above 9% in homogeneous terms, because we have had to hire many more commercial networks.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., ScottishPower has managed to maintain flat recurrent expenses in pounds. In the United States, expenses have been reduced by more than 8%. And renewables cost per installed megawatt have dropped by 3%, which showed that this company is capable of carrying out an expansion process efficiently.</p>
          <p>The third key element of the results has to do with the improvement of our financial situation, which is what the CFO mentioned. So, therefore, leverage only stands at 45.8% with an improvement of 260 base points relative to one year ago.</p>
          <p>The financial ratios of the group have also undergone a significant strengthening, assisted by the generation of cash, that has grown by 15%, and liquidity has reached a figure that is very close to &#x20AC;9.4 billion. So, this was mentioned by the CFO. We have fully covered our funding requirements until mid-2012.</p>
          <p>As regard the Group's prospects in the rest of the year, we expect the regulated businesses to improve in the U.K. and the United States as a result of the regulatory visions. As regards Latin America, the strength of demand has allowed us to slightly improve our expectations in terms of results.</p>
          <p>RENOVABLES will carry on growing, thanks to the increase in capability and thanks to the stability of prices that have been fixed in more than 93%, mainly through PPAs and real estate or tariffs in other markets.</p>
          <p>And in the deregulated businesses, we will compensate the better Spanish behavior with the weaker situation in U.K. and last year, it was the opposite. The U.K. market was stronger and Spain weaker. We'll maintain our focus on operating efficiency in all businesses and there has been &#x2013; there have been many improvements in the United States and the new regulation that will be applied to the subsidiaries in New York will provide an incentive for these measures. And as I've said, this will be implemented in the month of October.</p>
          <p>And the solid financial position of the group will also carry on being reinforced and thanks to the control of investments, which is in line with the cash flow that is generated and with the securitization of the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, the process is slower than what we expected and wanted and what the authorities and the agents wanted. But as the CFO pointed out, we think that we have reached the end of this process and fundamentally we now have to wait for this to be registered by the National Energy Commission and this will allow us to carry out a positive process and will have positive operating results and a recurrent net profit. And you can be sure that all of us people working with the group will carry on with our efforts in order to maximize these results to benefit all the shareholders. And now we are going to open the floor for the discussion.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Well, as usual, first, we are going to have the questions from the room and then we are going to move on to the questions from the telephone and finally, we will have the questions from the webcast.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Raimundo, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'm Raimundo Fern&#xE1;ndez-Cuesta from Nomura. Two questions on two issues that we've been talking about a lot these days; and one of them has to do with the fear, because we could &#x2013; might apply a German Nuclear Tax that the ministry has said they're not looking into. But I would like to ask the President, why does IBERDROLA think that it would not be legal relative to the Spanish Legislation and the European Legislation? And why is it that Spain is not like Germany in this regard?</p>
          <p>And the second question is also related to this fear that normally crops up when the credit markets are worse off, which is the possible enlargement &#x2013; capital enlargement and today, the company has a much more solid financial position, much more liquidity and we can see that there is a securitization of the deficit. But I'd like to ask you directly, why is it that we shouldn't wait for IBERDROLA to go for a real capital enlargement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Spanish legislation &#x2013; I'm a lawyer, but there are some lawyers here that could also answer this question. But these rates have to be applied for a specific purpose for something to change in the first place. And secondly, we've already have a rate, a significant rate, because we are paying this &#x2013; in the case of waste disposal, we are paying something like &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour and if we <mark type="inaudible" /> the rates that in some regions, are also being applied to the nuclear power, we're talking about &#x20AC;15 per megawatt hour. So we already have what the Germans have. But in any case, it is finalistic, so to speak.</p>
          <p>And the second issue is that European legislation allows you to apply whatever taxes you want, as long as they are finalistics. In other words, as long as they are paid by the end consumer. But you shouldn't apply to one technology or to another, you shouldn't apply a tax burden that reduces this technology's competitiveness. So I suppose that this is an issue that the Germans will be looking into with Brussels and in the case of Spain, we would follow suit.</p>
          <p>We have an example in Spain of what has happened doing something of this kind, which has to do with the mobile telephony firms and they applied rates to mobile phones, that I am &#x2013; used to work for that sector and my heart is still with them, and they applied a rate to fund the lack of advertisement on public television &#x2013; on Spanish television. But a resolution has been passed by Brussels and they say that, that rate is illegal and therefore that you cannot apply that 0.7 or 0.6% to mobile phones so that you can fund the withdrawal of advertisement on public television.</p>
          <p>So I sincerely believe and I tried to explain this before, I think that we can create an additional problem instead of solving the problem. The problem is where it lies and it cannot be solved by taking 50 million from here, and another 200 million from over there.</p>
          <p>Nuclear power, we produce 50,000 megawatts an hour, so what can you get from that? 100, 200, 300 million? But the problem is 4 billion, where is the problem? The problem is that they have managed the planning of solar energy incorrectly, and if they do not do things properly, we'll have another bubble with the thermo solar facilities in a few months or in a few years. So the problem is where it stands, it's at the very origin.</p>
          <p>So if you put in technologies of &#x20AC;466, it really, it's no good to deduct two or three from 50, because it's possible to compensate one at 400, if you deduct 50. So you have to look into that problem and by the way, it is being addressed right now, but you have to do something about it.</p>
          <p>And we have to be where &#x2013; as they've done in the U.K. and I am presenting it as an example, we want to have a much cleaner energy and how much does that cost? So let's have an offshore plan of 30,000 megawatts installed by the year 20, whatever it is, 2020, what does that mean? &#xA3;60 per family and year. And we'd have to do the same thing here, we want to be the &#x2013; we want to be more solar than the Americans. But how much is that going to cost the Spaniards?</p>
          <p>And it's going to cost them 10% more in their bills or 15%, I've seen the figure of 2009, 2% of 16%. So that means 8% more of cost on the bill, so that you can fund the execution errors in terms of the planning actions carried out in previous years.</p>
          <p>And the second point, and as regards increasing the equity of our company and Pepe said that we have an absolutely magnificent liquidity situation. So there is no need to increase our equity. But what I do have to say is that, regardless of the fact, I think that we do not need to do that, but not only that, I think that we have many paths open to us. I think that the deficit is going to be collected and this has been explained perfectly well by the CFO and once we've transferred the collection, there is a maximum period to do that and I think that everybody wants to get that done.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I have to blame myself and the company has to do so, too, because what we've said about the securitization dates were not invented by us. They were provided by the government too, because we thought that things could go quicker than they have, because there have been some obstacles along the way, like what the CFO said, as regards to whether there should be state aid or not and it's been taken to Brussels and that has produced another two months' delay.</p>
          <p>But being aware of the fact that there has been a delay in relation to what we wanted to do, we think that we are in a relatively at the end of the process. And I can also guarantee that we're doing as much as we possibly can to speed things up at all levels. So I don't think that it's necessary. I don't think that this cannot be collected, because there is an additional element that has to do with the responsibility of the administration because of not running the public services properly. So I don't think that there is anything to say in that regard and I also think that, that is something that is very clear.</p>
          <p>It wouldn't be realistic, because firstly, the deficit &#x2013; I would like to say this so that it's very clear. It's nothing new under the sun that this was perhaps was my first <mark type="inaudible" /> in 2001. When I arrived, I came across this and nobody was saying anything, and it was recognized in 2002.</p>
          <p>And our colleagues were skeptical about the issue and it was accepted because it had to be so legally. It wasn't because IBERDROLA was doing anything exceptional. We wanted to defend the interest of the shareholders and we have been collecting this systematically until 2008, and even in 2009, we securitized part of it, but why wasn't it not fully securitized? Well, because the financial markets sunk.</p>
          <p>So in order to do this, the government designed a law to give a state guarantee to those assets so that we could collect under reasonable conditions for the consumers to reduce the costs as much as possible and it wouldn't make any sense after nine years to draw up a specific law to do this. And now I've just seen a statement from the from President of the government at Parliament talking about the same issue and of course, it has to be done and it has to be done quickly, too.</p>
          <p>But there could be other circumstances that we have looked into. So we are not a company full of blind people and we've been looking around and we are flexible enough for practically everything, because we think and plan very carefully. There might be a situation but as that in 2008, they might close down the markets completely.</p>
          <p>So if it were not possible to securitized, we have a plan &#x2013; we have a B plan and what will we do? Well, what we've done in the past. We would do something about investments. We did so last year. We stopped investments when the situation changed. Instead of investing 7 billion, we invested 3. And as I can say, it's very difficult to launch a company and to invest, but it's much more difficult to stop the investments once they've been made, although we did that.</p>
          <p>So we would activate our divesture program and nobody thought that we were going do this in Connecticut and but there are many, many assets that can be made liquid with &#x2013; very easily and with a very clear cut policy, which is what we have maintained and that is that what we have to do is maintain our dividend and our payout. The payout that we've been &#x2013; we have been maintaining for recent years and under these circumstances, we do not think that it would be necessary to increase our equity because of the liquidity we have and because the deficit is going to be collected and I hope that it will take place soon.</p>
          <p>And if there were a market situation, that is if there were totally closed market, we have a stress plan for those circumstances. And we've been able to do something about the problem. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning. Javier Garrido from J.P. Morgan. The first question is on regulation, but outside Spain and the U.K. with a new government. There has been a preliminary approach regarding the regulatory prospects for the energy sector. And I would like to know what IBERDROLA'S assessment is of these approaches, in particular, the possibility of a minimum price for CO2 and other approaches?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the agreement you've reached with technical services of the New York regulator. Could you expand this in relation to what the basis are for this agreement regarding return on equity? And what proportion of the equity is contemplated under the capital structure for the New York subsidiaries under that agreement?</p>
          <p>And the third question, a clarification on what you've just said. I should understand then that if the capital markets evolve in a normal way, if they continue to be open and the tariffs' deficits are securitized, you're not going to continue with an active divestment policy, except for isolated case, but you wouldn't contemplate major divestments? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding divestments, you know we made a plan. It was at the beginning of this year, around 2.5, I don't know how much is pending. But we said that if we need it &#x2013; we have a ceiling. If we need it, we'll do it. If we don't, we won't. Divestments are a buffer to attain an objective and the object is to maintain our current position.</p>
          <p>So if it were necessary, we would do it. If it weren't, we wouldn't, but we continue to contemplate this figure, 2.5, as the figure which according to the environment at the time, was a reasonable figure. Half or about half has been done, and we'll have to see whether we need the other half or not. If we need it, we'll do it, and if we don't, we won't do it. Or we will use the best alternative, as we did in Connecticut, we changed something that was worse for something that was better.</p>
          <p>Regarding the U.K., well in the U.K., the regulator, as you know, is really an independent regulator, so it doesn't depend on the government. It reports to the British Parliament and has made its reflections on the energy framework for the coming years. First, we have a very fluid relationship with them. At the beginning of the year, I had a long meeting with <mark type="inaudible" />, the Chairman. And we discussed the document that he put out on analogy policy for the future and what the repercussions would be in the U.K. or what the U.K. energy needs are, the necessary investments, how to cover demand, etcetera.</p>
          <p>Well, we've had this permanent fluid relationship and this fluid relationship on a level of technical services means that we agree with their basic plans in general. There are some issues that are being included in their reflections. For example, the need for a backup when there are massive non-predictable energy facilities, such as wind energy, where you need to have combined cycle technology, in principle, combined cycle or pumping in order to supply energy when the wind doesn't blow and that has to be paid for. Therefore, they've rethought about capacity payments to support this kind of situation, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>In this context of reflection, they're also thinking &#x2013; and again, this is just a reflection, whether the green certificate model in Britain is the best system or whether the feed-in tariff system is better that we have in other countries. Our thesis in this is that if things work, why change them? Our experience in Spain, as I mentioned earlier, regarding these continuous changes, make us conservative. As we say in Spain, don't let me get any worse, let's keep things as they are and let's not change things that are working well.</p>
          <p>And the third issue is regarding CO2. Again, we're not against a minimum price for CO2, but we believe that it would have to be within the context of the European Union. If the European Union decides to take that path, fantastic. If the European Union decides to follow the system of the emissions market that has worked, why change something that has worked?</p>
          <p>And there are some countries, again, such as the French, and if some are against and the European Union maintains the emission market system, well, we believe that it's a system that has worked reasonably well. So let's not change things that work, that's the context.</p>
          <p>But again, the relationship with the regulators are absolutely fluid, permanent, constant and we are part of a reflection. We are not against anything. But I do have to say about the British Government that I was very pleased and I said this yesterday in the presentation for RENOVABLES and I'll say it again today, that practically all political parties, certainly the political parties that are currently in government, the liberals and the conservatives, but the Labour Party too, they are aware of the country's energy needs.</p>
          <p>They are aware of the investment that the country requires to cater for those energy requirements. They are aware of the needs of the British public regarding quality and security of supply, and so they are saying, we have to make a framework that is predictable, stable and will provide incentives, so that the necessary resources will come in to make the investments, and to be able to make those investments at the lowest minimum &#x2013; at the lowest possible cost, because we'll have a minimum amount of uncertainty and so that money can be lent in more favorable conditions. So they are indirectly favoring consumers through minimum cost, maximum security of supply and maximum quality of supply. I think that's a good example of how we can look at this issue. Instead of involving or trying to obtain things from the current investment and instead of attracting them, you scare them away. I think what they are doing is intelligent.</p>
          <p>The third issue regarding New York. I think that the technical services in New York, you were talking about the equity ratio. I think that we are talking about 50-50. We were at levels of 40-some and we're levels of 50. We are going up 6, 7, 8 points in equity ratio, which is a positive element. The second issue regards return on investment. I think that we are slightly higher than we had, around 10%. But more important than that is the capability of improving the <mark type="inaudible" /> through efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>If there is something I can say about that agreement, it's three things. It takes away uncertainty. There were things, pensions, storms, unfortunately in the northwest of the U.S. every year or every two years, there is a terrible snowstorm that requires extraordinary efforts and extraordinary expenses. And there was always a question mark over this, who paid for it, how was it paid for, when was it paid for, and that's been perfectly defined.</p>
          <p>The pension issue. The pension funds for the employees, part of them are under fixed income, under floating income. Well, that's all been sorted out. And these are major uncertainties. And this meant that some years, things were better and other years, things were worse and what we want is predictability, not shocks. So we are going for predictability.</p>
          <p>The second important point, incentives for efficiency. I have said from the beginning that one of the main elements that we liked about the American regulated sector is their capability to improve efficiency and IBERDROLA is an expert in this area. And we're already proven that where we go, we are capable of applying practices that substantially improve costs and efficiency.</p>
          <p>The point is that these &#x2013; there was no incentive to improve efficiency. But we've established such an agreement that these efficiency improvements have an incentive behind them, because we receive something in exchange.</p>
          <p>If until now, they were done for nothing, well, there was no incentive to do them, but if you do them and get something from them, that's an incentive. So in that way, we obtain two things: more profits and better operations. And the other day I was talking to the Director of Networks, Xabier de Irala, who is over there. We were talking about what's happened here in IBERDROLA in recent years. In 10 years, supplied energy has increased by 40%.</p>
          <p>We're doing it and we have improved service quality by 40% and doing it with improvements of almost 40% in efficiency. Are the figures right? Well, it's possible to provide better service. And it's possible to supply more energy and do it with reasonable cost. This is what we are trying to do and this is our incentive.</p>
          <p>What we are going to do? Make major investments to adapt that network to the needs of the 21st century, because we've also talked about this before, those that know the U.S. well, some of the American networks leave a lot to be desired and we have the opportunity in Maine, an interconnection that would not only serve to interconnect with Canada, but we can also be able to hang a lot of wind farms on them that Maine wanted to build and couldn't because of the lack of evacuation.</p>
          <p>Well, this is one of our opportunities and this is what this regulation provides. So, again, stability, security, incentives for efficiency improvements, incentives for quality improvements, I didn't mention that. And this is the framework and therefore, I think it's reasonable and I hope and trust that this will be helpful in the next four years. Next question in the room, Philip?</p>

          <p>Question, the first one is regarding the provision, excluding the IFRIC 18, is there other things which are explaining this sharp increase of your provisions, if you can elaborate on that? And the second question is more dedicated to medium term. Could you elaborate about your nuclear policy in the U.K., where you have some agreement to build a nuclear power station, where are you today?

          <p>Sorry, they're clearly affected by IFRIC 18 that gives us 32 million more. But also renewables, the renewables provision, which are consolidated have grown by twenty-some percent and there is also an increase because of investments that have been made in the U.K. in networks and we are saying this in the EBITDA for the networks business, where provisions also increased. And the other important element in provisions are the environmental investments that were made in the generation business in Spain and that also increase the amortizations. And you also have to consider that there is an exchange rate impact that we didn't mention. But all this is what makes the amortizations go up.</p>

          <p>Regarding the nuclear issue in the U.K., you know we acquired a location where we have the capability to build up to 3,200 or 3,400 megawatts and the nuclear power plant is a joint project with Gaz de France Suez and Scottish and Southern. There is a joint work team. We're currently &#x2013; once we have the location, we're working on the project, permit planning, et cetera, et cetera. We think and correct me, Paco, that this won't be ready to say let's go ahead until the 14th or 15 &#x2013; or till '14 or '15 or even more. So it's a slow job that takes a long time. We have to do a lot of planning. We have to do a lot of work on permit projects, et cetera, etcetera. And when we have it, we'll say, let's go ahead, but I don't think we will be able to give the go ahead before four or five years' time. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Alejandro Vigil [Cygnus]. I have several questions related to the [inaudible] businesses. One, regarding the business in Spain, regarding output hedging for the next quarters or 2011, and the deregulated market in the U.K., we've seen a deterioration in margins. Do you think this is going to continue in the next quarters and 2011 or do you see a turning point for next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards 2010, <mark type="inaudible" /> pointed this out, we have practically all the production placed for this year and it's been placed at prices in excess of &#x20AC;50 per megawatt. So this year it's been practically closed, although next year, we have placed something like 45 terawatt hour with prices that are higher than this year's, that are closer to 55 than to 50 and the 45 terawatts hour represents all the non-thermal energy that we have for next year and we've made some forecasts for 2012. We've placed some things we can talk about more than 10 terawatt hour. Prices will &#x2013; this will depend on the market, because the prices have been indexed according to the market and if they go up, if the market goes up, they will also go up and if not, we'll be &#x2013; we might be above 55.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far as 2010 is concerned, I think it is a game of two halves. If I give you some statistics that illustrate this, and forgive me for doing it in pounds, but clean dark spreads for Winter '10 on the 30th of March were &#xA3;6, on the 2nd of July, they were &#xA3;10, dark spreads for Summer of '11, 30th of March were &#xA3;2, 2nd of July, they are &#xA3;10. So the point is that spreads have been very weak in the first half of the year. They are starting to correct, both for 2010 and into 2011, as we have also seen with the strengthening wholesale power price, which is up about 25% on the year and so spreads are coming back both second half 2010 and 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Victor Peiro from Caja Madrid. And I would like to have more information on the deregulated businesses, because the first question would be what has to do with growth as regards electricity in the deregulated market, because now we know that there is transfer? And what is the ratio you expect? And then on other hand, the deregulated business of Gas after signing the agreement with <mark type="inaudible" /> for the sale of 1.1 Bcms, what would position of IBERDROLA be as regards the gas supply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as gas is concerned, it's the easy answer, everything has been closed and we have also closed next year. So does that mean when I say that it's been closed, that means that we have the supply and sales of gas. In other words, what we buy and sell has been fully covered, it's fully matched. So we have improvements. We have possibility of improving and we are improving our positions.</p>
          <p>As regards growth, I didn't really fully understand the question. Do you mean the growth of demand in Spain &#x2013; how many customers have you got on the deregulated market or how many customers are you bringing in? Well, we have attracted something like 60,000 clients or customers per week, which is an enormous figure, which is something like three times greater than what our Scottish colleagues were doing in a market that was fully deregulated and right now, we have more than &#x2013; three times more that. In other words, we have 60,000 new customers every week in terms of sales. Anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what percentage are you obtaining in terms of the total sales in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well compared to last year, we've multiplied all figures by two and we are doing three times more than we were doing one year ago in terms of weekly sales. And we account for nearly 25% of the Spanish market, which is what we also are in terms of production, and that's it, I think.</p>
          <p>Victor, would you like to clarify anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in this gas balance, how much comes from met gas? Are they going to make a contribution or are they not going to make a contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that I cannot disclose this data. I shouldn't really say where the gas supplies come from. I think gas, as you know, we're now negotiating the contracts with all the suppliers and this will possibly be clarified towards the last quarter of the year. And I only have to say that we're subject to confidentiality. We have a wonderful relationship with Sonatrach, who is a wonderful supplier. And in that portfolio, I can guarantee that supplies have been covered in terms of sale to purchase, and we'll see what the contract terms are to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, we present the business as a whole, because then there are lots of transfers between cycles and non-cycles. And I think that that conveys a much more global image.</p>
          <p>Jose Antonio Lopez and then Virginia Sanz.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Jose Antonio Lopez [HSBC], I wanted to ask a question in relation to the mid and long-term. When the Ministry of Industry, prior to announcing the revision of the regulated costs, they spoke about having to improve the competitiveness of Spanish industries and that's when the revision started, after that announcement. So what do you think about the current European market and the possible need to have a new wave of consolidation to improve efficiency and to build larger companies, so that we can strengthen the competitiveness of Europe as a Union? Do you have any view, do you have a view on that issue or do you have anything in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the first thing that Europe has to do is establish interconnections, because as we can neither take that energy out, nor bring it in, it's going to be very difficult to achieve efficiency. But if we were to have some wonderful interconnections between the U.K. and the Continent or between Spain and the Continent, we could take Spanish energy to the U.K. and from the U.K. to Spain, at a given point in time.</p>
          <p>And when you have a significant amount of wind production in Spain and you have a situation like we've had in this quarter, we've had a very low level of prices and with interconnections, we could have sold that energy in the U.K. for very attractive prices and the other way around, too. Because if the U.K. were going to do this, too, if they go for offshore wind power and whenever they have a surplus, we could optimize that area. So the first condition would be that we need to have interconnections.</p>
          <p>And the second issue is that in Europe, we &#x2013; it's five major groups and then there are a number of peripheral organizations. But the first condition is this, there has to be interconnections in Spain and Portugal. We work very well and we are optimizing Spanish energy in Portugal and Portuguese energy in Spain. Unfortunately, this is not possible with the rest of Europe, because I was at a meeting with the Energy Commissioner, with Oettinger, and the five or six largest producers were with him, European producers, and we were talking about interconnections.</p>
          <p>And in Spain, we have less than 2% of our installed power is interconnected with Europe, but in the U.K., the situation is also similar. So, what are we talking about? And in other countries, there are constraints not that big, Central Europe is more interconnected but it's not enough in many instances. So any element to achieve the efficiency of installations, well, first, you should be able to move your product around and we're working on that and we are doing as much we possibly can. And at this meeting we held and at future meetings, this is going to be one of the key elements to be addressed. In other words, how to achieve that efficiency? Because it doesn't make any sense for you to have infrastructural surpluses in one country and a deficit in other and then you need to resort to duplicity, because there is a lack of connection. So to achieve synergies, you need to have those interconnections. Virginia, at the back of the room, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. My name is Virginia Sanz from the Deutsche Bank. I have several questions. Firstly, and considering the figures you've presented today that are pretty positive as far as the financial result are concerned, I am surprised to see that Moody's has given you a negative rating. So what is it that concerned them? Is that they don't believe that you are going to be receiving the deficit money or do you think that it's the regulatory uncertainty we have right now, or have they given you some time to make a decision on the rating?</p>
          <p>And then as regards the issue of the energy pact that they said was something &#x2013; that something could be said in July and now that it's July the 21, do you think that this is going to be something that applies to the second half of the year, because I can see that it's not possible then &#x2013; not possible for you to reach an agreement on the closure of the Garona nuclear power station?</p>
          <p>And consider &#x2013; considering the regulatory uncertainty we have in Spain, do you feel comfortable now and can you confirm the guidance you need for the strategic plan for &#x2013; that you presented at the beginning of the year and which covers the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moody's &#x2013; I think that Moody's pointed this out very clearly and they praise us as a company and they criticize the government a lot, because they say that IBERDROLA is very good from all points of view and what they say is that we are subject to things that are really not really orthodox in the case of a regulated business and they didn't say that, but I would like to repeat this, 20 modifications in the Spanish laws, 100 Royal Decrees and 200 resolutions as well as ministerial decrees, well, that is madness. Well, having said that, I think that Moody's &#x2013; what Moody's has done, they presented expectations for this to become normal and this is what the government wants to do through the energy pact. It wants to put an end to this uncertainty.</p>
          <p>What is the energy pact? Well, I think that the energy pact has created some tremendous expectations and it's nothing new either, because I have gone to the Senate and to the Parliament in the last 12 months on several occasions. There is a sub-committee of the Spanish Parliament to reach an agreement on energy tariffs.</p>
          <p>So what vision does Spain have for 2030 or 2035? What sources of supply are there going to be? What cost are there going to be? What are the repercussions going to be like, as Ofgem has done in the U.K., the regulator and they've held an open discussion and they've taken this issue to Parliament, so they've taken another step here. They said well, look, not only that, but we want to give it support through the two main political parties. But everything is up and running and what they want to do is put a stop to the situation, which the rating agents and Moody's mentioned this issue.</p>
          <p>So I am not sure if this is going to be a very global issue. The president of the government has spoken about this issue in a positive manner. I have just received an e-mail here, but I have no further information. But I think that it seems that there is an agreement in terms of renewables. And we will see what happens, but I am not optimistic and I am not going to say that everything is going to be solved immediately.</p>
          <p>But I feel comfortable if the planning for 2030, which is what they have been discussing at Parliament, uses common sense and as long as rules are laid down to do things reasonably, in which we introduce the cost factor as another variable, which is what the Parliament is working on and which is what I believe, well, according to what I've been told, that they want to get done by before July's through, they want to release a document with a number of basic points on the key issues, which during the summer and after summer, there will be a much more detailed document available on what this approach is all about.</p>
          <p>This is nothing new. This is just a concern in the case of the legislative and executive bodies and we have to put an end to the situation, in which we have permanent changes in our system, as well as in our legislation and in our regulatory reforms and that is what they are working on right now.</p>
          <p>And what are our results going to be like? An indication, well, we have no elements to present here, but things are going better than we expected. We're talking about growth rates between five and seven and well, we've achieved levels of 12 as regards the EBITDA. So that means that we are relatively at ease and the indication we have for the end of the year, it seems that we're also going to be much better off than what we expected at the very beginning of the year.</p>

          <p>More questions from the room. Well, let's move on to the phone. We're running a little bit late. I think that the first question is Alberto Gandolfi from UBS. Hello, good morning, we are going to move on to the first question from Alberto Gandolfi from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Alberto Gandolfi. I have several questions, please. The first is a follow-up question on the first question. The Chairman was talking about a nuclear tax and he was saying that the tax has to have a purpose and what we're hearing is that the purpose could be extending the useful life of the plants. So would it be a possible scenario, a nuclear tax in exchange for extending the plant life? And MPD could be negative, because the tax could start to be paid right now? So what do you think about this, first of all?</p>
          <p>And also talking about the tariff issue, tariff issues either have to go up or something has to be cut off. Because it seems that an increase of 8 or 10% each year is not viable or is perhaps not what the government wants? Would it be possible to imagine something else? For example, we've seen regional taxes on hydro, on water? Can you comment on the impact that this could have on the EBITDA in the short term, in spite of the neutrality?</p>
          <p>And excuse me for going back to the tariff deficit again, but is it possible to think that the deficit could start to be securitized without knowing what the tariff increase is going to be in the future? Because it seems that there's quite lot of uncertainty about the possibility of it disappearing in 2013. So there could be a doubt as to how much paper there is going to be in the future and that could delay securitization again. Could you say something about this? Have you thought about it?</p>
          <p>And another very quick question on the business, two more. One is the English deregulated business. You've already mentioned the spark spread, but can you say a bit more about the margins? And how do you expect those margins to move the rest of the year? I'm talking about gross margin here. Can you talk about how costs and earnings have moved? What could we expect for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And the final question, what should the minority level be in the normalized P&amp;L? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I make a distinction between a rate and a tax. A rate is something that is paid by the producers and has to serve a given purpose. The tax rate for nuclear dismantling, we're paying &#x20AC;10 per megawatt. A tax is charged to the tariff or the invoice, the electricity tariff, for example, all Spanish pay 5% on their electricity bill to pay for regional spending or whatever.</p>
          <p>And the legislation in each country is different. In Spain, a nuclear facility is not a concession that can be extended for life. It's an industrial facility, like an automotive plant or steel works. If you meet the technical environmental security conditions, et cetera, et cetera, nobody can close it. And if somebody wants to close it, it has to be for reasons of national interest, and first, there has to be an expropriation. They have to justify that it serves the national interest and then there'll have to be an expropriation and that's what happened at Garona. They've taken an administrative decision, it's going to be closed in 2013 or won't be able to operate as of 2013, because it's not going to be closed until 2020 or 2018.</p>
          <p>But, since there is an approval from those technically responsible for that facility and it meets with all the technical requirements of security and quality reviewed by the Spanish bodies, the Spanish Nuclear Council and audited by the International Nuclear Organization. So if a decision of that kind is made, it will have to be justified through the national interest and will have to be expropriated and paid for. And thus, we've made an appeal and we've asked for something like &#x20AC;900 million for that decision, that's right, isn't it?</p>
          <p>So it's not something that they can say, well, I'll extend it, I'll extend it or I won't extend it. It depends on whether we comply with the safety regulations and other regulations. And that's reviewed by the National Nuclear Council and the international agencies that work in this area, so there is no cause and effect here.</p>
          <p>As to what happens if they are not increased, well, I think that things are already being done. It's in the paper today that 800 photovoltaic plants are being approved and when you look at the small print, 120 megawatts. Well in 2008, we had 3,000 or 2,800. So they are cutting back already and they also say, at what prices? It's no longer &#x20AC;466, it's 250, 240. That's half of what they were charging. So there are starting to be two elements, less quantity and lower price for the new ones.</p>
          <p>Regional taxes, well, regions are free to apply taxes, but the constitutional Supreme Court then says that they are not legitimate and that's the end of it. Some years ago, a rate of this kind was imposed by Extremadura and the constitutional court said that they couldn't do it. They will try it again and will go back to court.</p>
          <p>Regarding the deficit, well, I don't know whether the tariffs are going to go up or not, but we have the Treasury guarantee. The Treasury guarantee is there to guarantee to the buyers of that deficit that if the system doesn't provide enough money to pay them, the Treasury will pay for the rest and that's the Treasury guarantee.</p>
          <p>But in any case, again, the spirit and the law is that in 2013 and this is being re-ratified will put an end to that deficit. There are several elements that have also caused a negative effect. A drop in demand like last year's means that all the forecasts shot up.</p>
          <p>If you have more costly output and less demand, fewer people paying for it, paying for the fixed cost, the deficit goes up. If demand goes up, as it's going up this year at a rate of four-point-something percent, the income goes up and therefore, there's more to serve that whole issue. Regarding the U.K.?</p>

          <p>With regard to margins in the liberalized business in the U.K., as you'll know, in the first quarter of 2010, the six big players in the U.K. market cut their gas prices by an average of about 8%. Since then, wholesale gas prices have risen in 2010, wholesale gas prices by about 40% and wholesale power prices by about 25%.</p>
          <p>So in answer to your question and restoration of margins, I would have thought that the next &#x2013; the momentum is gathering quite strongly for an upward move in retail prices at some point in 2010, and you've already seen it by some of the pricing activity in our online products in the U.K. market.</p>

          <p>Yes, regarding the minority expenses, the impact is around &#x20AC;45 million, but what we do need to repeat and I want to explain it again, Alberto, is that this is an impact that's going to be absorbed. First of all, because this positive impact in the accounts is reflected negatively in the valuation of the financial derivatives. Therefore, one thing is linked to the other. And in the end, both this and the financial derivatives are reflecting the present value of cash flows that haven't taken place yet, and they will come into the company over the next six months, if the exchange rates stay at their current level.</p>
          <p>In other words when you're evaluating hedging of financial derivatives, et cetera, regardless of where you put them, in financial expenses or minority expenses, you're bringing in the present value plus the temporary value of the financial derivatives and you take them to the operating accounts at Month Six. And yet in that P&amp;L, you're not reflecting what the group is going to benefit through the greater cash flow that is received by having the flows in appreciated currencies. Therefore, the impact is 45. It has a negative impact on financial results, and that impact over the year has to be offset through other positive cash flows. So therefore, I wouldn't look at it as non-recurrent.</p>
          <p>The next person is Javier Suarez from UniCredit. Yes, go ahead, Javier Suarez, with your question please.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning everyone. Javier Suarez from UniCredit. Three questions, the first about the distribution business, on Page 26, you mentioned that in the EBITDA for the <mark type="inaudible" /> is &#x20AC;539 million. Doesn't include investments during 2009.The question is, what will the corrected EBITDA be, including the investments made in 2009?</p>
          <p>The second question regarding the Latin American business, on page 31, I think, EBITDA is growing by 15%. And the fact is mentioned, our increase in demand in Brazil and Mexico and the appreciation of the real. Can you give us a figure on the underlying growth in local currency to try to see how sustainable this growth is in Latin America, which has been so good during the first half of the year?</p>
          <p>The third question, going back to the regulation issue, we've covered practically all the points, but I would like to have your opinion on the situation regarding the approval of the decree that could force the Spanish electricity sector to consume domestic coal? There are significant difficulties in Europe, and I would like to hear you comment on this. And another detail on Page 33, I think it is, the provision level for the company goes up significantly by more than &#x20AC;70 million compared to the first half of 2009. I would like to know the reasons for this. Thank you.</p>

          <p>I'll answer the coal question. The news we have is what's in the press; that the commission has held several meetings, competition, energy, environment and the theme presented by Spain has been postponed for discussion until September. And there does seem to be an agreement, so that coal aid will not be provided and non-competitive mines will have to be closed before October 2014, I think it is.</p>
          <p>In Spain, apart from the aid within the electricity tariff, there are &#x20AC;900-odd million in the state budget for aid for mining regions. And if I understand it properly and I read about it in the newspaper, I believe that they want to put an end to this kind of aid, those that are provided through the state budget or those that are provided through the electricity bill.</p>
          <p>And in the specific case of the Royal Decree that they wanted to pass to provide incentives for the consumption of domestic coal, well, the discussion has again be postponed until September, because it seems that there is no unanimity or clarity in the approach of the community authorities. Would you like to comment on distribution, Jos&#xE9; Lu?</p>

          <p>Yes. This &#x2013; it's not only that, but they haven't recognized the investments of the divestitures of 2008 and what they should do is update the remuneration of 2009 and the investments of 2009 should update the remuneration of 2010. And all of this together, which would be the updating of 2009 with investments of 2009 and those of 2010 with those of 2008 and 2009. And in this manner it would be possible to generate an increase in income between <mark type="inaudible" /> million in the case of IBERDROLA and this is with data, data that have been released by the National Energy Commission when it revalidated its reference model.</p>

          <p>Would you talk &#x2013; could you say something about Latin America and provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as Latin America is concerned, the growth of the recurrent business in Brazil is something like 10 to 12% and basically this arises from 1.5% growth in demand plus a slight improvement in the margins of the distributor. We have some positive effects on the rates of exchange and although we have had some negative effects because of the sale of assets in Chile, that is not making contribution this year and some non-recurrent effects that have increased expenses relative to the previous year. But so that you can have an idea, the magnitudes of the businesses have produced growth of 10 to 12%, excluding all of those impacts in Brazil. And in Mexico, we also have the same growth, we &#x2013; it's something like 10.</p>
          <p>We've grown little bit less because of the negative rate of exchange and this has reduced the figure to eight. As regards provisions, well, if you remember, in the second &#x2013; or in the first semester of last year, rather, there was a reversal of provisions and that meant that the level of provisions was abnormally low in the first semester of 2009. So this year, we have a level of provision which is reasonable, but some non-recurrence, as we always do, but it's a reasonable level. But what happened is that last year, we had a number of reversals that have lowered the level of provisions.</p>
