          <p>Good morning everyone. My name is Henry St&#xE9;nson and I am going to be the moderator of this Quarterly Report from Ericsson. Special welcome to those of you who are listening in or watching our webcast. The event today is, as always, first a presentation made by both our CEO, Carl-Henric Svanberg, and our CFO, Hans Vestberg. After that, Qs and As until we are finished.</p>
          <p>So, having said that, please Carl-Henric, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Let me start with a couple of words on the second quarter in summary. We see stable business activity around the world with some variations. All business driven very much still by GSM much more than maybe we thought even a few years ago but also an accelerating demand for mobile broadband.</p>
          <p>The proportion on networks &#x2013; new network biz is still high and that puts pressure on margins and of course with accelerating India, that's even more accentuated. We had a very positive cash flow in the quarter, 8.5 billion. Hans will come back and talk more about it. We haven't seen really any reason to change our planning assumptions for a flattish mobile infrastructure market. And then of course we are affected by Sony Ericsson's breakeven result in the quarter.</p>
          <p>A couple of words on the network side in general. As I said very much GSM rollouts but also accelerating HSPA, but also much interest in LTE and this is going to be a different world going forward where we have three technologies existing in parallel. But it's also winning for the GSM wideband track where the migration is possible from GSM quite smoothly into LTE, and our latest launched base stations they are all upgradeable with certain software and hardware all the way.</p>
          <p>If we look at the number of subscribers, it's pretty impressive. 3.7 billion right now in the world subscriptions, up 170 million in the quarter which indicates the continued pretty healthy growth. When it comes to wideband, we are at 236 now which is up 31 in the quarter. That 31 if you go only a year back, it's almost double what the pace was a year ago.</p>
          <p>On the fixed side and the conversion side, there is a lot of IP focus obviously and the focus is driven by IP capabilities and IT technology that enables convergence as such. And here Redback technology is important for us, we are gradually integrating now Redback into our Research and Development in general in the company, building it into radio base stations and other products.</p>
          <p>If you look at the broadband take-up in the world, it's growing by 17 million per quarter, and we are now at 352, that we have a slower update, also that especially the &#x2013; after Q1. But overall, I would say a strong demand for broadband, whether it's fixed or whether it's mobile.</p>
          <p>If we look at Services, the interest is still strong for Managed Services, for obvious reasons, both for cost and for giving the operator a chance to focus on its customers.</p>
          <p>We have right now some 210 million subscribers under our management, which puts us on par with the very largest operators in the world. The split between high growth markets and mature markets, when it comes to Managed Services, is about fifty-fifty.</p>
          <p>What we are also are seeing, is that when in the past, it's been a lot about rolling out new networks and still is. But going forward, it will be much more about installed base, existing networks and how do we migrate them forward into the wanted positions and new technologies. And that means that the focus on Consulting Services, on Systems Integration, they are key components in defending our leading position in the world.</p>
          <p>There is also a pretty big efficiency potential, from one side what we have described many times in the leveraging synergies between what we do and what the operator is doing. But also in &#x2013; within Ericsson, where we can today do a lot of the work that we do in Managed Services, we can do offsite, which means that we can basically do it where it's most efficient, and we're building up resources for &#x2013; in low cost countries for doing this.</p>
          <p>If we look at the numbers in short, we ended up at 48.5, which is up 2%. If we look in constant currencies, the organic growth amounts to 7%. Still we have effects from the declining dollar, which if it stays now flat on this level, which it's been for a month, maybe that, it starts to even out.</p>
          <p>The operating income reached 4.7 billion. We should know that 0.2 of that is a capital gain from the enterprise PBX divestment. It gave us an operating margin of 9.7 and an EBITDA margin of 14.9. And Hans will come back and talk more about these numbers. Obviously, down from last year for the reasons, you know, one because of Sony Ericsson, but a slight positive trend from the work that is going on here.</p>
          <p>If we look at the cash flow 8.5, obviously, we have started to have good effects from all the activities we are doing in terms of &#x2013; terms and conditions, and efficiency in projects and so on. But as you will remember that we talked so much about before that it was the growth in the turnkey markets that we're building up working capital.</p>
          <p>And we said that when we start to have more balance in the growth there, also in turnkey markets, we will get more in balance also with cash flows. So that's another &#x2013; that's another effect, with also high growth in U.S.</p>
          <p>Just a couple of comments then on the various quarters. Western Europe is down 3%, but if we look also over a longer period of time here, basically flattish since a couple of years. And this is the region where we see the least of activities, the least of initiatives. The operator consolidation continues to impact projects and put projects and ideas and hold.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, there is a strong growth in the HSPA networks, traffic growth. I think this is obvious to us all. Capacity is still sufficient and as we said, we don't expect much of upgrades at least for this year.</p>
          <p>U.K. has been slow since Q3; Spain is also slow since some quarters. The strongest activity level is actually right now in the Nordic countries. And I am sure you all &#x2013; I am sure you all are working on various forms on wireless connections and the dongles and everything that are sold now in Sweden, as an example, closing into a million, is pretty impressive.</p>
          <p>If we look at the CIMA region, you can see the growth trends over the last three, four years, very much driven by mobile penetration still; beyond I guess every expectation that anybody had a few years ago.</p>
          <p>Generally, high activity level, both in 2G and in 3G rollouts. Africa is particularly strong here, soon 200 million subscribers in Africa, whereas Middle East and Eastern Europe is now slower. But the underlying business activity is good. We have declines here in Turkey and Saudi Arabia in particular in the quarter that affects us here.</p>
          <p>If we look at Asia-Pacific, which is also down 5%, this is more due to the comparison number last year. If you look at the trend, you can see that the growth trend continues. It's high business activity and especially in India, Pakistan, and Indonesia that's where we have a strongest growth for the time being. India for all the reasons we've talked about and soon being our biggest market.</p>
          <p>The comparison here with last year is very tough and that is primarily because China was very tough &#x2013; very, very high in the second quarter last year, but the growth rate is good.</p>
          <p>We also have Japan, which is down in this particular quarter, which is more being between projects here. We just as &#x2013; as we announced a few days ago, we have new launch expansion orders from Softbank coming in here. That should put Japan back on growth track, especially from the later part of the autumn.</p>
          <p>If we look at Latin America, 21% up you can see the trend how it's developed with a very strong fourth quarter last year, but generally throughout Latin America very strong demand for fixed and for mobile broadband. It is in the quarter particularly, Brazil and Mexico that are growing strongly, but it's also Chile as strong in relative terms, but being a smaller country. Good momentum in services throughout the region, lots of managers' services contracts and lots of such activities there.</p>
          <p>North America is probably the most encouraging number that we see in the report, between the regions 47% up, but again, here it's more of an easy comparison. The opposite of Asia and you can see the development how it accelerated at the later part of last year. It is very much driven from a demand for broadband services, whether it's mobile or whether it is fixed in the GPON rollouts. For us growth is very much driven by expansions and coverage projects on HSPA, so more of an easy comparison there.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will leave over to Hans. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl-Henric. Good morning to everybody. Let me go into the figures a little bit more in detail. First of all, I would like to say two things. The figures that I will comment on are excluding the restructuring that we made in the quarter, which are 1.8 and year-to-date 2.6. We have also another change, but that all &#x2013; only impacts two segments that we have decided to move the product IPX and micro-payment system between multi-media and services, so those two things are outlined there.</p>
          <p>So, starting with the growth, and as Carl-Henric said, we had a 2% growth in the quarter and in constant currency 7%. And of course that 7% indicating that we have the declining dollar impacting our result both on top and bottom line as it continues to decline.</p>
          <p>If we then talk about our gross margin ended up with 37%, which is, of course, a decline from last year's 43, given the business mix and the U.S. dollar basically, and then sequentially down since the first quarter. Here two things I think is important to mention, that India has accelerated in the quarter with the turnkey business, as we said in the first quarter, and we have also a more normal level of IPR and software sales in the quarter compared to the first quarter when we said that we had slightly higher. So those are two things.</p>
          <p>Then if we talk about the OpEx ended at 14 billion, which is sequentially slightly down. And of course we see some early indication of the cost adjustment programs that we are doing on the OpEx as it going &#x2013; as it's sequentially flat basically.</p>
          <p>If we come to the operating margins and they are up at 9.7%, which is sequentially on the same level, but then we need to remember that the contribution from Sony Ericsson in the second quarters is low, is a breakeven. And if we compare on the Ericsson level, it's an increase from 7.7 to 9.7.</p>
          <p>If we continue to look into the net income on 1.9, that includes the restructuring, that is the net income which consequently led to an earnings per share 0.60 or, which also includes the restructuring.</p>
          <p>Cash flow SEK 8.5 billion due to good collection and a continued good focus in our organization on cash flow. We managed to have stable working capital in between the first quarter and second quarter even though with the higher sales. Then we had also a positive development on other current liabilities that went up quite significantly and as you all know that includes refund, VAT accruals, advances from customers et cetera indicating, of course, that we have a lot of projects ongoing at same time and this might vary between quarters as you can see backwards as well. Anyhow it's a good cash flow in the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we then take segment by segment, starting with networks, network were down 1% in the quarter. Here again we need to stress that the dollar has an impact both on the top and bottom line. Network rollout continued to grow, grow some 11% in the quarter. And as we've said before we are taking the bigger portion of the Networks business, which, of course, are diluting the margins in the segment. We can see that we have more high proportion on new network build-out. We have an accelerating India in the second quarter, which will continue through the year. We believe that India will be the largest market in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We also had in this quarter as I mentioned earlier a more normal level on software and IPR sales, ending up an operating margin of 10% which sequentially is up slightly from the nine in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Multimedia ending on the 16% growth and here now divestment and acquisitions &#x2013; and acquisitions are basically balancing out. So, growth is 16% including the move of IPX. We had 10% sequential growth. We have an operating margin on minus one and here you need to remember that the 0.2 of the enterprise divestment is including here that we &#x2013; was announced earlier, so that was on line what we said.</p>
          <p>Anyhow, the underlying margin sequentially is improving. Here again, I need to stress that this might vary between quarters, where one quarter that is business that is actually investment areas with a low revenue, where three quarters that is actually business where we have good growth and normal margins. So, it might vary.</p>
          <p>We also feel that we have an encouraging trend on Tandberg and LHS, which are the larger acquisitions in the Multimedia segment, both are growing well and doing well in sort of the combined offerings for Ericsson.</p>
          <p>Ending up with a last segment, Professional Services; Growth of 7%, 11% when we adjusted for currency and as well the move of IPX. Here we should, of course, remember that the Hutch UK impact is included here. As you will remember in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we announced that we have restructured that contract which takes down our managed services sales. And the &#x2013; still the managed services sales was up 17%.</p>
          <p>We managed to sign some six new managed services deal in the quarter, whereby I would say Telef&#xF3;nica and Telcel are two very important ones in Latin America, which I would say Telcel and Telef&#xF3;nica are the major operators in the region. So, that we are very proud and happy for. Finally, we have also stable margins in the quarter. So, ending up at some 14%.</p>
          <p>All in all moving in to the cost reductions, just to remind you what we said before. 4 billion is our target of annual savings from 2009 with a restructuring charge of estimated some 4 billion. Second quarter was 1.8 billion in restructuring charges, in basically two areas, the first area is product and supply rationalizations where we have gone through our portfolio and of course both decided to close down, migrate and make some choices in our portfolio. And in supply the same doing &#x2013; looking through our tools and processes in the supply chain and see that we are going to be more efficient.</p>
          <p>Part of the product rationalization has consequences for our capitalized development and part is of course going through the provisions. Second part of the restructuring charge of 1.8 is related to lay-offs. Lay-offs in &#x2013; mainly in Western Europe, there are others as well, but mainly Western Europe, including the announced lay-offs that we did in the beginning of April this year in Sweden. All in all, leading to now charge of 2.6.</p>
          <p>I would conclude that the program is advancing as planned. We still have work to do, but it's going according to plan. Carl-Henric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So then three more slides and then we open up for questions. Sony Ericsson reported last week and they have spoken well for their situation. What we should remember is the slower market. They &#x2013; their strong foothold is Europe, especially middle to high-end and the European market according to Gartner is 16% down year-over-year.</p>
          <p>They are, on units shipped, basically on flattish level or down 2% and they have a breakeven result in this market that they explain. There is an activity program going on for restoring for this lower growth and for the situation that they have. We should remember that over the last three, four years, Sony Ericsson had a tremendous development growing 30-40%. And being today a twice as big company, as they were some years ago. So that has obviously created some growth pains here.</p>
          <p>The savings program has been introduced and it's overall a very challenging year for Sony Ericsson. When it comes to our planning assumptions, we haven't seen a reason to change those. We are planning for flattish mobile infrastructure market and we continue to see good growth in the professional services markets.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we still see industry fundamentals and consumer behavior that support a more positive long-term outlook when we look at the development that goes on in the broadband area and the use of telephony in societies.</p>
          <p>So in summary, it's challenging, but it's a stable environment. We are affected by the business mix. We are affected by the declining dollar. We had good growth in costs and currencies, driven for many reasons, but of particular interest, I think, is the growing demand here for broadband in general.</p>
          <p>Internally, a lot of focus on operational excellence. A lot of focus on execution and that goes right through our sales and &#x2013; sales and administration, the research and development and in operations.</p>
          <p>So that summarizes a little bit where we are and I will ask Henry to guide us through Q&amp;A and ask Hans to come up.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you very much. And now we'll open for questions. Who would like to start?  We always start slow and starting please, Jan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jan Dworsky from Handelsbanken. In terms of looking at the global macro environment and some parts of the world there are more challenges than others. Can you elaborate if you are seeing any and if you are getting &#x2013; sort of expecting to see some impact on the &#x2013; on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for now we can't say that we see anything. Our business, I guess, is a combination of our development of new technologies and new rollouts are happening, and also I am sure to some extent coupled to the GDP. If you look at U.S., you'll see the contradiction there with a very strong development and a lot of focus on new technologies and spectrum auctions and so on that we keep U.S. busy for a while. We haven't really seen any such impact in our industry. One could speculate that, in the longer run, if this financial crisis continues and even worsens and it starts to really affect consumers' purchasing power that eventually it may come back to the telecom industry. But that is not the scenario that we see and we have no signs in our own industry yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; China specifically over the Olympics, do you see any &#x2013; sort of, will Q3 be a period of less activity over the Olympics or should we factor anything like that in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly it will be less of activity. I think China has announced for almost any segment of its country it will be a slower quarter. We thought at least for a while that it would really be a slower quarter; I guess its balancing maybe a little bit better as it looks right now. But certainly China will be slower in every industrial segment in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next, Jan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jan Ihrfelt, Swedbank. I have a question on seasonality, if you see anything changing from the normal pattern in terms of seasonality in Q3, Q4? Or you &#x2013;  you mentioned China, will this have an impact on the seasonality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we don't guide separately for different quarters. So, I wouldn't go there and I have not &#x2013; we have nothing more to say about seasonality. We have it historically and then of course, over time, we will see what's happening in the third quarter, but nothing special to mention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second question on the business mix, do you see that the business mix will change dramatically in Q3 or in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I mentioned is that, of course, India is continuing to accelerate through the year, especially with their turnkey business they have. Others, I don't have any other indication of change on business mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess it is so that Europe is still slow, that hasn't changed. U.S. is accelerating. On the other hand Japan was a little bit down. So that sort of evens out. But if there has been anything that have surprised us, it's the &#x2013; rather the increase of a new network builds in emerging markets that we were <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We need a microphone here in front to start with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. David Halld&#xE9;n, Cheuvreux. First of all, a question on the managed services Bps, which was actually growing quite nicely in the quarter, good to see. Besides the two contract wins in Latin America, what other regions were affected by it, so there were four more contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are not disclosed, those contracts. They are spread evenly out in to the world. So those were not announced. The ones that were announced, they were Telef&#xF3;nica and Telcel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Follow-up question regarding the cost adjustment program; I know we're talking 2.6 billion year-to-date now. And I was just wondering has that had any impact on the consultants that you are use, and that you have? Or has it been more related to other fixed parts like employees? Is there a balance there? Or will it be a back-end loaded impact on the consultants? Just if you could put some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a mixture of all three of them. I mean, it's one portion which is own employees, one is consultants and as well a portion of product and sites and sort of everything that is, I would say, the surrounding infrastructure on that. I think we will see more so-called interaction and more people layoffs. So that is happening now throughout the third quarter and the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then also another question, the final question: looking at Europe, obviously a bit of a challenging market as you say, whether your &#x2013; the operator behavior and the pattern, etcetera.  But one thinks of the usage and you can't ignore the volumes that are running through the networks right now.  And we know that in the transmission networks, there are some bottlenecks in some areas.  But where do you see over the next sort of 12 months, or beyond, how these bottlenecks would evolve? Do you come to a point where operators are more or less forced to resolve some of these issues by doing upgrades or similar activities?  Just, if you could just elaborate a little bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that will obviously happen sooner or later that we come to those bottlenecks as we see they do in other markets as well.  With initial capacity, they can feel quite some traffic.  And then, initially, as we explained in the quarter, in the current market days when you also advance speeds, it brings also capacity in initial steps, then it doesn't.  So you will come to the point where we will have to start to upgrade, and that's why we said that generally we don't expect to see that in 2008.  But then it will start up in 2009.</p>
          <p>Then it depends a little bit on &#x2013; then it goes operator-by-operator.  In reality, in Austria, upgrades are already ongoing.  Others are standing right before upgrades, and others are still.  So that will be individual cases operator-by-operator, but it will come to that point.</p>

          <p>And in terms of the consolidation or the network sharing, do you think that we're sort of halfway through or do you think that there will be another big round or...?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think that's very hard to say and it's not necessarily for us to speculate over where the operator market is going to go.  But I mean if you look at U.S. being basically four operators today and we have 50 in Europe, it will consolidate. But before we are at the end point that could be 10 years from now.  But every time there is such a consolidation move &#x2013; now France Telecom was in the discussing with Italia for a while, you have Deutsche Telekom being in Greece, you have Telefonica in Italy and so on. These things tend to put things on hold -- but we really think they are basically fundamentally good.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Mats Nystr&#xF6;m from SEB Enskilda.  Looking at the networks operating margin of 10%, it was up a little bit from 9.2 in Q1.  And there was lot of discussion about IPR revenues there, but anyhow you confirmed that there was exceptional high such revenue.  So 100 high sequential sales explaining the high margin; on the other hand, both of you are talking a lot about increasing sales to India. So please could you help us to understand the dynamics on which was the most important driving factor for the sequential increase in network operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mix and I think that we mentioned three of them, you mentioned two of them yourself, which is impacting the mix.  But also the OpEx level is sequentially flat, which has an impact on networks with a sequential higher sales.  So, those combinations together makes that margin to come up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the, a little bit of same note, cash flow &#x2013; you've explained there was perhaps a better balance between the turnkey projects and other markets like America, on the other hand also continue stressing that India will continue increasing its share of sells and turnkey rollouts are also accelerating.  So, I don't really get it. So &#x2013; is the conclusion that we should really look at U.S. sales, for example, to determine future cash flow and operating margin? Is that dominating over the negative factors, so to speak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We should not &#x2013; I think that of course the U.S. is an entirely different type of market having different type of projects. So, but we should not draw a conclusion on a certain market in a certain quarter. We had a cash conversion in this quarter 193%, and of course, that is difficult to judge from one quarter, you need to see it over time here.</p>
          <p>But of course the mix of different countries &#x2013; but not only that, the mix of different type of projects, is important for the cash flow depending how we build it. We still have a lot to do on cash flow. We are very focused on seeing that terms and conditions will improve over time, that we can see that we unleashed a capital much earlier in the process on the large projects. And there we still have a lot to do. So when it comes to certain elements on the working capital they will factor it between quarters. And now see somewhat positive progress on it, but we feel we have lot to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But on balance then looking forward again, stating that India will accelerate rapidly here, what's your &#x2013; how should we interpret that in that case? The net effect on operating margin is going to be down, flat or no impact...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't guide on it. But, of course, as the infra &#x2013; the turnkey business in India is growing, and that's where the most challenging competition has been when we came in there. Yes, of course that will have an impact on our margins going forward. I'm not giving any particular number or something, but that will have an impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I finally touch on services and there was a healthy increase in the operating margin from 12.4 to 14. Is that this &#x2013; I mean this is way close to this total 15% level. So question obviously is, is this kind of the level to look for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that I mean depending again, as we've said in the first quarter, it depends a little bit on what type of mix we have in the quarter and how much new managed services we are starting off. That will actually vary on the operating margin. But we are striving to keep sales staying at this level. But it will be impacted quarter by quarter depending how much new managed services we take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was there any kind of one-time cost still in Q2, as referred in Q1 from the managed services contract...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Jan Dworsky from Handelsbanken, again. In terms of the R&amp;D forecast for the full year. Based on the performance in the second quarter, are you more or less confident to get to the 30.5 or double the second half run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have not changed the guidance. So that means that I believe we can handle it within the range that we have said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we saw &#x2013; excluding restructuring costs, provisions being substantially higher in the second quarter, being charged to the P&amp;L and also utilized. Is that a function of where the business is taking place geographically, or is it sort of technology wise or &#x2013; and how should we look upon that coming into the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that first of all we have talked a lot about provisions and that should of course reflect the situation when we closed the second quarter with the type of projects, the technology we have out, and the type of countries that we are delivering to.</p>
          <p>The business mix in the second quarter, of course, then required a little bit higher provisions than earlier. So that is your, sort of, reflection from it. We have a very thorough process for it. So we just continue with it. Giving guidance for the future we don't do on provisions. I think each will reflect the best &#x2013; the right situation in each and every quarter depending on the customer, country and phone literacy that we have, which changes in quarters and will depend on what's happening in some countries where we are working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Work in progress increased quite substantially in the second quarter in most part of inventories, should we see that as an indication of sort of lot of activity or sort of as a guide for revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the inventory goes up, and of course there are &#x2013; and there are some things that's going to be delivered in the future. So, of course, it indicates that activity level is quite high. Then, when it comes and how it comes in different quarters, that's more difficult to say. But yes, higher inventory level indicates higher activities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jan Ihrfelt, Swedbank. Two questions actually. The first one is on Sony Ericsson and do you think it's still possible to achieve double-digit margins in that business, the first question. And the second question is related to China and do you still see growth for this year in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we &#x2013; if we start of with Sony Ericsson, it's not for us to comment on where they &#x2013; what their envisions are. Those questions are to be put to the management team in <mark type="inaudible" />. But I think we at least should &#x2013; that I guess we can comment that when you look at their development on the success they have had over the last years, I think we have to conclude that they cannot with their market share hit right every time with the markets and the products that they are launching. There is nothing fundamentally changed in their strength and the position that they have. But the question should be put to them.</p>
          <p>When it comes to China, we &#x2013; I believe that we have already concluded that China was so good growth, and also have said that before in the interviews, and we expect that China will show growth this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Anyone else? Okay. Then I think we are through with the Qs and As. Thank you very much. And we proceed with the interviews as scheduled.</p>
