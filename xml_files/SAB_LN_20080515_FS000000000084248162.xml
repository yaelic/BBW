          <p>Welcome to the SABMiller Fiscal Year 2008 Annual Results Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to SABMiller. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day, everyone. My name is Malcolm Wyman, and I am the Chief Financial Officer of SABMiller Plc, and I welcome you to our results presentation for the financial year ending 31st of March 2008.</p>
          <p>First, as is customary, I must highlight that today's presentation will include forward-looking statements, which reflect our outlook at this time. Such statements are subject to a range of factors and risks, may not reflect our view in future, and are unlikely to be updated outside of our normal reporting and seminar calendar.</p>
          <p>And now, on to today's presentation, I will cover our financial highlights, and then Graham will take you through our strategic and operational progress.</p>
          <p>Firstly, it's been another good year for the Group, with adjusted earnings per share up 19% in United States dollar. This is the fifth year in the last six that we have reported double-digit earnings per share growth. And our compound annual growth rate over this period is in excess of 20%, tripling our adjusted earnings per share since the 2001/2002 financial year.</p>
          <p>Annual dividend for the year has been increased 16% to U.S.$0.58 per share and is covered 2.5 times by adjusted earnings per share. As in previous years, the focus of my presentation will be on underlying performance on an organic constant currency basis, as we believe this continues to most accurately reflect our underlying business performance.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the key drivers of our results. Total volumes for the year were in excess of 287 million hectoliters, an organic increase of some 6.3%. Lager volumes were up strongly, 7.2%, ahead of the prior year on an organic basis. This growth remains consistent with our long-term objective of growing our volumes in excess of the growth rate of the beer market.</p>
          <p>Our two key organic constant currency measures, revenue and EBITA, were up 10% and 9%, respectively. Although the organic EBITA margin reduced slightly, the Group did well to maintain the reported EBITA margin in the face of significant input cost increases. This performance reflects a number of key characteristics across our businesses.</p>
          <p>Firstly, significant price and mix gains, reflecting the strength of our brands, frontline pricing, and good revenue management. Secondly, input cost pressures, principally on malt and hops. An upfront investment in future growth, particularly capacity expansion, but also brand support and sales capability. And finally, a focus on productivity and also cost management.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency revenue increased 9.6%, with 6.3% of the increase attributable to volume and a significant 3.3% relating to price and mix gains. In the second half, strong price-mix gains of 5.7% were delivered. We have achieved strong organic constant currency revenue per hectoliter growth across our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we have obtained an increase of 4% on a like-for-like basis, with both pricing and mix benefits more than offsetting the negative impact of price competition in Peru. In Europe, we achieved an increase of 4% with signs of the pricing environment improving and also from positive brand mix.</p>
          <p>North America, Miller achieved an industry leading increase of 4% domestically, assisted by the continued migration of the brand portfolio to higher margin brands. In Africa we achieved a substantial increase, whilst in Asia our associate, CR Snow, put through a price increase in the last quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>However, in South Africa revenue growth was constrained by adverse mix effects in lager driven by the swing out of higher priced premium sales into mainstream sales. But, however, was still approximately 4% per hectoliter.</p>
          <p>Before dealing with each division, I would like to cover briefly the impact of commodity costs on our profitability, which has had an effect on all of our divisions. Input cost pressures have been significant in the past year. Most notably there have been substantial increases in the market prices of malt, barley and hops. The price of malt and barley has more than doubled in the last two years, whilst the price of hops has increased by 7 to 10 times over the same period with a significant spike in the last 12 months in particular.</p>
          <p>However, the impact of this on our profitability has been tempered through supplier contracts for future requirements and an active hedging program combined with selected investment where appropriate in local agricultural infrastructure. For example, we have invested in developing barley farming in Africa and India underpinning our supply in these areas.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, the impact of the input cost increases has been more muted with total raw material costs increasing 9% per hectoliter in constant currency. Our total cost of goods sold per hectoliter, which includes other variable costs is up about 6% on the same basis reflecting the lower cost pressures we experienced in other variable costs.</p>
          <p>I will now focus on our regions dealing with specific issues impacting organic constant currency performance. Firstly in Latin America, our lager volume grew 5% on the prior year despite high comparative volume growth. In constant currency revenue growth was 10%.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency EBITA growth was 6% and EBITA margin was down some 70 basis points. Although this included a 40 basis point negative impact because of a change in treatment of the recovery of local distribution costs, effectively now charged as costs instead of treated as a discount to revenue and thus has had no affect on EBITA.</p>
          <p>The full year deterioration in margin is lower than the decline we reported for the six months to September, reflecting both brand launches in the first half and also a significant focus on productivity and cost containment, which has reaped benefits on the second half of the financial year. Significant investment continued in the region to increase capacity, modernize infrastructure and also upgrade returnable containers.</p>
          <p>Europe delivered another excellent result with an 8% increase in organic volumes. A 13% increase in organic constant currency revenue and a 15% increase in organic constant currency EBITA. Pricing combined with productivity improvements have more than offset higher input costs and organic EBITDA margin was up 40 basis points. Volumes were particularly strong in Poland, Romania and Russia. And we continue to invest in capacity expansion to meet consumer demand and take advantage of growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Results have been very strong at Miller Brewing Company, benefiting from good pricing, the successful launch of Miller Chill and growth in Miller Lite. As a consequence, domestic net revenue per barrel is up an industry leading 4% and EBITDA is strongly ahead.</p>
          <p>EBITA for the year has been boosted by the resolution of a dispute with our can supplier, which resulted in a one-time payment to Miller of $70 million, part of which is due to our contract-brewing partners. 16 million of the settlement relates to benefits that in the normal course of business would have accrued in the second half of our financial 2007 year. And $17 million of the benefits of the settlement relate to a contractual change to our agreement with that can supplier.</p>
          <p>We have therefore adjusted these items on the slide to reflect this in order to present a meaningful underlying comparison. As a result EBITA shows growth of 13% on an underlying basis, same as that at the half year.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio of businesses in Africa continues to show significant EBITA growth and margins increased not withstanding rising investment and input costs. Our Asia businesses continue to grow strongly, input cost pressures diluted margins. However, pricing has been taken in the Chinese market in the last quarter, and we would expect this to impact margins beneficially going forward.</p>
          <p>The ongoing success of our portfolio of businesses in both regions, we continue to invest in capacity to support our growth prospects. With Greenfield developments in Tanzania, Angola and Mozambique and further investment in India where we are already capacity constrained.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, lager volumes were in line with the prior year notwithstanding the termination of our Amstel license, which contributed 9% of total sales volume in the prior financial year. Revenue growth was also impacted by the loss of this brand, which enjoyed a premium price point.</p>
          <p>The total impact on EBITA of the loss is estimated to be approximately $50 million for the financial year, less than the $80 million originally anticipated as the brand was re-introduced into the market later in the year that organically anticipated. EBITA was further impacted by higher raw material and distribution cost increases.</p>
          <p>Having reviewed the performance of each of our divisions I would now like to focus on the contribution of those to the Group. As you can see from this slide we now have three major divisions which each account for more than 20% of our total EBITA, Latin America, Europe and South Africa beverages.</p>
          <p>Our Africa and North America regions have also increased their share of our overall EBITA and with significant growth in all our regions outside South Africa. South Africa Beverages is for the first time no longer our biggest division. Latin America now producing the biggest proportion of our EBITA.</p>
          <p>This slide also illustrates the significant progress that has been made in developing a balanced portfolio of businesses, with a good balance of exposure to different currencies, economies and also growth prospects.</p>
          <p>Moving to Group financial considerations. Group EBITDA, which excludes a number of non-cash items and is also stated on a post exceptional basis was up 12%, and EBITDA margin declined by 50 basis points. There was a net working capital outflow of $242 million across the Group, mainly as a result of outflows in Latin America and Europe, with higher receivables from the Easter period, the most significant factor. Our ongoing objective remains to keep working capital at least neutral, despite increases in our underlying volume of business.</p>
          <p>Net cash flow from operations was 3% above the prior year, with the working capital outflow and a significant increase of 21% in cash tax paid due to timing considerations being the significant contributors.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure was $2.034 billion as we invest particularly in capacity and containers across the businesses to support future growth. Prevailing weakness of the U.S. dollar, especially against European and Latin American currencies, also played a part in contributing to the overall increase.</p>
          <p>The Group effective tax rate was 32.5%, 200 basis points lower than that achieved in the 2007 financial year, principally reflecting a more favorable geographic mix of profits across the Group, some local statuary rate reductions and ongoing initiatives to manage our effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased significantly in the current year, largely as a result of the financing of the acquisition of Grolsch and 2 billion of investment in capital expenditure. Our financial structure, however, remains strong with gearing still below 50% and net debt to EBITDA of two times. The only major refinancing in the period was of $230 million of short-term Rand borrowings with a five-year Rand bond. We have also replaced some of our commercial paper with longer-term borrowings. Our finance costs in the current year, $456 million include credits totaling $35 million, which relate to mark-to-market adjustments on items for which hedge accounting cannot be applied.</p>
          <p>The amount of $491 million on this slide adjusts for these credits, resulting in an effective increase in finance costs of 15% over the prior financial year. This benefit of $35 million has been excluded from the determination of adjusted earnings per share. Our average interest rate at year-end has decreased slightly to 7.3%, mainly due to a significant portion of our debt being in United States dollars, which has benefited from declining U.S. dollar interest rates.</p>
          <p>Moving to our financial outlook, the following comments are based on the inclusion of Miller Brewing Company for a full year and do not take account of any adjustments that may be necessary should the proposed MillerCoors joint venture proceed. We expect our finance costs to increase again in the 2009 financial year, principally reflecting our higher net debt position and the balance of currencies reflected in this.</p>
          <p>We anticipate our tax rate will be in the region of 31.5% to 32% next year, marginally lower than that in the 2008 financial year as we expect to benefit from the lowest statutory tax rates I mentioned earlier in certain of our countries and ongoing tax planning initiatives to reduce our effective tax rate. We believe that our effective tax rate will be sustainable at this lower level, and we will be continuing our tax management initiatives to reduce this rate further. The prices of malt, barley and hops have spiked in the past year, and this will continue to exert pressure on our brewing raw material costs.</p>
          <p>In addition, energy prices continue to rise and will similarly impact other input costs. However, much of our 2009 financial year brewing raw materials requirements have been covered, which will mitigate the cost increases. We expect total raw material cost per hectoliter in constant currency to increase by low double-digits and total COGS per hectoliter &#x2013; that's cost of goods sold &#x2013; to increase by high single-digits. However, as in the past year, we will expect that we will be able to achieve price increases and mix benefits to offset the expected rise in these input costs.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect our capital expenditure in the next financial year to remain broadly around the level of the 2008 financial year, and we continue to invest for long-term growth across the Group. 2008 and 2009 financial years are expected to reflect the peak of this capital investment cycle and we would then expect capital expenditure to begin to moderate thereafter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Malcolm. This is Graham Mackay. Good morning to all of you joining the webcast. Clearly, fiscal '08 was a strong year despite a few headwinds and one that was even more impressive coming on the back of several very strong years that preceded it. Things that I think were key features of our results include significant organic market share gains across our Europe and Asian businesses, accelerated growth in Africa, continued progress in Latin America with our programs to transform the beer category being rolled out notwithstanding some short-term challenges.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our strategy has been successful on all fronts. Building brand value, exploiting growth opportunities and stepping up profitability, positioning us well for MillerCoors, a JV which if regulatory clearance is received will be transformational and highly synergistic.</p>
          <p>More broadly the Group has recorded underlying revenue growth over the past several years, which leads our global FMCG peer group and is well ahead of the average. Underlying all this growth and enabling its continuity is a substantial program of investment across the Group, which demonstrates our confidence in our prospects over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Our focus on building leading brands, local, mainstream and worthmore brands, and managing the strongest full brand portfolios in each market has been successful in driving revenues and profits and growing organic market share. We're now seeing the fruits of our labors come through in higher unit revenue growth as well as volumes.</p>
          <p>Quite simply stronger brands can sustain firmer pricing, whether such price growth is clearly visible or more subtle, for example, through price management across a pack range. Tabled, you can see on the slide highlights our largest brands in a range of key markets illustrating our success across the board in achieving growth in revenue ahead of volumes.</p>
          <p>As a result our revenue per hectoliter growth has been strong across our divisions. As you can see here shown in organic constant currency terms. This is helping to cover the input cost rises facing the industry of which you are now familiar. In our case, overall cost of goods per hectoliter rose by 6% in FY '08 led by brewing and packaging materials costs that were by 9%.</p>
          <p>The colored boxes on the slide indicate for each division whether the dollar value of our price and mix gains have exceeded or just covered or fallen short of the dollar value of our unit cost increases. It is worth remembering that we and the market generally think of commodity prices in U.S. dollars whereas we operate in many other currencies. So the level of impact we feel from commodities in a regional P&amp;L varies with the relative strength of its currencies.</p>
          <p>Overall, of course it's good to see largely green and yellow, with the green for the Group denoting a positive net dollar impact on EBITA from price mix and unit costs or combined. Whilst, it's true that industry's cost pressures are likely to be more pronounced in calendar 2008 than in 2007. It's also approved that the revenue per hectoliter growth figures you see here reflect many price increases that were taken only in the second half of FY '08. So their full favorable annualized effect will come in FY '09.</p>
          <p>Further supporting our top-line growth, our innovation programs have accelerated over the past year. Starting in the U.S., these range from Miller Chill, which has exceeded its targets in an excellent first year, capitalizing on premiumization and Latinization in the U.S. to the new Miller Lite Brewers Collection and the rollout of new Leinenkugel's variants and Sparks.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the Redd's brand has been a product of innovation, the Russian variant you see here on slide is a unique beer customized for female consumers in a sleek perfume-inspired bottle. New packages and dispense equipment like these are also driving sales. In fact, 35% of last year's volumes in Europe were derived from product and package innovations over the past three years.</p>
          <p>And in South Africa where the launch of Hansa Marzen Gold has helped protect our local worthmore share and other new innovations include Sarita aimed specifically at working women and Skelters for the trendy young adult set. In the building of a meaningful local worthmore segment in Latin America with new packaging for Club Colombia, for example, and innovation in Africa to create appealing products at more affordable price points such as Eagle Extra, which you can see on the slide, and Baron's.</p>
          <p>Taken together all of those represents a more vigorous approach to innovation than has been the case in the past. Another key focus has been building and leveraging our geographic footprint. FY '08 saw a continuation of this progress across the Group, most notably of course the agreement of Molson Coors to form the MillerCoors JV, which is poised to strengthen our U.S. business and its economic returns. This was followed by our purchase of Grolsch, which a powerful addition to our international worthmore portfolio. Its rich Northern European heritage complements our existing international brands and brings new opportunities across our markets.</p>
          <p>Our smaller bolt-on expansions continued with the purchase of Browar Belgia in Poland and Sarmat just last week in Ukraine. And in China with carefully chosen acquisitions to complement our organic market share gains.</p>
          <p>As acquisitions have become more expensive in many markets, it can be more value creating to build new breweries and we have a number of Greenfield projects underway, more on this later. And we are successfully implementing a new premium led business model in selected mature markets, most notably here in the UK, Germany and now in Australia.</p>
          <p>Turning from those strategic themes to the resulting specifics. The Group's organic volume growth of 7% has been gratifying. Performances in FY '08 in Europe, Africa and Asia have been particularly strong, exceeding our medium-term growth expectations. While the U.S. delivered towards the upper end of expectations, Latin America built further on a high base from the prior year while our beer business in South Africa did well holding its volumes notwithstanding the loss of a significant brand at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>The extraordinary growth that we reported for the second half last year formed an usually high base for us on which we built in FY '08's second half. This is quite a profound effect, taking the growth reported in the three quarters which formed the comparative base for the period FY '08 quarter three, through to FY '09 quarter one, where we are right now. And setting that growth against our previously announced medium-term expectations, as you can see on this slide illustrates how extraordinary our comps are at the moment. As you can see in the table, the right growth over that nine-month period was between double and triple of our normal expectations, across the board other than for Miller, which has since improved its performance. Favorable weather, booming emerging markets and our own market share gains drove that growth.</p>
          <p>So in summary, our current run rate should be seen in those context and we expect our growth drivers to outlive the tough comps.</p>
          <p>Now turning to each of our divisions. Europe continues to be a successful microcosm of the Group's model, both in its implementation of strategy and in its competitive strength. Double-digit growth in Poland, Russia and Romania has been accompanied by sustained top line success in Italy, with very strong growth for our largest brands in each country. 360 degree marketing has been deployed with increasing consistency and effectiveness to strengthen our brands as you heard from Alan Clark and Chris Ritchie in their seminar a few months ago.</p>
          <p>From advertising to online media experiential programs, innovative point-of-sale activation. This work is winning market share for us in each of our largest six markets, as you can see in the table. The integration of growth is proceeding apace both for the Dutch business within our European management structure and for the brand globally with an international team to help drive the brand sales in SABMiller markets including as of this week, the U.S. and Australia.</p>
          <p>Amidst all this, robust price growth has been realized, as we capitalize on the strength of our brands with EBITA margins maintained last year, despite the higher input costs. In Latin America, our prior year comps were particularly challenging and this was compounded this year by floods and an earthquake in Colombia and Peru respectively.</p>
          <p>While strong revenue and cost management delivered the profit growth in FY '08 it's also worth putting the regions' underlying volume growth in perspective. The table here displays the per capita beer consumption in our three largest countries. In each case the consumption growth seen since our entry into the region is striking with more growth projected over the next few years. Of course this growth won't simply be served up to us. It will require sustained, detailed implementation of our operating strategies. These are well underway and I am confident that we will continue to succeed, the improving category appeal, increasing share of alcohol, through clearer market segmentation, enhanced brand portfolios and more efficient and effective selling and distribution.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding slower consumer spending in Colombia and increased competition in Peru where our market share has been rising again lately. We see excellent continued prospects for volume and profit growth in Latin America. And in the U.S., profit growth has been driven by volumes, pricing, mix improvements and cost savings, firing on all cylinders really. Alongside upper single digit increases in marketing investment, better marketing, strong product and package innovation, fast growth in worthmore and industry leading price growth, indeed at twice the rate of the industry leader as you can see in the table, characterize the improved health of the Miller business.</p>
          <p>The business hasn't been without its challenges including the management of price caps, with competition and between market segments. Less on-premise traffic in a softer economy and following some recent smoking bans are also factors. But its underlying strength and its progress in strategy implementation position us well as does Coors' recent success as we approach the transformational MillerCoors joint venture.</p>
          <p>We are hoping for a favorable outcome to the regulatory process and that we will be able to close the transaction in mid 2008. In the meantime, our integration planning process is underway with as many business functions included as are allowed under the gun jumping regulations that govern mergers prior to clearance.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we are confident that we will able to retain the best talent and the best practices &#x2013; business practices from Miller and Coors in the JV and indeed to take opportunities for creating new best practice. Opportunities afforded by the process of building a fit for purpose organization with many of the strongest brands in the English beer industry.</p>
          <p>Our economic returns and our ability to invest in our brands would both be enhanced very significantly by this transaction. And as we've outlined previously, we believe that the transaction offers the prospect of greater choice for consumers and a healthy business for retailers and distributors.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, the business delivered performance ahead of our expectations in F08 as you heard from Malcolm. As you know we effectively started the year 9% down on prior following the termination of the Amstel license and you will recall that we said we expected to retain roughly half of that volume within our own expanding brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>Against this, the results have been satisfactory rather than 4% down, the business retained all its volumes, growing in the first half and then 2% down in the second half while the industry grew, but became more competitive.</p>
          <p>In recent months, our market share has stabilized at approximately 90%. Although, the full annualized impact of the increased competition, will only be seen in F09. It's early days in the implementation of a new brand and S&amp;D strategies, that Tony van Kralingen described in our last South Africa seminar. But our mainstream volume growth, following our major bottle replacement program, Castle Lite's rapid growth and the successful launch of Hansa Marzen Gold all bode well.</p>
          <p>There is more to come in the brand portfolio. There are considerable cost headwinds this year, none of which are new to you. Input costs compounded by the weaker rand, more marketing, the new packaging and investment in selling and distribution ahead of the Shebeen licensing process.</p>
          <p>But we are confident of the fundamental outlook for the business in an industry that's again proving its resilience. With continued healthy revenue growth despite higher interest rates, slower retail sales and well publicized infrastructure constraints, which in fact are only having a minor impact on the beer business. All in all, we retain a solid position in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Across the rest of Africa, the strong economic and business performances that we have seen appear sustainable. The fundamentals driving growth are at an early stage of what may be a long positive run for the continent as seen in our key markets of Tanzania and Mozambique, which continue to expand rapidly despite tough comparators.</p>
          <p>Growth in Botswana has also been excellent following renovation of the St Louis brand and the launch of new returnable packaging, which you can see on the screen. And laudable performance continues from our Castel partners across many markets. You recently heard from Mark Bowman the renewed optimism we have in Africa and our confidence in the initiatives we are pursuing to capture all opportunities from economic growth in full brand portfolio management, excellent point-of-sale execution, employing the skills and processes that have been so successful in Europe and elsewhere to sustain our long-term growth in Africa.</p>
          <p>In China, we have extended our lead, with market share now 18% and the Snow brand showing the way in the industry's growth and consolidation.</p>
          <p>Our national footprint continues to grow mainly organically, warranting a number of Greenfield investment besides a few selected acquisitions, recent industrywide price increases of nearly 10% will in the short-term help cover commodity costs but, more importantly, bode well for future profitability.</p>
          <p>In India, we're achieving further growth of over 20% with a stronger brand portfolio including the Fosters operation, which has now been integrated into our business. Overburdening regulations is still a constraint and we remain poised to invest significantly as growth opportunities appear.</p>
          <p>And in Australia momentum from Peroni and a very successful launch of Miller Chill has led to the recent decision by SABMiller and Amatil to build a Greenfield brewery to support future growth. Bluetongue was also acquired enhancing our portfolio with strong local cross brands.</p>
          <p>Finally, as I stated at the outset, looking across the SABMiller business, we're investing very substantially to expand production capacity following our recent rapid growth, demonstrating our confidence that healthy growth will continue over the medium and long-term. Picture on the lower left here is of our new Varley Brewery in Western Colombia. Our investment is also taking the form of new bottle pools and trade CapEx, particularly fridges, to enhance and grow the beer category. These are high growth, high return investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>Full bottle replacement programs are noteworthy in Latin America and in South Africa. On the left in the slide is Colombia, an example of our upgraded packaging, on the right are our new quart bottle lines on a filling line in South Africa. And above that the picture that appears is a small brown mountain of some sort, is a small portion of many tones of crushed glass from the older, now retired and recycled bottle pool, very substantial physical operations to replace this.</p>
          <p>The map you see here illustrates broadly how these investments are spread. They are largely in markets where we already have a strong presence, deep consumer insights and a good feel for the beer markets' development. And we test these insights in stringent review processes to vet our CapEx proposals ensuring adequate returns relative to the risk in each market. The pace of our investment is peaking in the fiscal '08 and '09 period beyond which our spending should moderate in relative &#x2013; if not in absolute terms.</p>
          <p>And so to conclude, SABMiller's volume growth has been strong driven by a focus on and investment in building leading brand equities and winning local portfolios, that are the most desired and the most profitable in their markets. In the current year volume growth in the first half will be affected by high comparative growth rates and pressure on input costs will continue to increase. But pricing and mix benefits are again expected to compensate for these cost increases.</p>
          <p>Most of the economies in which we operate are enjoying robust growth albeit with rising inflation particularly food inflation. This has both negative and positive ramifications. Discretionary spending does moderate when wallets are hit by inflation in stable goods such as food. However beer sales often remain quite resilient in these circumstances if properly managed and inflation can be quite helpful in accommodating beer price increases. This is useful in the current commodity cost environment, indeed covering global input cost rises would be much more difficult if local CPI were low. And finally our confidence in our future growth prospects is being evidenced by our significant quantum investments across the business.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys. It's Philip Morrisey from Citi. Could I ask first of all, please just to clarify on the profile of CapEx, you flagged, obviously fiscal '09 being peak and I just wonder what the trajectory of the subsequent decline in CapEx was going to be? Please. Secondly, on South African Beverages reasonably sharp margin decline in the second half, I wonder whether that was the run rate that we should expect for the first half of the new fiscal year? And thirdly, I appreciate uncertainties regarding COGS, you've always given us guidance for the current fiscal year until your hedges were off and on the presumption that current swap rates hold would it be fair to assume that as you going into fiscal '10, that COGS' number would accelerate or decelerate versus the high single digit guidance that you've given for this fiscal year? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>This is Graham. Let me give some answers and I'll ask Malcolm to contribute. We obviously are in fiscal '09 right now so we have a very close idea of the CapEx commitments, more than idea we know what CapEx commitments are for fiscal '09. Fiscal '10 does show a decline but I think it would be misleading to quote you any sort of numbers because a lot of that depends on current trading and it depends on projects which are not approved and so to talk about F10 CapEx we're really relying on strategic plan projections conducted nine months ago now and I don't think they're particularly authoritative so what we see is F08 and F09 at roughly the same sort of level in CapEx as you heard and we do see a tail off in F10 of perhaps several hundred million a year, perhaps even more, but we haven't really quantified that with any confidence yet. So please bear that in mind.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The run rate in South Africa I think it's little bit early to call to use or again misleading to use the second half as a projection for the first half of this year. Remember that the first half of this year, Amstel was not in full supply in the markets so we are still cycling that those comparatives where Amstel was in very limited supply if at all in the market, actually. So I don't think that we'll be able to really get a full picture before the second half of this year. But in the meantime there are a lot of other moving parts of course, we'll be launching Grolsch later in the year. We're working very hard on our own brand portfolio. So, I think that linear projections would not tell us very much and we have to look at the situation on the ground. On the COGS number I think perhaps we'll just ask Malcolm to respond to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Philip, on the COGS numbers we did give you some guidelines for F09 but of course they are as we've said they are rough numbers we've covered forward we do know a large part of our volume. It's covered, but of course it depends on the volume growth of the business and whether we have to go into the market. So, we've given you guidelines for F09 as far as F010 is concerned we would expect that if the prices stay roughly where they are now, yes we do have some hedges in place, but if there is no increase in input cost themselves then the extent of our hedges coming off would not cause F10 to increase at a significant rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Look to &#x2013; if I can just clarify on Graham's comment on CapEx, of course it's a complex subject because there's cash flow and there's commitment and so as you go forward, it just doesn't fall off on the first day of the New Year. So, we would expect over the course of F10 by the time we get to F10 the run rate will be falling off a lot quicker than it will in the beginning so for the full year of F10 we wouldn't expect to see it come down in a major way. Because your project cycle comes down almost like a hill as opposed to a sharp drop.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's Chris Pitcher from Redburn. If I could follow up on the comments on South Africa, could you just give us a feel for whether you've pulled forward significantly investment in distribution ahead of Heineken opening up a brewery and when that pressure margin will be in the base, and similarly on glass costs on A&amp;P investment just to get a feel for when that will be in the base? And then following on in terms of South Africa obviously it was one market where pricing was not put up at the rate of inflation. I was wondering if you can give us a feel for the outlook there? And then finally on the tax rate you've kindly given us guidance at the range for next year, I was wondering if this includes any tax benefit from the Grolsch deal coming through yet or whether we can expect further a significant step down thereafter? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, let me take some of these and again ask Malcolm to comment. The investment in distribution is not really driven really by anything to do with the Heineken or Amstel situation, we have been seeking to institute direct store distribution as the licensing situation in the townships has normalized. So the constraint or the determinant of the pace of that is essentially licensing, pure and simple, not the Heineken picture. And we expect that to continue still for many years. As you may know the pace of licensing varies quite dramatically from province to province in South Africa, and it's certainly not all that fast. So we're doing at a &#x2013; we're putting in direct distribution as fast we practically can, but it's driven by the considerations.</p>
          <p>Your glass cost question, I'm afraid, I didn't understand. Could you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've been importing glass into South Africa, because of limited capacity in South Africa. The major glass producer in South Africa is bringing on new capacity, I was just wondering when you'll able to source more glass locally for nonreturnables, whether that pressure starts to alleviate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, that's absolutely right, it does start to be alleviated this year. So we don't see as proportionately anything like the glass import programs this year that we had to face last year. But &#x2013; and remember of course that the glass situation was hugely exacerbated by the fact of our returnable bottle pool replacement. And that comes to an end as we go into the summer now. So the supply situation locally should ease quite a lot.</p>
          <p>As far as local pricing is concerned, we are obviously conscious of affordability considerations in South Africa, which is an emerging market. We have priced quite tight over the last little while in South Africa, and that contributes to the numbers you've seen. I think it's helped keep volumes reasonably healthy, but you have to remember that there is essentially a different dynamic between mainstream pricing, which dominates our overall pricing numbers, and premium pricing. Mainstream pricing is essentially done with affordability and volume in mind and premium pricing is very much more opportunity based and competition based. I would anticipate that we will keep mainstream pricing very much under the spotlight because of the importance of affordability for some time to come.</p>
          <p>Malcolm, you'd like to talk to the tax question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as far as the tax rate is concerned, we have given that guidance of a lower rate going into F09, the gross situation doesn't really impact it too much, because as you know given the size of the Group's profits, the profit that comes in with Grolsch and any tax benefits arising from that would be reasonably small. But we continue to work right around the globe on all of our tax planning, and Grolsch will now just fit into that and become part of the tax planning going forward into F10.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Malcolm and Graham, Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Two questions for you, first one Graham, I noticed that on the Bloomberg, you had commented that we may see softening in the barley price towards the end of this year, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about that? And secondly, in the press release your comment on the BEE sector code, which is expected to be agreed towards the end of this calendar year. And I appreciate it's very early but are there any indications on the shape that may be emerging from those discussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Trevor, the softening of the barley I think &#x2013; what I was trying to say, anyway is that, it's very difficult to call these prices out beyond the next harvest because we don't know what the climatic situation is going to be. And the current situation is usually exacerbated by crop failures, particularly in Western Australia last year. But also very poor crops in other growing areas in the world, notably Europe. So, there was a sort of perfect storm about this time last year in grain supply, and we're still feeling the effects of that. Now, really what I'm hoping and what we're all hoping is that perfect storms by their nature don't continue, and if we have more normal seasons, planting and growing seasons this year, which we seem to have so far, that should certainly alleviate the situation.</p>
          <p>On the BEE, I don't think there's anything definitive one can say, there is a tendency in South Africa for the codes to converge with the standard codes that have been put out, the umbrella codes, if you like, put out by the government. So, I don't think that there will be a great deal of difference between the specific codes applying to SAB and to the liquor industry in general, between that and what has been already put out in the government framework.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentleman, Simon Hales from Dresdner Kleinwort. A few questions, if I can, please. Just going back to South Africa, I wonder, if you would give an idea at all in terms of the costs and extra cost of importation of glass in the second half? Just how significant a hit that was on the H2 margin? Secondly on South Africa, can I just confirm, in the press release, you talk about the adverse affect of mix in lager in the year. I'm assuming that's largely due to the loss of Amstel and the shift into mainstream that you saw, and it's not actually trading down that you saw across the wider market as a result of food inflation pressure. And thirdly, just on the corporate cost line, it fell significantly in the second half, and I note in the second half of '07, in the first half of '08 you saw a step change as a result of Latin America. I'm just wondering why that corporate cost line came down so significantly in H2? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just pick up the Amstel question first, rather the trading down question. Your supposition as I understand it is the adverse mix was due to the picking up of some of the Amstel volume through our mainstream brands and in fact <mark type="inaudible" /> of the growth of Hansa Pilsener as well as the new Hansa Marzen Gold in the text, and in fact we introduced &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; we also saw a quite strong growth in Castel which as it happens is continuing. So that was a substitution effect arising from the Amstel removal more than any long term or even medium term down trading. We don't see a down trading effect; in fact the premium segment in South Africa has seen a very strong growth. On the bottle import cost, we haven't released an actual number for that. I'm afraid I don't have one.</p>
          <p>Tony has said that in F08 overall total input costs including bottle importing costs rose by more than $50 million against F07 but bottle import costs we haven't broken out, and in fact it would be quite difficult to do that, I think, given the number of other moving parts that there are with the bottle situation.</p>
          <p>Corporate costs, Malcolm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On corporate costs, Simon, if you &#x2013; no doubt you have done &#x2013; if you go back and break down first half, second half over F06, '07 and '08 you'll see that there's actually &#x2013; there's no trend, that sometimes the first half is larger than the second half and sometimes the second half is larger than the first half. And what happens is corporate costs is not actually just overhead at the center, it's the corporate area which picks up the overhead but it also has other accounting costs in it, as you know in to IFRS we also have a charge for option costs and those can be bigger or lower depending upon the share price, and that generally goes into the corporate costs. We also have royalties coming in from various of our international brands. So you will see within I suppose a framework of 10 or $20 million ups and downs in each one of the halves. So it's difficult to get a exact figure for each of the halves based on what you would imagine as just a normal underlying head office cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear. But we should have seen going forward that the annual run rate is about stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if anything &#x2013; the annual run rate might be, again, because we don't know what will happen next year but it might be slightly higher than that. If you look at the run rate over the years you see it's been creeping up, and I would just consider that that would continue.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Julian Wentzel from Macquarie Bank. Graham, quite a broad-based question for you. If you look at rising food inflation, which if you assume that most of your volume mix comes from emerging and developing markets that accounts for about 50% of net disposal income, are you still so confident about your ability to continuously pass prices through in this environment? The second question is about price mix. I wonder if Malcolm could give some color as to the degree of negative price mix. Positive mix obviously at 3.3%, that could probably contribute about 0.8% negative to that total mix. Was there any other area that we should looking at, particularly probably looking at Asia? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, Julian, thanks. On the food inflation question, I mean, it's a very complex question, wasn't a simple question, very complex. I'm not sure that we know or anybody knows the detail of all the answer. I mean the fact is that we haven't passed on price increases through the world right now, and as I said these tend to get lost in general consumer inflation, which is evident because of food pricing but also because of other things. I should also point out that the price increases that we have put into effect and that we would need to put into effect to recover our raw material inputs are not that high and are certainly not at all high in comparison with food inflation itself. So, you could argue that that on the one hand yes, affordability become more of an issue because of diversion into food expenditure. On the other hand you could argue with some force that beer becomes more affordable against a general basket of consumer goods because we don't have to and haven't in fact passed on huge increases compared to other levels of increase going on.</p>
          <p>And the fact is that the secular underlying growth drivers in emerging markets at consumer level we think are intact. They may be a bit more muted now because of the factors we're talking about than the long run but they're still very much there, so &#x2013; and we expect them to continue.</p>
          <p>So we see that there is a hump at the moment that we have to get through and we're getting through very successfully of passing on relatively large or passing on cost of goods increases through relatively large pricing, but if you look at the pricing in the context of the other things that are going on it's actually quite modest. So I don't see any reason to suppose that we won't be able to carry on doing what we're doing.</p>
          <p>Let me ask Malcolm to answer the second part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, just Julian, that's a fairly complex question or complex moving parts within that question because if you look at each one of our areas, you can &#x2013; first of all in Graham's slides he's showing you where we have a negative impact because we haven't been able to cover the underlying input costs. But just looking at the makeup of our revenue and where we get price mix from, as you say it would have been positive around the Group but each one of those Group items has a divisional weighting, so when you put it all together you can actually have a division with a positive price mix which actually gives you a negative weighting when you put it into the Group situation.</p>
          <p>So I think the best way I can answer this is that if you look around the Group, South Africa obviously had a negative situation because of particularly Amstel, but in underlying constant currency its revenue per hectoliter was still up. If you look at somewhere like Africa and Asia, Africa was very positive, but China and Asia would have brought to Africa a negative impact in their price mix. But in Europe it was very strong, and Latin America would have been positive, offsetting any negative price mix in Peru. And in North America it would have been very strong because of our industry leading pricing plus the mix of our growth in Miller Lite. So to break it down individually is very difficult, particularly to look at the weighted average of what happens in the Group sense but certainly by division I think that gives you an idea of where the positives came from or where there may have been some negatives.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. It's Ian Shackleton at Lehman Brothers. A couple of questions firstly, the wording on the Molson-Coors deal in your statement, I think Graham you talked about that the earliest it will be expected to complete now is the middle of calendar year 2008. Now, I'm just wondering if that's representing a slightly different signal. I remember you talking about this completing in sometime in Q3, not on the 1st of July as far as you can see at the moment. And secondly, getting back to Latin America and you showed quite some punchy numbers for consumption per cap growth, and I just wondered how you saw the revenue per hectoliter panning out particularly in Colombia where I think you only got a 4% level last year, which clearly is beneath the headline inflation and certainly food inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, on the Molson-Coors wording, absolutely not. I mean nothing has changed &#x2013; certainly nothing has changed adversely &#x2013; to affect our perception or expectation. So there's nothing in that at all. So I expect that to close <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>First of all, that's sort of &#x2013; one of the points that you have to bear in mind is that the currencies in Latin America and in Colombia in particular, the currency has been very strong, so input cost inflation has been muted by that. Remember that international commodities are quoted in dollars and the Colombian peso has been very strong against the dollar, so the local inflation that they are seeing has not been as strong as in other parts of the world and their price increases to date that they've put in have in fact recovered that. Colombia prices, that 4% that you quote is an annualized number, their prices have risen by about 7% in <mark type="inaudible" /> terms, but that was somewhat later in the year. It wasn't at the beginning of the year, so there's an annualization <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just ask about Peru as well. I mean clearly you got annualized pricing there, about 1%, are we seeing though again a sort of step up at the end of the year, which could lead to better numbers in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, not really. The situation in Peru is much more affected by the competitive entry of the Arfay group. There are two competitors, AmBev and Arfay, and they both are mounting price-based attacks. So what you're seeing in Peru is much more a price mix effect of lower-price brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you, as a quick, quick question to Malcolm, as a follow-up, on the you talked Malcolm of the coupon at the end of the year of 7.3% does that include the full impact of the Grolsch financing? Is that the number we should be using for fiscal '09 or it will be a lower number because of Grolsch coming in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there will be an impact as a result of the Grolsch financing. We've taken on our existing financing. What we haven't done yet is rebased our currencies. <mark type="inaudible" /> you will probably get an impact on that coupon as a result of us moving more currencies into euro, and also we are inclined to move some of our variable rate financing into fixed rate to support that acquisition. There is a little bit of a financial balancing act that needs take place in the net debt line, so my inclination would be to say that that coupon would rise slightly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But factor in that Grolsch debt. We'd expect for '09 an average coupon of less than 7.3 presumably?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning BJM. Good morning Malcolm, Graham. First question for Malcolm, would you be able to give us an indication as to how much the raw materials would have gone up, if you hadn't been hedged in F08 and that's benchmarking at a 9% <mark type="inaudible" /> that you mentioned. And then just continue on Ian and Julian's questions, you showed a parity currency chart for the rand, and do you have a view on the COP? I'm assuming that the LatAm has now overtaken South Africa in terms of importance. On the ex-South African emerging market currency strength against the U.S. dollar, as you mentioned, it's mitigated some of the input cost increases. Does your outlook assume that currency continues to play a positive role? And then finally on food inflation impact over and above the usual negative suspects. Is it possibly beginning to bite Colombia and S.A. consumer, and will the changing elasticity allow for margin covering price increases? Will price per increases be possible in these markets without material volume impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Grant, I can just pick up on one or two of your first questions. You asked whether, if we had not been hedged that's a highly complex question, because we are buying in different markets around the world. We're buying at different periods and hedges run off all the time and we've got others that are running. So, what we don't try and do is keep a public figure of what in any one year it could have been had we not had hedges in. You know, we've also got supplier contracts and we have price agreements with suppliers as well. We may not be buying at market price. We may be buying at discounts to market price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Grant, I mean I'm not sure if you can answer that question actually, maybe, I'll just break in there, I mean, because if a group as big as ourselves had not been hedged I don't think you could buy at any price because we buy at fixed prices and if we hadn't had our contracts in the market early, we simply wouldn't have got any supply at any price. So it's a very theoretical question and remember that market prices are eventually set by marginal trades on what is left after all the big guys have all exhausted their contracts. So, I don't think you can give a meaningful answer to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Essentially the spot price we wouldn't have bought at anyway. So it's against the theoretical price, Grant. So we don't try and keep anything like that, it's as Graham says a theoretical concept. As far as the currency chart is concerned, yes, we do keep a COP one running. And we may well put that in the pack in the future and that as I understand it is showing very much the same picture as the rand that it's around about the sort of price parity level, but slightly stronger than the rand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to remind you that not all of our LatAm earnings come out of COP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not as big an individual focus as the rand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good point because if you look at although we account for it in COP coming through, there is a lot coming through Peru and Ecuador which is dollar-based as well as our Central American currencies.</p>
          <p>Okay. The food inflation question Grant could you just repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Trying to un-mute here. What I was really getting on about is that in emerging markets where food inflation having spiked so dramatically. We normally, we would feel that pressure of petrol price increases and general economic slowdowns and interest environments being so negatively affecting the general consumer. Where your model &#x2013; operational model covered for the impact &#x2013; input cost repricing last year and didn't see too much volume slowdowns. Is this year going to have a different impact on volume because the consumer is in such a dreadful state compared to FY '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see much more of an effect really from what I was showing in those slides of the very high comparative base over those three quarters. I think that's the dominant effect more than anything else. A lot of the stuff is going into the market and has been in the market for some time. So it's not as if we are seeing something that's just coming at us like a tidal wave, I mean we've been managing this picture now for quite a long time. In fact if you take the U.S., which I know is not the focus of your question, but nevertheless it's interesting that I think that the U.S. is through the worst of the inflation impact. Certainly, the packaging material, the worst of packaging material inflation is I think in the base now. And the food inflation stuff coming through is rising in parts of the world, not all of it. But in the raw material, the agricultural raw materials as a proportion of our total inputs are not all that high, certainly not as high as packaging. So it's got to be kept in context. If you look at displacement of buying power in individual markets, again that's a very complex question because it's affected quite a lot by what I mentioned earlier, which is the strength or weakness of the local currencies. So hard to call, I mean and very complex to try to call.</p>
          <p>Overall I'll just come back to what I was saying, we are pushing &#x2013; putting these price increases into the market. We are recovering certainly in absolute terms the cost increases that we are facing and we think the underlying growth drivers are there. South Africa is amongst the worst affected because the rand has been declining over the last couple of years. So the impact of imported inflation is relatively high in South Africa. And as you would know, South African inflation is sitting at about 10% at the moment but against that our imposed price increases are well below that, so we should get some sort of elasticity uplift as well. Yeah. It's hard to be more definitive than that I am afraid.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. James Edwards Jones. Please state your company followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning guys, it's James Edwards Jones from Execution. A couple of questions on the cash flow if I may. Your net debt increased by about $2.2 billion or give or take 900 million excluding acquisitions. Given similar levels of CapEx in 2009 can we expect net debt to increase by give or take $1 billion dollar this year? And secondly, CapEx running at about 9.2% of revenues, depreciation at about 4.1%, pretty much in line with last year, I was just wondering why the depreciation charge hasn't risen more rapidly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, David. First of all net debt, that 900 million also includes the result of some of our acquisitions during the year and also investments into India and China. So, it's not all just financing CapEx. In fact, the cash flows, depending on which one you put first in the line, the cash flows actually are very strong and would normally cover all of our requirements for CapEx. But when we start adding on top of that, the high levels of CapEx plus some acquisitions, that's when we find that we've spent a little bit more than we have actually contributed in cash flow during the year. So, next year we wouldn't expect that unless we started spending the same amount again on acquisitions. As far as the CapEx is concerned, yes, you said it's depreciation is about half of the amount of the CapEx percentage of revenue, if that was the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was just wondering really why depreciation hasn't risen more and started rising as a percentage of revenues given the very high levels of CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has started rising. If you look at the figures it's probably up well over $100 million during the course of F08. But a lot of the CapEx is still in the course of projects and will be coming in during F09. So you will get another uplift in depreciation, probably higher in F09 than in F08.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Melissa Earlam. Please state your company followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Melissa Earlam, UBS, two questions please. The first one is around your growth margin progression, obviously you are not reporting that in the statement. But in general terms, given 6% cost per hectoliter inflation and 4% revenue per hectoliter inflation, would it be fair to assume that that an implies an organic growth margin movement about a 100-basis points down year-on-year? And moving into '09, obviously your cost of goods sold per hectoliter inflation steps up, but your revenue per hectoliter from what you've been saying probably ticks up too. Should we be expecting the same kind of level of gross margin decline year-on-year or something slightly worse? That's my first question. And the second question is related to the Latin America margin. In the second half that came through a bit better than what we've been forecasting. Can you just give a little bit of visibility what was happening to AMP in that period, I've been working on the assumption that you were pulling forwards the AMP actually into that second half, did that in reality come through, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Should I just trying to comment on the &#x2013; I mean we don't disclose the gross margin, Melissa, as you quite rightly pointed out at the beginning. What we have said that's our gross margin will in fact decline and given the expectation for F09 where we again expect to cover those costs. But on the basis that we are recovering those costs and our COGS are not dissimilar to any of the other major brewers as a percentage. If you take a rough figure, you can work out as you say your estimate of where the gross margin might go to, but we haven't actually given any figures on that. What we have said Melissa, on gross margin previously is that &#x2013; we would anticipate. It could take two to three years to restore gross margins following this round of very high inflation. We certainly are not looking to restore or maintain gross margins over the very short-term because we don't think that's realistic. We have clawed back some of the effect that as you seen in productivity elsewhere. So, really what goes on above the operating margin line, we think it will take a while to get back to the status quo ante but we are concentrating on just maintaining operating margins is the first essential. And then on the AMP in Colombia, I'm not sure that I understood what you driving at the in...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colombia, in fact the more recent marketing including AMP, has been declining, but that's because there were some very, very substantial brand renovation programs going in, which are multi faceted and which raised marketing expenses quite strongly in the year before this last one and particularly in the first half-year. And those haven't come through the second half-year; we don't expect them, we're not through those. So, we would expect that decline to settle down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So effectively for Latin America, AMP <mark type="inaudible" /> as a percentage of sales was down year-on-year for that reason that you've just explained? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Gerard Rijk. Please state your company followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gerard Rijk, ING. Two questions. One is you talked about in the second half of the financial year, there were the biggest price increases, is there any expectation of new price increases in 2009, in which part of the year will that take place? Second question, is on the facing of the increase in cost of good sales. The thing that you mention mid-single, high-mid single-digit, is there a bigger increase in the part of the year than in the second half of the year, or is it more evenly spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do, with the price increases first the reason why we make that point about annualization of price increases is because the real spike in brewing raw material prices has only started to come through in fiscal '08, so therefore the recovery of those came through, started to come through during fiscal '08 and therefore there is an annualization effect towards the end of the year. And obviously, we therefore see the benefit of that for the whole of fiscal '09. It's a bit hard, well I wouldn't extend from that to the supposition that in F09 the price increases will all be backloaded because in fact, we apply price increases at different times in different markets around the world. There is no real pattern to that and I would say that there will probably be more uniform price increases this year because we are now already in the process of recovering those costs and so there is some momentum to the price increases, but I can't be more specific than that and in fact I didn't know that I can be much specific about the phasing of the COGS within year either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean that's complex and we buy for the year and we buy on contract and that's could be the same price being delivered at different parts of the year and so it's not necessary that there will be a major difference between the first half and the second half on a per hectoliter basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Nico Lambrechts. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Nico Lambrechts from Merrill Lynch. Just a question around fixed cost, clearly some of your gross margin compression was offset by fixed costs in Latin America you didn't allude to that in the first half could you maybe give us some background on the fixed cost savings that was achieved during the financial year and maybe fixed cost saving opportunities for fiscal '09? And then also on Latin America I think the total cost there is a round number of around $3 billion, how much of that is actually dollar botting cost where you could have achieved a benefit due to the shrink of the Colombian peso and other currencies there? And then lastly, Graham you also quoted in the press I think it's the FD there is a statement where they quoted you that you said there is no doubt that there has been a general slowing in the consumer growth in emerging markets, would you mind confirming that your statement and elaborate around that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nico, the operating fixed costs I am not really sure I can be too specific there. We obviously, our business has grown quite rapidly in volume terms and so there's operating leverage that comes through from that. We're also a business, which as you know focuses on fixed cost productivity very firmly all the time. So we have a vast range of productivity programs running at any one time, all of which bring their respective little bits to account. We actually I think made some great strides in fixed cost productivity in different parts of the world over the last year. U.S. actually quite notably amongst them. In LatAm, I think it's more to do, it is more to do with the end of the restructuring and brand introduction and market restructuring programs that has allowed us to show more productivity, because there are quite a number of one-off costs throughout the business, which apply to that. If I understand your reference to the COP and the dollar -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a comment on the fixed costs, in your statement there's a line that says, there has been significant fixed cost productivity improvement across the business in LatAm is that more the operating leverage then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's operating leverage plus the end of a whole lot of restructuring activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. My question around the dollar was purely more that dollar bought in raw materials, where obviously you get a benefit in those countries the transactions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we get a benefit because the currencies have been strong, therefore, the effect of dollar inflation in raw materials hasn't been as high, but the fixed costs are not really dollar denominated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for sure. That was a separate question. How much of your bought in raw materials is dollar based in the LatAm region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a number in my mind, I mean the &#x2013; all raw materials ultimately are linked to the dollar, because most of the commodities are internationally traded in their international reference points. So the one thing we do import, we import a lot of barley into our Latin American businesses because it's not a great barley, in fact, it's not a barley-growing region at all. So almost all the barley is imported, either from the U.S. or Canadian grain pools or from Argentina, and that's dollar dominated, it's also not a hop growing region, so those are particularly significant costs. Elsewhere the energy-related stuff would be affected by energy costs, which again are in dollar and that applies to most of the packaging. So there's a strong linkage, there certainly. But it's difficult to calculate what the benefit is because we cover forward our commitments from time-to-time, so depending on where we think the currency is against the dollar, we may well cover forward at a certain rate, it may go better or worst from there. So at any one point in time, we are always looking at what commitments we have at that stage and how much of those we should be covering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then your question about slowdown in emerging market, yes, I don't want to give the wrong impression here, the underlying growth drivers in all emerging markets are we think very much intact, the resources boom is still continuing. There is no doubt that in some markets, because price increases have been put through, which are unusual that has affected demand in the short-term, but there are always complicating factors. One of the big complicating factors is the huge growth rate in our numbers that I've talked about, those three quarters of last year, so we are cycling that. There have been other complications like floods and very inclement weather conditions in China as well as now, of course, the great tragedy of the of that earthquake. So things are going on, we think that in China in particular, which is one of the big growth markets that the food inflation is playing a role, but we I think that the growth will re-emerge, is still intact, it doesn't have to re-emerge. It's still intact underlying it.</p>
          <p>Things aren't as absolutely rosy in emerging markets as they were nine months ago, because food inflation has risen since then but that brings opportunities as well as problems as I've outlined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that in all of our countries, South Africa is the one where the growth expectations have fallen the most. The other ones, one would say that there's growth there probably not at the same high level as it was last year, but by relative standards, growth in India, China, countries in Africa are still at a very high level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you comment on Colombia where you've also previously commented that maybe consumer spending has reached a cyclical peak? How sharp do you think a slowdown could be? I understand that the secular growth is still there and I agree with that but just the cyclical impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we are facing a worst situation going forward than we've already seen in Colombia, Nico. One of the factors in Colombia is very, very high local interest rates. Now the effect of those is not exactly the same as it would be in South Africa. But interest rates there are amazingly high and that has an effect on the consumer economy. But I think that stuff is in the base. I don't think that there is anything more to come that I can see.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bruce Davidson, Blue Oar Securities. I've two questions. One you indicated what the investment has been in physical assets during the last year. Are you able to give some indication of what the investment in additional brand support and marketing has been? Second question, just really following from Nico's discussion on Colombia. If I read the statement, there is a sort of two-handed commentary if you like on Colombia, positive comments about the full benefit from all of your activities there in investment and increasing price compliance and a new brewery coming on-stream, which would actually paint quite a rosy picture against which you've got, well, you've just been discussing a consumer slowdown. I'm just really interested in your comments on what progress you're likely to see this year in terms of volumes and margins there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the brand marketing support, we don't give numbers on specific marketing around the world. I mean, let me just say, that I think that we spend, we already spend what we need to spend on, on brand marketing. So I don't see any long-term upward pressure there, in fact, there is probably at the moment a downward drift because we're coming to the end of huge flurries of activity in LatAm and to a lesser extent in South Africa. So I think that our marketing, as a percentage of net producer revenue, which is how we look at it internally, is probably pretty stable.</p>
          <p>With Colombia, yes, I mean we do have a great deal of confidence in that economy. We are investing for the future. We have as you mentioned price compliance programs and others going into effect. There is also the gradual recovery from the huge amount of change that we've put into the market and the &#x2013; bringing to bear what a feeling &#x2013; the full beneficial effect of all those changes. And what I mean by that, of course, is that any change causes some disruption. So that I think there is a settling down of that market which we think will continue for the next couple of years. So we don't see harder times ahead for Colombia, in fact, we probably see better times ahead for Colombia than we are seeing right now.</p>
