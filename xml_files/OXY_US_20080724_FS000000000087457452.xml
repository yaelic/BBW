          <p>Thanks very much, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Occidental's Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Los Angeles are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and CEO, Steve Chazen, our President and CFO, and Casey Olson, Oxy's President of Oil and Gas in the Eastern Hemisphere. In a moment, I will be passing the call over to Dr. Irani, who will highlight some of Oxy's recent announcements and future development opportunities. Steve Chazen will then review our second quarter and six month financial results and will also provide greater detail on our plan to increase capital spending, oil and gas drilling activity and our outlook for growing our oil and gas production for the remainder of the decade.</p>
          <p>Our earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules, and the conference call presentation slides which refer to Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.  And I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Irani. Dr. Irani, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Chris and good morning everybody. Today we are very pleased to announce a record second quarter with net income $2.3 billion, a 63% increase compared to second quarter of 2007. Net income for the first six months of 2008 was $4.1 billion, an increase of 58% over the comparable six month period last year. These results reflect not only the strong oil and natural gas prices, which have generally benefited the industry, but also the increased production across Oxy's operations. Comparing the first six months of this year to the first six months of 2007, our total worldwide production has increased by about 7% to an average daily production of 598,000 BOE per day, despite a labor dispute in Argentina during May which is now settled. Very shortly, Steve will discuss our results in more detail. But first I'd like to mention some recent developments that will enable us to further expand our worldwide production and create additional value for Oxy stockholders.</p>
          <p>As most of you are aware, the majority of Oxy's production is in the United States, which last year provided 63% of our total production and 75% of our proven reserves.  We are the leading oil producer in the Permian Basin and southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico, with production of at a rate of about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  In California, we are the largest natural gas producer, the third-largest oil producer, and in total our current net total production in California averages 126,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
          <p>And we have stated repeatedly that our long-term strategy is to maintain the US production to be over 50% of worldwide production and to have reserves well over 50% of the total. And so we intend to strengthen Oxy's North America position even further. We are making a significant effort to increase North America production with strategic acquisitions and increased drilling. In the coming months, we will increase our 2008 capital expenditures to a total of $4.7 billion. This year   we plan on drilling and recompleting approximately 400 wells located in each of our key business areas throughout the United States, namely the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the Piceance in northwest Colorado and our California operations.  And we're also increasing drilling activity in Argentina, Colombia and Libya.</p>
          <p>The primary means of increasing production is through enhanced oil recovery, including carbon dioxide flooding in which Oxy is an industry leader. We are now able to apply this technology to wells, which at lower oil prices previously were not economical to operate, with EOR. And so consequently, these wells are what I would call low laying fruits.</p>
          <p>To enhance our position in CO2 oil recovery, last month we announced that we will develop a hydrocarbon gas processing plant and related pipeline infrastructure in West Texas that would provide a new source of CO2 for EOR at our existing properties in the Permian Basin.  The project is expected to add approximately 500 million barrels to our industry-leading reserves in the Permian over the next five years at a very attractive cost, all from assets we currently own.  This additional CO2 supply will enable us to expand production in the Permian by a minimum of 50,000 barrels of oil a day within the next five years.</p>
          <p>Adding further to our North American assets, last month we agreed to purchase a 15% interest in the Total-operated Joslyn oil sands project in Alberta, Canada.  As you may know, this is one of the premier oil sands projects in the world, with over 8 billion barrels of hydrocarbons in place. We estimate the probable reserves net to Oxy to be about 370 million barrels.  We expect to spend about $2 billion over the next few years to develop these reserves in Canada, with production targeted to begin in 2014.</p>
          <p>While we are emphasizing Oxy's North American operations, we continue to pursue our long term strategy to grow the business at a faster pace in the Middle East and to purse opportunities that meet our stringent standards for financial return. Last month, I joined with officials from the Libyan National Oil Company to formally sign new 30-year agreements upgrading our existing petroleum contracts in Libya covering fields with approximately 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable, high quality oil reserves. The new contracts will increase our profits from Libya immediately and allow us to increase production for the future.</p>
          <p>Also significant for Oxy's continued potential growth in the Middle East long-term is our pre-qualification by the Government of Iraq to participate in discussions to develop a number of that country's most prolific oil fields. As you are aware, development of these massive fields is a critical engine of growth for the Iraqi national economy.  Depending on the security situation in Iraq, which is fluid, there is a possibility of projects being finalized by late next year.</p>
          <p>With the first two quarters of 2008 now concluded, we are pleased with Oxy's success and growth.  In light of the excellent additions to our asset portfolio and promising projects in pipeline, we expect 2008 to be another outstanding year for Oxy.  And I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Chazen.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ray.  Core results for the quarter were a record $2.3 billion or $2.79 per diluted share compared to 943 million or $1.12 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007.  Second quarter core results exceeded the previous record set in the first quarter by 26%.</p>
          <p>Here's a segment breakdown for the second quarter.  Oil and gas second quarter 2008 segment earnings were $3.8 billion compared to about 1.7 billion for the second quarter of 2007.  Oil and gas core results for the second quarter of 2007 were about 1.6 billion after excluding gains from the sale of oil and gas interests last year.</p>
          <p>The following accounted for the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters. Higher worldwide oil and gas price realizations resulted in an increase of $2.2 billion of earnings over the comparable period last year.  Oxy's average realized crude oil pricing in the 2008 second quarter was $110.12 per barrel, an increase of 86% in the comparable period in 2007.  Oxy's domestic average realized gas price in the quarter was $9.99 per MCF compared with $7.07 per MCF in the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas production the second quarter of 2008 averaged 588,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 5% compared with 558,000 BOE production second quarter of last year.  The bulk of the production improvement was 46,000 BOE a day from the Dolphin project which began production in the third quarter of 2007, and from the recently acquired domestic assets, partially offset by a 15,000 barrel a day in lower volumes from Argentine operations due to a strike in the Santa Cruz province in May of this year -- which I'll discuss later -- and lower production of 19,000 BOE per day caused by higher oil prices affecting our production sharing contracts.</p>
          <p>Dolphin contributed $101 million to after-tax income during the second quarter on sales volume of 46,000 BOE a day.  Dolphin sales volume decreased in the first quarter of 2008 due to the affect of higher prices on our production sharing contracts which have reached the cost recovery ceiling for this year.  Exploration expense is $58 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas cash production costs the first six months of 2008 were $14.08 a barrel compared with last year's costs of $12.33 a barrel.  Approximately 47% of the increase related to increased energy costs.  The increase reflected higher production and ad valorem taxes in field operating costs.  Additional 17% of the increase was caused by the effect of the production sharing contracts. In the back half of the year we are boosting our expense to workover activity by 65% in order to increase production in the current high product price environment.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings the second quarter of 2008 were $144 million.  Chemicals earned $158 million in last year's second quarter.  Midstream segment earnings the second quarter of 2008 were $161 million, an increase of 136 million from the second quarter of 2007 results.  The improvement was due to higher pipeline income from Dolphin, higher NGL margins in the gas processing business, and improved margins in the marketing side.   Positive mark-to-market adjustments also contributed to pipeline storage earnings during the second quarter of 2008.  The worldwide effective tax rate was 42% for the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now let me now turn to Oxy's performance during the first six months.  Net income was about $4.1 billion or $5.01 per diluted share for the first six months of 2008, compared with about 2.6 billion or $3.11 per diluted share for the same period last year.  The six months 2008 reported net income was another record and was 58% higher than the first six months of 2007, the former record.</p>
          <p>Income for the first six months of 2007 included 893 million net of tax and the items noted on the schedule reconciling that income to core results.</p>
          <p>Capital spending for the quarter was 1.1 billion and $2 billion for the first six months.  Cash flow from operations for the six months was $5 billion.  We used 2 billion of the company's cashflow to fund capital expenditures, $2.3 billion for acquisitions which included a $450 million payment for the Libya contract bonus, and 415 million to pay dividends.  We used $860 million to repurchase 11.1 million common shares at an average price of $77.82 a share.  These outflows decreased our $2 billion cash balance the end of last year by 500 million to 1.5 billion at June 30.  That was 1.8 billion at the end of June which was unchanged from year end.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for six months were 822.5 million; and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 826.9 million.  At June 30, there were 818.1 million basic shares outstanding and the diluted share amount was approximately 822.4.  The Board has authorized repurchase of an additional 20 million shares, which brings the total remaining share repurchase authorization to 35.2 million.  Oxy's 2008 annualized return on equity was 35% with annualized return on capital employed of 32%.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead in the current quarter with regard to prices, a $1 per barrel change in oil price impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $37 million.  The sensitivity includes the impact of Dolphin. Also included is the production sharing contract price impact of approximately 300 barrels per day.  A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $25 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we expect exploration expenses to be about 90 to $110 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.</p>
          <p>We expect chemical segment earnings for the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter results, with a range of 135 to $150 million.  Weakness in the construction and housing market continue to impact domestic demand, while higher feedstock and energy costs have reduced margins. These factors have been partially offset by higher caustic soda prices and higher polyvinyl export volumes. Despite difficult economic conditions and concerns over export opportunities over the balance of the year, we believe this range of earnings is highly likely.</p>
          <p>We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter to remain at 42%. Our second quarter US and foreign tax rates are included in the investor relations supplement.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our capital spending program, we expect to increase our 2008 capital spending estimate to $4.7 billion, which is an increase of $700 million or 17%.  This additional money will be used to drill 254 new wells, to complete 145 additional capital workovers. Overall, this represents a 16% increase in new wells and a 12% increase in capital workovers. A schedule detailing this increased capital activity in 2008 is included in the investor relations slides.</p>
          <p>The majority of the activity will be California, where we are adding six additional drilling rigs.  We will be expanding our rig fleet in the Elk Hills area by five, drilling an additional 100 wells, mostly in shallow zones.  We've added 50 capital workovers to our activity in the second half of the year. We are doubling the exploration wells in the Elk Hills area to 20. In other California areas, we are expanding existing developments.</p>
          <p>We are also adding six drilling rigs in Latin America where in Argentina we will be increasing drilling to offset the impact of the recent strike, during which we could not engage in any drilling activities. We are also carrying out an extensive workover program in Argentina. In Colombia, we are expanding our drilling in the LCI Field.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East/North Africa, additional wells are being drilled in the Masila area in Yemen. In Libya, we will be drilling four additional exploratory wells, three of which are within the new contract area. Finally, we are increasing our midstream spending, primarily for the construction of a new West Texas gas processing plant and related pipeline which was announced at the end of June.</p>
          <p>As we look at future production, we expect oil and gas production to be in the range of 590 to 600,000 barrels a day during the third quarter at an approximately $125 oil price. The strike in Argentina's Santa Cruz province lasted approximately 5 weeks, resulted in a complete shut in of all production and drilling activities in that region. Production is back to approximately pre-strike levels. In addition, drilling activity is expected to increase in the second half of the year with additional rigs that are being deployed. As a result, the Argentine production is expected to increase by about 19,000 BOE a day from second quarter levels.</p>
          <p>Libya's production we expect to be 8,000 barrels a day in the third quarter, with liftings of only about 5,000 BOE a day. The new contract terms reduce the company's share of production offset by a reduction in tax rates. This results in much more favorable earnings, perhaps two to three times existing levels. Other operations expect to have an increase in production.</p>
          <p>Shown in the investor relations sides is a table which provides daily production rate forecasts using the first 6 months of this year as a base. Production is expected to be 610,000 barrels a day in the second half of the year of 2008 and total growth in 2008 will be 6%. Due to higher prices, we've lost 13,000 barrels a day which is about 2% of our production versus our original initial $80 WT outlook from production sharing contracts. Production is expected to be 650,000 barrels a day in 2009, and 705,000 barrels a day in 2010. Our growth rate for both years would be 8% per year. The cumulative growth rate for the 3 year period is 7.3%.</p>
          <p>These estimates are all based on a WTI price of $111 consistent with the first six months of 2008.  At this price level, for every $5.00 change in WTI, production will be inversely impacted by about 1,500 barrels a day.  Recognizing the likelihood for fluctuations in project timing, we expect a range of 600 to 620,000 barrels a day for the last six months of this year, 640 to 670,000 BOE per day in 2009, and 690 to 720,000 BOE a day in 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to the individual areas, we expect to increase production by expanding our drilling program in Elk Hills and surrounding areas, in plays such as the Antelope Shale and deeper pay zones where we have had recent exploration successes.  We are also planning various enhanced oil recovery projects, such as the expansion of the successful Eastern Shallow Oil Zone waterflood.  In Ventura County, California, we have an active drilling exploitation program in a deeper pay horizon beneath an existing successful waterflood, which is also being enhanced.  In the Wilmington Field in Long Beach, we are planning to drill several delineation wells as a follow-up to a deeper exploration success.</p>
          <p>In the Mid-Continent Rockies area, we are expecting to double our gas production exit rate in Piceance Basin by the end of the year from the current levels of 40 million a day to 80 million a day, as a result of the 2008 drilling program, and to 100 million a day in 2009 through an expanded development program.  In conjunction with the increased production, we are retrofitting our Con Creek gas plant and compression facility to double its capacity to 80 million a day by year end and to increase it to 100 million a day next year.  We currently have 40 million a day of gas transportation capacity out of the Rockies.  Based on contracts in place, we will increase capacity to 100 million a day this year and expect to finalize agreements for an additional 50 million a day by 2011.</p>
          <p>Our joint venture with Plains is also expanding its drilling activity in the basin, which should increase production from the current rate of 26 million a day to 36 million a day by the end of the year, and 44 million a day by 2010.  In addition, we are pursuing oil exploration activity in Utah, which we expect to add to our production in that region.  In the Permian Basin, our on-going drilling program is being accelerated around several plays to take advantage of the exploitation opportunity from acquisitions over the last few years.</p>
          <p>We will expand our workover activity significantly, increasing our service rigs from 155 to 175 within the next few months.  We are increasing our CO2 flood program through additional resources from Bravo Dome; together with the drilling program and workover activity it's expected to increase our production over the next two years by about 10,000 barrels a day.  On 2010 we should also see a positive impact on our production of additional CO2 resources from the recently announced SandRidge transactions which will enable us to increase our production by a minimum of 50,000 barrels a day within the next five years.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, our near field exploration program in Argentina continues to be successful.  This has enabled us to identify multiple new drilling locations in addition to those in our current program.  We will achieve significant production growth by expanding our drilling in these areas and other areas with the addition of five high performance rigs.  In Colombia we expect that the LCI will largely offset the natural decline in Ca&#xF1;o Limon.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Middle East/North Africa and Dolphin, the higher oil prices and success realized to date have resulted in a very rapid pace of cost recovery.  Consequently at the $111 oil price, we will realize fewer barrels of production going into the future.  Libya's net production will decline as a result of the new contract which took into effect at the end of the second quarter.  Based on current pricing we expect earnings to increase two or three times under the new contract.  As a result of our increased capital development program, production will increase over the next five years to former levels with much improved profits.</p>
          <p>In Oman, development efforts in the giant Mukhaizna steam flood are on track and we expect to exit 2008 at a gross level of approximately 50,000 barrels a day. Large scale drilling activity in the range of 200 wells per year coupled with the introduction of multiple water treatment facilities to supply the steam generators will allow us to increase gross production at the rate of 100,000 barrels a day by year end 2009 and 115,000 barrels per day by year end 2010.  We expect our net production in Oman to double by 2010 to around 54,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>In Qatar we have agreed with the government on a third phase development plan for the ISND field.  This phase entails about 70 low-risk in-field drilling projects as well as further platform and pipeline enhancements over the 2008 through 10 timeframe.  A third drilling rig has been recently added to perform a large number of rate enhancing workover projects in ISND and further develop the drilling activity expected at the Al-Rayyan field beginning in late 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>We expect these additional development activities to increase Oxy's net production better by as much as 20% over -- by 2010 over 2008 levels.  Yemen's production reflects a base decline in the Masila field.  It's important to note this forecast is based on existing projects and does not contemplate any new projects or future acquisitions.  A copy of the press release and our schedules are available on our website or through the Edgar system.  We're now ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, you've stepped up here in terms of getting us the kind of detail we wanted to see on growth.  You also had an announcement on buybacks.  Could you just go through the prioritization, strategic decision that you've taken now in terms of how much you want to spend on developing organic growth and how much you would spend on buying back stock given where the stock price is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the stock buyback, organic growth, we'll spend what we need to have on organic growth as long as it works, works at some reasonable oil price.  I think where the difference will be, it's very difficult right now to do large scale acquisitions that would compete with buying back stock.  And so, the excess cash would be used -- as long as the stock is a reasonable price -- would be used to buy back shares.  The reason we asked for the additional authority from the Board was, we felt we'd run out of authority before the next Board meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got you.  So that means we can expect to see the buyback accelerating pretty much from here, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As soon as the window ends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So basically, you haven't been in the market recently because you've been blanked out obviously, and it's not ratable.  But basically when the window closes we would expect to see therefore more than 860 million, which is the first half number obviously, of share repurchase in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we are &#x2013; if you compute the free cash flow of the company for the back half of the year using whatever estimates you want to use, we're not going to build cash.  And while we'll have probably some smaller acquisitions, no large scale ones, so I think you can get an idea of the scale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, the bottom line, we will accelerate the share repurchase during the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks, guys, I'll leave it there.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys.  I too thank you for all this detail.  It's great.  Where to start with the questions?  I guess, first in California, if I look at the volume progression in the first half, and then look at the increase in commitments to rigs and wells, how quickly do you think we'll see a production response in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Well, you know, things always go slower than you might like, as far as the production. They always want to test and fool around. So I think the schedule we've shown here is a reasonably conservative schedule. We would hope for better results earlier. But, I think, given the history of it, I think we will stay with this conservative view.</p>

          <p>Okay, and then I was intrigued that the 17% increase in CapEx roughly correlates with the increase in wells. It would suggest that you're not seeing much rig inflation or service cost inflation. You know, we've seen a lot of increase in tubular costs and other equipment and services costs. Are you booked up with &#x2013; are the rigs secured and a lot of that equipment procured at this point?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing I want to elaborate on, but we've had some pretty good success, and I think as we expand the program, as you see, a lot of it's dedicated to that kind of activity, whether it's called Monterey or Antelope. And so we'll have more detail as the year progresses, but the initial results are very encouraging. We have a huge acreage position, not just around Elk Hills but in California, so if this works, it probably works pretty good.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I'm going to ask about something that you didn't talk about in the slides. And by the way, thanks very much for all the information, it's great. I know it's early days, but Dr. Irani, you said that you are looking at Iraq. And could you give us an idea of what you're looking at in terms of target sizes, whether you're looking in the north or the south, and kind of what kind of &#x2013; would it be a production-sharing contract or a more traditional kind of Western contract? Kind of give us a little bit more detail, a little bit more color if you could, on what you have in mind for Iraq, because it could be very, very important for the company going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Let me say a couple words and I can turn over to Casey Olson. There are some very large fields in Iraq which are going to be available, and there are smaller ones, but which are very significant. Realistically, the huge ones are going to be run by consortia, a consortium which would have majors in it and companies our size. So we will be trying to be participating in those large ones.</p>
          <p>What I'm really saying is no one company is going to get a field with 20 billion barrels or more, period. So we will be participating with some of the super majors, and looking at some of the large formations. Now this is going to take time and so on, but we're also looking at some of the smaller fields where we could do them by ourselves.</p>
          <p>Now all of this depends on the new administration, how well the security situation takes place, Afghanistan, dah dah dah, and so it's tough to say when all this is going to happen. But it's moving in the right direction and we just wanted to share with you that we have been pre-qualified, and that we are serious about the opportunities. When that's going to happen, I'm sure that all Americans would like to know. But Casey would you add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, just a couple things. Bernie, one, as you probably know, going back even into the late 1980s, as a company we were very actively looking at Iraq and heavily engaged in detailed negotiations on various areas in the country. And unfortunately most of that went south with the problems between Kuwait and Iraq, and then subsequent history that's occurred since then.</p>
          <p>Dr. Irani's comments are exactly correct. I think the other thing to point out is the Iraqis are, as you probably know, looking at a formal process. They've identified eight or so of the giant fields in country that they're going to work through a formal bidding process with the industry probably starting later this year and going through a good part of next year. Again, based on our previous work in the country, we actually have a pretty good handle on what those fields are, what potential they might have, et cetera, and I think we're very well positioned because of our work with the ministries years ago.</p>
          <p>Like many countries, a lot of the key technical people in the ministry are still the same folks that were there before, so we have an excellent relationship, a good solid understanding of what the potential is, and certainly are going to be very aggressive in participating in whatever process the Iraqis decide to follow through on.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys. I appreciate as well as the others on the incremental detail you provided. I'm curious, I suppose we could say that this incremental $700 million of spending is marginal sort of by definition given that it came late in the year and with an eye towards higher crude prices, but with that said, I imagine the returns are still quite robust.  Can you characterize the average say internal rate of return on these new investments relative to your base program and perhaps something with, the payback period or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the things that you want to appreciate is some of this low-laying fruit we talked about earlier. If oil price is still over $100, you're looking at paybacks of six months or less; some others are more intermediate and some are longer term.  But clearly we are going to pick up the low-laying fruit and Steve, would you add to all that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're sort of embarrassed to say that the rates of return on these items are well over 100% and actually the returns are better than the underlying returns of the company, and you get paybacks of -- the workover rig is hardly off the rig -- off the well before you get paybacks.  You get paybacks in a lot of these things in under 90 days.  So the rates of return are spectacular in product price environments well below current levels.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, I have several questions if I may.  Firstly, on the CapEx increase for 2009 and 2010, is the 2008 level -- is that a good place to start?  And also from what you've been talking about and the enhanced oil recovery and some of the short term, short payback period projects, what would the impact be on operating costs, more from a modeling perspective?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would take the &#x2013; some version of this year's and maybe increase it a little bit, so it might approach five billion.  We don't know exactly but some of these things will go away and change.  But we could wind up with five billion including chemicals and midstream.  The second question was operating costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; we're likely to have more expensed workovers in the back half of the year because we're accelerating a backlog of those and so you're likely to boost your operating costs for the whole company of under $1 a barrel, but certainly $.50 to $1. It's deliberate policy, to get, to spend $1 a barrel to get $100 net, even if it's 2 or $3 on the well or $5 on the well, seems to us to be okay economics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Do you have a rough idea of what the impact will be on your reserve bookings for 2008 based on the program that you've announced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  The answer to your question is yes we do, but we don't forecast reserve bookings. That's not something we're capable of forecasting from year to year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a follow-on question?  You mentioned very briefly that you &#x2013; the acquisition you made in the oil sands, the Alberta oil sands in Canada.  How should we think about this project strategically?  I'm sure there are other companies would have run a ruler over the project when the asset was for sale. Should we think of Oxy has potentially pursuing other oil sands deals? And is there a need for you to integrate downstream, if you are going to be doing more oil sands? There's some pretty inexpensive refining assets available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as refining assets, we don't have any current plans for any refining assets.  Actually, there were very few companies interested. It was a very -- because people felt that they current operator would want the property, which they did, and we paid very little more than the current operator offered for it.  We expect to have a good relationship with Total and participate in marketing crude with them.  So I don't see us going into downstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would view this as not a &#x2013; you shouldn't view &#x2013; we're not capable of operating this kind of activity, so if there were other interests available, non-operated interests with competent operators, we would be interested in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as you know, we did emphasize, and maybe we should again, that not all of oil sands are oil sands.  This is a very high quality oil sand area and the opportunity came along. And even though it's longer term than we'd like to be working on, it's a unique opportunity so we decided to make the investment.   And it gives us some option value because we know we can flip it easily if we have to in the future. It's not our intent at the current time, but it gives us an optionality to participate and understand this activity better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, these oil sands affect our &#x2013; ultimately affect our production, the ability to market our production in West Texas. So I think it's important for us to understand the flows of oil in North America and plan our marketing appropriately to keep our differentials low.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick, high-level CapEx question. Clearly, your rates of return in California and in the Permian business were pretty economic at lower prices. So understanding what you said about the low-hanging fruit and thinking about the rationale for boosting domestic spending now, is it solely a function of higher commodity prices or have you learned something new that deserves capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think clearly it's a multiplicity of things. I mean one of them is, well, why didn't we do this earlier? These projects would have been very attractive at lower oil prices, much lower oil prices. In some cases we were accumulating acreage and we didn't want to get the price of the land going up. In other cases, folks were working on the facilities in terms of getting them in the best shape, safety, et cetera, et cetera. And now we are moving along to capitalize on acquisitions we made earlier and money we spent on facilities and to exploit acreage we accumulated over a number of years.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay you also talked about drilling delineation wells for a deeper exploration success in Long Beach. Can you talk a little bit about that?  What is the say, the larger target or is this kind of going to keep production kind of flat from your Long Beach production?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a sizable target.  It has the potential of growing the total.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so this would grow your THUMS production you are saying, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>THUMS and some other things that we have been accumulating down in that, in the Wilmington field for a while.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you know we do have to discuss with the State of California to get their approval on this, because they do have some ownership into some of that oil in the Long Beach vicinity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how difficult is that to do?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well nothing is easy, but we were talking.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it's a win-win for everybody, but what I am saying is this is not as easy to exploit as Permian and Elk Hills where the -- it's a different atmosphere. Long Beach is kind of a vacation spot or being developed as such.  No problems, but that will probably come at a slower pace than Permian where we think we can get quicker execution, and in Elk Hills, as we continue to exploit the success we've had and the large acreage position we have accumulated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are these deeper exploration wells part of your growth plans in California, so if I look at your production growth targets to 2010, would these targets be in that production growth plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A highly risked portion of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood.  And then, in terms of your Permian Basin CO2 enhancement projects, with the new SandRidge deal, how should we think about how those reserves get booked? Because I think previously in the past you told us that, as you find a way to get CO2 to your new flooding projects, that's when you start looking at booking some of those reserves. So if you could just elaborate on how that works?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In order to book a reserve, it isn't just a physical barrel being there but you have to be committed to do it and have in this case a CO2 supply firmly committed.  So we don't know exactly the pace, but I would not &#x2013; I would expect that it would come over several years rather than all in one year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough.  Thanks for the time, gentlemen.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Quadrum Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Steve.  How's it going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Doug. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks.  I want to probe on a couple of things, if I may.  Forgive me for going into reserves in a little bit of detail, but Argentina, it sounds like you're cranking up the CapEx and drilling activity a little bit, but you haven't, as far as I know, re-signed the lease there yet.</p>
          <p>Can you kind of update us as to where you are there because obviously that comes with some pretty significant reserve bookings?  Similarly on Libya, just maybe give us a kind of magnitude or at least some kind of feel for the lumpiness that we could see in the reserve bookings this year, because it looks like it could be a pretty big year if you add all that up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting &#x2013; as far as Argentina, we're negotiating with the state province and negotiating with governments is never easy to predict.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why I mentioned California &#x2013; easier!</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it makes Long Beach easier &#x2013; look like easy.  So we don't the answer to that.  Obviously, it would be a fairly sizeable reserve add, because even if you took the PDPs and just extended them out, it's a fairly sizeable number.  In Libya, going back to the definition of approved reserve, you really have &#x2013; in order to books PUDs say &#x2013; you have to have government commitment and our commitment to spend the money.  And so the rate of booking would be reflective of those levels of approval.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You shouldn't expect to see it all at once.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the US, the impact of SandRidge and the impact of California, I guess that's more ratable over a numbers of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ratable over a number of years.  So, you ought to see, if you were to think about it, you would see over the next, this timeframe, 2010 timeframe, pretty safe reserve replacement levels over the years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good.  Just two other quick ones.  Libya, I know you've signed a deal.  How do you catch up the earnings from December 1 last year?  How do you go about getting that through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect to get a check.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that will come probably in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we expect to get a check --probably in the third quarter, but I mean that kind of cash and then it's a one-timer to catch up on the profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would show up as a reduction in the bonus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. All right.  Okay. And the final one is I guess the focus of the call today appears to be clearly the great success you're having in the US.  It seems to be taking the shine off the Middle East a little bit and I think there are some concerns that maybe things aren't going so well there in terms of your ability to lock in new projects.  Could you maybe just spend a little bit of time updating us on where you are, particularly in the, obviously, the Amritzal mine and Bahrain and how you see things going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the things we've tried to do in this call is to give you news.  Bahrain, we continue to be optimistic that we will achieve success there.  We continue to talk with them and they have set a time schedule where they hope, before the end of the year, to choose one of three people who have made the cuts and those three is Oxy, Exxon, and Maersk.  And so we just have to wait that.  As I said, we're optimistic but there's nothing new I can tell you. Other than that, we continue to negotiate in Oman and elsewhere for projects.  But nothing I can tell you that it's going to happen next week or next month.  These things are, as we repeatedly say, governments negotiate very slowly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess just one follow-up real quick.  Steve, you said $5 billion could be the CapEx number.  Would that take account of any success in the Middle East or would there be, could that number go higher?  I seem to recollect you saying that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could go &#x2013; it might go higher.  I think right now you'd have to say that's a reasonable guess.  But I would call it purely in the guess area.  You know, if we have more success, we're going to spend more money because that's just the deal, but you shouldn't.  If we are spending more than that, then these numbers we are showing on production are too low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, we demand high returns and we have enough of those to tell you that we are going to grow production over the next three years safely by over 7%.  Now, hopefully we will conclude projects domestically and elsewhere that have very good returns as we demand, although the growth rate could be faster.  So, increased capital should always be understood in the case of Oxy to mean higher growth and projects that have outstanding returns.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I just had a quick follow-up on the comments throughout the presentation on strategic acquisitions.  It really does strike me that with this kind of organic growth and Steve as you put it in the last meeting, doing more with what you've got and the opportunity now and the buyback, your comments on bigger deals.  By strategic you're really &#x2013; we're talking pretty small, is that a fair interpretation in terms of what your appetite is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Given where the stock is, it would be challenging to find a sizeable acquisition that was -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gives us better return than lying around .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just hard -- I'm not saying it's impossible, I just don't have one in my mind right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have the returns on the oil side; again doing more with what you've got, seem to be great, certainly relative to even the gas plays and acreage opportunities that are out there.  Do you have any thoughts or comments on gas versus oil in terms of...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We -- they're just about money. I don't believe in six to one as you I'm sure know, but sort of ten to one, it's really about money.  We're very pleased with the Piceance play. That's developing very nicely, the production is coming along, the reserve booking is coming along.  The supply, being able to ship it at low differentials is coming along. There's a lot of acreage that we have, and so we're very pleased with that gas play. We think there's some nice gas plays in the Permian that we haven't really worked on much. We think we'll do okay over there.</p>
          <p>Going to fool around with stuff, if you look at acquisitions, just say, well why are you acquiring it? You're acquiring it because you have expertise to make it work. There are other companies that have better expertise than we do in some of these plays. So I think what's, where the stock price is today, pretty hard to make a sizable thing like that work. You do have to move the needle on these numbers to spend that kind of money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, and again going back to California and some of the newer zones that you're targeting within the shales, et cetera, I know it's light oil. Is the gas-oil ratio any different from what you've seen in the conventional?</p>
