        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is <mark type="ph" /> Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to Randy Burkhalter. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you,. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss results for our third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our speakers today will be Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's General Partner, followed by Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and CFO. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance.</p>
          <p>During this call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>And Tiffany, before I turn it over to Mike, how's the quality of the call? Can you hear us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You are coming through loud and clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy.</p>
          <p>And before I start, I'd like to let all of our friends in the Northeast know that our thoughts are with you. We know what it's like to go through a hurricane and how much damage and destruction they can cause and you just got hit by the largest hurricane to ever have been formed in the Atlantic Basin. All of us at Enterprise are wishing the best for you and your families and a speedy recovery for the affected areas.</p>
          <p>Moving onto earnings, we are pleased to report strong results again this quarter with four of our five business segments showing improved performance over the third quarter of 2011. Record onshore crude oil and natural gas transportation volumes, record fee-based natural gas processing volumes, and near-record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes led to $167 million or a 17% increase in gross operating margin to a record $1.14 billion, compared to $973 million in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our NGL Pipelines &amp; Services segment accounted for $68 million of this increase, with substantially all of the increase attributable to our fee-based NGL Pipelines, Storage, Export and Fractionation businesses. Our Mont Belvieu fractionators reported an $18 million increase in gross operating margin, primarily due to our fifth NGL fractionator that began service in October of last year.</p>
          <p>Our South Texas NGL pipelines, including our new Eagle Ford NGL pipeline that began service in April of this year, reported a $16 million increase, while the Mid-America and Seminole systems reported a $15 million increase. Our NGL Storage, Export Terminal and related facilities had a $19 million increase compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margins from our Natural Gas Processing and NGL Marketing business increased by $4 million for the quarter compared to last year. Our fee-based processing volumes increased 17% to a record 4.5 billion cubic feet a day, while our equity NGL volumes decreased 13%. This shift reflected a desire by producers to retain the value of their NGL production and the associated commodity risk to increase their return on investment. We view this development as a win-win. It provides producers with a greater economic incentive to drill and provides Enterprise with an increase in fee-based volume <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:54).</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines &amp; Services segment reported a $50 million (sic) [$51 million] (3:59) increase in gross operating margins compared to the third quarter of 2011, on record pipeline volumes of 820,000 barrels per day. Our South Texas crude oil pipeline system, including the new 24-inch pipeline from Lyssy to Sealy that began service in June of this year, accounted for $20 million of this increase [ph] for a (4:18) 75,000 barrel per day increase in volume.</p>
          <p>Our share of Seaway's earnings increased by $18 million with a full quarter of revenues after the reversal of the pipeline that flows out of the South of Cushing to the Texas Gulf Coast. We also had record Onshore Natural Gas transportation volumes this quarter, up 14.2 trillion Btus per day, which led to a $28 million increase in gross operating margins from our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services segment, compared to the third quarter of 2011. This segment continues to benefit from the Acadian Haynesville Extension pipeline that began service in November of 2011, as well as from increased Eagle Ford production that feeds our Texas <mark type="ph" /> Intrastate System (4:56).</p>
          <p>Our Petrochemical &amp; Refined Product Services segment reported a $37 million (sic) [$36 million] (3:59) increase in gross operating margins for the third quarter of 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear it any better now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes. That's much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good.</p>
          <p>Talking about the Haynesville Extension Pipeline that begins service in 2011, and the Eagle Ford production that feeds our Texas Intrastate System has added to the profitability of that segment. Our Petrochemical &amp; Refined Product Services segment reported a $37 million (sic) [$36 million] (5:36) increase in gross operating margin for the third quarter of 2012 compared to last year. $24 million of this increase was attributable to proceeds we received in connection with a settlement of certain litigation in our Marine business.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the increase in this segment was the result of higher propylene fractionation margins, increased octane enhancement sales margins, improved segment results from Marine transportation.</p>
          <p>Enterprise generated distributable cash flow of $743 million for the third quarter of this year, providing 1.3 times coverage of the cash distribution declared with respect to the quarter. Distributable cash flow was reduced by $70 million from the loss of a settlement of interest rate hedges associated with our issuance of senior notes in the quarter. Excluding this loss and the $24 million benefit from the litigation settlement, distributable cash flow would have been $789 million and provided 1.4 times coverage.</p>
          <p>We retained $177 million of distributable cash flow this quarter to reinvest in the growth of the partnership and to reduce our reliance on the capital markets. We continue to complete capital projects on time and on-budget or under-budget, and the ramp-up of volumes on these new assets is generally meeting or exceeding our expectations.</p>
          <p>Through the first nine months of this year, $1.7 billion of organic-growth capital projects commenced operations, and another $1.3 billion of projects are expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter. In 2013, we expect to complete an additional $2.4 billion of capital projects.</p>
          <p>In total, we have approximately $7.9 billion of growth projects under construction that are scheduled to be completed between now and the first half of 2015. Revenues from these projects are predominantly fee-based and are supported by long-term contracts, and Jim will provide an update on these projects later in the call.</p>
          <p>In September, we recommended that our board raise the quarterly cash distribution for the third and fourth quarters of 2012 by 6.1% and 6.5%, respectively, over the same quarters of last year. Last month, the board approved the first of these two recommendations by increasing the cash distribution to $0.65 per unit with respect to the third quarter. This is our 33rd consecutive quarterly distribution increase. Our second recommendation to increase the quarterly distribution with respect to the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.66 per unit &#x2013; will be considered by the board at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p>We've taken steps in recent years to streamline and simplify our organizational structure in order to be more transparent to investors, to remove potential conflicts of interest, and reduce public company overload. With the help of our general partner, we also eliminated all of the incentive distribution rights it once held, and now Enterprise has one of the lowest costs of capital in the MLP sector.</p>
          <p>This clearly is a long-term benefit to investors in our common units and our debt securities. We want you to be able to focus on our business and growth opportunities, rather than trying to decipher the added complexity of a web of <mark type="ph" /> leverage-related qualities factored by each other (8:33). Having once had a complicated structure, we believe simple is better.</p>
          <p>We'd like to thank our debt and equity investors and our bankers for their continued support. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike.</p>
          <p>This year, we've been pretty busy, and that's reflected in all the major projects that we have recently completed or we have under construction.</p>
          <p>Out West, we're building our Texas Express Pipeline, which will be on in the second quarter of next year, our Front Range Pipeline, which will be on in the fourth quarter of next year and our Rocky Mountain Mid-America Pipeline expansion, which will be on in the first quarter of 2014. These pipelines will have a total combined initial capacity of 465,000 barrels a day with significant expansion capability. They will serve the Niobrara, Granite Wash, West Texas Permian, Mid-Continent and <mark type="ph" /> Dominicus (9:31). Our ATEX ethane pipeline is under construction. We expect that in service in the second quarter of 2014. It will have approximately 200,000 barrels a day of capacity.</p>
          <p>In Mont Belvieu, we are commissioning as we speak our sixth fractionation train and our trains seven and eight are under construction. They're expected to be online by the fourth quarter of next year. By the end of next year, Enterprise will have over 1.1 million barrels a day of fractionation capacity companywide with somewhere between 615,000 and 700,000 barrels a day at Mont Belvieu. Also at Mont Belvieu, we are finishing our rebuild and upgrade of our west storage facility which we expect online next month, which will give us added operational and commercial flexibility in storing and meeting more volumes.</p>
          <p>In the Eagle Ford, our Yoakum trains one and two are running and they're both exceeding our design specs. And train three will be on in the first quarter of 2013. NGL and natural gas pipelines and storage projects that support these three plants have either been put into service or are nearing completion. Phase One of the Seaway crude oil reversal came online in June of this year. Seaway will be fully reversed by the first quarter of next year and the loop will be completed by the first quarter of 2014. And that pipeline will have 850,000 barrels a day of capacity. Our 150 mile pipeline and associated 2.5 million barrels of storage out of South Texas which support the Eagle Ford crude oil production was recently put into service and our 180 mile joint venture line <mark type="ph" /> with Wangs coming out of Gardendale (11:25) is currently under construction.</p>
          <p>We are in the process of bringing the first phase of our ECHO terminal into service which initially includes three 250,000 barrel tanks for this first phase, with an ultimate capacity of six million barrels when fully built-out, and we are in fact in the permitting process for that. As a matter of fact, we are introducing first oil into ECHO today. When our crude oil pipelines are complete, we'll be able to move Seaway and Eagle Ford crudes into ECHO and have access to all Houston area refineries and all Beaumont/Port Arthur area refineries given these pipelines' access to over 7.5 million barrels a day of Gulf Coast refining capacity.</p>
          <p>Our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:21) dock expansion is nearing completion. We expect to increase our export volumes from our current 40 million barrels a year to approximately 60 million barrels a year. And last but not least, we are beginning construction of our propane dehydrogenation plant at Mont Belvieu, which we expect online in 2015.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, we've brought on eight projects, totaling over $1.5 billion. Six of those we're either ahead of schedule or on time, two are one to two months late, but most important, in total we were 4.5% below budget. The earnings performance we announce today and the list of projects that I went through demonstrate that our businesses and our employees continue to deliver. The industry continues to present opportunities on both the supply and demand side of the equation. It's an exciting time to be part of this industry and exciting to be working for Enterprise.</p>
          <p>I believe in the future we're going to see a lot of opportunities on the demand side of the equation. <mark type="ph" /> As far as products (13:33), crude oil prices have been relatively stable in spite of some really divergent fundamentals. Both in the U.S. and Canada, producers continue to find and develop new supplies and refiners are positioned to be able to process more domestic crude. The growing supplies that exist north of Cushing, in the Eagle Ford and in the Permian, and trucking imports confirm that the crude oil infrastructure that we are building will play a key role in the changing flow patterns for years to come. Natural gas prices included a rebound from the very low levels of early summer and the price collapse that most predicted, including us, was averted with low prices creating significant additional demand through strong coal-to-gas switching.</p>
          <p>For Enterprise, our Texas and Louisiana assets, including Haynesville, continue to perform better than expected. Our gas assets <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:39) by <mark type="ph" /> firm demand fees (14:41). And also, incremental purchase and sales and incremental fees contributed to the flexibility around our interconnects for creating more value.</p>
          <p>Looking to the future of natural gas, we have direct access to growing industrial markets and power generators all along the Gulf Coast. We see significant growth potential in markets near our assets in both Texas and Louisiana, and this is a function of the globally competitive price of natural gas.</p>
          <p>NGL processing margins continue to be depressed, especially for ethane. In general, the demand for ethane is meeting our projections in both the near term and with all the new build announcements. But with most drilling now concentrated on rich gas and oil, supplies have exceeded our expectations. That said, ethane cracking is clearly the most profitable feedstock of petrochemicals, and we don't need to look at too many of their presentations and press releases to realize that they get it</p>
          <p>Because I know we are likely to get questions about ethane, yes, it appears ethane will be oversupplied until new-build ethylene plants come online. We don't see the $0.50 a gallon ethane margin we enjoyed last year. That oversupply will be mitigated by fewer turnarounds in 2013 by ethylene plants, by less propane inventory <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:04) because of increased exports.</p>
          <p>Propane enjoyed increased demand as a feedstock this past summer, and for export, as these factors kept the summer inventory builds at much lower levels than many were predicting.</p>
          <p>Demand for domestic propane in the export market, which was already strong, has gotten better, with demand for spot barrels and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:32) continuing to be strong not just this year, but for several years out.</p>
          <p>Refined product inventory, both motor gasoline and distillates, are low because of strong global demand and refinery outages, including Hurricane Isaac and now Sandy. As a result, demand for butanes, natural gasoline, and specialty fuels has been brisk, and we continue to enjoy both short-term and long-term demand for these products, and our assets are realizing premium values <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:04).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I've said that the next wave of opportunities for Enterprise could be on the demand side of the equation. Our PDH project is an excellent example of this and an excellent fit with our existing operational and commercial capabilities. But more importantly, it demonstrates how Enterprise's position continues to provide the link between clinical and growing NGL supplies and growing opportunities in petrochemicals. In summary, as fundamentals change, we continue to find ways to increase our contribution along the value chain whether it be in NGLs <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:58), natural gas, petrochemicals or in exports. We have a lot going on with the Eagle Ford buildout, our Western <mark type="ph" /> NGL (18:03) pipelines, our fractionation trains at Mont Belvieu, Seaway, our ECHO terminal and our expanding export capabilities in PDH. We've gotten a lot done over the last few quarters with projects that fit our capabilities. But as Mike pointed out, there is plenty to be done and new opportunities are on the horizon.</p>
          <p>Our footprint, our strong customer focus, our employees and our reputation will allow us to capture even more opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim.</p>
          <p>I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss some additional items on the income statement as far as we reported net income of $588 million and earnings per unit of $0.66 per unit. That's on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of 2012. Net income and earnings per unit were reduced by $43 million or approximately $0.05 per unit on a fully diluted basis for non-cash asset impairment charges. Most of these charges were related to small pipelines located in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Net income and EPU included the $24 million or $0.03 per unit benefit from the settlement of a litigation in our Marine business. G&amp;A expense was $41 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $50 million for the third quarter of 2011. The primary reason for the decrease was $10 million of merger related expenses recorded in the third quarter of last year with respect to the merger of Duncan Energy Partners. In terms of interest expense, it increased to $200 million this quarter from $189 million recorded in the third quarter of last year primarily due to an increase in our average debt principal outstanding.</p>
          <p>Provision for income taxes decreased $9 million due to a decrease in Texas margin tax expense accruals this quarter. We spent $1.1 billion in capital expenditures this quarter, including approximately $1 billion on growth capital investments. We're on track to invest approximately $4 billion in growth capital projects this year, having invested $2.8 billion in growth capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2012. Sustaining capital expenditures were $102 million this quarter. It now looks like we will come in at around $330 million to $340 million for sustained CapEx in 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of capitalization, adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 2012 was $4.4 billion. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt principal to adjusted EBITDA was 3.45 times for the twelve months ended September 30. And this adjusts debt for 50% equity treatment of the hybrid securities. We accessed the debt and equity capital markets for $2.4 billion of capital in the third quarter to fund our growth projects. We had strong demand for our senior notes offering in August. We issued $650 million of three-year notes at 1.25% interest and $1.1 billion of 30-year notes at <mark type="ph" /> 4.45% (21:34). Both of these issues have traded <mark type="ph" /> idle since offering (21:36).</p>
          <p>Also in the third quarter, we raised approximately $600 million of equity through aggregate sale of 11.6 million common units through an overnight offering, our ATM program and our distribution reinvestment plan. The average life of our debt is now 12.9 years using the first call date for the hybrids. And our effective average cost of debt is 5.6%, and this was all as of September 30, 2012. During the third quarter, we also established a commercial paper program in August that allows us to issue up to $2 billion of short term promotional paper notes backed by our $3.5 billion multi-year credit facility. The program is rated A2/P2. Any commercial paper notes issued under this program will be treated as senior unsecured obligations. To date, no notes have been issued under this program.</p>
          <p>At September 30, we had consolidated liquidity of approximately $3.4 billion, which includes the availability under our credit facility as well as unrestricted cash.</p>
          <p>And with that, Randy, I think we're ready for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Couple questions for you. First, I want to go back to the comments that you made regarding the short term outlook around the ethane market in pricing. A couple things to point out. It looks like you've got a handful of crackers that are going to be coming back up online in the next couple months. So ethane demand should increase, but at the same time we've got north of 30 million barrels of ethane in inventory and we're probably rejecting somewhere between 100,000 or 125,000 barrels a day when you look at the Rockies and the Mid-Continent. So I'm wondering if all these things happen as you kind of described, what do you think happens to Mont Belvieu ethane pricing over the next couple of months? And more importantly, the spread between Belvieu and Conway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think the spread between Belvieu and Conway is until the more pipelines are in place. So I don't think that changes that significantly. What was your other question? What happens to the ethane price at Mont Belvieu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's just say demand goes to 1 million or 1.1 million barrels a day in November or December, we start drawing down inventories. Do you think there's a tailwind to ethane pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, it could be, Darren. It's really, you're not going to have the overhang of propane from a mild winter. So I don't believe you're going to have propane competing with ethane as a cracker feedstock. We're going to export a heck of a lot more barrels next year than we did this year. So by definition, theoretically, you had ought to get a little bit of a tailwind. I'm just saying it's not going to get you back to those margins that we enjoyed last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Jim, how do I think about your ability from an equity NGL prospective to be long Conway and sell Belvieu pricing to maximize the profitability coming out of the tailgate of Meeker and Pioneer. How do I think about that over the next couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say that again, Darren?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your ability to be long Conway ethane at depressed pricing and sell it at Belvieu prices, pick up the margin, effectively pay yourself on the transport from Conway down to Belvieu. I'm just trying to think about the opportunity cost or potential upside in opportunity processing that we could get from Meeker and Pioneer in the fourth quarter? Maybe even in the first quarter next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we look at every day is, and we crunch this constantly, we're looking at where do we make the most money across the system. So if we make more money, rejecting ethane at Meeker and buying EP at Conway and selling Mont Belvieu because it frees up the pipeline capacity, that's what we do. I don't know if that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm just trying to quantify the potential upside there. But that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We try to quantify that every day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I know you keep it close to the vest, that's okay. Last question, and this is intriguing. This goes back to your comment about the next wave of opportunities here on the demand side. When do you start thinking about the potential for butane dehydrogenation if you do to capitalize on either the butadiene or butylene demand or maybe even more isomerization capacity to arb the normal isobutane spread recognizing that it's seasonal? Is that what you were talking about, Jim? Or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're pretty good, Darren. We did our PDH plant because we got customers that recognized that they wanted an on-purpose supply in their portfolio. I think we were public that we were promoting the same thing in terms of on-purpose butadiene. Those customers have not crossed the threshold of recognizing that they want on-purpose butadiene. However, butadiene is a co-product out of crackers. At some point, in my mind, they're going to recognize that need.</p>

It's not a big project. But what we found out there is we're stretched to the limit on trucks. And we're constantly battling to get our loads on the books down. So West Texas, I don't know what the results were, but our volumes are strong. Of course in the Eagle Ford, they're strong and, Robbie, Mid-Continent Oklahoma?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In the Bakken we don't really have any pipeline assets. We have a trucking company and they've done pretty good up there. I can't remember how many barrels a day we're handling, but, Mike, we've doubled our truck fleet up there in just 18 months?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you see the same thing in Bakken as you do in Texas is that there's a shortage of trucks, but we don't want to ramp up our truck capacity and be long trucks when pipelines come on line. So there is a bit of a balancing act there.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't know. We've got a couple of big things that we're doing with the Seaway pipeline in terms of expanding existing capacity and looping it. The ECHO terminal has a lot of potential. We've got the capacity to get up to six million barrels of storage capacity. We'll see where it takes us, but Robbie's continuing to look for additional ways to spend money on that business.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last one from me, in the press release you mentioned and you've commented previously that your fee-based cash flow mix obviously is growing with the organic projects coming online. You mentioned the fee-based mix will exceed 80% in 2014. As you look to 2014 and 2015, I mean, roughly what's your thought process of how much above 80% do you think the fee-based cash flow mix could be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we need to update those numbers. I think they're a bit stale and I think our fee-based cash flows are going to be higher than we previously indicated, primarily because we've got some producers that have elected to redo their contracts, as we said before, to retain the NGL upside from their production. And as a result we're moving from some keep-whole contracts to more fee-based contracts. So that's been fairly recent, but we'll update those numbers and have more guidance on that probably the next conference call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry about that. Just picking up on the last comment from Mike there in terms of the shift away from keep-whole, is that something where you're actively out there renegotiating these keep-whole contracts? Or is it more you're just letting the contracts roll off and then they're switching to fee-based? I'm just trying to get the sense of the trajectory of how the contract mix is changing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think this is really producer dependent. If you have producers that have keep-whole contracts and their economics are really based just on natural gas, there's not a lot of incentive for them to drill. So this is an opportunity where it provides them some economic incentive. It provides us something in terms of more stable cash flows. It really is a win-win, but it's not something that we're going out and beating on every customer that we have. We're talking to people and when they want to talk about reforming their contracts, we're certainly will to listen to them and do something that works for both of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the distribution policy, I guess I was a little unclear on the language. You'd said a special increase of a half a penny here this quarter and next quarter. How should we think about that? Is that something that's going to be then a discretionary increase we'll get and you'll just make that decision every quarter? Or is this something that you can continue at this higher level of quarterly increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the way to think about it is if we had just increased it by $0.01 for the quarter, we'd have been at $0.645 and we're trying to get rid of the half cent just to make it easy for us and for our investors. And so we think good round numbers is good; it's part of our simplification project.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. Okay. So special, but &#x2013; okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It resets the distribution to $0.65 and that's where it's going to be until the next increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. That's fine. And then last one for me is just there's another MLP out there that's talking about doing ethane export and realizing this is Marcellus and it's kind of challenged in terms of weight with ethane. But is it something you'd even consider doing along the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We consider anything if we can make money at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ted, I think one of things that we think about in the Gulf Coast is that with ethane supply is there, petrochemicals are going to build new assets where the supply is, why spend the extra money to export it someplace else? And that's what we're seeing the petrochemicals do. If you look at kind of the numbers that we've been hearing about for theoretical ethane exports, it's twice the cost that it would cost somebody to move it by pipe, by our pipe down to the Gulf Coast. So we think we've got a better solution, but as Jim said, if somebody's willing to pay the freight to have us construct an export facility and enter into a long-term contract and provide the right returns, it's something we'd consider.</p>

          <p>You've got to remember who are some of our key customers. Our key customers are the U.S. petrochemicals. And that's who we're primarily focused on serving.</p>
          <p>It's very expensive to export ethane. I'd rather some of those guys come build crackers <mark type="ph" /> in the U.S (34:56).</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Understood. I guess maybe thinking about &#x2013; you're bullish on the propane export market, though you just feel more limited export market for ethane. Is that also what you're coming down at?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm just curious, with all the construction projects, what kind of cost escalation are you seeing going on right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to turn it over to Leonard, but just in general, our projects have been coming in on-budget or under-budget, and we think it's because Leonard's figured out how to game the system. But, Leonard?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have been accused of sandbagging, but it's my position that we're just good.</p>
          <p>Actually, as far as labor or costs have gone, maybe 1% or 2% escalation, but nothing significant.</p>
          <p>I think we have an advantage because we have a very large number of projects, and we get some very favorable bids from our contractors. So we have really been benefiting from all of our activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, John, I think Mike mentioned that we had $1.7 billion worth of assets that have gone into service for the first nine months of this year, and those have come in, on average, about 4.5% under budget. So again, doing a great job in managing the cost.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Again, I think we have an advantage because when we call these contractors, they give us preference because they know that we'll have the work for them.</p>
          <p>A good example is we've had one set of contractors at Mont Belvieu building frac for the last four years. And they like that stability.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One of the problems is you're trying to figure out what is the right relationship.</p>
          <p>If you look historically, propane should be 65% to 75% of crude, but crude wasn't $100 a barrel. So as the price of crude goes up, the cost basis is still natural gas. So what is the norm in a relationship to crude, given this environment? And I'm not sure anybody knows at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So over the past &#x2013; call it six quarters &#x2013; you've had, I would call, way in excess of your coverage ratio of what you need to run your business comfortably. As we transition here into a lower NGL price environment &#x2013; and earlier, you said you're transitioning to an 80% fee-based business model &#x2013; how do we think about that coverage ratio and where you want to manage the business, after we undergo that transition fully?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bernie, we just announced an increase in the rate of growth in our distribution, so we've taken that into consideration. And if you look at our distribution coverage this quarter, it's 1.3x. We've talked about all of the capital we've got to spend the remainder of this year and next year, and frankly, through 2015. And we continue to find ways to develop more projects.</p>
          <p>So as we've talked about in the past, our ability to retain some of this cash flow for reinvestment in those projects reduces the capital churn that we'd otherwise have &#x2013; reduces our need to go and out issue new equity in the market. And we think it provides better long term returns for our investors.</p>
          <p>So I don't think you're ever going to see us at a point where we're at a 1x distribution coverage. And if anything, I think you see more MLPs being like us and retaining cash flow, because frankly, it makes financial sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Okay, and then change gears a little bit. If you think &#x2013; thinking about ATEX as it comes online, obviously it's going &#x2013; I think the tariff is around $0.15 on your contracted capacity. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. $0.14, $0.15, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems like with the amount of ethane that's expected to come from the Marcellus, that you're going to shift from a situation where the marginal barrel of ethane comes from the Northeast instead of the Rockies. And I was really kind of wondering thoughts about impact of what you thought of long-term floor prices of ethane could be, given that potentially that stuff's going to be coming from further away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what will flow in the Marcellus, until you see ethylene plant in new builds, I think what we have gotten subscribed is what will flow, because those are demand fees and that's sunk cost.</p>
          <p>I think marginal incremental supply above that is going to require more demand. Because you just nailed it. Our tariff is $0.15 and the frac fee up there is probably $0.07. So they got probably a $0.20, $0.22 hurdle before the next incremental barrel flows. And there's got to be a <mark type="ph" /> have a pipe (48:46) for that incremental barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if you think about, I guess that stuff is locked up, but any commentary on what the potential market rate on any excess capacity you may have on ATEX will be until it's completely full?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you have some excess capacity on ATEX and until you have that demand full from the Gulf Coast. Is that just going to be &#x2013; is there any prospect of us filling that up? Or is that 100% full at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've been public about what we've got in there. I think we peak at about 135,000, 140,000 barrels a day. We start out at about 75,000 barrels a day. No, I don't see any incentive for us to try to use our variable economics to increase flows down that pipeline. We've got a lot of production in the Yoakum and up in the Rockies. I don't see that.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what it's going to come on at is about 75,000 to 80,000 ramping up to somewhere in the neighborhood on our subscriptions of 135,000. 140,000 are in the ballpark in five years. And that's over a five year period. So in other words, you've got new ethylene plants by the time we're at the peak on our ramp.</p>
