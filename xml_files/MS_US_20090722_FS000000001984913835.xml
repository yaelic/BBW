        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today we will review our quarterly results and provide an update on our strategic initiatives.</p>
          <p>We remain firm in our view that 2009 is a year of transition, and the second quarter reflects that ongoing process. Our results show progress in this transition as we invest in talent, execute the joint venture with Smith Barney, and continue to turn around asset management.</p>
          <p>A number of noteworthy items resulted in a loss of $1.37 per share from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30 including: negative revenue of $2.3 billion from the narrowing of Morgan Stanley's debt related credit spreads impacting earnings per share by $1.32; an $850 million accelerated amortization charge resulting from our repurchase of the top related Series D preferred stock, impacting earnings per share by $0.74; and a 202 million charge relating to the partial redemption of the Series C preferred stock issued to MUFG [Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group] in exchange for its purchase of Morgan Stanley's common stock, impacting earnings per share by $0.17.</p>
          <p>Other items incurred during the quarter were: $734 million in firm-wide real estate losses, $245 million in integration related costs associated with the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, and a $33 million expense related to the FDIC special assessment.</p>
          <p>Discontinued operations included the results of MSCI [Morgan Stanley Capital International] including a $310 million after-tax gain on its sale.</p>
          <p>This quarter we continued to focus on risk adjusted returns. Whilst I will address our relative underperformance on fixed income later in this discussion, we continue to be well positioned for a recovery in the global capital markets and are not limited by a large loan portfolio or direct consumer exposure.</p>
          <p>On May 31, ahead of schedule, we closed the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, creating a new global leader in wealth management. In June, we also announced further details of our global strategic alliance with MUFG. We are collaborating on corporate and investment banking through a loan marketing joint venture in the US and business referral arrangements in Europe and Asia. And we created a referral agreement to provide Morgan Stanley's commodity products to MUFG's global customer base. We believe these initiatives will offer us greater lending capacity and expand our institutional client base, especially in Asia.</p>
          <p>We are currently in the process of turning around Asset Management. We have examined the scale, expense, structure, and performance issues of each business and are now executing the optimization of these distinct businesses. In November, we committed to $2 billion in firm-wide cost savings for 2009. We reduced compensation expenses by 1.2 billion from head count reductions primarily taken in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now with the joint venture closed with the opportunity in the marketplace, we are taking advantage of the market dislocation and hiring strategically. We have added talent within Fixed Income, Derivatives, Prime Brokerage, Investment Banking, and Asset Management, and continue to invest in our people.</p>
          <p>With the inclusion of the joint venture with Smith Barney in our consolidated results, our recurring non-compensation expenses are going to be higher. We had committed to a reduction of $800 million in recurring non-comp expenses for 2009. Through the first half of this year, we made significant progress towards this goal. Excluding the present impairment, Smith Barney operating expenses, and joint venture integration costs, we have reduced our recurring non-comp expenses by nearly $600 million year to date. We remain focused on identifying and reducing expenses.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our consolidated results, we continue to demonstrate leadership in our businesses including Investment Banking, Credit Trading, and Global Wealth Management. If you turn to page two in our financial supplement, firm-wide revenues of $5.4 billion included the negative impact of $2.3 billion, as stated earlier, from the tightening of Morgan Stanley's credit spreads on certain long-term debt carried at fair value. Revenues included Smith Barney's contribution to the joint venture for the month of June. Results also included net losses on firm-wide real estate expenses aggregating to $734 million.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses were 6 billion, up over 50% from the first quarter, largely driven by compensation as we continue to invest in our people and talent, as I discussed earlier. Non-interest expenses also increased due to the inclusion of both compensation and non-compensation expenses from Smith Barney. We continue to accrue compensation based on our estimate of full-year needs and competitive market pressures.</p>
          <p>Non-compensation expenses were 2.2 billion, up 19% from last quarter, driven by as I said a number of discrete items including integration costs of the joint venture, charges related to occupancy, and the FDIC special assessment.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page three in the financial supplement, after significantly reducing our balance sheet in 2008, total assets increased to 677 billion at June 30, of which $158 billion is our liquidity pool. This is primarily driven by the increase in our client financing businesses and the addition of assets from Smith Barney. We continue to keep a significant portion of our balance sheet in cash and equivalents as we believe maintaining strong liquidity is prudent in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratios demonstrate the exceptional strength of our balance sheet. While we are still finalizing our calculations, we believe our Tier 1 ratio under Basel I will be 15.8%. Risk weighted assets are expected to be approximately $277 billion at June 30, and we expect our Tier 1 common ratio to be 8.3%, and our tangible common equity to risk weighted asset ratio to be 10.4%. Level 3 assets were $61 billion at June 30, representing approximately 9% of total assets.</p>
          <p>Now we turn to the businesses, starting with page five of the supplement and Institutional Securities. Revenues of $3 billion include the $2.3 billion negative impact of credit spreads discussed earlier. Principal investment revenues were negative $183 million. Write-downs of 285 million in real estate limited partnership interests were partially offset by gains in corporate private equity investments. Non-interest expenses were 3.3 billion in the second quarter, off 58% from the first quarter, primarily on higher compensation. The business reported after all this a pre-tax loss of $307 million.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Investment Banking on page six, our franchise reaffirmed its leadership position in the second quarter across M&amp;A and equity and debt products and delivered a very strong performance. We were number one in announced global M&amp;A and advised on four of the top five in eight of the top ten announced transactions in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Significant second quarter advisory assignments included amongst many others, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton's $58 billion joint venture and DIRECTV's $14.5 billion merger with Liberty Media. This quarter, we gained share across capital markets, leading to significant deals and demonstrated execution strength. We were a leader in helping financial institutions recapitalize, including equity capital raises for US Bancorp, State Street, and SunTrust.</p>
          <p>We continue to lead significant deals in July, including advising General Motors in its emergence from bankruptcy and Rio Tinto's 15.2 billion rights issue.</p>
          <p>Second quarter Investment Banking revenues of 1.1 billion were up 38% from the first quarter of this year on strength in underwriting across all regions and exclude fees associated with the issuance of our own equity and debt. Advisory revenues declined 35% sequentially as overall M&amp;A market volumes remain subdued.</p>
          <p>Equity underwriting revenues nearly tripled from the first quarter of this year on a surge in volumes, driven primarily by the recapitalizations in financial institutions and REITs.</p>
          <p>Fixed income underwriting revenues increased over 60% from the first quarter on higher investment grade, high yield, and municipal bond issuance.</p>
          <p>Equity sales and trading revenues of $681 million were negatively impacted by 757 million from the narrowing of debt related credit spreads on firm issued structured notes. Cash equity revenues were up 11% from the first quarter of '09 on higher commissions across all regions. Derivatives reported lower revenues, down 13% sequentially, as decreased volatility created fewer trading opportunities, partially offset by higher client activity. Prime Brokerage revenues improved 50% sequentially from a shift in balance mix and increasing client balances. Average client balances increased 10% from last quarter while balances in our top 50 accounts increased 16%.</p>
          <p>Fixed income sales and trading revenues of $973 million included losses of $1.3 billion on the narrowing of credit spreads on firm issued structured notes. Excluding this DVA [Debt Valuation Adjustment], fixed income sales and trading revenues were up modestly from the first quarter of '09 as weakness in the commodities muted the results reported by interest rates, credit, and currency. We were more constructive in the fixed income markets in the second quarter as evidenced by our strong results in credit trading. However, we have seen some relative underperformance in other areas.</p>
          <p>We are actively investing in our businesses and aggressively hiring key talent. Earlier this week, we announced that Jack DiMaio, a recognized name in fixed income, will be joining Morgan Stanley as Global Head of Interest Rate, Credit and Currency Trading. We believe Jack is ideally suited to help us drive improved performance in our Fixed Income business as we look to further strengthen our client flow businesses.</p>
          <p>Commodities reported weaker revenues consistent with the typical seasonal pattern. Despite the weakness this year &#x2013; this quarter, year-to-date results are 6% ahead of last year. Excluding the DVA and commodities, fixed income revenues were up over 35% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Interest rate credit and currency trading revenues combined were up 16% sequentially on higher activity levels. Interest rate products reported a strong quarter, driven by market volatility.</p>
          <p>Credit trading revenues were up 12% sequentially. Within credit trading, credit corporates had a standout quarter with revenues up 92% from the first quarter of this year, primarily from investment grade and distressed trading as the credit markets remained volatile and we increased market share.</p>
          <p>Currencies reported consistent revenues driven by market volatility. On a year-to-date basis, interest rate credit and currency trading revenues combined were up 54%, with interest rate products up 99% and credit trading up 87%.</p>
          <p>Detailed on pages 14, 15, and 16 of the financial supplement are our mortgage related gross and net exposures. Aggregate mortgage related net exposures were reduced from 9.1 billion to 7.9 billion during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Other sales and trading revenues benefited from spread tightening and valuation gains in our lending business which includes leveraged acquisition finance and relationship lending. Net gains in this quarter were approximately 600 million. However, these gains were offset by the combined impact of tightening credit spreads of Morgan Stanley's debt related to CIC's [China Investment Corporation] investment of 195 million and other losses from hedging activities.</p>
          <p>Total average trading and non-trading Value at Risk [VAR] increased $154 million from $142 million last quarter, reflecting an increase in our non-trading VAR. Non-trading VAR increased to 108 million from 83 million, primarily as the result of increased lending exposure on higher market valuations. Average trading VAR declined to 113 million from 115 million, reflecting small declines in interest rate and commodity risk.</p>
          <p>Turning to page eight of the supplement in our Global Wealth Management business, the results of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture are now fully consolidated within this segment effective with its closing on May 31. Accordingly, this quarter included the joint venture results for the month of June as such comparisons to prior periods are not meaningful. Revenues were stable and consistent despite the slowdown in the retail market.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses were 2 billion and included approximately $245 million of JV related integration costs, of which 124 million is compensation for replacement awards for Smith Barney employees contributed to the joint venture. The cost of these replacement awards was fully allocated to Citigroup's non-controlling interest, although they do appear in our compensation expenses. Non-interest expenses also reflect $33 million of amortization of the previous announced FA retention awards, 29 million of amortization of intangibles related to the joint venture transaction, and a $25 million FDIC special assessment charge on deposits.</p>
          <p>The business reported a pre-tax loss of 71 million. Excluding the JV related integration costs, PBT was 174 million while PBT margin was 9%.</p>
          <p>On page nine, you can see the quarterly productivity metrics of the business. Prior periods have not been restated. The number of FAs is 18,444, and total client assets were 1.4 trillion. Net new asset outflows of $2 billion reflect continued outflows from legacy Smith Barney that are trending down from recent highs. Deposits in our bank deposit program now total $106 billion, of which just over 50 billion is held by Morgan Stanley banks.</p>
          <p>Turning to Asset Management on page 10 of the supplement, Asset Management had a pre-tax loss of $239 million, driven by real estate related losses within Merchant Banking, including a $111 million pre-tax loss in Crescent. Core Asset Management was profitable for the second consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall for the segment, revenues of $575 million increased significantly from the first quarter of '09, and were primarily driven by gains in SIVs, gains in investments in our private equity and alternative products, as well as gains on investments made in association with our employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans.</p>
          <p>Principal investment revenues included gains in our private equity, alternatives, and other seed investments, partially offset by $154 million in real estate losses, of which 16 million are related to Crescent financial assets.</p>
          <p>Principal trading revenues were negative in the quarter as mark-to-market losses of $131 million on a lending facility to a real estate fund sponsored by the firm and other real estate investment hedging losses were partially offset by a $128 million gain on the disposition of our remaining SIV positions that have been reflected on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Management and administration fees were 7% higher on a sequential basis, driven by a more favorable asset mix despite near flat average asset balances.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses for Asset Management increased 29% from last quarter and include a $38 million impairment charge related to Crescent. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and higher revenues. Non-compensation expenses decreased 14% sequentially on lower impairment charges.</p>
          <p>Turning to pages 11 and 12 of the supplement, you can see the assets under management and asset flow data. Total assets under management increased to $361 billion during the quarter as market appreciation of 30 billion was partially offset by 25 billion in net asset outflows. Nearly all of the quarterly outflows were in our core business, primarily from fixed income funds which include our money market funds, which are the preponderance. The outflows in long-term fixed income are related to our past performance issues. As we reported last quarter, we continue to see our performance improve in these products.</p>
          <p>Outflows in equity are primarily related to manager changes and certain mandates moving from actively managed to passive products. We continue to see improved performance in our equity products, evidenced by an increase in the percent of assets performing in the top half of Lipper one and three-year categories.</p>
          <p>Now we turn to page 17 of our financial supplement and look at our firm-wide real estate exposures. Our real estate gross asset exposure as reflected in our statement of financial condition, which includes Crescent and other consolidated interests, investments in real estate and infrastructure funds, and bridge financing was 4.6 billion at the end of the quarter, down from 4.9 billion at the end of last quarter. Including 1.7 billion of contractual commitments and other arrangements with respect to these investments, our total exposure would be $6.3 billion. This exposure excludes assets in investments for the benefit of certain deferred employee compensation or co-investment plans.</p>
          <p>Now in summary, a few words on the outlook. As I said, 2009 continues to be a year of transition. There is some evidence of improving economic conditions, and we have become more constructive on the market. However, housing markets continue to be challenged, and we expect deleveraging will be a multiyear process as US consumers undergo a shift in their behavior.</p>
          <p>But there are bullish factors as well. Capacity has left our industry. Corporates need to re-equitize, refinance, and re-lever, and clients need to help in managing their risk. We are well positioned with a favorable business mix and limited consumer exposure.</p>
          <p>This quarter we did achieve a number of successes. In June, we were among the first financial institutions to repay TARP. Post-repayment, our capital ratios continue to be industry leading, and we are operating with excess capital. In May and June, we successfully completed two equity capital raises and two unguaranteed debt offerings. Morgan Stanley's brand and client franchise were reaffirmed by the robust investor demand which included our international partners in Japan, (MUFG) and China (CIC).</p>
          <p>We are hiring in line with our strategic goal, and we will continue to invest in talent for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Institutional Securities, our core business, continues to demonstrate the strength of our leading client franchise. Investment Banking exhibited strength in underwriting. Prime Brokerage improves, launched a new custodial services through our trust company which will further drive continued gains in market share.</p>
          <p>Within Fixed Income, we had excellent results in credit trading, and we are focused on adding talent to grow revenues and improve results in other areas.</p>
          <p>Global Wealth Management posted solid results despite the challenging retail environment. The close of our joint venture with Smith Barney was successfully accelerated, and the integration is on track.</p>
          <p>We have established a multi-pronged approach to Fixed Asset management and have begun the execution phase. We merged two of our fund-to-fund businesses to form alternative investment partners with roughly 20 billion of alternative assets. This will drive expense efficiencies and ultimately improve margins.</p>
          <p>With innovative idea generation, leading sales and trading teams, trusted client relationships, and enhanced risk management, Morgan Stanley remains one of the only financial intermediaries with the scale, global footprint, and range of capital markets expertise sought by institutional and retail clients worldwide.</p>
          <p>Thank you. With that, I'll now take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of Banc of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Guy; how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. First of all, I was wondering if you can just walk through the components of the increases and decreases in book value per share over the quarter that allowed you to keep book value flat or actually slightly up in the quarter despite the fact that you had about $1.10 loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you begin with common equity of firm, as you know, 29 billion; you had dividends of 1.4 billion. You had the common stock offerings of 6.9 billion. You have the gain on the MSA, the JV, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV of 1.7, and you have a small amount of others of about 0.5 billion, the balance being interest, so you end up with 37 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And fundamentally, most of what offset the net loss must have been the joint venture gain which didn't go through the P&amp;L, right, because the share issuance you did was basically at or below book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just want to make sure that I understood that. Can you talk about the change in the capital allocations on a unit by unit basis?  Your institutional capital allocation fell by a couple billion. It went up by a couple billion in GWM. And your unallocated of course because of the capital raise went up by almost 4 billion. But in terms of the changes of the shift in the units, can you just talk about the increase in Global Wealth Management and the decrease in the institutional business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The increase in Global Wealth Management obviously is taking on board the assets from Smith Barney and the joint venture and the increase in risk weighted assets themselves. Within fixed income, within institutional securities, the slight decline actually is tied into the corollary of what happens with DVA, the debt valuation adjustment, as that comes back. So that is really what the delta is even though we took the balance sheet up, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but you didn't choose to roll any from the unallocated into the institutional business to make up for the DVA, and I'm just zeroing in on that, I guess. What's the thought process there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really a function of how much the business wanted to operate. So whilst we did increase VAR as a proxy for economic capital if you want in some of the businesses, in other areas we didn't take as much risk as we could have done, which I alluded to before, so it was flat. That's what happened. So we are positioned to put more capital into those businesses when we see the right returns on a risk adjusted basis. And obviously in investment grade trading, we did. In distressed debt, we did. We could have applied more capital into the business in for instance interest rates and foreign exchange.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we should watch that space as the new management takes hold in FIG [Fixed Income Group] it sounds like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would hope that we are going to be applying more capital to those businesses. Yes, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning to the joint venture, I was wondering if you could help us understand how much of the increase in net revenues that we saw versus last quarter came from the increase in FAs due to the joint venture closing in the beginning of June as we try to think about run rates for revenues, and the same question really for core expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's just very difficult to do that, and I don't want to establish that precedent as we actually do have now a joint venture. So what I'd rather do on a go-forward basis, Guy, is just plot it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. I guess my financial question is about the effective tax rate, 54%, and you talked about a change in the geographic mix and change in the use of tax credits. The geographic mix could be what it is, but 54% seems very high. Are you losing the usability of some tax credits or something that's driving that very high tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a gain, isn't it?  Even though we have losses, we'll be able to utilize tax credits in 2009 on a tax basis, so really it is a function of that. So the answer is no, we won't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Just piggybacking onto Wealth Management, I appreciate not carving out the relative contribution, maybe just a bottom line. If you look at the head count in terms of FAs, a little more than 10,000 added. I think Smith Barney had a lot more than that. I don't know if that's a timing thing or what contributes to that.</p>
          <p>And then part two of that would be is there any color commentary in terms of what pre-tax margins on any normalized basis look like inside Wealth Management, is it tracking according to plan?  There were some modest net outflows in the quarter. I'm just trying to get any commentary because it's a big part of your new identity. So I just &#x2013; any color would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very difficult, Glenn, and I'm not being evasive because we're trying to true up with the integration with the merger actually completing ahead of time. Obviously, we have some lag in Smith Barney as people are leaving and then coming in, and then we have the compensation cost which we are adjusting across.</p>
          <p>So the way I would answer it is we see nothing in the integration that would derail our view of the merger and the expected synergies in costs we would expect. Also, if I look at the numbers, if I look at the Global Wealth Management group itself, where we were in the add-ons, I don't see any discrepancy in the numbers as you've described. So I'd rather wait until next quarter when you can see it. Margins remain solid underlying this. What I don't want to do is to get into the trap of describing Morgan Stanley versus Smith Barney when it indeed is one company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No worries, we can move on. Inside Asset Management, the outflows are pretty brutal. You mentioned that there is a pretty comprehensive view on a piece-by-piece basis if you will within Asset Management and you're starting to execute on that. Is that something that would be shared with us, or are we &#x2013; just expect it to play out over time?  In other words, when there was a wealth management clean-up program in place when James [James P. Gorman] came on board, there was the pretty slide show that showed the next two to three years, and you guys executed awesome on it, right, and it was easy for us to track. My gut tells me Asset Management is going to be a little bit more underneath the covers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. Asset management, as you know, to talk about our Asset Management business, you're essentially talking about four businesses, so we have four plans, right?  The merchant banking business, which is primarily a real estate business, is suffering cyclical threats. I think we've been very open on that. Then you have the core business, institutional and equities, which we believe we have taken costs out of. We changed some management there.</p>
          <p>We got better managers in as well. Performance is improving. And there's the retail business itself, right, where we have some performance issues. But all of them have a common theme, which is cost control. I think we have agreed that Asset Management is strategically important to us, and what we will do is give you more color on that going forward as and when we make any deviation from that plan itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, cool. Maybe the last one is related to &#x2013; the comment you made on capacity has left, I agree, but it has only left certain parts of the business. For instance, where we all sit in cash equities, it's probably as bad as ever. So maybe as you re-shift and re-jigger on the heels of your RAROC announcement and everything, as you re-jigger what the FIG mostly but the whole ISG platform is going to be versus where capacity is left, I just don't know if capacity is left in the high risk weighted asset businesses, and therefore what you're building is actually &#x2013; capacity hasn't left that much. I don't know if that question makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it does make sense. I'm firmly of the opinion that capacity actually has gone out in the businesses that we actually have ourselves deemphasized, so structured products and things like that. I think the growth is coming in the traditional flow businesses, and we have been always well positioned for that. So I think we will do well, and that is built into our models.</p>
          <p>My concern about anything that moves away from flow structured is that it can bring with it quite a large regulatory tail risk in terms of recomputation of risk weighted assets, capital allocations, and so on. It's one of the reasons we're carrying some of the excess capital we're carrying. But I think we feel very confident. I mean if you go back through the last five decades, Morgan Stanley has always been in the top rank of leading players, and there clearly is a model change in the business.</p>
          <p>We've seen the de-emphasis of certain types of investors. We've seen the essential abolition of certain types of products. And what we're talking about is repointing the business to focus on what we're good at, which is primarily flow businesses, and I think the capacity has left there as well. I think we will be well positioned to take advantage of that, and that's an alpha that we'll be able to trade.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Apologies if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but any more color you can provide on the hedging loss this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no basis risk in there by and large, right?  We obviously had some losses from mark-to-market on movements of swaps and redesignation of those hedges we mentioned last quarter in relation to our debt, but nothing significant. It was just a potpourri of stuff, if that makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, and then just digging in on equity sales and trading, DVA aside, it sounds like you saw improvements within the cash equities business, Prime Brokerage, but was curious if you could provide any sense of what some of the offsets were during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no real offsets. If you look at it, we actually had market share gains in what we call our Delta One, our cash businesses, and our financing businesses. We actually had some pretty good results in Prime Brokerage just to give you some color there. A number of clients returned with balances in excess of $0.5 billion since January 2.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 clients have increased 23%, whilst the Tier 4 which we have been trying to deemphasize have decreased 14%. So our Tier 1 balances actually increased 14% in the second quarter, so there is a bit of a tail effect, and that's against a background as you know of redemptions early in the year. So we feel pretty comfortable that we're resizing that business and making it as profitable as we thought we could.</p>
          <p>What really happened I suppose if you look away from that downsizing of Prime Brokerage, which is coming back, is that in derivatives, we weren't as successful as we've been normally, and we don't think there is anything there other than an absence of client flow in our case. But I still think our equity numbers whilst off a little bit look reasonably solid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, helpful color. Thanks, Colm. And with respect to capital, you've said in the past, you said again today you believe the firm is overly capitalized. You raised a significant amount of capital during the quarter. Ratios are high, so any sense of where you'd like to target the Tier 1 or Tier 1 common in the intermediate term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously we have internal targets but I can't give external targets because I'm really subject to what my regulators would like me to do. What's clear though just to talk about it is that Tier 1 as a ratio is being augmented considerably by Tier 1 common. So we obviously had a composition of capital mismatch, which is why we did the common equity raises this quarter around. We now feel we're very robust on Tier 1 common. I would suggest without wanting to upset people that we've probably got an excess of the hybrid type of capital in our Tier 1 capital ratio. And over time as markets normalize, we would look to deal with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. As a follow up to that, Colm, assuming you are above your internal capital targets, then first part of the question, what's the priority?  Is it dividend restoration, share repurchase, internal deployment, or strategic acquisitions?  And second part of the question, with respect to that capital composition part, do you think that that potentially impedes your timing of letting some of that excess capital go if you do in fact have it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we're reasonably underlevered at the moment. I think we can dedicate more capital to the businesses. I think our balance sheet could be taken up higher. I'd like to deal with that first. I think any talk about repaying &#x2013; buying back shares or increasing dividends at this stage are premature at this stage in the cycle, and we'll address that when we come to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then final one for me, could you just provide us a sense what the marks, where they stand on the legacy assets for the quarter?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me just get that for you. So just to run through them, CMBS bonds low to mid-40s, in the US 32, in the UK 50; senior commercial loans, low 80s; mezzanine commercial loans, mid-40s; Alt-A, mid-20s; US and UK residential loans, mid-60s; subprime ABS CDO mezz, low teens. Our leveraged finance portfolio is low 70s, and our secondary loan portfolio would be mid-50s. Is that okay?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple questions. The first is on the comp to revenue ratio. It has come in about 71% in the first half. I know you've talked about competitive market pressures in the press release. I'm just wondering is there anything structural that we should be aware about that is impacting that number such as higher fixed comp expenses than in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we did increase fixed comp for managing directors from 300 to $400,000, but I don't think that's the main driver. First of all, 71% is our revenues which are being impacted by DVA. If you ex DVA out, we're actually accruing our revenue, our comp to net revenue on an annualized basis at around 49%, so we have to be competitive.</p>
          <p>Now clearly, that's on the basis of our own revenue projection. If markets improve, then you can start scaling back a bit from what the revenue accrual would be, but clearly we're not in normal markets yet to make long-term assumptions about what revenue, what comp to net revenue should be at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but on a look-forward basis, there's no reason to believe that it should change from what it has historically been. That would be a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if that is a fair statement, Richard. I would suspect that on a look-forward basis in more normal environments, you would expect to see comp to revenue trending down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is just more broadly on the institutional businesses because I know at the end of Q1, you did talk about increasing risk. That seems to have happened to a degree. I'm just wondering though, were there other factors during Q2 that impacted your risk appetite such as the need to keep liquidity to repay TARP or the results of the stress test?  Or was this in line with what you were thinking at the end of Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think liquidity is impacting our ability to take risk. We're very firm that we need to keep a pool of liquidity, and that clearly has a net carry drag, which I understand, but that is a relatively small price to pay for confident markets which we still think aren't totally out of the woods yet. We have the ability to take risk, and as John [John J. Mack] mentioned in his comment, we can take risk. In those areas where we've taken it, we've actually done pretty well.</p>
          <p>So it's just a question of continuing to apply more economic capital to the business areas and take the right sort of risk. But what I would always caution people on is that we very much look at risk adjusted returns. It's not just a question of trading on a binary basis, and that's the way we view things. It's trading on the back of our flow and customer flow, and I think in certain areas we could have done a better job than we did. In some areas we did do a good job.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about the Investment Banking backlog, where it stands relative to last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The IPO backlog is very strong. Let's begin with the good stuff. The investment grade debt and high yield backlogs are strong and up from last quarter, but the Investment Banking backlog is down on last quarter. But if you remember, it has been weak for a while.</p>
          <p>So I would say that M&amp;A still looks as though it's being somewhat challenged. I still believe that we're primarily in an M&amp;A triage environment, and that's the challenge we face. For that to improve, you're going to have to see pretty unfettered access to the unsecured funding markets for that to come back and people feel that they can finance activities, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much is that backlog down in aggregate for underwriting and M&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In aggregate, I would say &#x2013; I'm trying to get a sense of that. I think we're probably down from last quarter not too much, about 14%; but from last year, obviously quite significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And as far as Wealth Management, do you have little bit of buyer's remorse?  The only reason I say that, I look at the net new assets being down 1%. And I know you aren't talking about the separate entities anymore, but the Smith Barney side seemed to be weaker than your side, and that seems to be following through. And also a related question, the net new assets, does that reflect only one month of Smith Barney outflows, or would that be somehow restated for the full quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It only reflects one month of outflows, and we have absolutely no buyer's remorse at all. We're actually really comfortable with the acquisition and the joint venture itself. We're very pleased with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just the net new assets being down, can you give any additional color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is a lot of noise there, Mike. I think you'll get a much better sense of where we are next quarter when things normalize. Remember these were two companies going at different speeds at different times when things came together, so I think you've just got to wait for things to settle down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, it's a general question. The sustainability of trading, you have to model that for your expense control. And a related question to that is how much of your difference versus peer is due to people?  I know you made a management change, and how much of it is due to the processes itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's structural is the answer to the question. I think we punch below our weight. We have a very strong client footprint. We can predict a number of factors in terms of our forecasting expense control, all of which make me feel that in our case, they are certainly sustainable and can be better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the sustainability of trading, is everyone going on vacation over the summer and the trading should be a lot less, or it's still continuing into the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still continuing at the moment. Obviously July began with the July 4 weekend, but I see nothing yet that's causing me grounds for concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And bid/ask spreads just as wide or getting a little narrower?  I'm getting mixed signals from some of the comments so far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I wanted to come back to comp for a sec. So as we look at ex-DVA, I think what I calculated is something like 45% in the first quarter and then closer to 50 in the second. And as you talk about the comp being driven by competitive pressures and not referencing expectations for full-year revenues or profits, how do we look at that?  Is that step up to 2Q all a function of what we're hearing is a much more competitive environment for hiring top talent?  Is this 2Q a run rate we need to be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first of all, we've given additional disclosure this quarter. We've given you compensation per segment, so you can see that we have our Global Wealth Management, Asset Management, and Institutional Securities business. What I'm trying to point out to you all is that the nature of our compensation payout is changing.</p>
          <p>In the case of Global Wealth Management, there's much more of a grid structure of payout, which is not discretionary. It's grid, right?  Within Institutional Securities, you can work out what the ratios are as well. So I think we're giving you more color so you can, Roger, instead of looking at a blanket percentage, which is comparing an apple to an orange. In the case of some of our competitors, you'll get a better handle.</p>
          <p>But clearly we have to pay competitively. We are a preeminent investment banking franchise in our Institutional Securities business, and we feel very confident about our prospects going forward. Obviously everybody would like to have far more revenues. It makes the compensation issue easy. But in terms of competitive pressures, we are clearly aware of that. But we're also very aware of the loyalty of the employees of this firm who have been here for a very long time. So hopefully if you analyze the three segments, you get a clearer sense of what we're doing with comp.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then I guess within equities trading, so I guess what I'm curious about is with respect to your strong equity underwriting, I would have thought maybe you'd see stronger trading on the back of that. I guess the question is what have the trends in facilitation been?  Have you been committing much capital?  There has been a lot of demand. It seems like that really what drove Goldman's trading line this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not significantly, I mean the equity business the way we run our equity business by and large is slightly different from some others. We had clear gains in Delta One, the commission driven business. We had clear gains in Prime Brokerage relative to where we were. I mean I said if there is one delta in equities, it's the derivatives, which I said does not cause us a great deal of concern. And I think by the way relative to our other peers, the numbers are not at all bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true. And on the derivatives side, were you long vol throughout the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the guys &#x2013; actually we were long vol last year in the first quarter, and the guys very cleverly reduced that position and turned it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess on commercial real estate, so I was looking inside of your real estate funds in Asset Management. It looks like there was about a $5 billion decline in AUM related to write-downs, I guess 2 billion of outflows. So this suggested like a 20% write-down if we did that math right. I guess my question is then you look at Crescent and your marks there are something like 8%, so there's a fairly large discrepancy.</p>
          <p>I understand Crescent is held at cost, but I guess my question is, and I asked this question last quarter too is what would drive significant impairments there on your remaining exposures?  Would it be financing related, and if so, what do you have coming due on those properties this year and next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is finance related primarily. We don't talk about individual valuations per se, and we have given you a lot of disclosure on Crescent. Remember, there's a gross and a net exposure on Crescent. And we do do impairment tests and we have said that we have to consolidate the subsidiary, which is why it suffers the accounting treatment it does. So I can't add much more than that, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly then, just within credit trading, was there much of a benefit from the net &#x2013; the decline in negative basis between cash and derivatives this quarter that would have benefited the trading book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't be able to answer that question specifically. We saw very strong client flows in investment grade trading, and we did see some good positioning profits as well. But I think it was generally probably a narrowing of the spread. As regards to the basis, I just can't answer that specifically, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks, Colm.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney of Meredith Whitney Advisors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Colm. I have just a straightforward question. I'm sorry if you went through this. I see the footnote of the restatement of EMEA revenues and the regional breakout, but just if you could provide more color in terms of what happened in EMEA, and then is this a run rate for the last two quarters?  Forgive me if you already went over this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't actually. That's a great question. What it is is that all our DVA, our structured notes actually hit Europe. So if I were to do back of the envelope recalculations, you're basically talking about 53% Americas, 40% Europe, 7% Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so those two are you could argue one-time hits, those two quarters, the last two quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Unusual items?  Is that a better way to call it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Unusual items.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you remember, our debt spreads widened out significantly in 2008, right?  And we, if you want, traded idiosyncratically towards the group. What has happened is that as Morgan Stanley spread has normalized, and our spread has come back in all the way now, so we are trading more or less the same as our competitor, right, and better than some. So my view on DVA going forward is I can't predict whether it's going to go up or go down, but it will trade in line with the financial system itself rather than any idiosyncratic basis of Morgan Stanley's. Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does. I'm going to assume from your comments that EMEA starts to normalize on prospective quarters then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...but not from current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my next question is just trying to push you a little bit further about your newly constructive view of the markets. What's the timing between you see &#x2013; when you start to really put &#x2013; not reallocation of capital but actually add more leverage to the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; first of all on constructive, I wouldn't say I'm bullish. I think the point is that we have always said that we felt you need market stability to be able to return to be able to allocate capital efficiently and properly. There are clear signs of market stability returning. First of all, you're getting term in the term financing markets.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you're getting CP coming out. You're getting access to unsecured debt. Funny enough, Morgan Stanley reopened the hybrid bank market yesterday. You probably saw that where we did a deal for BB&amp;T which we totally pushed down our retail pipelines. Those things make me very constructive about the market itself, about the stability of the market.</p>
          <p>What I'm concerned about is the macroeconomic picture which is the consumer deleveraging which we spoke about. But now that we've got market stability, we feel much more positive about applying capital to segments and taking advantage of trades, and we are there. This quarter we did apply more capital to certain sectors of the market and trades reasonably well. We could have traded better in one or two other areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, thanks, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hecht of JMP Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Colm, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Michael, fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to the core performance in FIG this quarter, which was &#x2013; I'm getting about 2.3 billion less to DVAs, which I think was better than the first quarter but still billions less than your peers. As you guys invest here and increase your risk appetite in the flow businesses, how should we think about the opportunity, something closer to the 4 to $7 billion per quarter your large peers like Goldman, Citi, B-of-A, and JPMorgan have been earning each quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly we can do better. Despite our being more constructive on the markets, some trading desks didn't see the opportunities but our peers might have done. As a result, we didn't take as much risk as we could have done; and as you can see, our trading VAR is flat. Now there may be some legacy issues for some of those people in terms of risk appetite fourth quarter of '08. But we're beyond that when we've seen what other people are doing in the market.</p>
          <p>But what did we do in Fixed Income?  Where we took more risk, we had strong return. We took incremental risk and applied capital in investment grade credit and distressed debt. We traded the mortgage area well. We reported very strong we think possibly top-three investment grade distressed and mortgage trading revenues, and we are seeing market share gains there.</p>
          <p>But clearly we need to apply that discipline to the areas where although we've improved, we didn't perform as well as we could. And given that we have as good a client footprint as anybody and better than most, we think that that is easily remedied. We're addressing the flow in market share issues by hiring talent. We're hiring more DNA into rates and foreign exchange. We have made some management changes, but that was part of an ongoing process where we were talking about taking advantage of dislocation in the market to bring improvement to bench and strengthen the bench. So I don't think it's a fundamental issue for us. It's something we can easily address and have done before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair enough. And then just broadly, can you speak a little bit more, a little more color on the Smith Barney integration?  Obviously it's very early days. But any disappointments you can speak to on the technology side and then talk to maybe your confidence in the expense synergies that you laid out previously I think of around $1 billion?  And also as part of that just broadly how you feel broker retention is running versus your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really too soon, Michael, and I would be misleading. I think some newspaper reports have been misleading. We are very confident with the integration. Everything is on plan. I would say in fact if anything, we're slightly more pleased than we thought. We closed the deal earlier, and we have no issues with retention. So I'd rather hold off to next quarter when we can give you something more substantive on that. Remember, we closed this early, right?  It's a big achievement, and there's a lot of cleaning up here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree. Yes, I saw that press article as well, and I was surprised because it just seems like early days. Just the last one for me, is there a way for us to think about potential DVA markdowns from here?  You guys had about 6.4 billion in gains in '07 and '08; I think so far this year including the piece that you took in December, reversals of about 4.1 billion. So how do we think about the potential overhang for DVAs?  I understand it's a function of where your spreads go from here, but is there a cumulative amount of reversal we should think about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't answer that because &#x2013; I can answer it in one way. I think we're now in line. Remember our DVA is based upon our bond spreads. It's not based on our CDS spread. So we're now in line with our nearest peers in the industry broadly. So if DVAs are going to come in, it's because the whole financial system is being rerated and viewed as a better credit.</p>
          <p>I'm assuming for that to happen, then things are getting generally better elsewhere, so I would hope that we would get some compensating write-ups in positions we've got where there's some recovery. So all I would say in total is I can't predict what DVA will do, but I can tell you it is no longer an idiosyncratic issue for Morgan Stanley. We're in line with the pack.</p>

          <p>We have time for one more question, and that question will come from James Mitchell of Buckingham Research.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just follow up on the Asset Management business, what is the long-term game plan there?  Obviously if you look at your scale, not that you're sub scale, but smaller than some of your peers; Merrill got out of it because of conflict with the large brokerage business, and you certainly had some issues around performance and flows. Is that something that you want to scale up, you want to scale down?  Would you consider acquisitions to bolster it longer term?  Obviously in the near term you've got your hands full, but I'm just trying to think through the long-term strategy in Asset Management. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said before, there are really four businesses there, and you have to look at them individually. And what we do believe is that the business broadly fits into our Wealth Management &#x2013; Asset Management strategy where there are synergies and that makes sense. Our first job is to continue to do what we're doing which is to improve performance and take out unnecessary cost.</p>
          <p>James Gorman, our Co-President, is specifically looking at the strategies in each of those segments. We have looked and I said to you before, James, a number of alternatives. Do we dispose of it?  Do we do a contribution type deal?  Do we fix it ourselves?  And we're very much focused on the latter at the moment. And I know it's frustrating for you all because it's a slow thing to fix, but I have promised where we get improved performance and we make decisions supporting those businesses, we will keep you in touch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any value in perhaps accelerating that via acquisitions?  Obviously a lot of the asset management companies themselves that are publically traded have been hit pretty hard, and you mention you have excess capital. Is there any appetite for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the moment, we've got a very strong view that we need to focus on what we have and make sure that that is efficient, making key hires for that. Obviously we'll keep options open but our core case is to actually optimize what we have.</p>
