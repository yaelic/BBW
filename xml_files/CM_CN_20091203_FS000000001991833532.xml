          <p>Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The purpose of our meeting this morning is to review with you CIBC's fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 results that were released earlier this morning. The documents that will be referenced on this call including CIBC's Q4 news release, investor presentation, and financial supplement as well as CIBC's 2009 financial statements and MD&amp;A are all available on our website at www.cibc.com. In addition, an archive of this audio webcast will be available on our website later today. And CIBC's full 2009 accountability report will be available this coming Monday, December 7.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly review the agenda for this morning. Gerry McCaughey, CIBC's President and Chief Executive Officer, will deliver some opening remarks.

          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let me remind you that my comments may contain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Today, CIBC reported net income for the fourth quarter of 644 million and cash earnings per share of $1.59. Return on equity in the fourth quarter was 22.2% and earnings apart from items of note were $1.41 per share. These items of note included a gain from our structured credit runoff portfolio and mark-to-market losses through our normal course loan hedging activities. David Williamson will review these and other items of note that impacted our results in his presentation.</p>
          <p>For fiscal year 2009, CIBC reported net income of 1.2 billion and cash earnings per share of $2.73. We reported a strong Tier 1 capital ratio at October 31 of 12.1%, up from 10.5 a year ago.</p>
          <p>2009 was a year of progress for CIBC on many fronts. Against the backdrop of a recessionary economy, our core businesses performed well. We managed down our structured credit and other runoff portfolios, and our capital position at year end is as strong as it has ever been while we have strengthened the area of risk management.</p>
          <p>This progress has positioned CIBC to be strong through the duration of the cycle. While there is still uncertainly about the strength of the economic rebound and what regulatory reform may emerge for financial institutions globally and in Canada, we are prepared for this uncertainty through our focused efforts over the last two years to build capital and overall balance sheet strength, reposition our wholesale bank, and further invest in our retail franchise which has long been the bedrock of our business.</p>
          <p>While making significant progress in these areas, we have supported our clients during an extremely challenging period in Canada and around the world, enhancing our reputation as a leading financial institution and a strong supporter of the Canadian economy.</p>
          <p>Turning to our business results, CIBC Retail Markets performed well during the quarter with net income of 474 million and revenue of 2.4 billion. For the second consecutive quarter, we had solid revenue growth in Personal Banking, Business Banking, and Wealth Management. Loan losses were lower, reflecting lower write-offs and bankruptcies in cards as well as lower provisions in small business and commercial banking.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest across our retail business in support of our focus on the client experience and making it easier for our clients to bank with us. Sonia Baxendale is with us today to answer any questions you may have on our progress with Retail Markets.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale Banking, revenue was 483 million and net income was 154 million. Excluding items of note, Wholesale Banking net income was 124 million, down from 179 million in Q3. While Q4 market conditions were not as favorable as Q3, for 2009 overall Wholesale Banking exceeded its financial objective set at the end of 2008, which was to deliver annual income between 300 to 500 million from its continuing business through the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>In summary, Wholesale Banking had a good year in 2009 and is well positioned for whatever market conditions we might face in 2010. Richard Nesbitt is available this morning for questions and can expand on the key risk controlled growth opportunities he sees to augment our Wholesale Banking strategy in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also continued to manage our structured credit runoff portfolio. The net activity from our structured credit runoff business in the fourth quarter resulted in a net after-tax gain of 58 million following a gain of 65 million last quarter. David Williamson will cover our progress in this area in his presentation.</p>
          <p>While investing in our retail and wholesale businesses, we have effectively managed our expenses. In 2009, we exceeded our expense target for the fourth consecutive year, which for the last three years has been to hold our expenses below annualized Q4 '06 levels. Since we've set our strategic target of a median NIX ratio in 2005, we have reduced this ratio from over 70% to just over 57% in 2009 on an adjusted basis. Through the first three quarters of 2009, we were tracking to our median target. Going forward, we will support further NIX improvement by maintaining a focus on expense control while growing revenue in targeted areas where we have competitive capabilities and market opportunities that can generate sustainable earnings.</p>
          <p>In summary, CIBC took important steps forward in 2009. We strengthened our balance sheet, invested across our core businesses for future growth, reduced our structured credit exposure, and effectively managed our expenses. As a result of this progress, CIBC is well positioned heading into 2010. In our retail business, we expect further growth in mortgages, cards, and other credit products. We also expect higher demand for investment products as consumer confidence improves. While this will support revenue improvement, we do expect our loan losses to remain elevated as long as higher unemployment levels prevail.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale Banking, we also expect industry conditions to improve as long as the economy continues to stabilize. In this scenario, we expect renewed demand in areas of traditional strength for CIBC such as Investment Banking and M&amp;A and to expand our efforts in other key risk controlled activities such as corporate lending, securitization, and foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>In closing, I'd like to thank all CIBC employees for their contribution over the past year to serving our clients, shareholders, and communities, and our shareholders for their continued support.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn this over to David Williamson, our Chief Financial Officer, for his financial review. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gerry. I'm going to refer to the slides that are posted on our website, starting with slide five which is a summary of results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We reported earnings per share this quarter of $1.56 or $1.59 on a cash basis. Our items of note for this quarter listed on the top right of the slide totaled $0.18 per share. Our cash EPS excluding these items was $1.41 per share. I'll summarize each of these items of note briefly.</p>
          <p>During our fourth quarter, our structured credit runoff business generated a gain of $0.15 per share. I'll provide additional insights into this performance in a few moments. Also in the quarter was a loss of $0.07 per share related to the negative valuation adjustments on our exited and other runoff businesses. The next item of note was a loss of $0.06 per share due to mark-to-market adjustments on credit derivatives included in our corporate loan hedging program. The loss was caused by improved credit conditions in the quarter, which resulted in narrowing of credit spreads. The final item of note this quarter was a gain of $0.16 per share related to positive tax adjustments, largely due to the revaluation of future tax assets.</p>
          <p>Excluding these items of note, results for the quarter were helped by higher spreads and volumes in retail markets, higher treasury revenue, continued expense discipline, and lower loan losses, and were hurt by lower wholesale bank revenue.</p>
          <p>As Gerry mentioned, we reported a strong capital position this quarter with a Tier 1 ratio of 12.1%.</p>
          <p>The next slide provides a summarized statement of operations on a reported basis showing net income for the quarter of 644 million.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to a summary of structured credit runoff activities for the quarter. We had our second consecutive quarter of net gains with a gain this quarter of $85 million versus a gain of $95 million last quarter. Similar to last quarter, this gain is best explained by referring to the five items shown on the slide. These items are largely offsetting, reflecting the positioning of the structured credit book to dampen earnings volatility.</p>
          <p>First, we had pre-tax income of $322 million from reductions in our CVA balances on financial guarantors. This resulted from an improvement in the mark-to-market value of certain underlying assets, partially offset by a slight deterioration in the credit spreads of financial guarantors. Second, we had gains on our unhedged non-USRMM positions of $43 million, which was driven by a gain on the sale of certain assets and on improved valuations on other positions, partially offset by a loss from the impact of improved valuations of underlying assets related to unmatched purchased credit derivatives. And third, unhedged USRMM positions had a gain of $15 million, which was driven primarily by amortization.</p>
          <p>These gains in the quarter were partially offset by the two remaining factors shown on this slide.</p>
          <p>The first item is losses on purchased credit derivatives on loans and receivables of $208 million. These assets were included in held-to-maturity last quarter and have been reclassified as loans and receivables this quarter in accordance with the new GAAP rules that were recently issued. The impact of this change on earnings was insignificant, but I thought I should highlight the change in classification of these assets out of held-to-maturity to avoid any confusion.</p>
          <p>As discussed last quarter, these underlyings were accounted for on an accrual basis whereas the purchase protection is fair value. Therefore, when asset values get better, these holdings generate a loss. This inverse relationship acts to moderate the earnings volatility of our overall structured credit holdings.</p>
          <p>The second item is other losses of $87 million, which include expenses associated with our structured credit holdings and the Cerberus note liability, which generates losses when the market for underlying assets improves.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our business results starting with Retail Markets on slide eight, revenue for Retail Markets this quarter was 2.38 billion, up 15 million or 1% from last year and up 37 million or 2% from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Personal banking revenue of 1.6 billion this quarter was up 138 million or 10% from last year. We experienced wider spreads and saw volume growth led by deposit growth of 44% year over year. Personal banking spreads were up year over year due to favorable pricing and wider prime/BA spreads on lending product, partially offset by the lower interest rate environment affecting deposit spreads and lower net prepayment penalty fees on mortgages.</p>
          <p>Turning to Business Banking, revenue of 348 million this quarter was up 11 million or 3% from last year as improved customer rate changes were partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on deposits.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, our Canadian Personal and Business Banking divisions continue to build momentum with growth of 25 billion in funds managed year over year, helping to increase revenue by 149 million, which excluding the 2007 Visa gain represents a new high.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 highlights the results for our Wealth Management businesses. Wealth Management revenue of 337 million this quarter was down 26 million or 7% from last year. The market driven decline in asset values and lower spreads due to the low interest rate environment were only partially offset by higher trading commissions from increased new issue activity. However, Q4 represents the second successive quarter of revenue growth for Wealth Management and the highest revenue level for the year. In addition, the Wealth Management business continued to show positive momentum with its third consecutive quarter increase in assets under administration.</p>
          <p>FirstCaribbean revenue of 160 million was flat from the fourth quarter of last year as narrowing spreads, lower volume, and the impact of a stronger Canadian dollar were partially offset by higher securities revenue.</p>
          <p>Other revenue was down 107 million this quarter versus last year due to lower treasury revenue allocations.</p>
          <p>Retail Markets net income this quarter was 474 million, down 98 million from last year. The provision for credit losses was 362 million, up 131 million from last year but down 55 million from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in credit losses was driven primarily by higher write-offs and bankruptcies in the cards and personal lending portfolios, a topic that Tom Woods will discuss in his remarks.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we changed our accounting methodologies for cards reserves. We no longer maintain a specific allowance for cards, but rather we include the entire reserve amount in general. We restated prior quarters for consistency.</p>
          <p>In addition, commencing this quarter interest income on credit card loans is only accrued where there is an expectation of receipt. Previously, interest income was accrued until credit card loans were written off on becoming 180 days in arrears or when notified of a customer bankruptcy. This change did not have a significant impact on the quarter's results. Both of these changes moved CIBC closer to current industry practice.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses for the quarter were down 14 million from last year as we continue to be focused and disciplined in managing our costs.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 shows our net interest margins. On the bottom row, you can see that total retail net interest margin was up slightly from the prior quarter as favorable pricing was more than offset by the lower interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wholesale Banking on slide 16, revenue of 483 million this quarter was helped by the net gains in structured credit runoff that I outlined earlier in my remarks. As noted on the slide, revenue adjusted for the impact of structured credit was $380 million. If we were to exclude all of the items of note related to Wholesale Banking, revenue for this quarter was 458 million, down 114 million from the prior quarter on the same basis.</p>
          <p>Looking at the individual lines of business starting with Capital Markets, revenue was 253 million compared with 325 million in the prior quarter due to lower revenue in our fixed income trading, foreign exchange, and equity derivatives businesses. Corporate and Investment Banking revenue of 146 million was down 75 million from the prior quarter, driven by lower revenue in US real estate finance, core merchant banking, and corporate credit products, partially offset by higher advisory revenue.</p>
          <p>Other revenue of 91 million was up 100 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loan hedges as credit spreads continued to tighten but at a slower rate than in the prior quarter. These improvements were partially offset by negative valuation adjustments.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking net income was 154 million this quarter. Excluding structured credit, net income was $96 million. If we were to exclude all of the items of note related to Wholesale Banking, net income for this quarter was $124 million, down 55 million from the prior quarter on the same basis due to lower revenue and higher loan losses partially offset by lower expenses and a lower effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our total expenses and performance versus our target of holding expenses flat relative to annualized fourth quarter 2006 expenses, we have made adjustments as noted on the slide to ensure a reasonable comparison. As you can see, we are far ahead of our objective due to a continued expense discipline. Furthermore, as Gerry mentioned, we continue to track to our strategic target of a median NIX ratio within our industry group.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. At this point, I'll turn it over to Tom Woods.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Let's start with slide 42 on credit risk. Specific loan loss provisions in the quarter were 408 million. The quarter-over-quarter improvement of 82 million was mainly due to lower losses in cards as well as in corporate and commercial lending. Gross impaired loans increased by 243 million this quarter, mainly relating to five US borrowers primarily in the real estate and financial sectors.</p>
          <p>Slide 43, our US commercial real estate finance business has 2.4 billion Canadian of drawn loans and 256 million of undrawn exposure. In 2009, we took loan loss provisions of 102 million for the full year including 51 million in Q4. Gross impaireds are 279 million and net impaireds 189 million.</p>
          <p>We believe provisions in 2010 for this business will be below those recorded in 2009, although predicting losses in this space is challenging as it will depend on a number of factors including: first, the general economy and the impact on lease up rates, rental prices, and sale prices; second, the capability and willingness of project sponsors to inject equity; third, the availability of government support in certain sectors; and fourth, the flexibility of other lenders where we are involved in restructuring negotiations.</p>
          <p>As you know, conditions in this market as a whole deteriorated. But our portfolio, which consists of 140 loans averaging less than US 20 million per loan, has the following positive features. It's geographically diversified, but with approximately 40% of the portfolio in the Northeast and only 7% in the Southwest. It's diversified by sector with 28% retail, 19% multi-family, 18% hotel, 16% multi-use, and 8% office.</p>
          <p>Our US leveraged finance runoff book has 400 million in drawn loans and 622 million in undrawn exposures. In 2009, we took loan loss provisions of 36 million, including 4 million in Q4. Gross impaireds are 60 million and net impaireds are 19 million. Current indications are that provisions for 2010 in this book will be down from 2009.</p>
          <p>Our European leveraged finance runoff book has 894 million Canadian in drawn loans and 162 million in undrawn exposure. In 2009, we took loan loss provisions of 78 million, including 12 million in Q4. Gross impaireds are 99 million and net impaireds 39 million. We may have some additional provisions in 2010 in this book, but at the moment we do not expect them to be material.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 44, our cards net credit loss rate in Q4 was 6.3% versus 7.1% last quarter. Net credit losses were down 24 million due to lower write-offs and bankruptcies. The account management initiatives that we began deploying in the summer of 2008, which I have discussed on previous webcasts, have helped reverse the loss trend in this portfolio. While loss levels are still elevated, delinquency rates appear to have stabilized and we're optimistic that the early actions we took position us well going forward.</p>
          <p>Slide 45, our coverage for credit losses continues to be strong, where we have 38% of specific allowances as a percentage of our gross impaired. As you can see here, our coverage ratio is above the Canadian bank average.</p>
          <p>On our credit metrics, we continue to have through-the-cycle loan loss target range of 50 to 65 basis points. In 2009, the ratio was 80 basis points or 71 basis points excluding the impact of securitization. Our current outlook for 2010 for loan losses is for better performance in our wholesale and personal loan books and stable performance in our cards portfolio for the year as a whole, although we see better performance in cards from the elevated Q3 &#x2013; Q4 run rate.</p>
          <p>Tuning to market risk, slide 46 shows the Q4 distribution of revenue in our trading businesses. In Q4, all but six trading days or 91% of the time had positive revenue, down slightly from 95% of last quarter, but well improved from 50% in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide 47, our Tier 1 ratio was 12.1% at October 31, up from 12.0% at the end of Q3. The increase was mainly due to earnings net of dividends and capital issued through our dividend reinvestment plan, partially offset by the impact of a change in regulatory treatment for our securitized credit cards, which we now treat similar to our on-balance sheet cards portfolio.</p>
          <p>In addition in the quarter, we updated a number of our Basel II credit parameters. These updates reduced our Tier 1 ratio by 26 basis points this quarter. However, we believe that the Basel II parameters we will be updating in Q1 will have a positive impact on our Tier 1 ratio. The Tier 1 drag in Q4 from the parameter update was partially offset by a benefit due to reductions in risk weighted assets in our structure credit and corporate loan portfolios, reflecting improvement in market conditions there.</p>
