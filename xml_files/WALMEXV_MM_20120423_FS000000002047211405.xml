          <p>Thanks, Rafael, and good afternoon to everyone.  I'll begin by going through Mexico's performance of first quarter.  For the first quarter, Mexico achieved a 13.6% increase in total sales and comparable sales were up 5.6%.  Comp growth was driven by both positive traffic and ticket.  Transactions increased 2.3% and the average ticket grew 3.2%.</p>
          <p>Mexico's first quarter comp store sales for the self-serviced formats grew by 5.3%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry excluding Walmex grew at 3.5%.  First quarter of the year was a challenging quarter.  We had good sales growth, but we are not satisfied with EBITDA growth.</p>
          <p>Total income for Mexico was MXN83.5 billion for the quarter, an increase of MXN10 billion, or 13.7%, over last year. Gross profit grew 11.8%, which reflects markdowns to lower inventory levels and the impact of IFRS on the day-to-day management of markdowns.  Our merchants are learning to manage their business with IFRS, and this will not be an issue looking forward.</p>
          <p>Expenses grew 15.2%, above our expectations.  We had good performance in key items, such as labor cost that grew below sales, where we continue to drive productivity, but pressured by increases above sales in utilities and rents.  We are committed to reducing operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the rest of the year.  First quarter EBITDA grew 8.3% to MXN8.0 billion.</p>
          <p>As I said before, gross margin during the quarter was impacted by markdowns to lower inventory levels.  During the first quarter, we reduced inventory levels in Mexico by MXN5.4 billion.  This was achieved via aggressive markdowns on seasonal merchandize and winter apparel.  The level of inventory remains high compared to last year, mainly due to our decision to stock up on basic items prior to the Easter holiday.  Good inventory management will be one of our priorities for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Now let's review highlights for operation in Central America.  Our objective for this year is to consolidate the transformation of our business in Central America, in order to support our objectives for continuous profitable growth.  Sales on a constant currency basis for the first three months of the year have shown a positive trend for both total sales and comp stores sales.</p>
          <p>Central America increased total income from the previous year by MXN1.9 million.  This represents a 16.6% increase in peso terms, or a 9% increase on a constant currency basis.  First quarter gross profit was MXN2.8 billion, and as a percentage of total income declined 150 basis points, as a result of pricing investments and markdowns to lower inventory levels.  It is important to mention that during the quarter we saw an improvement month-to-month in gross margin, ending with a 21.6% gross margin in March.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, expenses grew at a slower rate than sales.  Operating expenses as a percentage of total income declined 10 basis points to 18.2% from 18.3% last year.  EBITDA was down 16% on a constant currency basis as a result of the decline in gross margin.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to the consolidated results.  Total income grew 14.1%.  Gross margin went from 22.4% to 21.9% as a result of the decline in gross margin both in Mexico and Central America.  Operating income grew 5.0% and EBITDA grew 6.6%.  As I already mentioned, for the rest of the year we will continue to improve inventory management, reduce operating expense as a percentage of sales, and consolidate the transformation of our business in Central America.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it to Rafael to comment on our balance sheet.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Scot.  Our financial position remained very strong.  As of the end of the quarter, our cash position amounted to MXN21 billion.  Capital expenditures were approximately MXN2.1 billion in the first quarter, and we repurchased 2.2 million shares for an amount of MXN82 million.</p>
          <p>We're on track to meet our 2012 expansion program, and we continue to identify growth opportunities to open new stores.  Year-to-date, we have opened 52 units, 51 of them in Mexico and one supermarket in Costa Rica.  In Mexico we opened one Bodega Aurrer&#xE1;, seven Mi Bodegas, 38 Bodega Aurrer&#xE1; Express, one Walmart, three Sam's and one restaurant.</p>
          <p>We also had two recognitions during the quarter.  The Euromoney Magazine awarded us recognition as a company with the best corporate governance in Mexico, and the company with the most convincing and coherent strategy in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In Mexico we were granted for the 12th year in a row the Social Responsibility Company (sic) [Socially Responsible Company] distinction from the Mexican Philanthropy Center and Alliance for Social Responsible Companies (sic) [Socially Responsible Company] in Mexico.  We are one of the 10 companies and the only retailer that has obtained this distinction from the moment it was created.</p>
          <p>Before we finish, I want to remind you &#x2013; everyone that this year's ordinary and extraordinary dividends of MXN0.44 and MXN0.11 per share approved at our last shareholders meeting will be paid next April 30.</p>
          <p>With this, we are ending our conference call.  I now remind you that we will be available to receive any calls with questions that you may have.  Thank you once again.</p>
