          <p>Good morning. My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the third quarter earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, you may begin your conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christy, good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our third quarter fiscal 2010 operating results for the 12 weeks ended May 9.</p>
          <p>As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 12-week third quarter fiscal 2010 operating results; for the quarter, our earnings per share came in at $0.68, up 42% from last year's reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.48. As will be discussed in more detail in a moment, both this year's and last year's Q3 results and the comparison of these results included a couple items of note. These were outlined in this morning's press release and include the following.</p>
          <p>First, you will recall last year in Q3, we took a pre-tax charge of $34 million related to a litigation settlement covering our membership renewal policy. This charge hit the membership fee income line of our income statement last year in Q3 for $27 million and our SG&amp;A line item for $7 million, negatively impacting last year's third quarter earnings by $0.05 a share. This year in Q3, our SG&amp;A line was reduced or benefited by a $14 million pre-tax reversal of part of a charge related to a Canadian tax liability that we had previously taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. This had to do with stock option protection &#x2013; the option issues and protecting our employees in Canada who receive such options. This is an SG&amp;A impact, not an income tax impact.</p>
          <p>So adding back the $0.05 to last year's third quarter EPS of $0.48 and subtracting the $0.02 EPS pickup I just described, year over year Q3 EPS would have gone from $0.53 last year to $0.66 this year, for a 25% year over year increase.</p>
          <p>As I will discuss, there are other items of note that impacted each of last year's and this year's fiscal third quarter results, some positive items, some negative, from income tax rates to LIFO to FX, closing costs, et cetera. I will mention the FX issue right now, what I refer to as FX tailwinds. As you know, the US dollar this year as compared to last year relative to several of the foreign currencies and countries in which we operate had weakened, so our foreign earnings results when converted and reported in US dollars has helped us this year and has helped us in Q3 by a little over $28 million pre-tax or $0.04 a share. That is assuming FX exchange rates were flat year over year, this year's foreign operating results in Q3 would have been lower by that amount.</p>
          <p>In all, we look at our Q3 results as a continuation of positive trends that we saw in Q2. In terms of sales for the 12-week quarter, reported total sales were up 12% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure was up 10%. For the quarter, both total sales and comp sales were partially impacted by gasoline price inflation and by the strengthening foreign currencies relative to the US dollar year over year.</p>
          <p>On a comp sales basis, the plus 6% US sales increase in Q3 that's outlined in the press release, if you exclude gas inflation that would have been a plus 3%. Similarly, the reported plus 26% international comp figure assuming flat year over year FX rates would have instead been plus 8%. And total company comps &#x2013; again, we reported a plus 10 for the quarter; excluding both the gas inflation and excluding FX changes would have been plus 4% for the company during the fiscal quarter.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest, our opening activities and plans; we opened one new location in Q3 in Pacoima, California. That's within the city limits of Los Angeles. In Q4, which began on May 10, we plan to open 6 new locations. The first of these 6 opened this morning in St. John's (sic) [St. John], New Brunswick, Canada. This is our 78th Canada warehouse location, and brings our total warehouses worldwide to 568.</p>
          <p>The 5 additional buildings we plan to open by fiscal year end include 2 additional ones in Canada; 1 in Queens, New York, an area called Rego Park; one in Roseburg, Oregon; and our 22nd location in the UK in Coventry, which is about 95 miles northwest of London. Also this morning, I'll review with you our expansion plans for fiscal 2011, which are up, Costco Online results, membership trends, certainly a discussion a little bit more about margins and SG&amp;A, an update on our stock buyback activities, and a couple of other items of interest.</p>
          <p>In terms of the discussion of the quarterly results, again sales for the quarter were 17.4 billion, up 12% from last year's Q3 of 15.5. Again on a reported comp basis, it was at plus ten. The plus 10 third quarter comp was comprised of a 9 in February, a 10 in March, and an 11 in April. There were some seasonal &#x2013; some holiday changes, but essentially a pretty close range there. And again, excluding gas and FX, the 9, 10, and 11 for February, March, and April would have been a 4, 3, and 4.</p>
          <p>The 10% reported comp was positively impacted by about just under 4% due to the year over year strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar. And as I mentioned, the local currency comp rate if you will for all the foreign countries was a plus 8, but when converted into US dollars because of the FX was plus 26. As I mentioned, gasoline had a big impact, about 3 percentage points, so the US reported comp of 6 would have been a 3 without that.</p>
          <p>Our average transactions increase was a little over 6% for the quarter, which of course includes gas, inflation, and FX. And the average frequency increase was a little more than 3.5%. In fact, the frequency trend during the past 3 calendar reporting months of February, March, and April was a 3.7, a 3.5, and a 3.7, so it was pretty consistent. I think most importantly, these frequency figures are on top of a roughly 4%-plus frequency increase during Q3 of '09; so pretty strong frequency continuing, recognizing people seem to be coming in more frequently but buying a little less each time and perhaps buying a little more on the food side as well.</p>
          <p>For the quarter in terms of sales comparisons by geographic region; for the quarter, the Midwest, the Southeast, and Texas were the strongest, followed by a good showing in the Northwest. California actually trend-wise over the last 4 quarters has also had a good improvement in track record, but at a lower level. Internationally in local currencies, we're doing quite well despite all the craziness around the world. Canada in local currency is up close to 10%, with Taiwan and Korea averaging in the mid-teens. The UK is closer to flat.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, softlines was the strongest core category followed by fresh foods, food and sundries, with hardlines being the relative weakest one of those 4. Within food and sundries, every subcategory was positive in the quarter, ranging from 1% up to 12% up. Tobacco was actually a little bit higher than the 12 but that was an anomaly related to I believe an increase last year that tends to greatly vary sales levels based on a pending tax increase, tobacco tax increase.</p>
          <p>Within hardlines, the comp, the strongest subcategories were sporting goods, hardware, health and beauty aids, lawn and garden, and tires. The one of note that was a slight negative comp was what we call majors or electronics. That's not inconsistent with what I think Bob Nelson has said on the monthly sales voice calls. What we're seeing in TVs is there's not a lot of promotional activity out there as the underlying components of these flat screens, notably the panels, as demand has increased in Asia from Chinese consumers and what have you that there's less need for the manufacturers to provide incentives. As you've seen in our MVM [Multi-Vendor Mailer] mailers over the last several months, there's not as much exciting activity in terms of promotional activity for our TVs.</p>
          <p>Within the softlines comp, most every category was strong. Generally, every subcategory but one was in the 9 to 22% comp range, with housewares, small electrics, domestics, media, home furnishings being standouts. And within fresh foods, all sub-fresh food categories, meat, bakery, produce, and what have you were all positive, each in the mid to high single digits and averaging in the high single digits.</p>
          <p>Now moving down the line items on the income statement, I'll start with membership fees. Again, recall membership fees &#x2013; first, I want to take out the component of that $434 million charge from last year, 27 million of which hit last year's Q3 membership fee income line, so I'm going to take that out in terms of comparison. And then of course, I'll show you it without FX, since with the relatively weaker US dollar, we show dollar increases greater in the foreign countries.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis for the quarter, this year we had $395 million or 2.27%. Reported last year was 329, but again I want to add in the 27 million, so the comparison to the 395 will be 356 or 2.30%, and that's again without that membership litigation settlement in Q3 of last year. So on that basis, 395 versus 356, dollars were up 11% and basis points were down 3 basis points. And in dollars, it was up $39 million.</p>
          <p>Now again, another complication is gas inflation, which tends to screw up some of the percentage comparisons. That minus 3 basis point number without gas inflation would have been plus 4 basis points, so a pretty good showing given the sales strength and relative membership strength.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about FX. Again, FX last year, the 356 number would be the starting point. The 395 assuming flat FX year over year would have been 381, which I think is probably the most appropriate comparison. That would show that dollars were up $25 million excluding FX or currency, or up 7%. The same reported minus 3 basis points but again excluding gas inflation would have been plus 4 basis points. A lot there to digest, but I think that's the best way to look at it.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership, we've got strong renewal rates. We continue to see improving and increasing penetration of the Executive Membership. And really despite only 2 net new openings in the past 6 months in Q2 and Q3 combined, our new membership signups in Q3 were up 2% year over year in the fiscal quarter. That's actual new signups.</p>
          <p>In terms of number of members at Q3 end, we had &#x2013; Gold Star is 22.2 million. That compares to 22.0 million at the end of Q2; Business Primary, 5.75 million versus 5.7 million at the end of Q2, so slightly up there; Business Add-on rounding down to 3.3 from a 3.4 a quarter ago. Part of that is that as add-ons become Executive Members, if they're individuals, they go in the Gold Star category. So really I think the 22 to the 22.2 in Gold Star probably is a little lower than that 200,000-person increase, which part of that is an offset to the reduction in add-on. All told, you add up the numbers, it's 31.1 million households at the end of Q2 and up to 31.3 million households at the end of Q3. And if you include spouse cards, we went at the end of Q2, 56.9 up to 57.4. Now these numbers, by the way, do not include Mexico since we don't consolidate. Including Mexico, the 57.4 would be 60.3.</p>
          <p>At Q3 end on May 9, our paid Executive Member base was 9.9, just a shade over 9.9 million, an increase of 292,000 or 3% in just the 12-week second quarter. So we added about 24,000 Executive Members per week during the 12-week third quarter. Executive Members now represent about a third of our membership base and just about two-thirds of our sales.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership renewal rates, they actually tweaked up a little in the quarter. We went from a 92.0 on the Business side renewal rate at Q2 end to a 92.1, and on the Gold Star side from an 86.0 at the end of Q2 to an 86.3 at the end of Q3. All told, an 87.4 is now an 87.5. Those are figures, by the way, which they've always been for US and Canada, since some of the newer countries have a lot of new locations, which tend to distort that, so we've always done it that way.</p>
          <p>Now going down to the gross margin line, our gross margin in the third quarter was lower year over year by 11 basis points, from a 10.99 down to 10.88 this year. The 2 things I ask you to jot down, of course, are the 2 matrices for gross margin and SG&amp;A. We'll start here with the gross margin. The line items are merchandising core, ancillary businesses, 2% Reward, and LIFO, and then of course total. And we'll look at Q1, 2, and 3 for this fiscal year. Going across merchandising: core: plus 15 basis points in Q1, plus 15 in Q2, minus 10 in Q3; ancillary, minus 20, plus 16, and plus 6; 2% Reward, minus 3, minus one, minus 3; LIFO, minus 1, minus 4, minus 4. For a total in Q1 year over year, we were minus 9 basis points; in Q2, plus 26; and in Q3, minus 11.</p>
          <p>Now again, the craziness here in terms of understanding percentages has do with gas inflation, or last year we were explaining gas deflation. Keep in mind if you have gas inflation this year, your denominator in calculating any number over the reported sales number is going to tend to lower the percentages. So on the margin side, lower means it looks a little worse. On the SG&amp;A side, lower means it looks a little better, and we'll try to explain that to you here.</p>
          <p>So if you'd start with the overall number of 11 basis points; within this 11 basis point figure, our core merchandising gross margin, as I showed in the matrix, was down 10 basis points. And ancillary gross margins, principally gas, contributed 6 basis points. On a standalone basis, our gas gross margin was up actually close to 50 basis points. But because it's a gross margin business that's 7 or 800 basis points lower gross margin than the rest of the company, in the very &#x2013; in the low to mid-single digits, that increased penetration at that lower amount notwithstanding a pretty good year over year gross margin improvement in the gas business, contributed 6 basis points there.</p>
          <p>Sales penetration of our higher margin core businesses was down 2 percentage points in Q3, representing 81% of our sales this year versus 83% of our sales last year. So whereas our sales percentage of our ancillary business; again gasoline sales, which is a much lower margin business, was up 2 percentage points, this one was down 2 &#x2013; the rest of the business was down 2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>The sales penetration of our core merchandise business was down year over year, as you see here, the minus &#x2013; hold on a second, I just lost this page, the minus 10 basis point number. If you look at just the core merchandise business margin versus the core merchandise business sales &#x2013; and again, that's food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods, which represents right around 80% of our total company, those realized gross margins in those realized businesses in Q3 were up 14 basis points year on year. But again, the lower sales penetration caused it to be down on this chart.</p>
          <p>The respective merchandise category gross margins were the strongest in hardlines followed by softlines and then food and sundries. Fresh foods margins were actually down year over year, primarily to lower gross margins in meat. In talking to Jeff Lyons, who is the Senior VP in charge of fresh foods, meat has tended to be inflationary during the quarter but still very competitive pricing out there, not only among warehouse clubs but among the major retail supermarket chains as well, so prices have lagged a little bit in terms of covering that.</p>
          <p>All in all in Q3, a good showing on the gross margin line, with nice increases in 3 of the 4 core subcategories and good increases in gas margins as well.</p>
          <p>The impact from growing our Executive Member business, which results in higher 2% Rewards, as we showed, jumped 3 basis points. The implication there is that sales penetration of rewardable op merchandise was up about 1.5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>LIFO, last year in all 4 quarters we took LIFO credits, I think totaling over $30 million pre-tax for the fiscal year '09. This year now that we're &#x2013; essentially you can't go below zero is the way I can describe it. And even though there have been slight deflationary trends this year, that's starting to switch but nonetheless slight deflationary trends, you can't go below zero. So there's no LIFO charge or credit in Q3 compared to a $6 million LIFO credit last year, so that was a 4 basis point detriment to this year versus the comparison of last year. This is one of those items I mentioned earlier on in terms of the pluses and minuses in looking at the Q3 year over year comparison.</p>
          <p>Now after taking all this gross margin information in, perhaps the easiest way to summarize Q3-over-Q3 gross margin comparisons is that excluding gasoline sales year over year, Costco's gross margins would have been up in Q3 by 5 basis points, and this is notwithstanding the minus 3 basis point variance year over year from the 2% Reward and the minus 4 basis point variance from LIFO.</p>
          <p>Moving on to SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentages in Q3 over Q3 were lower or better by 40 basis points, coming in at 10.29% of sales this year compared to 10.69 last year. Again, I'll ask you to jot some numbers down, then try to as best I can explain it here. These line items would be operations, central, stock options, quarterly adjustments, total. And again looking at the 3 columns would be Q1, 2, and 3. In operations, it's minus 16; and going across &#x2013; minus means higher or bad. Q2 is zero, and Q3 is plus 14. Central: minus 3, plus 2, and plus 4. Stock options or stock &#x2013; or equity compensation now that we do our issues: minus 3, plus one, and plus 5. Quarterly adjustments: plus 18, minus 12, and plus 17. Total: minus four, minus 9, and plus 40.</p>
          <p>So let me give you a little editorial here. So looking at the first thing, operations was lower or better. Core operations was lower or better year over year in Q3 by 14 basis points, but it's all about sales mix change. Just like with the gross margin percentages where increased gasoline sales penetration hurt us, it correspondingly helped SG&amp;A by about 22 basis points. So the plus 14 minus the 22 if you will is a minus 8. So where is the minus 8 in the core operations? It's mostly higher healthcare and other benefits related costs. But as I will explain in a minute, there seems to be a little light at the end of that healthcare tunnel. The rate of dollar increases in these benefits related areas increased year over year in Q3 at a rate of increase lower than has been the case in the last 3 fiscal quarters. I also mentioned &#x2013; well that was why the plus number went to a minus number.</p>
          <p>One of the positives was the payroll comparison, which we are seeing some payroll leverage in Q3 over Q3. Payroll percentages showed improvement of 10 basis points year over year in Q3, pretty good given the relatively low underlying levels of sales growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of healthcare costs, in fiscal '09 US healthcare costs in dollars jumped 26% in Q3 '09 versus Q3 '08 and 27% in Q4 '09 versus Q4 '08. If you recall, that's when we started talking about what I call the double whammy. One, there's healthcare inflation. And 2, with the reduction of new openings of warehouses, which is where you have a lot of new hires, particularly new part-time hires that take up to 6 months to become benefits eligible, as we open fewer warehouses, that meant that the mix of employees became more eligible instead of having these new part-timers. Similarly, existing employees aren't leaving their jobs. Our turnover rate overall, which in good times, a good economy, economic times, a couple years ago tended to be in the 20% range, is now in the 10% range. So again, we've seen a double whammy, which seems to be now anniversarying that we have a higher percentage of our base of employees in the US being covered with healthcare.</p>
          <p>So again, looking at Q3 and Q4 last year as compared to their respective quarters the prior year, we saw US healthcare costs go up 26 and 27%. In the first half of this year, Q1 and Q2 combined, the increases were about 20%. And in Q3, the quarter that I'm talking about right now, as we have anniversaried at least the big increase in the percentage of employees who are benefits eligible, our Q3 year over year increase in healthcare costs was up a little over 11%, so hopefully that trend will continue.</p>
          <p>Our central expense was lower or better year over year in Q3 by 4 basis points. Again, a chunk of that is the gas inflation. And stock compensation expense was 5 basis points better. The latter, a slightly lower dollar figure on strong total sales &#x2013; reported sales figures.</p>
          <p>Finally, the quarterly adjustment line of 17 basis points in SG&amp;A consists of last year's &#x2013; that component of the 34 million that hit the SG&amp;A line, about 7 million of that 34 million, and this year's $14 million credit for the partial recovery of the Canadian charge taken in '07. Again, that Canadian charge was Canadian taxes to our employees that we protected those employees that received those options up there. That hit the SG&amp;A line, not the income tax line. And then there were about 4 basis points of miscellaneous items hurting Q3 last year but more on a one-time basis.</p>
          <p>Overall, I think probably in the last couple of years one of our better SG&amp;A performances given the current sales levels and the slowing rate of growth but still escalating costs in healthcare. We continue to work hard and we're focused on reducing SG&amp;A. That's the primary focus of Jim and Craig's.</p>
          <p>Next on the income statement line, pre-opening expense, 9 million last year in Q3, 3 million this year in Q3, so 6 million or 4 basis points better. Last year in Q3, we had 5 openings. This year in Q3, we had one opening. Also last year in Q3, we had quite a bit of pre-opening. About half of it expended in Q3 related to several then upcoming openings in international. No real surprises here, it will fluctuate. Of course, pre-opening expenses will start to increase as our opening plans for Q4 and fiscal '11 start to increase.</p>
          <p>In terms of provision for impaired assets and closing costs line, in Q3 '09 last year we had a charge of 7 million for the quarter compared to charges of 3 million this year. Last year's $7 million charge included a $5 million reserve to cover closing costs and asset impairments related to the then planned closing of our 2 Costco Home units, which actually took place on July 3 last year.</p>
          <p>So all told, operating income in Q3 versus operating income in Q3 a year ago was up 36% year over year. And of course, excluding the items noted in the press release, that operating income increase year over year would have been up 21%.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was slightly higher year over year in Q3, and Q3 coming in at 27 million versus 25 million last year. That's actually a little under $1.5 million increase. It's due to rounding the 27 and 25. These amounts mainly reflect the interest expense on our $2 billion debt offering that we did in February of '07 with the amount of capitalized interest in the quarter being virtually the entire reason for that year over year $1 million difference.</p>
          <p>Interest income was higher year over year by 4 million. It came in at 10 million versus 6 million a year ago. Interest income was higher year over &#x2013; of that $4 million delta, interest income was actually higher year over year by $1 million. Rates have not gone up dramatically, needless to say, but the amount of cash has, with most of the rest representing higher year over year Q3 earnings from our half interest in Costco Mexico.</p>
          <p>Overall pre-tax earnings were up 39% in Q3, from 340 million last year to 474 this year. Of course, excluding the items outlined in this mornings' press release, that being the $34 million charge taken in Q3 last year and the $14 million benefit benefiting this year's Q3, pre-tax income would have been up 23%, from 374 last year to 460 million this year.</p>
          <p>Our company tax rate came in at 34.5% this year versus 37.75% last year. Last year's tax rate had a couple of discrete items that added slightly to the rate, whereas this year we had a couple items that benefited or lowered the effective rate slightly. Again, there's a multitude of various state and government related tax audits, and that will always fluctuate a little bit from that roughly 36.5 &#x2013; 37% underlying number.</p>
          <p>For a quick rundown of other topics, I won't be going over the balance sheet as it is included in this morning's press release, so you have that already. I will mention that depreciation and amortization for Q3, it was $180 million. And year to date for the first 3 quarters was $549 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of the balance sheet, needless to say quite strong; low debt to cap ratio; accounts payable, in terms of us being able to show dramatic improvements in not having to fund a lot of our inventories. On a reported basis last year in Q3, at Q3 end, our accounts payable as a percent of inventories was 102%. This year in Q3 reported, it was 108%. That includes other payables in addition to merchandise payables, like construction payables. If you look at just merchandise payables accounts payable, last year in Q3 it was 85%. This year in Q3 it was 90, so again an improvement there, a reflection of finally some small amount of sales strength and very little increase &#x2013; effective increase in inventory levels.</p>
          <p>Average inventory per warehouse was up $277,000 per warehouse, from 10.089 to 10.366 million or up 3%. Actually that $277,000 figure would only be up 90,000 if you exclude the year over year FX impact of 187,000. So no inventory concerns; if anything we saw some examples like seasonal patio furniture the last several weeks we've been scrambling as we sold through that pretty well early in the seasonal season.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, in Q3 '09 we spent 226 million. In Q3 '10 we spent 139 million, so a little less as you might expect. Year to date, we've spent all of 644 million. I'd estimate that our FY '10 CapEx will be somewhat lower than last year's figure, probably 950 to $1 billion. And that of course will increase, and I'll talk about expansion in a minute.</p>
          <p>At Costco Online, as you know, in '09 Costco Online was down about or 5%. For the third quarter and the third quarter year to date, sales were up 5% in the quarter and 7% year to date. E-commerce profits were up 7% in the quarter and 14% year to date. Our average ticket has come down a little, as you might expect, with the fact that we have a very high average ticket because of the items that we sell. But site traffic continues to grow and was up 9% in the quarter year over year.</p>
          <p>Like the four-walled warehouses, on e-commerce a big chunk of the business is electronics. Again, there hasn't been a lot of promotional excitement or lower price excitement on the flat-screen side with increased worldwide demand of flat screens. That seems to be coming to a near end, and the sense I got from our GMM in charge of electronics who just yesterday came back from Asia talking to electronics manufacturers that supplies and hopefully pricing will ease up as we start into the &#x2013; near the end of the summer.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, I mentioned we opened one unit in the quarter. We plan 6 for Q4. That would give us a net total of 15 openings, one of which was a relocation, so 14 net openings in '10. In '11, our current construction schedule shows 26 locations including 2 relos, so 24 net.</p>
          <p>I'll mention before I go into fiscal '11, I'll mention that at Q3 end, our total square footage &#x2013; some of you have asked for that &#x2013; stood at 76.190 million square feet of retail space.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of expansion plan for '11, currently there are 24 projects net new projects active on the current construction list. 9 of these are planned for months 11 and 12 of that year, but they are active real projects. So my guess is, is that the figure for '11 will ultimately be around 20 to 22, including 7 or 8 outside North America as we've ramped up some of our Asian expansion.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I want to talk about our stock repurchases, which we began after buying nearly $5 billion of stock between July '05 and into the late summer of '08 before the market went to heck and the concerns about liquidity in general became a major concern. We purchased &#x2013; so again, we purchased quite a bit back then. During the week of February 8, which was the last week of our fiscal second quarter, we got back into the market, buying about 250,000 shares that week or about 50,000 a day. During the 12 weeks of Q3, we purchased 1,925,000 shares.</p>
          <p>Now there are 2 or 3 weeks &#x2013; there are several weeks that we were in blackout where we did not buy any. On the days that we did buy, we bought about 50,000 shares a day as compared to 50,000 a day during that last week of Q2. During the first couple of weeks of Q4, we've averaged 100,000 shares a day. It's principally a reflection of what I've stated in the past. We've got an analysis that we update on a periodic basis. And generally speaking, we're not trying to be perfect in deciding when to buy. But as the stock shows a little weakness in the market, not related to us but in general, we buy a little more; and when it shows strength we buy a little less. But overall, we've been a net buyer.</p>
          <p>With that, again there's supplemental information that will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations site right away, within the next hour. You already have the balance sheet. The other stuff in there relates to the quarterly LIFO items, the actual calculation of EPS to show you the little components of it to do your fully diluted calculations, and the like.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back over to Christy for Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, a couple of quick questions, great quarter, guys. One question was I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the Executive Membership program. I think you said it's one-third now. Where do you foresee that potentially going? If you dreamed the dream, where do you think Executive Membership could get for you guys?</p>
          <p>And then just the second question unrelated is &#x2013; I might have missed it, but can you just discuss what the current expectation is for food inflation for you guys over the next 6 months? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Executive Membership, the assumption is, is we're not going to just do Executive Membership. I'm not implying anything by that. There have been no discussions. At what point do we just say hey, we're only going to offer an Executive Membership? That has not been discussed.</p>
          <p>I guess my personal biggest surprise has been the ongoing increase in penetration, even in the most mature country, the US, where we've done it for gosh, 8 or so years now. And the good news there is, is the incremental increased penetration has very little if any adverse selection. If you think about it, who was the first member to sign up for this 7, 8 years ago? It was the owner of a restaurant or a convenience store that's already buying $25,000 or more of membership rewardable merchandise. And so for doing nothing other than paying an extra $50 or so, they get a check at the end of the year for $500. Needless to say, all those people have done this for a long time.</p>
          <p>Today, if I had to profile the member who is opting to convert or opting to sign up as an Executive Member, it's somebody whose likely annual purchases are more towards the breakeven of this program. In other words $50 extra divided by 2%; they have to buy $2,500 a year in rewardable merchandise. And those are the people that on an Affinity basis look at an Affinity Program and are incented to buy more. Even though these are smaller rates of increase, I'm surprised they're continuing at the levels that they are, and I think that's good news.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind also in the last &#x2013; we've had US for the longest period. Canada has probably been gosh, 3 or 4 years now. And the UK and Mexico, although Mexico we don't consolidate so they're not in these numbers; in the UK, we just started about 6 months ago. Not a big number yet, but again, the UK is 20 &#x2013; we're just getting ready to open our 22nd unit, so 22 units out of 500-plus, so I think that it will continue.</p>
          <p>The other piece of that is, is that if you go back a couple years ago, for every 100 new members signing up, we tended to get 10 or 12 to actually sign up originally as an Executive Member. Today, that number is in the low to mid-20s. And I think that's partly because we do a better job at the counter, if you will, when somebody is coming in to sign up explaining the virtues of it. So all those things bode well; these people shop more frequently. They buy more. Those that convert, once they convert, they buy at an increasing rate as compared to the control group, and so all that's pretty good.</p>
          <p>In terms of food inflation, in polling buyers in all merchandise categories a couple weeks ago, the general view is over the next 6 months, there is inflation but not a lot. And I think that their view was somewhat influenced by rising oil prices and rising gas &#x2013; or freight costs and manufacturing costs, and that has subsided in the last couple weeks. But if you ask them today, they're still going to say a little bit of inflation. In fresh foods, whether it's meat, produce, there is all kinds of anomalies that impact inflation and deflation there, not just the economy. But overall, I would say sub 1 or 2%, and then that is tempered a little bit at Costco because of the deflationary trends related to increasing penetration of private label, so very modest inflation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, 2 main areas of questions. First on the multi-vendor mailings, what's been the net impact to sales and also margin year-to-year? I understand in April there might have been less couponing, which hurt the comps, and I think you were going to try to take some action here in May. I'm also curious whether that has helped the business this month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, the action is more of a timing issue. I think on a fiscal year over fiscal year basis, it's maybe 31 versus 33 weeks or 33 versus 35. I mean it's a couple of extra weeks. As it related to April and Bob's comments on the monthly call, that had to do more with timing of a given mailer where one started earlier last year. And so we benefited a little &#x2013; it hurt a little one month and it benefited a little the other month.</p>
          <p>The bigger issue with MVMs is if you go back a year ago or a year and a half ago, there was always 3 or 4 or 5 items that were $1,000 TVs or $1,200 TVs with $300 off, or $900 for $200 off; as well as &#x2013; a little less of an issue but the same thing on PCs or laptops. Again, right now, there's very little of that. I don't have the exact dollar numbers. There has probably been a slight less on a per-week basis a dollar amount of sales from the MVMs. But also people are pushing more basic household goods, where again when we talked about it on a monthly basis some of the non-foods categories that have been in the low to high teens comps, some of those are influenced by some of the items you see there. There is lots of 30 to $80 items in the MVMs, whether it's &#x2013; I don't have that one in front of me, but things for the home, but not the $1,000 items, and so that's part of the impact there. The view is that will start to lighten up near the end of the summer in terms of being able to offer some promotionals, but there's no guarantee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, my other question was on the gas operations. What actually was the year-to-year EPS benefit to you in the fiscal third quarter? And then we've found that the gas price advantage for Costco seems to have widened versus competitors, maybe 0.03, $0.05 per gallon over the last 6 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. What was the latter part of that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a question about has your gas margin &#x2013; sorry, your gas price per gallon, it looks like it has widened versus the competition over the last 6 months. If we're correct on that, has that resulted in better comp gallons? And then with the big drop in oil, can you remind us how it's impacting the business? You turn the inventory faster. Would you be seeing a bigger benefit to the bottom line, or would you be putting that into more aggressive pricing? Sorry, I know there is a bunch of questions there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, gas is one of those things that &#x2013; it's a like a teenager. You love them but it drives you crazy sometimes. In the quarter year over year, there was a small benefit, less than a couple of cents, maybe a couple cents at most, 0.01 to $0.02. I think it rounds to 0.02, but usually, we don't talk about that other than when it's a big delta.</p>
          <p>In terms of the gap of 0.03 to $0.05, are you suggesting that our prices compared to our competitors, that gap has spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The gap has widened as we've looked at it, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't see that. I think that may be more regional. But all I can tell you is we comp shop our gasoline in some locations 2 or 3 times a day versus the direct competitors of Sam's or some of the discount stores or supermarkets, and at least once a day in all locations, so we feel we're very competitive. I assume we're all making more money this week versus 2 or 3 weeks ago as gas prices came down. That's good for us. So we enter Q4 positively, although we made a decent chunk of money in gas last year in Q4. And what I've learned is, is even though we're 2-1/2 weeks into Q4, I can't extrapolate for 16 weeks. As soon as you bring out the party frills, something happens and gas prices go up and oil prices go up and the profitability is tempered some. But we're starting off well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. The other small question in there was the change in the comp gallon trend. Has there been any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gallons are up. I don't think there has been &#x2013; if anything, last year the trend was flat a little bit, and it's improving a little bit this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where we saw a big comp gallon change was in '08 when prices went through the roof and people were talking $4-a-gallon gas during the spring and summer of '08. That's when we and I'm sure some other warehouse clubs virtually in every market in the country, whether it was Missoula, Montana or in Los Angeles when the local TV consumer advocate was on the nightly news talking about where's the cheapest place to buy gas, we benefited greatly from that. We saw gallonage comps go up dramatically as people were trying to save money. That is not as big an issue now, but we're still seeing some. So as prices fell dramatically, again it was flattish and now it's up a little. Next question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. I just wanted to go into the gross profit to make sure I understood &#x2013; I heard you correctly. So the total is down 11. If you look within core, you're down 10. But I believe you said the core, I guess within the core, it was up 14. Is that correct? So within the 4 &#x2013; the 80% of the business, it was up 14?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. If you think about it, and these are not exact numbers. I'm just doing this on the back of the envelope here. If you assume that the core relative to gas is 800 basis points delta?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It might be a little more than that. If you have 800 basis points and a little bit over 2 percentage points of reduced sales penetration of that higher margin stuff, the core.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>2.25 or 2.5 percentage point &#x2013; about 2, 3 penetration difference times 8 or 900 is 20 basis points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that 14 compares to the plus 5 a year ago, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that's a plus 19 versus a down 3 last quarter. So I'm just trying to get a sense for what changed within the quarter that led to such a big improvement. Was it markup rate? Was it IMU? Was it lower markdowns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a little bit of everything. It's higher penetration of fresh foods. It's slightly lower what we call DND. It's an improvement in our sales returns reserve a little bit, which impacts the margin through the salvage estimates. It really is a lot of little things. It's not like we sat around the table 12 weeks ago and said how can we improve margins more. There's generally a trend that margins are not the issue, that we can show some improvement and still be competitive. And Bob Nelson is sitting here saying, you and I did, but we're not the merchants. But the fact is that it is a lot of little things.</p>

          <p>All right, I'll circle back with you offline. And I guess my last question would be if you look at cash and short-term investments per share, you're sitting at I think an all-time high of $12. It sounds like you're starting to buy back stock. Are there any other plans to utilize cash in any other way? Are you going to get a little more aggressive on the buyback? You're sitting with a lot of cash.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My comments a minute ago implied that we are more aggressive. We were more aggressive in the latter part of Q3 than the beginning of Q3. We are more aggressive in the first 2 weeks of Q4 than all of Q3 or the latter part of Q3; so yes, more aggressive there. In addition, my guess is, is 900 million of the $2 billion debt was 5-year money that comes due in March of 2012, which is now only less than 2 years away. We'll write a check for that, so there's 900 million that we'll spend. And CapEx should ramp up nicely in '11 and '12 compared to the roughly little over 1 billion in '08 and '09. So those are the 3 areas that I would see more.</p>

          <p>The average of the 3 monthly numbers that you've released already comes in below the 3% comp that you reported today for the US business excluding gas. And I'm wondering if that implies that the first 9 days of May is trending above what you did on those April numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a little bit of an anomaly because our quarter is like February 10 or so. We gave out February, March, and April, so we didn't give out anything for May. He's saying the implication is it's a little better. I'd have to look at the numbers. I don't think there's any major change either way.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then also if you give us a little update on what's going on competitively out there. Wal-Mart is getting more aggressive on rollbacks. We're starting to see that roll into the beverage area a little bit. Are you feeling any impact from that, or can you see it at all in your stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not seen it, but it is top of my discussion every day around here. And the merchants are out there looking, recognizing we're less impacted by what Wal-Mart is doing versus what Sam's is doing. And Sam's has always been very competitive, as have we. They are taking certain items down dramatically. And there are certain items &#x2013; I'm not going to say which ones that we have taken down to cost, a very small number, by the way, and we'll do what we have to do. But overall that has not really been a big impact to us. I think it's a much bigger impact to supermarkets and general merchandise retailers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the quarter here, part of the margin performance that you posted was much better SG&amp;A control. In fact, you said this was one of your best SG&amp;A control quarters in some time. Is there anything you can point to specifically that you're doing that might give us some comfort that that trend will continue, or is it just lapping some of those healthcare problems?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The healthcare is lapping, but all the healthcare and related benefits costs were still a detriment but a much lower detriment in Q3 over Q3 as compared to Q2 over Q2 or Q1 over Q1. I think payroll was the biggest one. I think we in the last year, we've reduced the average SKU count, which means &#x2013; we still have the same square footage, so we're just maxing out and are more efficient in what we are selling. We have gone back &#x2013; I've used the comment that for many years I'd always say there are not a lot of silver bullets because we're pretty efficient. But in tough times one gets more efficient, and everybody out there I think is working a little harder. And even the little things we're doing, whether it was changing out the color copiers to being &#x2013; you have to opt in to color. I've used that example. There are lots of little things. There are no big giant changes out there in the warehouse other than a focus, a renewed focus on expenses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Richard, if we could just continue on that line of the expense control, it looks as if that 10 basis points of payroll leverage is quite good. Could you remind us what happened with the renegotiations of the contracts, what that implies in terms of leverage opportunity going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Every 3 years, which the 3-year period most recently was March of 2010, we rewrite our employee agreement. It's not a contract. It's actually an employee agreement that we send to them. On the 60 locations out of 500-plus that are union, that is a contract but it's very similar to what you see in the employee agreement for the non-union employees.</p>
          <p>And the question, if you go back a year ago that with the economy bad, what happens to top of scale, which is about a little over half of our hourly employees are at top of scale, what type of increases are they going to get each year; basically very little change from prior years. If you look back at the last 2 or 3, 3-year employee agreements, so 2007 to 2010, 2004 to 2007, and so on, once they're at top of scale, they rise pretty quickly from when they start here over those first 4 or 5 years to get to top of scale with big increases each year. Once they hit top of scale, historically it has been somewhere around a 2.5% increase. So rough number at top of scale was $20 you assume. $0.50 an hour would be a 2.5% increase. We went into it discussing things, but generally speaking, we felt this was an important time to continue that when employees are in need. And so there's not a lot of benefit to the bottom line from saying hey, we can only do half as much because we chose do as much.</p>
          <p>I think where we're going to see a benefit on the labor side is we have great employee relations. I think we've seen some of the improvement in payroll percent is that people get it. Our people get it and they are working harder and smarter. I think also if we get a little leverage from sales that will help.</p>
          <p>Where I think the opportunity is going to be is some actions that we can take on the healthcare side. That's a big nut. It's growing, forgetting about the increased number of people eligible because of slowing warehouses. That will improve as we ramp up warehouses a little bit; but more importantly, making our employees better consumers. We're not going to do takeaways but we, like a lot of companies, are looking at a lot of things like &#x2013; I'll give you a simple example. In the greater Puget Sound, let's say there is 20 places, hospitals, medical clinics, where you can get a standard MRI, mammogram, or a colonoscopy. Those are 3 major items. The contract and negotiated large company here rates could range &#x2013; there could be a 4-fold delta between the cheapest and the most expensive in the community. Now we're not going to just say you can only go to the cheapest, but it's been structured so they can go anywhere. And there's got to be some rationale there that something that costs $1,000 in one hospital; and 8 miles away in another well known hospital costs $2,800. We're not doing anything that other companies aren't doing, but we're looking at all those types of things, and we think we can save money and to help control that a little more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just to be clear on the employment agreements, no change. It had been &#x2013; I guess we had been calling it out as perhaps a BB, not a silver bullet, but an opportunity, but it sounds as if no change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. And then just talking about on the &#x2013; you had mentioned on the earlier question, a small number of items you priced at cost. Can you just perhaps dig into that a little bit? I know not that long ago, a year ago, you guys got a jump on being quite aggressive and we saw traffic picked up but we also saw the impact on margins. Could you give us a sense as you talk about Wal-Mart is top of mind and top of &#x2013; center around the discussion around there as it relates to the rollbacks. What would be the tipping point in terms of getting more aggressive like we saw last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, last year, which we were talking about essentially December of '08, when commodity prices had fallen precipitously but the underlying commodities from vendors were lagging 4 to 8 weeks, and we chose to &#x2013; given that comps were heading towards zero, we chose to basically take upon ourselves about 30 to $35 million in commodity markdowns on a limited number of items but in the aggregate 30 to $35 million: rotisserie chickens, milk, cheese, butter, to drive traffic. And we saw an improvement in frequency. And that was the perfect storm, as I described it back then, because we knew that it was a matter of weeks, not months or years, where the underlying procurement costs to us would come down and fall in place. But that hurt us because we didn't get price protection on that.</p>
          <p>I don't see any current scenario that dictates that. Again, Wal-Mart is amazing in what they can do and what they're doing right now. But a lot of that's Wal-Mart versus supermarkets, not Sam's versus Costco. I think we and Sam's and BJ's but we and Sam's in this regard are fiercely competitive, have always been. I think we both know that if one of us gets aggressive, the other one is going to be equally aggressive. And arguably, we've got Jim, and we're aggressive. I don't see that as a current issue. Things could change tomorrow, but we're going to hold our stand here. But there's nothing in today's tea leaves that tell me differently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the items that are down to cost in terms of &#x2013; could you be a little bit more specific in terms of categories, where they are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's one &#x2013; I heard one example yesterday in a meeting. It wasn't a meeting on Wal-Mart. It was a meeting on a lot of things. And there was one item in health and beauty aids where they're selling it below cost. And we've taken it down to cost, and we got out of the item. It's one little item, and I don't want to say what it is. But it's meaningless to the company other than I'm sure there are some other things out there. But we are &#x2013; let's face it. We and Sam's are fierce competitors and respect one another, and we both also are pressured to make money. I think that we'll hold our own here.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then the D&amp;A growth, I think you said it was 180 million, so the growth was about 5% year over year. That was a big step down. I think in the second quarter, D&amp;A was up 15% year over year. Is that correct? And if so, is it just a slowdown in the clubs? It seems likes a pretty steep drop-off. Is that what we should be thinking going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's more than anything timing of openings. I asked the same question this morning when I said sequentially it looked like it was a little less of an increase in Q3. It's just timing of a few things, nothing dramatic there. Once we ramp up expansion &#x2013; I think part of it also is we had committed a little more over the last year to IT, which has 3 and 5-year write-downs, so nothing earth shattering there.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Richard, 2 questions for you. One, you talked about a lower SKU count in the store. What's the current number that you guys are operating with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>SKU count: 3,750.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and is there a plan to change that or take that any lower from where you are today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're comfortably low right now. Keep in mind, probably 4 years ago when the stated goal internally was 4,000, it was inching towards 4,200, when Jim every monthly budget meeting would say guys, would you like me do it. Would you like to do it or would you like me to do it? Take about half an hour. Then the feeling was, as the top 200 items or 5% of the items represent darn near 40% of sales, you can imagine with the bottom 200. Let's mash out and we'll do more aggregate volume. So I think that we feel comfortable where we are right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then are there any new brands that are in different categories that you're excited about, things that you're selling now or you're looking to get that you can talk about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of &#x2013; there's certainly &#x2013; and I'm sorry. I just don't have &#x2013; I missed that one, so I don't have that list in front of me. I know there are more brands in apparel and more availability of some apparel. In terms of the KS [Kirkland Signature], I think between now and the end of the year and into next year, look for some more branded private label items and lots of supermarket consumables, canned goods and things like that. I think in the last 6 months, you've seen things like KS Macaroni &amp; Cheese and the like, both dry and canned foods. Electronics I think again is &#x2013; 3D will happen. I'm not sure everybody's going to jump on it the first day, but we'll be there. LED back-lit, there are some things there that are exciting on that side, but I'm stretching here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And so, Richard, when you look overall at the trends, some of the things you're naming but discretionary versus non-discretionary, where do you think we are from a consumer perspective today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the biggest change from now versus a year and a half ago was the fact that as TVs &#x2013; as flat screens went from 2,000 to 1,500 to 1,200 to 900 to 800 to 700, and demand units were up huge. And finally I think that has been sated a little bit, the appetite. As well with increasing demand worldwide like in China and India and what have you is what I'm being told that for the first time in a long time over the last few months, the underlying cost of the panels, the OEM cost of the panels was up dramatically. So there's not a lot of promotional money do the multi-vendor mailers and things like that. So not only do you have price deflation in some of those categories over the last couple years, you've got a little less demand than you had historically.</p>
          <p>I think that being said, what is a positive for us? We went into this season with patio furniture, which we sell between January and March, a couple months before the season starts, and want to be out a couple months before the season ends. We've been scrambling. Probably by mid-March, we were scrambling for extra inventory because while we were a little conservative committing this year, not a lot conservative but a little conservative, we sold through it very well. So whereas people &#x2013; my favorite article that I read about all this was called Frugality Fatigue. People were frugal last year, and some of them are a little tired of being frugal. And they're buying things for the home; and whether it's doormats or housewares or coffee machines or live goods, plants, that's stuff that has been strong.</p>

          <p>I know that you guys can appreciate the difficulty for us in forecasting gas's net impact on your gross margins, and you've cited some changes in penetration but pretty good gross margins on gas itself now. But do you think that gas will have more or less of an impact on company-wide gross margins in Q4? What's the trend right now?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was going to say I think it will be a lesser negative. You're still going to have year over year inflation in gas. And so that penetration on lower margin &#x2013; you'll have better margins probably year over year, but not as great as I mentioned here in Q3. A year ago in Q3, we lost a little money. This year we made a little money. Last year in Q4, we made more than a little, not a huge amount but more than a little. We're entering this quarter pretty good. So let's assume we do a little better than last year bottom line-wise. Therefore, gas grows margin-wise. Still, the increasing penetration dwarfs it.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our sales penetration, all I can tell you is that sales penetration has been fine. There has not been any dramatic change. I think one of the issues for us has been over the last year when we saw &#x2013; everybody talked about the restaurant business is down. First of all, the restaurant business was more down for the bigger restaurants, the bigger, higher end restaurants, which is not necessarily our customer. And then if it's true that the restaurant business was down, who benefited? Supermarkets and warehouse clubs, so I think we had some offset there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then we were impressed with higher traffic on top of difficult comparisons. Can you talk about what the basket looked like?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I go out there, it's a lot of food and sundries. There are fewer TVs in the basket, not a lot fewer but fewer. And again, I think we have become &#x2013; I think if there's a silver lining to this horrible economy over the last year and a half is that the warehouse clubs and us in particular are the extreme value proposition. One of our signature categories in our view is fresh foods. People are shopping with us more frequently than they used to. Some of that is restaurant business. In my view, some of that is supermarket business that people are getting more of their stuff at Costco.</p>

So not everything works, but most things do work. And there's not a whole lot that's sacrosanct in terms of branded goods. We want to offer both. We want to show our member the quality that we can offer. And clearly if we can get them to be loyal to the KS brand, that's great long term. And we're pretty much prepared to try everything.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's positive. It's still small, a very small percentage. I think it rounds to 1%. But I think we looked at ourselves in the mirror and said we probably were a little bit of &#x2013; a little arrogant. For a long time, we didn't do it for whatever reason, and even though technology-wise it got a lot simpler and it did not have any real impact to the front end in terms of slowing up the lines, in our view that it really isn't our member. The reality is it's everybody's member. And if it can help and it's not very costly to do, which is the case, then it's a positive. It's a slight net positive.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Colin McGranahan from Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard, thanks for taking the question, just a quick follow-up on 2 topics that have been discussed already. On SG&amp;A, you gave us the cadence of the growth rate of healthcare, and I know some of the things you're looking at in terms of making your employees better consumers, those are long-tailed. Do you think this 11% growth rate now is more of a steady state growth rate for some period of time, or should that continue to inch down as the compares maybe get a little easier still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that on the one hand, there are things &#x2013; first of all, the long tail is not completely long. This is not like smoking cessation programs or w8 loss programs or exercise more and eat better so you'll have less heart attacks 10 years from now. This is &#x2013; some of these changes can be made in the next year, and each one can be a few million bucks. So it's not giant, but they'll all help.</p>
          <p>I was going to say one other thing. The offset to that is changing healthcare legislation, and not just the new plan. One example; next year, this is &#x2013; I don't think this is even part of what's referred to as the Obama healthcare plan, is that currently, dependents of employees who are under 22 &#x2013; under 18 or under 22 if they're in college, can be on their parents' healthcare plan. And you'll say there's a cost to that to the employer. The new law is &#x2013; I think it goes into effect January &#x2013; either January 1 or September 1 based on the fiscal year but I think it's January 1. The new law is up to 26 and you don't have to be in college. If we look at our current employee base in the US of 95,000 or so people, existing employees who had dependents in the plan but based on their age, they left our plan either at 18 if they weren't going to college or 22 if they were going to college, we have about 13 or 14,000 people out there that have left our plan of current employees.</p>
          <p>Now not all those are going to jump on our plan. If they're working themselves and many of them are, if they're eligible for their own plan, they can't go on our plan. But let's assume half of them do. That's 7,000, and they're young and they're healthy. But even if the average cost was only 2,000, there's $14 million a year. So there are things that will mitigate some of the savings. But nonetheless, I think that &#x2013; I can't guess. I would expect the growth rate in dollars in Q4 given that we had a high increase last year in Q4 is around the same or a little better and hopefully gets a little better. But it's still going to be at best in the high single digits going forward over the next couple years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's really helpful. And then just a final follow-up, through the quarter and really focusing on the US business, the average ticket didn't really improve maybe as much as we might have expected it to. I know you've talked about more frequent trips still happening, but any other thoughts on that? I would think that as the discretionary categories are showing a little bit of life that maybe that average ticket trend should be getting better faster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind they are coming in more. They're buying a little less each time. And also, they're buying more food and sundries and less $1,000 TVs. That goes a long way to changing that average ticket a little bit. I think we're probably half to a little more than half &#x2013; or half to a little less than halfway through a year's cycle in that in terms of the pressure of less TVs.</p>
          <p>If you go back a year or 2 or 3 years ago, one $1,000 television in our MVM, in 2 or 3 we could sell 20 or 30,000 units or 20 to $30 million of one item. There are none of those right now. So those are things that impact it. Is it offset by coffee makers and toaster ovens and exercise equipment and a lot of other things? Yes, we're doing a pretty good job of fighting and tackling. Mind you, a simple one is, is we've got them coming in more frequently. It's not like they're buying it somewhere else. When they start buying it, they're buying it at us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. I wondered if I could ask a follow-up on that question earlier about average ticket. You mentioned consumer electronics and selling less TVs. I think we've spoken in the past and you've talked about how there has been more of a shortage of big TVs, and that's led to better pricing potentially but lower sales. I just wonder if you can give us any view on how that's going to change over the next 6 months or so, whether you see more new TV models coming into the system and whether we should start to expect TV sales to start going up again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The big issue over the last 4 to 10 weeks let's say has been less promotional opportunity for us in MVMs and arguably less &#x2013; offset a little bit by less deflationary trends in there. Again, our VP of majors and electronics literally just got back yesterday from a week in Asia meeting with all the manufacturers. And the view is, is that availability will be greatly enhanced by mid to late summer, that capacity is up. And so there's a feeling going into the seasonal parts of September through Christmas there will be a little more promotional opportunities. I hate to use the word promotional, but let's face it. When you have had something that's been declining on its own 2 or $300 a year, and then on top of that a couple hundred &#x2013; $300, 3-week, $300 off in an MVM mailer, that drives business. Again, there's a not a lot of that excitement in the MVM mailer related to those bigger ticket items right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think in the first quarter or so, we should start to see them coming back in the MVM mailers a bit more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>4 months from now in early October when we talk about Q4, we'll talk about it was still an impact in Q4, the tail end of Q4 and into the first month of Q1 of September, we start seeing a change. That would be my hope.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why is the UK so flat against other international markets? Is it just economy based or is there something else going on in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit of it has to do with &#x2013; in the UK we operate under a slightly different format. If you walk in, it's a membership warehouse club. It looks like a warehouse club. It smells like a warehouse club, and it walks and talks like a warehouse club. The one difference there is, is that in order for us to make economic sense, we locate our facilities in what are called commercial trade areas, not retail areas, which are still expensive but not as expensive and are more available. Because of that, each &#x2013; and I forget if it's cities, states, provinces, but each locale has a minimum required of business to the trade. So we do not market nearly as strongly to non-trade members or non-business members, so we have less of a consumer piece over there. And so that always has impacted us a little bit over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically, what you're saying is the business community there isn't recovering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's my guess. I can't...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're not really getting into any consumer recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our view is, is our pricing is more favorable over there relative because there aren't other warehouse clubs over there, and discounting is not as dramatic. But again, the economy &#x2013; I'm not an economist. I don't have the numbers in front of me for the UK. My guess is it's a little bit of a small business recovery, but also the fact of how we have to market.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just finally, any thoughts on the West Coast, any changes you're seeing to the California economy in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think that sequentially, we're seeing it pick up nicely. It's still at a lower rate than some of the other parts of the country. But I think we're all looking for tidbits every week or every day when you hear something about finally there is a reduction in the foreclosures. But the fact is, again, I think that frugality fatigue helps a little bit, but we are seeing a little pickup. There's at least not the concern that the sky is falling.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, a question on membership growth going forward. You've had a nice little acceleration off of lower levels in prior quarters. How would you expect that to play out in local currency over the next couple of quarters, still at that 7% level or does that start to get a little bit better do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat the question? It broke up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question was regarding membership growth. It's shown some nice improvement in local currency in the last couple of quarters. And I was just curious what your thoughts were over the next couple of quarters. Does it maintain this 7% rate or so, or do you think it can improve off that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would hope it would accelerate somewhat because we're long term opening one unit in each of the last 2 quarters to 6 in Q4, and God willing, around 5 or 6 a quarter in all the quarters next year. Recognizing whatever &#x2013; so that would be &#x2013; should be an improvement, an acceleration. Recognizing any acceleration in terms of the P&amp;L, we record membership fee income on a deferred basis, so if we get an incremental new member tomorrow at $50, it's basically $4 a month extra incrementally into the next 12 months. And so that will temper that rate of acceleration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Through this earnings season, we've heard retailers talk about some softness or choppiness related to weather in May, and obviously we've had a lot of turmoil in the markets over the last few weeks. And I realize comps are next week, but I'm curious. Are you seeing choppiness or any increased volatility in your business over recent weeks as this has unfolded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only choppiness that we see relates to how a holiday falls, like Memorial Day fell a week off, so it helps you one week, hurts you the next week or vice-versa. And the timing of an MVM mailer where if &#x2013; I'm making this up, but let's say last year it was in weeks 1 through 3 of a month, and this week (sic) [year] it's weeks 2 through 4. In week 1 this year, since you had an MVM last year but not this year, you see sales down. And in week 4, it catches back up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just some housekeeping items. I don't know if you mentioned it earlier, but do you have an expected tax rate for the full year? And I was just curious where you think pre-opening and net interest will fall out for the full year also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pre-opening should start to escalate some. I'm sorry; I don't have that in front of me. I'm looking at last year, but it should escalate from where it's been with more openings.</p>
          <p>And interest income &#x2013; by the way, getting back to I think it was Chuck Grom's question on Q2 interest income. The big delta in Q2, interest income, I looked at my notes from Q2 while we were on the call here. And interest income actually was only up a few million dollars year over year in the quarter. The big difference sequentially that, Chuck, you had mentioned was related to first of all Q2 has Christmas; and Mexico &#x2013; our half of Mexico earnings are dramatically higher then. In addition, as I mentioned, I did mention in the Q2 conference call, we did pick up some incremental dollars on FX contracts. Usually that's something that's no more than plus or minus a couple million dollars and I never talk about it. We happened to have in Q2 a benefit of probably a penny, 7 or $8 million, and so that was an anomaly in Q2 that is more of an anomaly whether it was plus or minus in Q2. It was nonetheless an anomaly. And the other big chunk was just quarterly profits in Q2 in Mexico were dramatically different than Q3.</p>
          <p>But looking to Q4, I don't see a big change. Again, it doesn't matter how much cash you have. There ain't a whole lot of money. Given that we know that we're going to pay off $900 million in March of 2012, in the last few months we have taken about $900 million and extended it out up to just under 2 years and are making an extra 80 &#x2013; 90 basis points. So say 900 times 80 basis points is 7 million a year. So maybe annualized you'll get a couple million a quarter from that. But that's not earth shattering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the tax rate for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our tax rate &#x2013; I start every quarter with a tax rate assumption of around 37 or high 36s. And usually it's between &#x2013; again, the percentage in Q3, which was 34.4, part of that is, is Q3 is a lower profit quarter. So when you've got a 3 or $5 million benefit or hit in a quarter on a lower percentage, that changes the percentage more on a lower base.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Richard. Going back to your comments on regional strength, any sense of what percentage would you attribute or just what's &#x2013; is it the region improving or is it that you're just taking share in those regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the Midwest and Texas, a little of it has to do with we're newer there. I almost can't say newer anymore because we've been in those regions now for 10 or so years, but we're not there for 25 years. I think Texas, again we've been there for 10 or so years, and our competitors have been there for 25 years. I think we just are showing some nice improvement there. In Florida &#x2013; or the Southeast, which is Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, I think it's half and half. I think some of it we're taking market share because we've done a pretty good job, and some of it we have some newer units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you haven't &#x2013; I haven't seen the Northeast mentioned in a few quarters here I think now as regional strength. Is it just because it didn't fall as far and so it has less room to improve, or what's happening in the Northeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. But in addition, the Northeast &#x2013; I forget which quarter or which months it was, but they had hard weather patterns. There were a couple &#x2013; and I hate to use that as an excuse, but I know there were a couple of months there a few months ago which really impacted it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
