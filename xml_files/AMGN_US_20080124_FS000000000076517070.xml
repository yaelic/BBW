          <p>Good day ladies and gentleman. My name is Melanie, and I will be your conference facilitator for today's Amgen Fourth Quarter Full Year 2007 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Melanie, thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call this afternoon. We have a lot of ground to cover during this call including a review of our financial results during the fourth quarter and full-year 2007 as well as our best judgment of business trends and risks to our business in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, will lead off with a strategic overview of our business followed by Bob Bradway, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob will provide some additional details on our performance in 2007, as well as our projected growth outlook in 2008. George Morrow, who as you know is our Head of Global Commercial Operations, will then discuss our product performance both within the U.S. and international markets with a particular focus on critical issues that may influence product performance in 2008. Following George will be Roger Perlmutter, our Head of R&amp;D, who in the context of providing a pipeline update will discuss the results of a Phase III study comparing denosumab to alendronate. After Roger's presentation, we'll open it up for your questions.</p>
          <p>We will be using slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that through the course of our presentation today, we will make certain forward-looking statements and, of course, actual results can vary materially.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for joining us. Needless to say 2007 was a challenging year for Amgen and our shareholders. In fact in my now almost 16 years with the company, it stands out as the toughest one we've ever faced. We had safety-related concerns in our ESA franchise and those resulted in the loss of substantial planned revenue and profit. However we took swift, decisive and as I think the numbers show effective actions to restructure our cost base and still fund and advance the pipeline. This enabled us to deliver 2007 earnings per share of $4.29, which remarkably is very close to the low end of our original EPS guidance that we gave last year at about this time. That's despite the unexpected and very large hit to our operating income.</p>
          <p>I'm proud of that operating performance. And I think in 2007, we proved that we are adaptive, we are resilient and we are able to move the company ahead under even the most difficult circumstances. And this 2007 performance gives me enormous confidence in our ability to meet any challenges 2008 may present. I know you want to hear less about last year and more about what lies ahead, so I'm going to give you a top level look at 2008 and some thoughts on guidance. Then we will drill down to the nuances during the rest of this call. To begin with, we know 2008 will bear the full-year impact of the 2007 ESA changes and we will once again operate the business to optimize results and advance the pipeline. Although, we are facing some new competition with Enbrel and with biosimilars in Europe, we have plans in place, we're prepared and our position is solid.</p>
          <p>Our regulatory agency relationships are a key priority for Amgen. We remain committed to doing the right thing for patients and I'm happy to report are in constructive dialogues with both the FDA and EMEA. In fact over the past 10 months, we have moved ahead together to implement three ESA label changes. We will continue to cooperate and work together, because we and these agencies share the same goal which is doing the right thing for patients.</p>
          <p>For 2008 guidance taking all that into consideration, we are projecting a revenue range of 14.2 to $14.6 billion and an earnings per share range of $4 to $4.30 per share. Our guidance range reflects our best judgment about business trends and the ongoing competitive, reimbursement and regulatory risks to our business.</p>
          <p>By the time of our business update, which we are scheduling for June, we'll have more information on all these matters to discuss with you. In fact you are going to hear from us a lot this year because we expect significant pipeline data to emerge. In fact we now have the denosumab head to head versus alendronate data and as you read in the press release, this study met primary and all secondary endpoints. denosumab showed greater increases in bone mineral density as compared to alendronate.</p>
          <p>Also the safety profile for denosumab continues to be encouraging. Roger will discuss that and other details of this trial in more detail later. While more denosumab studies are underway, the results we are going to talk about today give me increased optimism about denosumab's prospects. Simply put, we could not have hoped in this study for better results.</p>
          <p>Also we have a number of molecules in Phase II that we will continue to advance this year. As we examine the data, we will determine which ones make the most sense to take to Phase III ourselves and which ones may need to move forward through partnering or licensing agreements. Again, we will keep you informed. The bottom line is that we have more assets in our pipeline than we can develop ourselves. This is a good problem to have and we want to maximize the potential benefit for patients and shareholders. In every case where the clinical findings show promise, we want these new medicines to have the best chance of reaching people with serious illness.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Bob for the financial review, I want to thank the people at Amgen who put forth a phenomenal effort in 2007. We were able to take a punch and keep going and that gives me confidence that we can handle whatever comes our way. There will undoubtedly be challenges and opportunities in 2008, and we are ready. Bob?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin. If I can direct your attention to page 5, I'll walk you through the fourth quarter adjusted income statement. Starting with revenues for the fourth quarter, as you can see from the slide, revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 2% from $3.8 billion to $3.7 billion. In terms of the product franchises, product sales in our anemia franchise decreased by 17% during this period, while the rest of our product range grew by 9%. In terms of wholesaler inventories during the quarter, all of our major products ended at the high-end of the normal ranges and George will give you a little bit more product detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>Moving to the geographical breakdown of sales, our fourth quarter U.S. sales totaled $2.9 billion, which represents a 7% increase &#x2013; sorry; 7% decrease over the same period from the prior year. Our international sales in the fourth quarter were $747 million, which represents an increase of 17% and these sales were positively impacted by $64 million from foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding those fluctuations, our international product sales increased by 7% during the period.</p>
          <p>Now turning to operating expenses, which I'll discuss on an adjusted basis, you'll note that our operating expenses decreased year-on-year due to our ongoing efficiencies from our announced cost cutting efforts. Starting with cost of sales, for the quarter you can see that cost of sales increased by 3% to a cost of sales margin of about 15.6%. This increase was primarily driven by excess capacity charges at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico.</p>
          <p>Moving to R&amp;D expenses, you can see that our R&amp;D expenses increased 22% during the period and this was primarily due to licensing activity. In the fourth quarter, you may recall we had an inbound licensing deal with Cytokinetics and, of course, in 2007 we derived a benefit from out licensing denosumab in Japan to Daiichi Sankyo. So those were the primary contributors to the 22% decrease. In addition, we had lower staff-related costs and discretionary spend as well resulting from our previously announced restructuring.</p>
          <p>Looking at SG&amp;A, SG&amp;A expenses decreased 1% during the period and this reflects our lower promotion and ad spending on marketed products which decreases were partially offset by our higher Wyeth profit share expenses due to Enbrel sales growth as well as higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense growth is down approximately 3% year-over-year, excluding the higher Wyeth profit share expenses. So despite the increases that I talked about in our business including cost of sales, legal expenses and profit sharing from Wyeth, total operating expenses decreased during the period by 8%, again due to the efficiencies we achieved during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to the tax rate, you can see the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% which is an increase over the prior year but recall that the fourth quarter of 2006 benefited from the retroactive extension of the R&amp;D tax credit as well as a favorable audit settlement during that period. In terms of earnings, adjusted earnings per share were 1 dollar for the quarter, which represents an increase of 11% over the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>Looking at fourth quarter adjusted earnings including stock option expenses, earnings were $0.97, which again represents an increase of 11% compared to the $0.87 we earned on the same basis in the fourth quarter of 2006. And on a GAAP basis, our fourth quarter 2007 earnings per share were $0.76 compared to $0.71 in the fourth quarter of last year, again, representing an increase of 7%. The fourth quarter GAAP earnings were negatively impacted by $157 million of charges, principally related to staff separation costs, accelerated depreciation and accruals for losses on leased facilities in connection with our previously announced restructuring.</p>
          <p>If I can turn your attention to page 6, I'll walk you through the adjusted income statement for the full year. For the full year, you can see revenues increased 4% from $14.3 billion to $14.8 billion. Product sales for our anemia franchise decreased 8% during this period while the rest of our products increased by 14%. Again wholesaler inventories for our major products at year-end were at the high-end of normal ranges. In terms of the U.S. sales during this period, U.S. sales totaled $11.4 billion, which was essentially flat with results from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Looking at the international sales for the full year 2007, we achieved sales of $2.9 billion, which represents an increase of 17% and, again, these sales were positively impacted by foreign exchange to the tune of about $193 million. Excluding those foreign exchange fluctuations, our international product sales grew 9% during the year.</p>
          <p>Now again turning to operating expenses on an adjusted basis, our cost of sales increased for the year by 8% to a cost of sales margin of 15.8% and this increase was primarily driven by product mix due to the higher sales of Enbrel as well as other items including the write-off of certain new product presentations and excess capacity charges at our facility in Puerto Rico. Excess capacity charges are expected to continue to occur through 2008 as we have previously indicated to you. R&amp;D expenses over the period decreased 4%, again this was primarily due to the licensing activity that I've previously described.</p>
          <p>Turning to SG&amp;A, SG&amp;A expense growth was 5% during the year and this reflects the higher Wyeth profit share expenses, again due to Enbrel sales growth as well as higher legal costs for the full year. These increases were partially offset by our lower promotion and ad spending for marketed products. For the full year, SG&amp;A expense was essentially flat once you strip out the higher Wyeth profit share expenses. For the full year tax rate, you see the full year adjusted tax rate was 21.3%, which represents a decrease from the 22.3% that we reported in 2006.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share were $4.29, which represents an increase of 10% over the prior year. Including stock option expenses, the earnings per share were $4.17, which again represents an 11% increase compared to the $3.76 that we reported in 2006. And again briefly touching on earnings per share on a GAAP basis, our 2007 earnings per share on a GAAP reported basis were $2.82 compared to $2.48 in 2006, which represents an increase of 14%. 2007 GAAP earnings were negatively impacted by the write-off of $590 million of acquired in-process research and development related to our previously announced acquisition of Alantos and Ilypsa, as well as $739 million of charges primarily related to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, staff separation costs and accruals for losses on our leased facilities in connection with the restructuring.</p>
          <p>On page 7, we provided some highlights from our balance sheet and statement of cash flows. As you can see, we ended the year 2007 with a global cash balance of $7.2 billion. As you can see, our debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $11.2 billion, and just to remind you, the increase over the year end 2006 represents an increase of $2.2 billion and that's primarily due to the issuance earlier in 2007 of $4 billion of senior notes, offset by the repayment of our $1.7 billion LYONs security.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital expenditures, for the year, as you can see we spent approximately $1.3 billion on capital expenditures and that included about $234 million in the fourth quarter of the year. Our capital expenditures were lower in the fourth quarter versus prior year primarily due to the indefinite postponement of our construction of the manufacturing facility in Ireland as well as other capital project reductions due to our previously announced restructuring.</p>
          <p>In terms of share repurchases, we repurchased 87 million shares during the year at a total cost of $5.1 billion. And just to remind you we currently have in excess of $6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under our Board stock repurchase -- Board approved stock repurchase programs.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 8, as Kevin mentioned earlier and as you've seen in our release, we are offering revenue guidance for 2008 in the range of 14.2 to $14.6 billion and we are offering earnings per share guidance, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4 to $4.30.</p>
          <p>Looking at the components of our operating income during the period of 2008, we are expecting that our cost of sales will increase slightly as a percent of sales versus 2007. In terms of R&amp;D, again we are expecting a slight increase as a percentage of sales compared to 2007. We are expecting that SG&amp;A will be similar to what it was in 2007 when excluding the Wyeth profit share. In terms of the Wyeth profit share, we are expecting that to amount to about one-third of our total SG&amp;A expense in 2008 versus the approximately 30% that it comprised in 2007.</p>
          <p>We are expecting the tax rate in 2007 -- 2008 to be similar to 2007 levels and in that we are assuming that the R&amp;D tax credit will be reenacted. Capital expenditures we are expecting to be approximately $1 billion during 2008 and we will continue to be opportunistic with respect to our share buyback program.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the floor over to George, who will walk us through our product performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Bob. Let's go right to the commercial highlights on slide 11. The components of the 3% full year product sales growth are the ESA franchise, which accounted for 43% of product sales declined 8% and the remaining portfolio grew 14% year-over-year. As I'll show you in a moment, the ESA franchise sales trend was flat and stable during the latter part of the year as physicians incorporated the new label and reimbursement policies into their anemia management approaches.</p>
          <p>Next is slide 12. For references purposes this slide displays the fourth quarter and the full year sales in growth rates for our major products, but I'm not going to go into any additional detail on this slide. Moving to the next slide, which is Aranesp, physician response has been rapid and ESA utilization patterns now largely reflect new label and reimbursement changes. As such, Aranesp weekly sales stabilized in a reasonably tight range starting in mid-September and extending through most of the fourth quarter. As you think about the true underlying demand trend, however, it's necessary to adjust fourth quarter sales for a few one-time items totaling approximately $50 million. These include a downward adjustment to return accruals, a recovery of certain accruals taken for Medicaid discounts under the Deficit Reduction Act and a modest typical quarter end end-user inventory build.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., segment share held relatively steady in both oncology at about 64% and nephrology at about 53%. On the international side, Aranesp declined by 3% in the fourth quarter, excluding foreign exchange benefits. Our exit share was two points higher for total Aranesp in Europe and pricing was negatively impacted by the intensifying competitive environment with several biosimilars peg-EPO and Dynepo entering the market.</p>
          <p>As we enter 2008 with a fairly stable but flat Aranesp sales trend, we see several important issues that may influences future sales. The outcome of ODAC, the net effects of label changes, which Roger will discuss in a moment, reimbursement policy changes by either public or private payers and competitive behavior in the U.S. and Europe. Note that for the first two quarters of 2008, we'll have particularly tough comparators given that the full effect of all of the changes of last year were realized from mid-September on. The ESA environment remains dynamic and we'll keep you informed as events unfold.</p>
          <p>Next slide, to continue to assist you in understanding the components of Aranesp revenue over time, we have updated the chart that you previously saw first in 2006. The blue boxes contain the full year numbers while the red numbers show the fourth quarter breakdown. As mentioned, the global Aranesp business declined by 12% in 2007 versus 2006. In the U.S., the largest impact was seen in oncology, particularly in oncology clinics where practices are highly sensitive to reimbursement changes. As this slide indicates, the U.S. oncology component was 1.55 billion in 2007 versus the 2.1 billion we showed for 2006, a decline of 26%. Our international oncology business fared a bit better in 2007 versus 2006, growing from about 500 million in 2006 to about 550 million in 2007.</p>
          <p>Next is EPOGEN on slide 15. EPOGEN declined 3% in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus the fourth quarter of 2006, driven by a 7% decline in dose and utilization that was partially offset by 3% patient growth and some other minor adjustments. For the full year, EPOGEN declined 1% in 2007 as compared to 2006, also driven by a reduced dosing utilization resulting from changing practice patterns due to label changes and the EMP. A further modest decline in dosing utilization in 2008 is possible to the degree that some physicians have not yet modified their prescribing patterns according to the January 2008 EMP update. And just as a reminder, this update includes restricted reimbursements from monthly doses above 400,000 units, and persistent hemoglobin measurements above 13 grams per deciliter.</p>
          <p>Next is slide 16. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined grew 9% fourth quarter '07 versus fourth quarter '06. In the U.S. sales increased by 4% driven primarily by demand and more specifically price, with underlying unit growth for Neulasta flat versus last year. While U.S. wholesaler inventories ended slightly above the normal range, this was not a factor in sales growth year-on-year due to the fact that 2006 ended with a similar inventory picture.</p>
          <p>International Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew at 29% year-on-year, 18% excluding foreign exchange effects. As noted in the past couple of calls the ESA issues in the U.S. have impacted sales force share of voice for Neulasta. However, we have refocused our efforts on this important franchise and saw a positive trend in share of voice through the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2007 worldwide Neulasta/NEUPOGEN sales also grew 9% versus full-year 2006.</p>
          <p>Enbrel is next on slide 17. Once again in the fourth quarter 2007 we've experienced solid growth of 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2006 driven by demand. As you may recall from our first quarter call last year, there were two factors contributing to the decline in the first quarter of 2007 versus the prior quarter: a favorable discount adjustment of $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the typical behavior pattern of many patients filling an extra prescription prior to the beginning of plan year. Both rheumatology and dermatology segments had double-digit growth versus the fourth quarter of 2006, and despite some share loss in both segments, we maintained our leadership position. In terms of the full-year, greater focus on mobilizing patients to seek treatment and better assistance in helping patients clear reimbursement hurdles were the chief drivers of the 12% growth versus the prior-year.</p>
          <p>Turning to 2008, we have shifted to a wholesaler distribution model in January, which we estimate will result in roughly 10 days of sales as wholesalers build inventory. As indicated in our third quarter 10-Q, we are in discussions with the FDA with respect to the class of TNF inhibitor agents around several safety issues. Such discussions may result in additional patient safety information in the form of a box warning that will apply to the Enbrel label as has been the case with other TNF inhibitor agents. Roger will speak more to this issue shortly.</p>
          <p>Dermatologist continue to believe that Enbrel has the best balance of safety and efficacy so new competitors will have to meet a high hurdle of proof regarding long-term safety when they launch in 2008.</p>
          <p>On to Sensipar in slide 18, for the fourth quarter worldwide Sensipar sales grew 31% versus the fourth quarter of 2006. Earlier last year we felt that Sensipar was being negatively impacted by the distraction of the ESA issues among our US nephrology customers. Our field organization has done an excellent job of making sure that Sensipar messaging is heard and this enabled us to turn in a strong fourth quarter in the US with nearly 23% year-over-year growth. And international sales grew even faster at 57%. Full year 2007 worldwide Sensipar sales of 463 million showed that this product has become an important therapy in the kidney disease setting.</p>
          <p>Next is Vectibix, Vectibix revenue and share declines appear to have stabilized during the fourth quarter. Future growth is highly dependent upon label expansion into first and second line metastatic colorectal cancer incorporating our new information on KRAS. The KRAS biomarker data holds the potential to redefine the benefit risk profile of the class by identifying metastatic colorectal cancer patients who are more or less like to respond to treatment.</p>
          <p>I will finish up with an overview of our international business on slide 20. We drove fourth quarter overall growth of 7% despite the fact that ESA dosing was more conservative. Dynepo was launched earlier in the year and several biosimilars and peg-EPO were launched in certain markets in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So far the only impact of the new ESA competition has been some modest Aranesp price erosion. In fact Aranesp share increased slightly year-over-year. In 2008 we will encounter the full effect of the new competition including potential G-CSF biosimilars, but so far so good. Roger?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, George. Going on to slide 22 let me summarize the key events in 2007 for the research and development organization. 2007 of course was a year that was formed substantially by our interaction with international regulatory agencies with regard to erythropoietic stimulating agents. We worked hard to improve ESA labeling. Our goal in all of this is to ensure that ESAs are used appropriately and that physicians and patients are informed about any risks that may be understood with respect to ESA. We issued "Dear Healthcare Professional" letters to over 66,000 healthcare providers following the March and November labeling updates and posted labeling changes on our website, communicated new information to investigators and the results of safety studies and we are working with agencies to finalize our pharmacovigilance studies.</p>
          <p>For Vectibix, we received conditional approval in Europe based on the use of KRAS as a predictive biomarker and we continue to study this and other biomarkers in order to better understand how to use Vectibix in the colorectal cancer setting.</p>
          <p>We also filed romiplostim, or Nplate in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia and I will have a little bit more to say about that in a moment.</p>
          <p>But in 2007 as a result of the events that Kevin and George and Bob have described, it was necessary to restructure the R&amp;D organization. And in the face of this restructuring, we, at the same time, were able to progress our late-stage clinical programs and to achieve unprecedented expansion of the early pipeline. Indeed on the numbers, and those numbers are, for example, the advancement of new molecules from basic research to preclinical development, from preclinical development into the clinical setting and movement of Phase I programs into Phase II. On these numbers, 2007 was the best year in the history of Amgen research and development which to me speaks volumes about the resiliency and adaptability of our R&amp;D organization.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 23 with respect to erythropoietic stimulating agents, our discussions with the FDA are continuing and the EMEA is working to harmonize ESA labels. We described this in the fall of last year and we do expect that in the very near future, there will be a harmonized ESA label in Europe. We are preparing for the ODAC meeting in March and we are working with closely with the FDA. My expectation is that we will be able to go in together with a presentation that describes what's known and what we agree on and those areas where there are still unknown features of ESA safety and what can be done about that both to pursue detailed analysis of any potential safety concern and also to implement a risk management plan. And we'll be rolling out the details of that risk management plan in the very near future.</p>
          <p>We also completed enrollment of our TREAT study, which you'll recall, is the large outcome study in patients with renal insufficiency who are diabetic not on dialysis in which we are asking whether treatment of anemia in that population improves overall outcomes defined as all cause mortality and a composite cardiovascular endpoint. In all of these actions our primary priority is patient safety. We are trying to do the very best we can to ensure that there is appropriate use of ESAs to treat anemia.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 24, with respect to Enbrel, as George mentioned, we are in discussions with the FDA to improve our label for Enbrel. We are expecting that there will be a box warning related to serious infection as there is with other TNF inhibitor agents. As many of you have seen we published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the most prestigious healthcare related journals in the United States, the data demonstrating that children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who received treatment with Enbrel experienced very significant improvements in their disease and this with a quite acceptable safety profile. So we are very enthusiastic about these new data.</p>
          <p>In slide 25, I provided an update on some other marketed products. With respect to Vectibix, we have completed now enrolment in the first line colorectal cancer Phase III study, and in addition we expect our second line colorectal cancer study to complete its enrollment in the first quarter of this year on target. In both of these studies, we are now employing a data analysis algorithm that includes analysis of the status of the KRAS oncogene in the tumors in these patients and what we have shown, as is described in the ASCO GI press release from today and that was previously presented in part at the European Congress on Clinical Oncology is that patients who you have the mutant version of KRAS in the third line colorectal cancer setting do not benefit from Vectibix treatment. The question really at the moment is, whether the first or second line colorectal cancer setting, we can improve patient responses and reduce inappropriate toxicity by focusing Vectibix treatment on those patients who are most likely to respond that is those who have wild-type KRAS represented in their tumor populations.</p>
          <p>For Sensipar, the EVOLVE study, which is a very large outcome study looking at all cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes when the secondary hyperparathyroidism is treated in patients with renal insufficiency is on target to be completed by the end of January, ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>We also completed our preliminary analyses on two Kepivance head and neck cancer studies; one in patients with resected head and neck cancer and another in patients with head and neck cancer that had not undergone resection. In both of these studies, we found that Kepivance met its primary endpoint of reducing the incidence of severe oral mucositis in patients who are undergoing treatment.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we also saw trends favoring a reduction in the duration and severity of oral mucositis and in the use of narcotic analgesics. However these trends, when adjusted for multiple comparisons, were not statistically significant. The safety profile for Kepivance in this setting was similar to that that was seen in the placebo treated patients and we will have the opportunity to review these data in a great deal more detail at upcoming scientific meetings.</p>
          <p>Turning now to denosumab, the press release that we recently provided to you gives the results for a Phase III head-to-head study, comparing denosumab to alendronate treatment in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In this study primary and all secondary endpoints were met. The study was a fairly straightforward two-armed study, which was conducted internationally. In this study 1,189 patients were enrolled and randomized one-to-one to receive either alendronate which is given as 70 milligrams once weekly by the oral route or denosumab given at the dose at which we are studying postmenopausal osteoporosis, which is 60 milligrams given by subcutaneous injection once every six months.</p>
          <p>The study was designed such that we first compared the bone mineral density at the total hip for non-inferiority and if we met that endpoint, then we compared denosumab versus alendronate treatment for superiority, and we found in that comparison that denosumab was superior to alendronate in terms of improving bone mineral density. I cannot give you the exact numbers because it's our intention to publish these results in a high profile journal and I don't want to compromise that publication. But I will simply say that at the total hip, which is the primary endpoint that the effect of denosumab exceeded the effect of alendronate by 40% and alendronate behaves as has been seen in many other prior studies of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who were treated with this bisphosphonate. So this is really a very exciting result and we are extremely enthusiastic about it. I should point out that the results at other skeletal sites were similar and each one of our secondary endpoints was met as I've indicated. The safety profiles for denosumab and alendronate were very similar, and that includes the serious adverse events where they are indistinguishable. So we feel extremely comfortable in this much larger study now that denosumab is behaving as we had expected.</p>
          <p>I would point out that denosumab is the most potent anti-resorptive agent that has ever been introduced into clinical practice as judged by preclinical studies, and it certainly behaved that way in this clinical study. Now, bone mineral density is not a registration endpoint, and this study will not prove to be a basis for registration. The important thing of course is what happens in our 216 study, which is our postmenopausal osteoporosis fracture study, which is on track to deliver data in the second half of this year, as is our Phase III study in men who have undergone hormone ablation by GnRH superagonists or antagonists for prostate cancer. In addition we completed our phase 3 enrollment in our breast cell related event study, and we are expecting a very, very robust data set in 2008. We are on track to review the entire PMO data set which includes the fracture study, the hormone ablation study in breast cancer, hormone ablation in prostate cancer, the study in women with osteopenia not yet progressed to osteoporosis as well as the head to head study all of those data which form together our registration package in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to a pipeline update then on slide 27, my last slide. As I indicated romiplostim or Nplate was granted priority review by the Food and Drug Administration. We do expect a regulatory decision in the first half of 2008. As was announced today there will be an ODAC review scheduled for 12 March, which will provide an opportunity for us to once again go over the very substantial data set that supports registration of this drug in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura the complete data were reviewed at the American Society of Hematology meetings in December which included 11 posters and three oral presentations describing aspects of our studies including two pivotal Phase III studies which met all endpoints.</p>
          <p>Our mid stage pipeline is advancing with nine new molecules advancing into Phase II programs in 2007. In 2007 we also out licensed AMG 623, our BAFF BLyS antagonist, which is part of the effort that we are making to seek partners for programs that no longer fit within our broader therapeutic area. And I would emphasize again that all of this performance was achieved at a time when we were struggling to gain efficiencies and to improve the way in which the R&amp;D operation works based on the financial constraints that affected us in 2007. The fact that we were able to do all of this in 2007 bodes well for what we will be able to achieve in 2008.</p>

          <p>Hi guys, good quarter and thanks for taking the question. Looking on your slide 14, the Aranesp segment breakout, I'm comparing this with an earlier slide that you guys have for '06 and a couple of questions: one for the US non-oncology, it looks like that was down 100 million year-over-year. Can you talk about the drivers there? Then the second part is that the US oncology division of that if you could just segment that, between CIA, AOC and MDS that will be great?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Geoff. Because of the reimbursement change that taken place distinguishing between say AOC and MDS is just &#x2013; it is kind of a fruitless exercise right now. So we are not going to do that any longer.</p>
          <p>Going to the non-oncology we did lose some business there and basically what's happening is doctors are titrating to a lower hemoglobin level. It's close to 11 at this point. So that reflects some decreased utilization but decreased dosing.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. So just to go back to the slide 14, George, the other thing that you helped us with before was Medicare and non-Medicare within oncology. And you have given us that here but could you talk about &#x2013; I think you flagged up that the potential downside from the NCD being literally interpreted was 70% on the Medicare side. And the question was what was going to happen on the non-Medicare side? Could you talk about now you have seen the stabilization, where you've come to on those two sides of your oncology business, thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give you some data from audit. I can't say this is perfectly projectable to the broader audience but I think it's pretty good otherwise I wouldn't share it. If you take that period of stabilization in the fourth quarter late third quarter '07, early fourth quarter '07 and compare it to the similar period the previous year, the utilization, patient use of ESA is down about 50%. So literally we are talking about half of the patients being treated in that period versus really our peak period in 2006.</p>
          <p>And Geoff that's probably a bigger decrease in the Medicare segment and a lesser decrease in the commercial payer segment, but as we've said previously even though commercial payers have not adopted the NCD provisions, many doctors are treating their patients one approach and so they're not differentiating between Medicare and commercial payers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I'm assuming your guidance contemplates a range of scenarios at the ODAC panel and back in May the uncertainties that were left were indication-specific restrictions and what to do in the range of 10 to 12. So I guess the question is on low end of your guidance, what scenario are you assuming coming out of ODAC?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is certainly an understandable question. We're &#x2013; just a comment on ODAC, we're not trying to handicap in this guidance or on this call what might happen there. We're preparing cooperatively with the FDA and we look forward to really full and complete discussion of the issues. So I'd rather just not comment on conditioning what may or may not happen at ODAC and relate that to our guidance. I know that's not completely satisfactory, but I think for right now it's the right thing to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Just maybe I guess I'll ask the D-mab [denosumab] question, when you look at the secondary endpoints in that chart Roger, meaning other skeletal points on BMD [Bone Mineral Density], you said they were met, but were they met on non-inferiority or were you superior at all the other skeletal sites on BMD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark, the study was designed &#x2013; our view of the study when we put it together was denosumab ought to be superior at cortical sites and it ought to be at least non-inferior at trabecular bone because that's the information that came from our preclinical studies. So the specific statistical analysis plan said test for non-inferiority first then superiority at the cortical sites, which include total hip, trochanter, and distal radius. We were superior at all of those sites and the margins of superiority are about what I described. But in addition, we were better at all the other sites. There is no formal statistical analysis. It wasn't part of our statistical analysis plan. But you can say looking at the data, if you simply look at it and test it that we are superior at all skeletal sites.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="15" type="a">

          <p>And although the patient number is good-sized, particularly for a safety analysis with 1,189 total patients enrolled, in order to see a fracture difference comparing an active agent, alendronate with what we believe is another active agent denosumab, we would need to have many thousands of patients studied for years, so it's not surprising we didn't see a difference.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Kevin. I was struck by your comment that you have too many products; I should say pipeline candidates, versus what you think you can develop. I think one of the things investors have been struggling with is the extreme concentration of your business. So how are you thinking about what assets to develop and what to out license? And if you are out licensing, what is your plan to diversify this business over the next three to four years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand the question. We take a look at the pipeline as it develops. If you guardrailed it and said what if all of the molecules that are going into Phase II need to go into Phase III and the demands of those molecules in terms of Phase III trials were beyond economically what looked like made the most sense for the company. We'd try to look at them in terms of what's the most attractive for us which could involve factors of how big in revenue could the products be? How might they fit with our franchises? Would we develop them for one part of the world, somebody else for another? So there would be a variety of criteria. Now, I think the diversification of the business, if you will, is going to happen as the pipeline develops. Three to five years is a little bit short in a 10 to 20 year product cycle. So let me extend beyond that a little bit.</p>
          <p>We've got probably two kinds of diversification challenges. One is US versus international. We are highly concentrated in the US. Given our history it'd be nice to be a bit more international than we are right now. I think that will happen. And then number two, we'd like to have more products in more therapeutic areas and if the pipeline develops as I hope it does, we will end up being a major player in the bone area, we have metabolic disease assets, we have one in -- one or two in asthma, more in inflammation.</p>
          <p>So, as we look at our long-range plan and project out 10 years or so, we see quite a bit more diversified company, both in therapeutic areas and geography. But I think all of us, that's everybody on this call who has been around a while, trying to predict exactly what the pipeline is going to do is a bit challenging. But we're certainly aware of the issue, but I don't think the company is so concentrated right now that it's imperative that we do some M&amp;A move to change that profile. I'm actually all things considered so far so good, but obviously we all hope for diversification in a positive way going forward. That was a long answer, I know, but it was an important strategic question, it was pretty complicated.</p>

We plan to go out here after this call and see a lot more people, but the messages basically were, "Hey look, Kevin, when you guys are running the company, make sure that you don't try to deliver for the short-term and damage the long-term. Keep investing in research and development." I've got to tell you we're very, very confident that we have enough resource and access to enough resource to move this pipeline ahead. I don't want anybody to interpret the comment about too many assets, as one of lack of commitment to high R&amp;D spending. Quite the reverse, we're going to spend in R&amp;D as I've said in the 20-ish percent of sales and that's not a hard number, but is it 20? Is it 21? Is it 22? That's a heck of a lot of money. But I think we are going to have assets beyond that to develop and that's a great spot to be. Research has been enormously productive for us and I'm really excited about the potential.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was just wondering based on the increase in bone mineral density that you have seen, can you use some type of mathematical model to predict what you think you might see in terms of fractures, fracture rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, unfortunately, Richard, bone mineral density is not a perfect surrogate at all; it's a very imperfect surrogate for those things that ultimately contribute to fracture risk. There are a lot of parameters that are involved in fracture risk and even when you are looking at it comparing multiple bisphosphonates, it's not so straightforward. In this case we've got a novel mechanism of action, that is we're employing the mechanism that is ordinarily used by the body to control bone resorption, we're blocking RANK Ligand. We increased bone mineral density, we can show pre-clinically that we increase bone strength. We're very optimistic about how that will read out in terms of fracture risk. But there is no nomogram that permits us to say "For 'x' increase in bone mineral density we get 'y' improvement in fracture risk." So we're just going to have to wait for the results and be patient.</p>

          <p>Here is the way &#x2013; talk about big shareholders! Here's the way think about it, at least from my point of view, when you look at the safety profile obviously we were all quite keen to look at that and we are very, very pleased with how that looks, very pleased. If you look at the bone mineral density and you said, "Hey, is it the same, less, or better?" those being the three outcomes, we sure as heck got the best possible outcome in 'better' and Roger talked about the numbers. All that said, it's one of those: so far, so good, stay tuned. But I have to say this trial result is one that reinforces our optimism and hope for the product longer-term.</p>

          <p>Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of George Farmer with Wachovia Capital Markets. Go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Roger, you talked about things to be discussed with FDA regarding ESA safety issues, is it just a matter of setting up risk management program or are new trials in fact required and if so when do you think you will begin those studies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>George, we have said before that we have already committed to a more robust pharmacovigilance program to do additional studies to explore the question of ESA safety. I mean the fundamental issue here is that the weight of evidence, when you look at the totality of all the studies, suggests that ESAs do not pose additional risk in terms of the tumor progression or safety, if you, for example, perform meta analysis as we have done or Cochran has done or other people have done. On the other hand, there are individual studies, which show safety signals in a number of different settings. And it is possible that those individual studies are telling us something quite important about particular tumor types or particular patients. So to exclude the possibility that there is a risk in terms of tumor progression or early death as a result of ESA use to treat chemotherapy induced anemia you really have to do large studies in homogeneous tumor types and we have been working with the FDA to design those studies with an eye towards making sure that they are practical, that you can actually enroll the studies, that we all agree that they will answer the question and give us the right kind of results. Once we settle on those we're keen to get those studies started. We are looking forward to the advice that we will get from the ODAC panel because we will be talking about those studies with the ODAC group and FDA, we and the FDA together will talk about those studies when we go to ODAC in March.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you for taking the question. Just a pipeline question. I'm kind of curious, there was no mention of the Ilypsa phosphate binder, I guess you are calling it now AMG 223. Could give you us maybe a little update as to where that molecule stands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chris, we are going to talk about the totality of the Phase II and Phase II going to Phase III pipeline when we have our review in June, the Ilypsa molecule is going forward. It has the characteristics that we described earlier as a phosphate binder and we are getting ready to embark on the additional studies necessary to drive registration. So we will give you a full update on that one and also on the Alantos acquisition, our partnership with Servier in the DPPIV inhibitor when we speak in June.</p>
