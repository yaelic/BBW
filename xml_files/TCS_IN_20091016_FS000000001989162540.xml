          <p>Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance followed by a Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Anything said on this call, which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation emailed to you earlier this evening and also available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chandra to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. I'll take a few minutes to make some key highlights of the quarter two results and the trends we are seeing before turning over to Maha.</p>
          <p>Overall, it has been a spectacular quarter from a TCS point of view. Across the board, we have seen excellent performance, whether it is revenue or the operating level or the net level. We have achieved a growth of about 3.2%, but the highlight is the volume growth of 5% and the international revenue growth of 5.3%. Our India business dropped on a sequential basis by 18% because the India business has been volatile and in rupee term &#x2013; and in dollar term, it's about 3.9%.</p>
          <p>From an execution point of view, we continued our journey towards offshore movement and we improved the offshore revenue by 70 basis points this quarter. The utilization went up by 230 basis points including trainees and you also see that in the reduction in the SG&amp;A expenditure.</p>
          <p>The deal wheels have been healthy. We closed 10 large deals during the quarter and added 30 new clients. The deals have come from U.S., UK, Europe, and India markets and across industries. We closed two deals each in retail, utilities, manufacturing and government and one each in insurance and pharma sectors.</p>
          <p>From an industry point of view, financial services registered excellent growth, not only from the services business and also from our product business. Our financial services products, apart from showing a good growth this quarter also registered 11 important wins. The financial services industry or BFSI &#x2013; BFS went to 45% of our revenues from 43.9% of our revenues. That's a 110 basis point improvement.</p>
          <p>The other two sectors, which also increased their share is the utilities and the pharma sectors. We continue to see stress in manufacturing, telecom, and hi-tech sectors. We believe that the worst is behind us in these sectors, although we don't see significant uptake in the near-term quarters.</p>
          <p>From a geography perspective, U.S. continues to do very well and the market share of U.S. went from 52.3% to 53.4%. That's again 110 basis points. And we did really well in emerging markets in Asia Pacific and Ibero America markets.</p>
          <p>And we believe that the UK market, which has a huge exposure to our largest telecom client will also begin to show improvement in the coming quarters, partly because the hit that we have been having in the largest telecom account has more or less bottomed out and also we have registered some very good wins in the UK market this quarter and also the ramp-ups are beginning to happen.</p>
          <p>From a services point of view, we did very well in the ADM and Assurance Services in particular and our infrastructure revenue showed declines this quarter, partly because the infrastructure business also has a significant India component and India component showed a decline.</p>
          <p>So overall, I think it has been a good quarter, satisfying quarter. And going forward, we believe that the signs of recovery is definitely showing. At the same time, the recovery is going to be slow from our point of view.</p>
          <p>Those are my comments and I'll be happy to take questions later on after Maha gives his speech.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. I'm not going to give a long speech today mainly because I think the figures speak for themselves. And let me just give you the breakdown in terms of revenue. We have had a volume increase of 4.97%.</p>
          <p>We've had a negative 1.39% on pricing. Exchange contributed positively to revenue of 0.93% and asset mix, we moved things offshore and that contributed to a decline of 1.35% in revenue; on overall terms, this was 3.16% positive.</p>
          <p>In USD terms, cross currency impact was plus 1.62% giving the USD topline Q-on-Q growth of 3.87%. Well, of course what we call pricing is actually realization of the Q-on-Q decline, I mentioned this partly, we have continuing flow through effect of price negotiation from the last fiscal and partly or accountably Q-on-Q changes in service line and geography mix.</p>
          <p>Now moving down to the P&amp;L and looking at the margin, we have delivered an operating margin of 26.27%, which is an expansion of 1.44% on Q-on-Q basis. Thus, the breakup is, currency has contributed 20 basis points positive, offshore shift has contributed 15 basis points positive, impact of promotions and the variable payout, additional variable payout has contributed a negative 94 basis point and the SG&amp;A efficiencies have contributed to 121 basis points positive and the productivity improvement coming as a result of utilization improvement et cetera is contributing to positive 81 basis points.</p>
          <p>And that's how we have arrived at this additional 144 basis point improvement in margin. And so, we've had a extremely good quarter and we are quite satisfied with what is &#x2013; what we have achieved. It certainly has proved that our business model, the investments that we have made in the previous years and so on are continuing to pay at a higher rate.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll now turn it over.</p>
          <p>One more issue that I want to talk about is on the variable pay. We have announced that we have given additional pay to people and thus total amount is of the order of 500 million rupees and variable &#x2013; as far as TCS is concerned, we give variable pay based on the performance of the company and of course, of also the business units in the company and this goes in line with the performance and therefore it is truly variable. And in this quarter based on the assessment of the profit &#x2013; additional profit that we have made as also the improvement in margin, there has been an additional amount that has been paid and even after factoring in those additional amount we have had a margin improvement of 144 basis point.</p>
          <p>With that, now I'll hand it over for question and answer.</p>

          <p>Rochelle, you can now open the lines for Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. I just &#x2013; really two questions here, first, just on the present state of the demand environment, it looks like your volumes were pretty strong. I was wondering are you seeing discretionary spending come back and do you expect this volume trend to continue and is it stronger than you thought it was going to be or is it in line with what you are expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, discretionary spend is still being very tight. There are few sectors in which we are seeing the discretionary spend, definitely the BFSI segment primarily because of the M&amp;A, then the retail and the utilities and pharma segments. These segments we are seeing discretionary projects. Whereas the three top verticals of manufacturing and hi-tech and telecom are under absolutely a lot of stress in terms of discretionary spend.</p>
          <p>So in terms of volume for the future, I think, it's difficult to say at this point whether we'll be able to get the same level of volumes. I don't want to say we will be cautious, but I do want to say that the recovery is going to be slow. So we shouldn't expect continued increase of volumes. We can't take it for granted. I think we got to watch it carefully still because I would like to see some volume uptake in the other three sectors as well. That's the comment I'd like to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just, secondly here, it sounds like you guys are hiring again and it sounds like you're putting through some wage increases, which are signs of some bullishness coming forward. Any thoughts on just sort of the improvement and what you're kind of expecting from the environment over the next six months and headed into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two points really. On the recruitment side, yes, we made 24,000 offers last year and we said we are going to hire them this fiscal year. And we have taken close to some 16, 1,700 &#x2013; 1,800 people so far. So we're going to take on about 8,000 odd people in Q3 and the following quarter, we will take the rest. So that is the story on recruitment. I think we have been able to improve the utilization very well. Including trainees, the utilization has jumped 230 basis points during Q2. That's kind of a good trend and therefore, I think, the taking on the people is the right thing to do at this juncture.</p>
          <p>Going forward, all I can say is that we're seeing signs of recovery, stability, from our point of view definitely. And there will be growth, but at this point in time, I just want to say that the recovery is going to be slow because there are still sectors, which are not showing signs of a good growth that we would like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So will the recovery build on top of sort of a base revenue that you've kind of already hit over the last couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You expect that to be sort of incremental?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Moshe Katri of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Two questions, Chandra, kind of as a follow-up to your comment that the recovery is going to be slow and obviously we know that you guys don't give forward guidance. But going forward in terms of the progression on a quarterly basis, should we expect the typical seasonality during the quarters, a weaker December, a weaker March, and then maybe an uptake after that? Is that going to be kind of the trend in your view?</p>
          <p>And then maybe you can comment about the whole budgeting process that your clients are going through looking into 2010. What are your views on that? And then I'll go to the next question after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as how the budgets are concerned, the clients are going through the budgeting cycle now. So it's very difficult to comment on the budgets. But based on the conversations I have had with a large number of clients and one-on-ones that many say I was, my comment is going to be that the spend is going to be very monitored carefully. And there will be discretionary projects that will be kicked off in certain sectors but the spend will be very carefully controlled. That means that there'll be no automatic clearance of big budget projects and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>But having said that, I think November will be a good month for us to get a very good sense of the budget. And the seasonality is not something that I would say because the discretionary budgets are going to be released carefully. So I don't think there's going to be a sudden blip in discretionary spend or anything like that. So I would not say so much on the seasonality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. And then second -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll be a gradual ramp up, I think. It'll be a gradual ramp up. Frankly speaking, I think we have had two good quarters. I think in both quarters, I think, our volume growth has been a surprise for the market and we have come out well. So I just hope that the recovery continues in the three sectors that I mentioned. And all the other sectors as I said we are seeing positive signs. So we are able to grow from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second question is focused on margins. One of the biggest concerns that investors have had throughout the years has been related to EBIT margins for the industry. And here you are kind of exiting this downturn with record or peak EBIT margins. Can you kind of comment on that trend, that's number one. And number two: talk about EBIT margins vis-&#xE0;-vis some of the recent appreciation of the rupee versus some of the other currencies? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, margin, if you really see the last two or three quarters, the improvement we are seeing, it is all due to very structured programs. None of these is one-off. So I think the way that we have been going about margin improvement is to do it in a very sustainable fashion. Having said that, currency is a big factor and I'm going to let Maha give his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You know, Moshe, this &#x2013; the first one even on margin perspective, I think what certainly is paying off is that we had already made a lot of investments in terms of the sales offices, emerging countries and all those kinds of things. And therefore it is really leveraging at this moment in time, whatever investment that we have made.</p>
          <p>The second &#x2013; as far as exchange is concerned, obviously, if it falls quite a bit, then we have an issue. Obviously, it'll have an impact of margins. If I take the last quarter, it has been pretty much stable from an exchange perspective. As far as dollar is concerned, rupee appreciated marginally. It appreciated by about 20 paise, 0.20 rupee and &#x2013; but then, we gained a lot due to cross currency movement, pound and euro and so on.</p>
          <p>And as it looks like as far as this quarter is concerned, we are not going to get the benefit of cross currency. And we have to carefully watch the situation, but the rupee might not be depreciating further than what it is at this moment in time.</p>
          <p>So this is definitely a challenge and any big reduction in that will have an impact as far as margins are concerned, although we will try and control that. But certainly it is &#x2013; and I don't want to give any forecast on it basically because we don't know where the rupee is going to be settling at different points of time in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, nice quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Vihang Nayak of Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congratulations on great number. Just wanted to know that you have seen &#x2013; you've shown top client growth of almost 25% for the last two quarters. What kind of view, I mean, are the ramp ups almost happened or are we seeing such growth in the future also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the top client have changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that also you should know. And the top client is growing. That's a good news. And whether the rate of growth will be at this rate, I can't say, probably not. But I think the top &#x2013; actually the top five &#x2013; top one, top five, top 10 clients have been doing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And in terms of BP, you have said that it has almost bottomed out in this quarter. So is that true for in general for the other service provider also and in the telecom segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From our point of view, that is true for most of the service providers. So I think that the telecom, we've been having negative growth for the last few quarters. Our belief is that it has bottomed out. Even if we don't see significant growth from here, probably the chances are that it will not de-grow from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And just lastly, you said you are hiring &#x2013; you will be having a gross hiring of around 8,000 employees in 3Q. So that means that you'll be adding almost 12,500 employees in the last quarter. So you are planning to add all the employees in this particular year itself right? I mean, all the 24,000 you're ready to offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ajoy, you want to --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yes. What we are saying is that we will be taking 8,000 of the freshers for whom offers were given earlier. They will be joining in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing the joining ratio and as far as this particular quarter was concerned and we are monitoring that pretty closely. And based on that, we think we will be able to take most of the other people who are left, in the remaining quarter that is the Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That should be 12,500, it may be less. That's what, Ajoy is saying.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. My question relates to what are the current hedge levels we have and what are the products loss we had this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the current hedge levels are concerned, what is very critical is that as far as our receivables are concerned, we are fully hedged by receivables currency fully hedged. As far as the revenue is concerned, we are hedged to the tune of about $200 million this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of the overall discretionary spend especially relating to new project implementation systems integrations of large ERP deals that has been quite a bit of slowdown in sale of SAP license or other thing. Do you see that environment changing or are you still with some other couple of quarters down the line as when we can take a good call whether you're seeing bounce back in enterprise application spend and related strengths.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have to wait for some more time for those type of deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So any thoughts on new COO that we could be appointing soon?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see the &#x2013; organizationally, I think last year, we went through a major restructuring and we have multiple business units, each pretty much being run as independent business units. So we may do some structural changes, but a full level consolidation is not likely, but whatever we do we'll keep you informed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Ramachandra. Our next question is from the line of Ms. Diviya Nagarajan of UBS Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congrats on a good quarter. Chandra, you spoke about your problem sector is manufacturing, hi-tech, and telecom kind of bottoming out this quarter. What gives you this confidence and could you also give us a trend of what kind of spending is happening ex your top telecom client in these sectors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Diviya, I think I have always maintained that any of these things have to be looked from the client's specific perspective. If you take TCS, for us, whatever assessment that we do is based on our exposure for the various clients in the particular sector. And we are in dialog with these clients, we track every project, we track the pipeline, we know what we are winning, what we are loosing, and what kind of cancellations are likely etcetera for all the clients that we do very, very carefully.</p>
          <p>So anything that I say must be seen in the context of the client specific information we have. So I cannot make a broad-brush statement about a particular sector whether it is going to recover not only from the IT spending point of view, from an economic point of view. It's very difficult for me to say. Different people have different views on UUs and UUUs and all kinds of formats. But from our point of view, I think based on the client specific information we have, we think that we are bottoming out in this client, but although they are bottoming out, significant growth is not likely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. And coming back to Maha, the kind of salary hikes that you gave this quarter, I believe you gave about 150% on your variable. Do you think that this is a kind of an indication to the kind of hikes you expect to see in the system, given the strong growth momentum that you've seen so far and that you're expecting some kind of recovery in your largest vertical BFSI there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have always maintained that the focus on variable component of the salary, and obviously as far as the fixed pay is concerned, it'll be based on the inflation and cost of living index and so on and that as we perform better, we certainly will have higher variable pay.</p>
          <p>If you look at this quarter, it has been an extremely satisfying quarter. Obviously, we have posted exceedingly good results on the operating profit, on the net profits, and so on. And therefore, the contributions of the employees will be recognized through this variable pay addition and so on. So certainly, if we continue to perform very well, obviously, we &#x2013; that's where we bring in the variability in line with the variability in performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And lastly your product segment has also done well this quarter. Can you give us some sense of which geographies the product segment has done well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the deals &#x2013; the 11 deals have come across markets actually, few deals in the U.S., few deals in Middle East, few deals in Asia, and one or two deals in the European market as well. So it's been broad based actually, different products have introduced this product.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Nagarajan. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Nitin Padmanabhan of Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. I had a question on the margins. If you look at the rentals as that the rental numbers both on the SG&amp;A and cost of revenues, they've come down by around 23% on a Q-O-Q basis. So if you could just shed some light as to what's happening there? Another thing is on the employee costs under SG&amp;A. I think we've seen a 3% decline. So what is it there? Have we reduced the head count on support or sales or what is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as rent is concerned, it is the matter of absolute optimization of spaces and so on. So obviously when you are in this kind of a market, when you are looking at each cost item and so on, we essentially make sure that we optimize and also you would see that we are also bringing new infrastructure and you would have seen a jump as far as the depreciation is concerned. So these are the two &#x2013; these are the kinds of factors. So while I don't think we'll continue to show that rent improvement and so on, but there is certainly a thing as far as rationalization is concerned. What is the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was on the absolute employee cost for SG&amp;A, has it actually come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, employee cost &#x2013; as you know in SG&amp;A, we put the bench cost, and we've had 230% &#x2013; 230 basis point improvement in utilization and therefore SG&amp;A has <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, all right, correct. Another thing was with the respect to BFSI, you said, some amount of discretionary spends are coming back. So I just &#x2013; if you could just throw some light on that and as to in terms of M&amp;As and system integration projects, so many projects are underway and is that what is likely to turn revenues there for sometime or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are right. That's where you have to be careful as well, because the BFSI segment is growing up a number of opportunities related to M&amp;A and integration and also some amount of rationalization work, both in the application space and the infrastructure space. And also the BPO is beginning to kick in in the BFSI space. So all these three things are happening. But from a discretionary spend point of view, it's predominantly M&amp;A and integration that's kicking in.</p>
          <p>So we just have to be careful at what the sustainability of those kind of projects are from a long-term point of view, but for the immediate quarters definitely that's going to be throwing up opportunities for growth and volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And Diligenta platform is likely to come out next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Diligenta platform is going well. In fact, we went live for the next release earlier this month. We delivered that. I think the full platform will go live next quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congrats on another terrific performance. Sir, just looking at the volume growth, even in the first quarter, it was 3.5 higher than the peers. This quarter also 5% higher than the peers. So what percentage of the volume can say is related to the one-time or pent-up demand versus how fresh projects, which is coming into play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandeep, I don't think any of them are pent-up demand. I think they are all fresh demands that are coming up. So either it is due to new outsourcing initiatives or reducing clients doing more work. And I wouldn't call any of them to be pent-up or anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just Maha, if we take out the currency issue both in terms of rupee versus dollar or cross currency, do you believe such kind of margins are sustainable with more campus recruitments happening in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, margin depends on both revenue and costs. And given the current environment that we are in and &#x2013; I don't know how to put this cautiously optimistic kind of framework. I think if you separate out the exchanges <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to update, I heard that the 10 large deals what we have won &#x2013; we have not won any in BFSI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These deals &#x2013; you see, yeah, these are fresh deals, yeah, none of them of the BFSI is as part of this. BFSI growth &#x2013; we have, yeah, we have declared one large win in insurance, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Kunal here. Could you help us then &#x2013; to understand the nature of your deals, what kind of projects are involved there? You did mention that couple of deals in retail, utilities, manufacturing, and government. That's one and then I'll ask the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the sector as I said is two deals each in retail, manufacturing, utilities, and government, one each in insurance and pharma. The type of deals are ranging from couple of deals in the transformation area, in the utilities and the retail sectors. And there are a few deals, which are full services, where we are getting not only IT, plus BPO also. And the remaining ones are outsourcing deals, ADM, and managed services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. Can you throw some light on the auto sector? What kind of &#x2013; are you seeing still subdued project or spending from the auto sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The auto sector has been growing negatively for us until last quarter. This quarter I think we had a marginal dip, but this quarter also we had a marginal dip in the auto sector. Auto sector recovery is going to be slow, but we are seeing some opportunities, but recovery is going to be slow.</p>

          <p>Hi, sir. Congratulations for the good numbers. Just wanted your comments on a couple of things. First of all, how are you faring versus the competition, especially in Europe? And secondly, just wanted to check with you what kind of &#x2013; how much more juice do we have in terms of improving our margins? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the first question, how are we doing in Europe, I think Europe is doing well. As I said, we were affected by one large telco customer. And then as far as this quarter is concerned, we closed five deals in the UK, Europe market including one very large deal.</p>
          <p>So Europe is doing well, and I think we'll continue to see growth in Europe in the coming quarters. In terms of margin, I think Maha explained it clearly. Our intent is to maintain the margins, but currency can have a serious impact depending upon how volatile it becomes either way. So that's the only comment we'll make. And I'm not going to say that there's any juice to improve the margin from here. I think, we'll be happy to maintain the margins that we have.</p>

          <p>Hello and good evening. Just one question. On your Asia-Pac growth, could you just tell us where you're seeing the growth as in which country and what kind of verticals are you seeing this growth happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, Asia Pacific, basically to increase its share from 4.3% to 5.3%. And it is primarily also &#x2013; significant portion of it is also due to the wins we have seen in the financial services products. We've been able to get some wins on growth on the financial services products business in the Asia. So that's also contributed to growth, but in terms of the overall market percent, I think Australia and several of the Asian countries and also a little bit of China, these are the markets. But in each of these countries, our presence is not very high. So given that we have to be careful in projecting anything based on that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, sir. I just have one quick clarification. Your offshore percentage of revenues is up close to 70 basis points, but the impact on the topline is 1.35%. So I just want to understand why is the impact &#x2013; why is this inflationary impact on the topline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. You see actually what happens offshore is that it reduces the revenue. So 70 basis point as we see, that's the shift that you have as a percentage, but the actual revenue impact if we had not had this our offshore movement, we had continued in the same percentage as on-site, we would obviously have not had the decline of 1.35.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1.35% is effort based, whereas the 70 basis points is revenue based, so we're not comparing apples-on-apples.</p>

          <p>Congratulations on a good set of numbers. I had one question in terms of the M&amp;A opportunities in BFSI, over what period do you see these opportunities play out in terms of our implementation related work? And post that we would be required to drive incremental revenues from other sources.</p>
          <p>And second in terms of the wage inflation, given that we've given out promotion and variable wage hike, is there a possibility that our wage inflation next year could be higher than industry given that the fixed salaries haven't been increased?</p>

          <p>So I wouldn't say that it is a cycle where it'll just start and then stop. But what is the trajectory it will follow will vary from client to client. But these are opportunities in which you either pick a new client or you pick a additional business area in the client and from which you build on. So that's the way I would look at it. I will not look at it as things that start and stop.</p>
          <p>Then with regard to the wage increase, basically we'll take a call at end of the next quarter. But I think Maha clearly explained that we have a performance-based model, where we will definitely reward the employees based on the margin performance in a quarter. That will be variable pay, but definitely there is likely to be a wage shift next year, but we will definitely take a call end of next quarter, November-December, we will take a call.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then, I don't remember if you, during the call you kind of went through the details of some of the things you're seeing within the BFSI sector, the banking, the financial services and insurance in terms of the demand and the various factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I thought I did based on some question, yeah. Pardon.</p>

          <p>Is there a question from you or -?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what is the question? Can you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you kind of talk about some of the trends you're seeing within BFSI, can break it down by the three sub segments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. See, the demand is &#x2013; as I said, is happening primarily due to M&amp;A and integration work in the BFSI. And second type of demand that's happening is due to also customers wanting to optimize the cost base.</p>
          <p>The new customers or customers, who had less leverage for the global sourcing model are definitely leveraging the model to do a cost base restructuring; that is happening. The third is that some of our clients in the insurance space had really from our point of view had a strong impact, strong negative impact three, four quarters back and bottomed out one or two quarters back. And now they are beginning to spend. That's happening in with some of our customers.</p>
          <p>And it's very difficult to split between banking, capital markets and insurance. If I have to say the cost base restructuring and the customers following the recovery process is more happening in the insurance space and we are seeing lots of M&amp;A and integration work in the banking and the capital market space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just moving on quickly to pipeline. Can you talk a bit about maybe sales cycles, the deal sizes that you are seeing, maybe your ability to convert bookings into revenues, and we've had Accenture and IBM kind of talking, kind of hinting that maybe they're seeing &#x2013; they're still seeing some deal slippage in terms of large deals that, maybe you can comment on that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The deals are very large in size, it takes longer. It takes longer in this environment definitely and &#x2013; but otherwise, in sectors like retail, utilities, pharma, et cetera, we are seeing closures. We're seeing big closures as per schedule, but manufacturing, definitely there are dealers, manufacturing gives up taking much longer. And any large-scale transformation projects, two of which we closed this quarter, those kind of deals are longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Katri. Our next question is from the line of Pranav Bharadwaj of Madhav Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good evening, sir. Congrats on a very good quarter. I have a couple of questions. First of all, there's something related to the Indian operations. As we are seeing some more and more government projects and like that, so are we hoping to improve our domestic operations in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See from the Indian operation point of view, one of the things that we've always articulated is that the business mix that we have is both discretionary and annuity, but the discretionary portion is very high.</p>
          <p>Also because of that, it's quite difficult for us to control the volatility of the business in the Indian market. So I think that's going to continue for some time till we build up the strong annuity based clients. But I think we are winning quite a number of projects. In fact, we announced couple of deals as part of this quarter results. And then we have won a few more deals also since then. So I think the &#x2013; definitely we are increasing our deal wins in India, penetration in India, but still the main thing that we need to address is the volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. And just a quick question in the tax rates, as in &#x2013; if I remember correctly, in the last earnings call, you had guided, you had said something about 17% for the year. But it's been a little different this time. So what is the cause of this distance, and what can we assume for the whole year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I had said, even at that time, that these are some what difficult to calculate mainly because it really depends on &#x2013; it depends not only on the SEZ and <mark type="inaudible" /> and SEZ and so on but also in double taxation benefits and so on.</p>
          <p>As far as &#x2013; as it looks like at this moment in time, most of our projects are either in cities, which are continuing or in SEZ and that is the reason why we have had those benefits continuing as far as our tax rate is concerned. As of now, we think that it is not going to materially change as far as this year is concerned, we are still in the process of working out in detail depending on the projects are priced and so on, but once the direct tax code is implemented, obviously there is going to be a very, very different kind of situation but that happens from April 2011.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just wanted to get an update on how is your ECS &#x2013; TCS e-Serve integration going on? Have you been able to add new clients on e-Serve's platform? Just wanted to get an update on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>TCS e-Serve is doing extremely well. The integration is very solid, very strong. And they are very co-operating &#x2013; is fully connected with the sales team of the TCS network and we are bringing these. They acquired new clients and those new clients have also started delivering growth. So from a e-Serve point of view both from revenue point of view and also from the margin point of view, they are doing very well. We are very, very pleased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just wanted to have your comments on the Latin America Ibero market. Is it also pretty similar in terms of our business mix to India that it tends to be slightly more lumpy, because it has more project based business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there, I think we are beginning to get a good portion of the annuity business in the Latin American model. Latin America, I think we have started to get a good number of annuity contracts. In fact, business mix is getting better than India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure. Thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Ramachandra. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constrains that was the last question. I would now like to hand the conference over to, Mr. Kedar Shirali for closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rochelle. I'll request Chandra to make a few closing remarks for the evening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for making the time on Friday and being in this analyst call. In summary, I think we've had a very satisfying quarter. We are very, very pleased both at the revenue line and the gross margin and operating margin and the net income lines.</p>
          <p>And going forward, as I said from sectors point of view, BFSI is definitely showing signs of growth. And utilities, pharma, and retail sectors are also having a number of opportunities. Manufacturing, hi-tech, and telecom are still to show signs of growth, but more or less are bottoming out.</p>
          <p>Then from the margin point of view, our intent is to continue to maintain margins, but currency maybe a major factor. So we have to watch out for the currency. From an employee point of view, we've added a net addition of 320 associates this quarter. We'll be bringing in 8,000 fresh graduates plus some amount of experienced professionals as well in the Q3 sector.</p>
          <p>And we will get more visibility to the client projects &#x2013; client budgets for the next fiscal year in the November December timeframe. We still want to be careful, because we believe that the discretionary spend is still very, very tightly controlled, and is open only in some sectors. So the recovery and the rate of growth is going to be slow. Those are the thoughts that I would like to leave you with. And I take the opportunity to wish you all a very happy Diwali and festival season. Thank you very much.</p>
