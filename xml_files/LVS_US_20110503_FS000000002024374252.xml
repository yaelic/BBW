          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Marvin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>I will now hand the call over to our host, Mr. Daniel Briggs. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted property EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded.</p>
          <p>With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. On behalf of our management team here with me today, I would like to thank all of you for joining us. As you can see from our press release, the company had another record quarter, producing $746 million in EBITDA and a record $2.11 billion in revenue. We played a little unlucky during the quarter and on a normalized basis, we would have been just over $785 million, a sold run rate of more than $3.1 billion of EBITDA per year, which I believe will be a record for any similar company in history.</p>
          <p>These results amount to the seventh consecutive time the company has increased its quarterly adjusted property EBITDA over the previous quarter. This trend started at the end of the second quarter of 2009, and since that time we've more than tripled our quarterly EBITDA results, from $247 million in quarter two of 2009 to the $746 million we reported today.</p>
          <p>I believe that upward trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Why do I feel that way? Let me explain by starting in Macau, where the properties operated by our majority owned subsidiary, Sands China Ltd., are continuing to enjoy market leading EBITDA generation. The Venetian Macao increased its EBITDA by $58.5 million over the same quarter a year ago to reach $228 million, and a record 35.8% EBITDA margin. Non-Rolling Chip drop, which is the mass market tables, Rolling Volume, that's the VIP business, and Slot Handle all increased over the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted property EBITDA at the Sands Macao was $92.6 million, an increase of nearly 33% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Like The Venetian Macao, Non-Rolling Chip drop, Rolling Volume and Slot Handle at the Sands all increased significantly over the same quarter a year ago. The Plaza Casino at the Four Seasons Hotel, with increases in Rolling Volume and Slot Handle, also had its best quarter ever, generating $57.5 million in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Our Rolling program in Macau showed a continued increase with contributions coming from existing junket business and recently added junkets. We recognize we have the ability to increase our presence in the junket segment, and that will be an area of continued focus moving forward. Our team is working with our existing group of junket operators as well as new junkets in an effort to maximize our position in this segment.</p>
          <p>We're also working to adapt our diverse physical product to better suit their needs in creating a differentiated service environment for their customers. With continued initiative designed to enhance human capital, customer service, and our physical presence, we are well-positioned to continue growth in the VIP segment.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with our quarter in Macau and not content to simply leave the car in cruise control. We have the largest footprint in the largest gaming market in the world, and we are eager to take advantage of the significant organic growth opportunities in front of us. And I have no doubt that we will achieve even greater success in the months and years to come.</p>
          <p>In addition to our organic growth opportunities in Macau, we're also looking forward to the opening of sites 5 and 6 on the COTAI Strip. Although we have made significant progress on parcels 5 and 6, our anticipated opening of Phase I could slip to the first quarter of 2012 if we do not secure increases in our present construction labor force. As the bulk of the 13.7 million square foot property, the world's largest building constructed at one time, opens over the course of next year, it will profoundly enhance our presence in Macau. We will nearly triple our hotel room inventory with the addition of 6,400 rooms, and thus provide the capability we believe is vitally important to growing our MICE [meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions] business in Macau.</p>
          <p>We will also be adding other important non-gaming amenities which will include more MICE space along with additional retail, entertainment, and dining. The opening of this development will be the last significant opening in Macau for the foreseeable future, and will secure our position as the leading operator in the world's number one gaming market, thereby expanding our footprint in Macau.</p>
          <p>In addition, sites 5 and 6, through thousands of non-gaming jobs, will further help the government in its efforts to diversity Macau's economy. Today we're just committed to helping Macau reach its potential as an international leader and business destination as we were nearly seven years ago when we first touched down in Macau, and no developer has invested more on behalf of that effort.</p>
          <p>So that's Macau. Now let's talk about Singapore. Let me start by saying that the doors to Marina Bay Sands opened one year ago last week and in the 52 weeks since that opening, we have made more than $1 billion in EBITDA, that's U.S. The reason I bring that up is not to remind everyone that I had predicted that we would make $1 billion in our first year, though I do take a little joy in that, I bring it up because it represents just the beginning of what we can achieve in Singapore.</p>
          <p>We made $1 billion at a property which for the first several months was not able to offer its complete set of amenities. In fact, just this past quarter we opened important visitation drivers such as the ArtScience Museum, our light and water show, and Disney's Lion King. My point is that while we reach $1 billion in the first year, we're still miles away from realizing the full potential of our opportunity in Singapore. Our MICE business, while very strong, is still in the early stages compared to where it will ultimately be in the months and years ahead. The same can be said for retail, food and beverage, and the hotel.</p>
          <p>As for our gaming business in Singapore, I recently saw a CNBC story that quoted Royal Bank of Scotland predicting gross gaming revenue in Singapore would rise 25% to $6.4 billion in 2011 and surpass Las Vegas as the world's second biggest gaming market. With only two of us in the market and with our success in the high margin mass business, which is now exceeding $4 million a day in win, we're strongly positioned to benefit from that additional growth.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2011, Marina Bay Sands Non-Rolling table game drop was $986 million. The Slot Handle was $2 billion. Rolling Chip Volume was $10.1 billion for the quarter, as our marketing programs continue to take hold. Additionally, room occupancy was 86.3% with an ADR of US$285. Our combined retail and food and beverage revenue was approximately $100 million during the quarter. As I alluded to earlier, we don't see these parts of our business doing anything but continuing to grow, so to say we have additional opportunities in Singapore would be something of an understatement.</p>
          <p>Here in the U.S., our Las Vegas properties were impacted by about $45 million in revenue on low hold. Food business continues to improve and I am very bullish about our prospects in this segment. Based on our existing bookings, we expect to do more than 700,000 group room nights in 2011, with an expectation of 1 million total group nights in 2012. Our results for the first quarter show that the number of rooms sold to cash paying customers, our average daily rate, and the number of group and convention customers served all increased significantly during the quarter compared to last year. In fact, 97% of our rooms sold in the quarter were cash customers compared to 68% a year ago.</p>
          <p>One final note on Las Vegas, we're pleased to announce that we have brought John Caparella on as the new President at The Venetian Palazzo. John is very engaging and has deep hospitality experience, which includes having served as Chief Operating Officer of Gaylord Hotels. We're glad to have John join us, and we think he'll be a great addition to our Las Vegas operations.</p>
          <p>Turning to our operations in Bethlehem, Sands Bethlehem recorded its best quarter ever, with adjusted property EBITDA of $22.1 million and an EBITDA margin of 24.3%. The hotel at Sands Bethlehem will open by the end of this month, and we now have plans to open the retail component at the property in the fourth quarter of this year. The 300-room hotel will be the largest full service hotel in Lehigh Valley, and when combined with our additional entertainment and dining offerings, provides us an excellent platform for growth at our own East Coast property.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me close by saying that the company's financial position is the best it has ever been, and we're excited by the various options that keep us moving forward. Our substantial cash generating capabilities and strong financial positioning, coupled with favorable capital market conditions, provides us with a number of opportunities to optimize the capital structure of the company and reduce our overall borrowing costs. There will be more to come on this issue in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>So with that, Mike [Leven] is here to discuss any operational questions you may have, Rob [Goldstein] is here for your gaming questions, and Ken [Kay] can further discuss our current financial position. So let's go to Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, my first question is on Singapore. You'll probably get this a lot after the call but I think if you look at Singapore adjusted for that unlucky hold and normalize that, the EBITDA was a little bit less than probably where consensus was. And as I go through the pieces and just kind of normalize the hold on the VIP side, I think what would be helpful to all of us is &#x2013; and maybe, Rob, if you can do this, if you kind of go through what you think the department profit margin is for the various segments, whether it's VIP, mass and slots, room, other?</p>
          <p>Because it looks like expenses overall were much higher than I otherwise would have expected or even looking at where it's been relative to revenue growth. If you can help us sort of understand those items going forward, it'd be helpful. And if you could give us any sort of sense in terms of April trends in Singapore, that would be helpful. And I have one other follow-up after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, we don't really see a change in the margin in the casino side. We've told you all along we think we'll be in the mid 50s%, actually perhaps 57%, 58% in the mass slot and table combined. Hold percent, hold's around 22.5% plus. We see volume growing there nicely. On the VIP Roll side, I think we're still in the low 30s%. Again, the hold percent is what it is, but we don't see the margins changing. We've been consistent in our approach toward the commissions, so I don't see a lot of changes there.</p>
          <p>And I don't think we'll see change in April or May or beyond. If anything, I see increasing margins in mass table and slot as we grow there. I don't see commissions &#x2013; I don't see the margin getting a whole lot better on the Roll as well. It'll still be in the low 30s% because you're still paying out. Most of the business is on the very high end and you're be paying as high as 1:4. So I don't see how we get that much beyond 32%, 33%. But I do see a little bit of appreciation on the &#x2013; as we grow on the slot table mass side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, Sheldon, you said earlier that you've having some early success in Macau with recently added junkets. If you can give us a sense, what percentage of the Roll &#x2013; I don't know if you want to look at all three in the aggregate in Macau in this first quarter, but what percentage of the Roll was junket promoter-related versus the last quarter, that would be helpful, Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Joe, I'll take the question again. I think I can be a little more helpful. I just came back from a week over there. And I guess &#x2013; let's be clear, we think we have vast opportunity in the junket segment, Roll segment in general in Macau. We were pleased with our numbers as Sheldon referenced on the call. We see &#x2013; but we see opportunity and we see vast opportunity to improve our operations as Sheldon referenced with service, with people, with spending more capital on the rooms, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Our Roll will continue to be probably spread 80/20, 85/15 junket versus direct. We've said it before and we'll say again, there's a market for the direct VIP, but the primary market in the Macau has been and continues to be on the junket business because of the obvious reasons that we've talked about in the past. And our goal is not to &#x2013; it won't diminish. There are certain people who prefer to go direct to us. We're finding that a very, very strong business for us in Singapore, but the junket piece is the driver of the Roll portion of our business in Macau, and our goal is to keep driving those segments of the Roll.</p>
          <p>I do think from the junkets that we've suffered some decisions in the past that weren't the best for this company. We're fixing that. We are working very hard to &#x2013; we look at our real estate portfolio. We made the decision in this company to be a big player in Macau. We are the player in Macau. I think our footprint speaks for that. Our goal now is to grow organically, increase this segment dramatically. I mean David Sisk, Ed Tracy, myself, and the team over there are really committed. We just spent a lot of time with all the different people. And I think the truth is we're going to grow the segment but it takes time and effort, and we'll probably see appreciation on the junket as opposed to direct because the direct stays pretty fixed. The junket is where the real growth will reside.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Mark Strawn with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, one question on Singapore and one question on Vegas. On Singapore first, if you look at the pieces of business you can control there, maybe junkets at this point are outside of your control. As you look forward, how do you see the growth trajectory of that property? Is it really on the mass side, and how do you stimulate those volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I'll just speak <mark type="ph" /> to the Singapore piece for a sec. (17:16) I think we &#x2013; you can see the appreciation of those numbers quarter after quarter, it is magnificent to watch. I think the team there is convinced that we're experiencing 20% growth annually. We think we can &#x2013; I think that's achievable. But it's a two horse race. We're privileged to be there. It's a wonderful government, it's a wonderful place to visit.</p>
          <p>I believe our building is iconic and in the right place physically to keep improving. I believe our business is the aspirational place of the two. Honestly, we're getting a lot of new players every day. There's never been in my mind &#x2013; I've never seen a place with this much mass table business consistently and slot business. I mean you see the numbers coming out, you see the growth. If you look at our growth in the last &#x2013; just from the second &#x2013; no, the third quarter, we were doing $80 &#x2013; 92 million. We're now at $96 million. We're going from $196 million to $222 million on bookings, millions obviously.</p>
          <p>The slot route is unbelievable. We go from one, three, five, eight and winning $80 million to two, zero, four, one winning $108 million. Where in the stock? That's the question which we can't answer. All we keep seeing is increased visitation. Weekends are phenomenal. I don't think there's any end right now to our ability to grow in this segment. It is &#x2013; Sheldon referenced $4 plus million a day. Does it get to $5 million? I think it absolutely does. The question is what's the timing? We're in a very...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is how much more does it go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I mean I don't think there's any question, we don't see any slowdown here. We see appreciation quarter &#x2013; I see appreciation quarter after quarter. Andrew McDonald and that team, Mark Juliano's there now, <mark type="ph" /> Jerry Bach, Eric Person (19:03). They've done a terrific job of rethinking that floor all the time. That team is very focused upon driving slot and table mass.</p>
          <p>I think it's going to be the &#x2013; in the world, there may not be another market like it in terms of mass business, with only two players in the market. It's pretty extraordinary. That will be the driver of EBITDA in my opinion. Sheldon and I have discussed this. Sheldon believes and I think he's absolutely right, there'll be terrific growth from the Roll segment, but that will come later as &#x2013; we discussed in past calls our issues there. For today the real driver in my mind is the mass business, and it is nothing short of great.</p>

        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the combination of the mass and the high end but look, people are calling that property the eighth wonder of the world. The non-gaming aspects of it, the rooms, the retail, the entertainment &#x2013; The Lion King we thought was going to be limited but it's turning out to be a winner. We're extending our contract there, and the ArtScience Museum is attracting a lot of people. The comments that we get from all over the world is just that it's an incredible, one of a kind building.</p>
          <p>If you think of Singapore as to what Las Vegas was many, many years ago, but there are only two properties on the entire Strip, you divide all the money that's taken in with all the properties, the 100 plus casinos in Vegas and the 25 or so mega resorts on the Strip, and you divide it up into &#x2013; you reallocate that to only two operators, plus a huge community of very high end players in back of it, you've got a very, very unique opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, that's helpful. And then one quick follow-up on Las Vegas, as you look at that balance between your comp and your cash room mix, it seems like a pretty sizeable impact on the Slot Handle side. Is there &#x2013; did the dial get perhaps turned too far towards the cash side of things, or is that how we should expect that mix to trend going forward as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know. It seems to me that somebody once said if somebody wants to give you some money, don't turn it down. Don't throw it back at him, and don't duck. It only confirms the fact that the decision I made to reduce the amount of comps, which was the dogma in Las Vegas: you have to give comps to get people to play. And our slot income &#x2013; everybody thinks &#x2013; the practice was to think of the gross income that you have, but nobody looked at the net income.</p>
          <p>So when people were giving out both free play and RFB [room, food, beverage] in comps, I mean, it's just &#x2013; it was too costly. So if we move from 68% to 90-some-odd%, I forget exactly the number, on cash, that's a good thing. So we've stopped giving it away and therefore losing money on it and we converted those into cash. That's a very good thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Janet Brashear with Sanford C. Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Macau, could you give us a little update on the progress relative to lots 5 and 6? You said that you wouldn't be able to stay on schedule if you don't get additional labor. I'm wondering in particular if there's any &#x2013; while the government is philosophically supportive of you finishing the project, if there's any impetus from them to help you speed it up or if they'd rather keep the pace of casino development slow and maybe don't &#x2013; aren't as motivated to help you speed it up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that &#x2013; I think the government knows it's in Macau's best interest to complete the project as soon as we can. And I'd like to say the government has been very helpful and very cooperative with us on the issue of labor. They haven't given us any special treatment, but they're cooperating as much as we can expect them to do so. So I know that there'll be some people who say well, you talked about getting it ready by the last quarter of 2011, now you're saying it may be the first quarter.</p>
          <p>But you can't &#x2013; these aren't exact sciences on the estimates of when we're going to get the labor. We're a certain number of days lagging in the schedule, and it is possible that we can make it up, make up a substantial part of it. In any event, I don't see anybody &#x2013; any analyst estimating any contribution to income in either the fourth quarter of '11 or the first quarter of '12. So it really has no financial impact on anybody's projections.</p>

          <p>Janet, this is Mike. We have roughly about 5,500 on the site now. We're running about five weeks behind on the December target. We met there last week. We need to pick up another 1,000 to 1,500 employees in some of the specialty areas like mechanical, electrical, plumbing, et cetera, which is where the problems are. And we're still hopeful we can make that target.</p>
          <p>But the reason we're talking about possible slipping is if we don't get that extra 1,500 or so, we would probably have difficulty &#x2013; we will have difficulty meeting the target. And we're gradually increasing. Last week we got 400 to 500 more and we're hoping as Galaxy opens we'd get some more, particularly in that area from MEP. So that's our count at the moment, and we track that every week. And I'll be there again May 18th and take another look at exactly where we are at that time.</p>

We're talking now to two international brands about licensing that product and running it ourselves. We have proposals in that we are going through and final discussions are being held with two major international companies, both of which have significant penetration in Asia, as well as around the globe.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're only a year into this thing. Very important, one thing we all know is obviously Chinese New Year's very powerful when it falls. Obviously the calendar New Year is critical. I don't think we're seeing a lot in terms of &#x2013; the one thing we've learned is the holidays are all very important. Easter is a four-day holiday. Easter Monday, Saturday, Sunday, Friday's wonderful. It goes on for four or five days. Same thing in Macau. But I think at the end of the day, I'm not sure that the &#x2013; unlike Las Vegas, for example, it's very seasonal. The heat in the summer impacts the group business, et cetera.</p>
          <p>I don't think on the Roll &#x2013; our Roll segment in Singapore, you're going to see significant impact by the calendar. More on there, the more I think it's just simply driven by there's demand every day. The quarters won't be that much different, in my opinion. The fourth quarter has its holidays, so does first quarter. Perhaps the summer. Last year we had a very strong summer. We'll see how this summer holds up.</p>
          <p>But yeah, it seems to me that the real key thing for us is not seasonality, it's just growing the business and finding the customers and them finding us. I get the impression that the growth will be there. It's not driven at this point. It's a new product, it's a new market. I don't think the calendar or the seasonality is nearly as important as just people finding the property and getting there and liking it, and the revisitations picking up.</p>
          <p>Sheldon referenced the very strong April. Visitation was very strong in April, but I don't think it's being driven by &#x2013; the Asian market demand for gambling is very, very strong as we all know. I think that's the bigger driver than perhaps seasonality at this point in our experience in Singapore.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. And then I guess I just wanted to go back to the opportunity for the glass is half full as it relates to junkets in Singapore. You guys have been pretty conservative in terms of your &#x2013; some of your interpretations of some of the rules there. And just kind of wondering, I believe the general election has been scheduled now in Singapore. Kind of what do you think are the next opportunities, the next kind of pieces to get junkets legalized there, and maybe your thoughts on a timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think first of all, we follow Sheldon's direction in terms of our strict interpretation of existing laws as we see them, and that will restrict our ability to grow as quickly perhaps as we might if we were more liberal. But I think it's the right approach until the government gives further guidance to adhere to the kind of strict instructions approach to it. Having said that, I think junkets, there's now 31 companies in the queue as we speak. I think that will grow to 40, 50 by the time the summer rolls around. It grows every day. There's some very good publicly listed companies in that group.</p>
          <p>I think it's clear the city government is going to at some point make some decisions about these applications, and we're certainly in the line to be involved with them if in fact they are approved licenses. And we'll wait for government guidance, and in the interim, we'll do our job internally by not dealing with anybody we think is not licensed, not having practices that could be questionable.</p>
          <p>We adhere very, very strictly to Sheldon's direction, and we think the direction of the Singapore government. And again, I think it's going to be a progression, a process, and we'll keep you posted on how it turns out. But there's going to be some license decisions made in calendar year 2011 in Singapore. I think that's pretty clear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last one for Ken, just there's been some discussion out there about some potential refinancings for you guys I think in the Macau side, Ken. Could you give us a little bit of your thoughts about opportunistically, I think some other operators in Macau have looked at tapping some lower cost financing recently, just kind of what you might be considering on that front? And that's it from me. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, no problem. We do have significant opportunities there. I think the market conditions are favorable. We've had some preliminary conversations with some of our lenders and obviously haven't finalized anything yet, but we do have an opportunity to refinance our operations in Macau, which would generate some significant savings from an interest perspective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, I have a question for you in Macau, and I know you have all talked about and we've all seen and witnessed the strength of The Venetian but obviously there's a variety of different scenarios that can occur in Macau after Galaxy Macau opens...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one of those is that the environment gets promotional. So I was just wondering if you could discuss what your plans would be in such an environment and have you started at all to implement any new marketing programs ahead of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, first of all, I think we feel &#x2013; I feel very strongly that the Galaxy is a big contributor to the COTAI portion of our business. I think it's been very good for COTAI, it's going to drive more visitation, that's a good thing. We saw that with City Of Dreams. We welcome the Galaxy opening. We're excited about it. I think if anything, Galaxy is more of a junket-focused player. It will bring mass.</p>
          <p>I think our belief &#x2013; my belief more than ever is we're privileged to be in COTAI with The Venetian. The property is &#x2013; it's a must-see property, it traffics a lot of people because it's got great things for a lot of different parts of the market. It's very well segmented. It's a building people want to see, it's interesting. The shopping is outstanding, the room count is great, a diversity of food and beverage, entertainment. I think we're going to benefit greatly by Galaxy.</p>
          <p>On the junket side, I don't think Galaxy is going to impact us positively or negatively. Our job is to seize the opportunity, to just be a better player in the junket portion of our business. That segment has suffered, and I think we need to get better at it. I think the Wynn results point that out, how much opportunity there is there, and we'll just simply work on it. But I think with Galaxy's opening, I'm a strong believer it's great for COTAI, it's great for the vision of this company, and I think it's great to The Venetian as a mass player.</p>
          <p>I don't think it impacts the Plaza Four Seasons as much, but when you walk through The Venetian, it is a force of nature, it is a must-see place. And I think every person that comes to the COTAI peninsula &#x2013; the COTAI section of Macau will make a stop at The Venetian. I'm pretty confident, and walking through last week, it just gets busier and busier and it's reached a different level of importance I think in Macau. I think Galaxy is a real positive force.</p>
          <p>As to the promotional issues, I think the Galaxy people are going to be focused on making money and watching the margins, and I don't think it's going to be an issue. Our team is watching it very closely. Ed and David are all over it, and I think if we have to react, we will. But we've got to protect The Venetian. It's a very important part of our Macau strategy and it is the player on the COTAI Strip.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then just moving to Singapore, I wanted to get back to the question of margins and some of the costs. So sequentially the margins, the EBITDA margins were lower. I was thinking it might be seasonality but you had mentioned that there really isn't a lot of seasonality. So there were some higher other expenses in the P&amp;L that we saw. I was just wondering were some of those maybe some pre-opening from some of the non-gaming things or is this kind of an EBITDA margin that we should think about?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't think any &#x2013; we haven't had any margin question from any of the operating sites. In fact, those operating margins are actually expanding. Our rooms profit, our average profit, our retail profit, all those are expanding. I don't know of anything that &#x2013; have you noticed something specific, Felicia, you're talking about?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>No, I think &#x2013; it's Ken. I think it's predominantly driven by the hold. I mean I really think that that's the biggest issue. I mean looking at the margins for for instance, the hotel and also the food and beverage, as Mike said, they both have expanded. So we didn't have a reduction in margins from those. The only thing I could think of potentially is if you have new activities are opening up that haven't ramped up from a revenue standpoint, then there's the possibility...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I have the answer. Ken has taken a more conservative approach to the accounts receivable and he's put aside bigger reserves than what we've had &#x2013; than what we wanted to do. So &#x2013; but we've caved into his conservative approach and &#x2013; at least for this period. That doesn't mean we're going to follow it in the future. He's just put aside more reserves than what we think were warranted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, conservative is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Being conservative is good. I can't say it's bad. But if you ask the question, there's no other reason why that expenses would have been higher and I think that amounted to about &#x2013; what's the number, Rob, about $11 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Excess, excess reserves over what we think &#x2013; over what the operating people think we should have taken. But we caved into what he said because as you say, Felicia, it can't hurt us to be more conservative.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felicia, it's Rob. I just wanted to make sure we're clear though on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:12). The most important single piece of the business in Macau and Singapore which is the Non-Rolling mass slot and table, the margins remain stellar. If anything, I think they're going to grow as we get more &#x2013; obviously more revenue out of those games and slot. I don't think there's any issue there, and I do think the hotel is now running like a Las Vegas 2007 hotel. It's got &#x2013; running high 80s% and high occupancies and high rates. And if anything, margins should get better I think, and Mike thinks so.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and I know you probably aren't going to be able to answer this or none of us are going to be able to answer this until Genting reports and we parse through their numbers, but do you have a sense at all of what your mass market share was and your VIP market share? Maybe not specific numbers but did you grow, decline? Any view there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally speaking, I think that our mass market is &#x2013; everybody says &#x2013; everybody who seems to know say that MBS is capturing a &#x2013; I won't say runaway, but an increasing share of the mass market and we're quite happy with that. We are capturing a lesser share of the VIP market because &#x2013; I don't want to get into details about junket reps or anything, but they seem to like to pay higher commissions than what we want to pay.</p>
          <p>And so we think that they will come out with higher Roll because they're what we call in the trade, we call they're buying the business, and we choose not to "buy the business," although we are being somewhat more flexible on the commissions. But we don't want that to be the final arbiter of who's got what percentage of the market. Eventually people will come to the MBS and enjoy playing there, and even if we pay a little bit less, we have stated in the past we don't want to get into a commission war.</p>
          <p>If we get into a commission war, we won't intend &#x2013; we won't get in it for the purpose of losing. So we think that before we get on that horse and gallop into a commission war, we're going to see what happens when the government finishes its investigations, and allows or disallows junket reps, and how many of them and who they are, et cetera. So we are biding our time until those decisions are made.</p>

I believe that in the past &#x2013; that trend will continue and it's also an issue of how they see the market versus us. But I must tell you that it's not because our ability isn't equal or better, our people aren't equal or better. I think the truth of the matter is if we choose to compete in that fashion, we can flip that switch on pretty quickly if that's the direction that we're given.</p>
          <p>So I don't think it's a market difference, I don't think it's a building difference, I don't think it's a people difference. I feel our team in the field is as good as it gets on the casino sales side and our team on the ground is as good as it gets. So if in fact we choose to rethink that approach, it wouldn't be difficult to compete with them.</p>
          <p>I do think our mass business &#x2013; I would be very surprised if we're not stronger than RWS by quite a bit. I think our mass business is showing the strength of that building and the consumers voted with their dollars and I think you're going to see a nice movement in our favor in that regard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to add that in the recent past, since we opened MBS, we have increased the number of sales people in the field substantially, by dozens. And we have well over 100 people out there in the field bringing in the higher end customers, the premium customers that will be considered at the &#x2013; premium direct customers, at the lower rates, the VIP customers. And this is something we never had before &#x2013; we couldn't justify 125, 150 salesmen in the field with only Vegas for them to come to. And we were staying with the junket reps in the market in Macau because they own a substantial &#x2013; they own such a substantial portion of the market there.</p>
          <p>So now with Singapore and with Vegas, and whatever premium direct that we can build up with the junket reps that don't have any penetration, that this is quite unusual for us and it's &#x2013; well, it's not unusual but it's really unprecedented. And we're going to continue to cultivate that direct sales channel and we think that'll help us significantly in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I wonder if you could give a little bit more color around the Singapore margin issue because you mentioned $11 million in excess reserves. If I add that back into your EBITDA adjusted for hold, I'm still getting a margin that's down sequentially and maybe a little less than we would have expected.</p>
          <p>So I don't know if you can give a little bit of color on just sort of sequential changes in margin in some of the segments and I don't know if there was anything non-recurring from opening costs or something in Q1, but just to &#x2013; or more specifics around those receivable numbers, the reserves, just so we can see how the margin would have looked or maybe what you're seeing that we're not seeing?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's going to go &#x2013; it can't go up sequentially every quarter based on seasonality but it should go up on an annual basis. So if you compare the quarters sequentially &#x2013; what you want to do is look at the third quarter when we finally get quarter to quarter comparison year-over-year versus the third quarter of last year to see if it went up that way.

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nobody's ever done it before. There is nothing, Robin, in our expectations that will cause a speed bump. But in the nature of human and commercial activity throughout time immemorial, you've got peaks and valleys. And any month, any week, any quarter could be up or down for a whole variety of reasons that are unpredictable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robin, let me just say this. Sequentially we have gone up every quarter, for the second quarter of '10, third quarter of '10, fourth quarter of '10 and now on an adjusted basis, we've gone up every quarter, on an EBITDA basis &#x2013; normalized basis so far. So are you asking the question as to whether we'll continue to go up sequentially, I think a lot of that depends on seasonality.</p>
          <p>If you're dealing with a Chinese New Year or you're dealing with a Golden Week or whatever, at the levels of occupancy and the levels of play that we have, which go up, it still makes it somewhat difficult on a sequential basis, the comparisons, based on how many holidays, how many situations. That's all I'm saying but theoretically we have gone up practically in the last four quarters every quarter. Remember, you started with a very low base and now we're getting to a much higher base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, Robin, we were at 54.6% last quarter, December 31st and &#x2013; she's talking about March quarter, she's talking about March. We were at 54.6%. When we run through the numbers, we get to something very, very close to that on a hold-adjusted basis for this specific quarter. It might be slightly down. We talked about the $11 million charge.</p>
          <p>There's nothing whatsoever in our business that makes us believe that margin is going to decrease on a percentage basis unless we grow the Rolling business at a higher rate than we're growing it at right now as a percentage of the mass business and the hotel and the retail, which will all grow margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because your margin on the Rolling is a 31% margin. So if you grow the Rolling business, you're going to end up &#x2013; your margin may go down but your profit &#x2013; your EBITDA is going to go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
          <p>A &#x2013; [060H6B-E Robert Goldstein]&gt;: But you're also going to grow the mass &#x2013; Robin, the mass business will continue its outward movement in the direction it's going in. So those margins should stay near mid 60s% and that should provide the fuel to drive the whole profit up. It shouldn't diminish. It should increase.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a question on Singapore again, the hold-adjusted EBITDA for this quarter was about $311 million and if I recall correctly in the fourth quarter call, Sheldon, you kind of mentioned that January was a pretty strong month with EBITDA of around $110 million. How should we go about thinking about the contribution of EBITDA from February itself, which is the Chinese New Year impact?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know, I don't have the figures in front of me. But just recognize that there are peaks and valleys in everything in nature, okay? Nothing goes straight up. Nothing goes straight down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To simplify it, the play was there, the hold wasn't on the high end and it's just that. Then on the mass side, it was just the 23% run. And have we held our luck here in February? Much stronger than it was. The volumes are fine. The luck just wasn't there on the Rolling side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to point out that we ticked back up from $8 million Roll to $10 million Roll from the fourth quarter of '10 to the first quarter of '11. So we've come back to where we were at the highest quarter in 2010. Look, this is a market that's going continue to grow. There is nothing predictable, nothing predictable whatsoever that will have a negative impact on percentage.</p>
          <p>And what really counts is how many dollars you could put in the bank and the teller at the bank doesn't qualify his acceptance of your deposit based upon the percentage of margin that you experience. He just says give me the money, I'll put it in your account. That'll be that. And &#x2013; but there is nothing predictable out there. We don't see anything that will change any of the trends. And I'd like to say that we all feel quite decisively and unequivocally that this is a very unique market in the world.</p>
          <p>That &#x2013; the South Asia and the contributions from may not be considered South Asia &#x2013; Southeast Asia, like China, like Japan, like Korea have been contributing a lot to our high end of the market, and we see no reason why that won't continue to grow. We continue to see people coming out of the woodwork at all levels, at the initial $100,000 level and at the $5 million and $10 million and increased levels. They come out of the woodwork, that a lot of the &#x2013; some of them we didn't know before, some of them we had been trying to get as customers, and we're achieving that now.</p>
          <p>We don't see any trough of any significance coming into our future in increasing the business. So when you're talking about &#x2013; there are people saying give or take $1.5 billion EBITDA are coming out of Singapore, you're talking about very substantial amounts of money. Pretty soon Singapore will deliver more EBITDA than the entire Las Vegas Strip. It's done. So we have great opportunity organically and great opportunity for expanded growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a follow-up question on receivables, maybe if you can just help us by giving us a bit more guidance on how we should be thinking about casino receivables in Singapore? I see that Rolling Chip volume has recovered as you said pretty nicely in first quarter. How should we be thinking about credit standards, and also how are you treating provisions going forward? And if you can share with us the amount of casino receivables in Singapore as well, if you have it by any chance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll answer the first part. I'll leave it up to Ken and Rob to answer the second part. The fact that we're doing &#x2013; that RWS is giving &#x2013; is probably going to have a lot more Roll, maybe twice the Roll that we had, it sort of indicates to you two things vis-&#xE0;-vis, how they get the Roll and number two, how conservative we are on granting credit. We want to be conservative. We don't want to come up with any big surprises on the negative side because we gave out too much credit and too recklessly.</p>
          <p>We're extremely conservative on granting credit, we're extremely conservative on collecting credit, and on putting aside reserves. We are in this for the long term. We're not in it to make profit to create a tremendous impression for one quarter and forget about the future. This is &#x2013; we're riding a very solid horse here, and we want to keep that horse going. We're feeding it, we're grooming it, we're taking care of it, and we expect that it'll just continue to grow on a prudent and conservative basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Ken. We've got about &#x2013; from a receivables standpoint on a gross basis about $360 million of receivables. We've got about a 13.5% reserve against that, which I think is conservative, as Sheldon had mentioned before. I don't see that necessarily changing much. I think we've done a very good job with regard to being conservative with regard to granting credit, we've done a very good job with regard to collection of accounts outstanding, and we think that we're really in good shape from a receivables standpoint.</p>

          <p>Jon, I mentioned to Janet Brashear before, you may have missed the answer, we're in the final stages of negotiation with two international brands, one for the Shangri-La and one for the Traders site. Most likely that'll be completed in the next couple of weeks. We've had the visitations and have all the material in on our side and on their side, and we'll probably have an announcement by the end of this month I would say to give us a little leeway to do the negotiations we have to do.</p>
          <p>And we will then have 5 and 6 represented by three major international companies, all with heavy presentation in the Chinese market. That's our goal there. And we will manage those two properties ourselves. The Sheraton properties, they will manage as previously done. There's been no change in that scenario.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, great results. Just looking forward, you're finishing your Macau property, you're getting a hotel open in Bethlehem, what's next? I mean Southern Florida looks like it's still there settling down, Massachusetts, possibilities in Asia. Can you talk about where you might be going next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're hoping that notwithstanding all the tragedy that's occurred in Japan, that we have &#x2013; we're hoping or we have some reason to believe that they understand they've got to do what they can to accelerate or to reinstate their reputation as a good tourist destination. So that may be a blessing in disguise vis-&#xE0;-vis liberalization of the gaming laws and allowing IRs to be put in.</p>
          <p>And of course, we're &#x2013; everybody says we're the leading candidate there. I heard that Steve Wynn recently said that he didn't think that Japan would be a very good place to attract people to. But bear in mind, Japan for time immemorial has had these issues, and there have been earthquakes and tsunamis there forever.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; we just had a team of people over to Spain. We are continuing to lay the groundwork for that. We have constant meetings about planning and programming; that is, how much space we're going to allocate to which of the properties. We've talked to builders. We're in discussions with both the governments and land acquisition, both in Madrid and Barcelona. And it's not a Spanish development per se. This will be a development where the primary market is all of Europe: Western Europe, the former Warsaw Pact countries, Western former Soviet Union countries, even into Moscow and St. Petersburg, down to the Middle East, Turkey, with 85 million people, and North Africa.</p>
          <p>Nobody's talked about North Africa. There's a lot of haves there and there are far more have-nots. So we're hope that North Africa will help to fatten up the market there. But it's for 700 million, 800 million people in the <mark type="ph" /> catchment (1:01:15) area, so it's not just Spain. And we're moving forward on that. We're not ready to break ground. We don't have the grants and incentives finalized yet, but we're in heavy discussion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And as far as Asia goes, Taiwan doesn't have the transportation system that you need, that just doesn't work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taiwan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taiwan, so far as we know about Taiwan, Taiwan is still considering the islands in the Taiwan Strait or based upon my age we used to call it the Formosa Strait. I'm not sure that we want to go to Kinmen or to Matsu. Prudence would have us look for some sort of assurance from the Chinese government that they'll keep the visa flow open. And since Taiwan is not yet a special administrative region as they are, I'm not sure what the attitude will be from China in keeping the visa spigot open.</p>
          <p>So without some sort of assurance, it would be a tough decision to make vis-&#xE0;-vis the islands. We are advocating keeping it on the Taiwan mainland; although there's only 24 million people there it would be a phenomenal, very, very self-supporting IR in Taipei or in Kaohsiung.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. And how about Massachusetts and Florida?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still looking at those. If Massachusetts allows three full casinos, Rhode Island is considering converting their two slot parlors into full fledged casinos. The two, the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, are still there. It all depends where they allow them. I think with three, there might be too small of a market up there so it may not justify the kind of money that we'll have to spend to show our best, to flex our muscles the best.</p>
          <p>Florida, it all depends. It's still up in the air. A subcommittee failed to pass it or a committee failed to pass it, and I think it's being put over to next year. And the same thing in Texas. We don't have any approval yet in either Texas, Florida or Massachusetts, but we're keeping a close eye on that.</p>
          <p>The big, big activity &#x2013; I think the United States is getting too diluted in terms of too many casinos in too many states. I remember the days when there were too few casinos in too few states. Now the pendulum has swung the other way. There are too many casinos in too many places, too many racinos with slots, and the possibility of Internet gaming that could potentially have a negative impact on the brick and mortar casinos.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's &#x2013; we don't have anything final. We're leaning upon what the Macau government wants to do. I'm sure we're not leaning on them, we're relying upon them. We're not doing anything to do it. We're not taking any steps except to tell them how good it's going to be and again, I hate to repeat it, but we have reason to believe that the possibility of approval may be closer than further.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I guess I just wanted to go back to an earlier question by Mark Strawn who talked about the impact of &#x2013; I think he was trying to get to in Vegas that maybe the cash customer activity and the decrease in promotional activity may have impacted the hold in some way in that market. And then on Singapore, similarly on the old percentage, is it that Resorts World is &#x2013; as you said, is buying business. Is that impacting your hold because it's reducing the length of play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, it's Rob Goldstein. In Las Vegas, there's absolutely no impact on the hold percentage. We've got a lot of &#x2013; a wonderful amount of Asian business and then they just kept winning. It's that simple and there's not more to be said as far as promotional activity, if it had no impact whatsoever.</p>
          <p>As far as Singapore, what RWS does, doesn't impact our hold percentage at all, as far as our business. We didn't hold back lucky, we just missed by &#x2013; points. It's not usually significant. Obviously it impacts the EBITDA but again, there's no impact whatsoever on the W's activities on a hold perspective. We have lots of business. We play many hours, a lot of great benefits to the Asian customer, they tend to stay and play a long time. They just stay and play and stay lucky, and that's the simple fact both in Las Vegas as well as in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the principle of the law of averages that the hold percentage is a matter of luck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing you should know, we've been doing this in Las Vegas for better than a decade. Our cumulative hold percentage in Las Vegas on Asian Baccarat play exceeds 27%. So sometimes you play lucky, sometimes you don't. But at the end of the day, we're pretty confident with the volumes in Singapore and the volumes in this company, it's pretty obvious at the end of the day it'll work out just fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We cut back on the comps at the slot end of the market by raising the threshold. We haven't eliminated the comps. We've &#x2013; the thresholds for people who qualify for the comps were too low so I raised them up to the point where they're profitable now, where their profitability was questionable before. But the percentage of hold is &#x2013; doesn't impact the slot hold, it impacts the table game hold.</p>
          <p>So the comps, the increase or decrease in the allowance for comps doesn't have any effect whatsoever on the hold number. And besides, only &#x2013; hold can only be adjusted by luck, by the law of averages. That's all. There's no other way to it. If there was any other way to increase the hold, believe me, we'd be out there chasing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but, Sheldon, I mean it's also length of play, as you've pointed out over the years past and your competitors have pointed out. So that's why I'm asking is either one of these activities reducing the length of play? And I guess the answer is it's not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, absolutely not. There's no way that we would cut back on comps where there's the potential for somebody who's going to play a long time or a short time, or where the threshold of probability of theoretical win is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But they might go to another casino if you're not offering them the same amount...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, we're offering the same. The point, Steve, is that we went down too far on the threshold. That's all there is to it, and it was almost completely on the slot side and not on the table side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, and this hold is all Baccarat-driven and these guys aren't impacted by that at all. We have no comp issues on the high end at all. The Chinese &#x2013; the Asian customer who comes to Las Vegas didn't suffer at all as far as any decision &#x2013; it does not impact, it's not even related.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good. Just a &#x2013; just very briefly on Singapore, Sheldon, I mean the mass market trends that were evident in the results I thought were pretty strong with mass revenues per day up 7% sequentially. Can you give us some brief thoughts on the depth of that market and whether you're finished penetrating the mass market there or are you seeing the market overall has got more to run?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike is saying that he got some figures that only 3.some% of Singaporeans...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're not saying Singaporeans, you're saying the Singapore market for us. So I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point is the numbers are staggering. If you look at the slots, we've gone from the first full quarter which is Q3 '09 &#x2013; excuse me '10, we've approximately won about $79.5 million then jumped to $96 million there and then jumped to $108 million. Can we get to $120 something million next quarter? I believe we can. I believe this is going to keep going. We've not &#x2013; the penetration in that market we don't know because we don't know how big that market can get to.</p>
          <p>But I think it's safe to say talking to Andrew and Mark and the guys who run that business every day, we have total confidence that the growth is ahead of us. Is it going to be 5%, 6% per quarter, 8%, 9% per quarter? I don't know. But the growth isn't over. But the mass table size is even more &#x2013; I think more compelling there in terms of we're seeing &#x2013; the growth there tends to be both per Singaporeans and visitors, as that building gathers more strength and becomes the preferred place, the place we want to go to, I think our table business will continue to ramp.</p>
          <p>The good news is the hold percentage stays very fat, probably in the 22%, 23% range if you call it. The comment earlier to Steve's call, they play an awful long time. They don't leave the table. The appetite for extra strategies is very, very small versus American customer. So I think our table business there will ramp up. Again does it grow to &#x2013; cumulatively we believe the market can grow you know easily we can see 1.8, 1.9 next year as a cumulative mass slot. I believe that's the number. That's my personal belief. It can grow to 1.8, 1.9 next year in 2012. I don't think it slows down.</p>
          <p>And if anything, as you see, Singapore visitation which is off the chart, 26%, 28%, we're the beneficiary of that visitation. And we're right in the heart of town in the Marina district. We've got this wonderful building. We've got, as Sheldon referenced, the Disney show. The retail is superb. The restaurants are I would call it spectacular. So why wouldn't we keep getting our fair share of an ever-growing double-digit growth in visitation? I think we're going to dominate the mass table and slot market for a long time and we're very fortunate to be there. It's a wonderful problem to have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic. And one final follow-up if I may, Rob, what was the &#x2013; can you talk to the percentage of table drop in Vegas that was accounted for by high end Baccarat play in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we ran about roughly &#x2013; our business breaks out &#x2013; one reason on the call we talked about how to break it out. About $280 million roughly of our drop was Baccarat-driven. Of that, 90-plus% Asian play. I mean we're an Asian house in the Baccarat business, you realize, as are the better hotels in town. And we did get more than our fair share in terms of &#x2013; because of our presence in Asia.</p>
          <p>And since it's so simple, sometimes you play lucky, you know, lots &#x2013; listen to the Wynn call, they played very lucky. It was great. They held 30 points. I can guarantee that the majority was driven by high end Baccarat. And we didn't play lucky but we had the business, we'll continue to have the business. And when it's all said and done, we'll hold our 27%, 26%, 28% on that segment. I'm not the least bit concerned and nor should you be.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have reached the allotted time for questions. I'll now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can &#x2013; the only thing I could say &#x2013; this is Sheldon, the only thing I could say is that we're extremely excited about being the most successful company in the history of the lodging, hospitality, gaming industry. That the expectation is that we'll hit $3 billion plus in EBITDA this year. And some people are saying that we might hit &#x2013; some of the analysts are projecting we'll make $4 billion. I can't make any comment about &#x2013; in 2012. I won't make any comment about that, but I will say that we feel quite confident that the $3 billion mark will be breached. We'll expect to go somewhat over that.</p>
          <p>And again, without providing guidance, we're very optimistic. You know, one month of low hold doesn't make a year, but think about having the entire Las Vegas Strip resident in two casinos and we split that up. When the Singapore government rightfully does &#x2013; finishes investigation about junket reps, we'll see how that comes out. In the meantime we're being very conservative, but we earned $1 billion in EBITDA in our first 12 months.</p>
          <p>And I want to remind some of you guys that some of you were projecting we were going to make $300 million. And I think the average of the consensus was about $500 million. So we made $1 billion while we still weren't ramped up. And there isn't anything in the future that anybody can see that will cause a diminution of this greater growth.</p>
          <p>So we're very happy about it and I want to thank everybody for their vote of confidence in us. And we look forward to the current quarter, giving you an even more profitable quarter. So thank you for calling and that's the end of the call.</p>
