          <p>Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Inditex Conference Call for the Interim Nine Months 2010 Results. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Inditex's Deputy Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session comprising of two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex' results for the interim nine months 2010. I am Pablo Isla and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, our Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>I would like to cover a few of the highlights for the interim nine months 2010. The results show that Inditex continues its ongoing international multi-concept growth. Sales have increased 14% in the period. Over the interim nine months 2010, our operations have shown high efficiency and tight operating control. We have also maintained our strict focus on cash flow generation and, in terms of expansion, our store-opening plan for the year is on track.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers, and I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In the interim nine months of 2010, all the key lines of the profit and loss account saw significant growth as a result of our operating performance. Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;8.9 billion ; sales in local currencies have grown 11%. In the period, we have achieved an EBITDA of &#x20AC;2.1 billion, a net income of &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross profit, this line has increased 20% to &#x20AC;5.3 billion. Gross margins on sales reached 59.9%. The performance of the gross margin in the interim nine months was partially driven by exceptional factors in the first half of 2010, such as the currency and the comparable base. We anticipate normal gross margin drivers in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses in the interim nine months 2010 have increased 13%, reflecting mainly the growth in space and include all the start-up costs for new openings and Zara's e-commerce launch. Operating expenses are tightly under control.</p>
          <p>Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the trends shown at fiscal year-end 2009. Inditex continues to show a strong financial condition.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In the interim nine months of 2010, we have opened 300 net stores to reach a total of 4,907 in 77 countries. Given our diversified geographical presence and our capacity to select opportunities globally, we have opened stores in 45 different countries over the period. Store openings for fiscal 2010 will reach the top end of the range presented to you last March.</p>
          <p>Regarding the performance by format in the interim nine months of 2010, Zara and the younger concepts group together have performed broadly in line with each other with some minor differences. Regarding the younger concepts, Massimo Dutti and Zara Home have performed above the average and Oysho and Bershka below the average. The changes versus last year relate mainly to the comparable base.</p>
          <p>I am now handing over to Pablo Isla for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>For the remainder of 2010, we will continue to invest profitably in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns. Regarding the autumn/winter season, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1st of August to the 12th of December have grown 10%.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I would like to elaborate on a number of strategic initiatives for the coming months and some recent store openings. Inditex is currently operating 140 stores of Zara, Bershka, Pull&amp;Bear and Massimo Dutti and Stradivarius in 28 cities in China. Zara accounts for 69 of these stores. In early 2011, we plan to launch Oysho, Zara Home and Uterq&#xFC;e in China to reach a full multi-concept presence in the country. All Inditex concepts will be expanding in China next year.</p>
          <p>Zara is operating 63 stores in Japan with a highly established presence in the country. We also plan to launch Bershka in Japan in early 2011. Bershka will open a flagship store in a highly prominent location in Tokyo's Shibuya district, a hub for the world's teenage fashion. This will be followed by further stores in Japan over the year.</p>
          <p>Massimo Dutti is also increasing its presence in other Asia markets where Inditex is currently represented only with Zara. Massimo Dutti has opened its first stores in South Korea on December the 9th. The reception of the flagship stores in Seoul at Garosu Road and Kangnam Road has been very good. I would also like to remind you that we plan to launch Zara stores in Australia, South Africa over 2011, confirming the global reach of our business model.</p>
          <p>On the 2nd of September, we have launched Zara online sales in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK. On the 4th of November, we have added online sales in Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Zara offers a strong commercial proposition in e-commerce and is also available in mobile commerce. Customer reception has been very satisfactory. We plan a progressive rollout of e-commerce operations in all markets in which Zara is present.</p>
          <p>I would now like to highlight some selected openings of recent months. On the 10th of December, Zara has opened a flagship store in Rome's Via del Corso on the way to the Fontana di Trevi, one of the world's most prominent retail destinations. Palazzo Bocconi is an outstanding historical building, home of Zara's largest store worldwide and Inditex's store number 5,000. We are currently operating 280 stores in Italy.</p>
          <p>Zara has recently opened a highly visible store in Hong Kong's airport, the gateway to China, with 50 million passengers each year. This store further enhances Zara's visibility in the Chinese market. Zara is also expanding in China's Central Regions. Good examples are Zara stores at the Galleria Shopping Mall in Chengdu and Huanghua Shopping Mall in Chongquing. Megapolis is Zara's 22nd store in Moscow. Inditex is currently operating 200 stores in Russia.</p>
          <p>Bershka has recently opened its largest store worldwide at Milan's Corso Vittorio Emanuele, the key retail location of the fashion capital. The flagship store comprises 1,400 square meters and is a unique showcase for Bershka's collections. Bershka is also expanding in the Chinese market, with stores like the one at Chengdu Galleria. Bershka currently operates 27 stores in China.</p>
          <p>Massimo Dutti has recently opened its store number 13 in Russia at Saint Petersburg Galleria Mall. Massimo Dutti has also introduced its new image in the store at Neuer Wall in Hamburg, Germany.</p>
          <p>Pull&amp;Bear has launched a flagship eco-efficient store at Madrid's Gran V&#xED;a. It includes a strong number of features to reduce energy consumption by 30% versus standard stores. This project will be implemented in all new stores in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Stradivarius recently opened its store number 28 in Poland at Wo&#x142;owska Street in Warsaw. Oysho has opened its flagship store in France at Rue de Rivoli in Paris. Zara Home has opened a flagship store at Piazza San Babila in Milan. Uterq&#xFC;e continues its expansion with a flagship store at Avenue de la Toison d'Or in Brussels city center.</p>
          <p>Finally, regarding our corporate calendar, the full year results for 2010 will be released on the 23rd of March, 2011. And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from with Richard Chamberlain from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, guys. It's Richard Chamberlain here from BofA Merrill Lynch. Good morning. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, we can hear you, good morning, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just a question to start with please on the gross margin. I wondered if you could just quantify please how much your use or increased use of proximity sourcing boosted the gross margin in the third quarter. Remember having quite a big positive impact in the first half, so I just wondered if you could say what was the impact in Q3, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, we prefer not to &#x2013; we think that the best way to read the gross margin is not on a quarterly basis, it's more &#x2013; much better to wait until the end of the full season. What we can say is that, as you remember, in the first half of the year, we had a very big increase in the gross margin, this had to do with sourcing in proximity, this had to do with inventory management, also with two exceptional factors such as currencies and comparable base. And then as we anticipated to you in the first half results publication, what we are expecting for the second half is a gross margin very much in line, very similar to the gross margin in the second half 2009; so normal drivers in the evolution of the gross margin in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was just wondering because obviously it doesn't look like the like-for-like sales rate slowed very much in the third quarter if at all. So, I just wondered why the proximity sourcing effect would be much less in the third quarter because, clearly, that's a function of like-for-like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Richard, what we mentioned is that sales from the &#x2013; in the second half considering up to the 12th of December are growing at 10%, we think this number is very satisfactory. Obviously, to consider just the last &#x2013; the fourth quarter is &#x2013; we're talking about five weeks and comparing against the most demanding comparable in the fourth quarter. So we have still ahead of us the Christmas season and after Christmas. So I would say that at this point in time, I believe that that 10% is a very &#x2013; 10% sales growth in local currencies is a very reasonable one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Didn't really answer the question, did he?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, it's Rich Edwards from Citigroup. It was just a question on online. I wonder if you could give us some sense of the online contribution to third quarter revenue trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I must say first of all that we're very satisfied with customer reception to our online offer. As I was, as we were mentioning during the presentation, we have introduced our online sales in several other European markets. But as we said in the first half results publication, we prefer at least to wait until the end of the season to have a whole season, where we're just beginning with our online activity. So we prefer not to quantify. We are just beginning in several different markets.</p>
          <p>What I can tell you is that, we are very happy with our customers' reaction to our online proposition. We are also very happy with our approach that combines the stores with online sales, with the possibility of deliveries in the stores or returns in the stores. So we think it's a very attractive proposal for our customers and this is what &#x2013; we prefer not to go beyond that in just the first season in which we are selling online.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You also mentioned, I think, in the presentation that the launch of online had increased your cost base. Can you give us some idea of how significant that cost was? And is it something we should think of as being largely one-off? It sounds like you've got some other launches to go in the first half of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the start-up costs for the online launch were around &#x20AC;12 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that doesn't really explain, because your cost base, if you strip space and currency out of your costs growth in the quarter, it looks as though like-for-like costs were up about 6%, which is the biggest cost growth you've had for a couple of years. 12 million wouldn't explain that. Why has the cost base grown so quickly? Is it just variable costs or there's something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's the usual factors. As you know, the main driver for operating expenses growth is the space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're clearly mentioning that we're growing to reach the top end of the number of stores that we presented to you in March. So we're talking more of the top of the space growth that we were mentioning at the beginning of the year. This is the main driver of the space growth.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have a variable part linked mainly to the performance of sales. And thirdly, we have currency. And currency in the nine months has been approximately 200 basis points. If you add these &#x20AC;12 million coming from the online, you have basically all the drivers. What we can tell you is that the operating expenses remain tightly under control and that like-for-like cost growth is below 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Fred Bjelland from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just wanted to get back on the gross margin, maybe for next year. Obviously, you talked about a lot of the one-off drivers behind the gross margin in the first half of the year. Should we expect the number of those to reverse next year? And also, in terms of input cost inflation, I see that proximity sourcing should give you some insulation against that, but presumably you're not going to be immune to it. So, just wondering a little bit on timing about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, we elaborate about the gross margin for any given year in the full year results presentation of the previous year. So we will elaborate much more about our expectations for the 2011 gross margin in the 2010 full year results presentation.</p>
          <p>What we can say is &#x2013; well, of course, as you were mentioning, there were some exceptional factors in the first half that will not be there in the first half 2011. Then &#x2013; well, then it is evident, no that there is some cost inflation regarding raw materials, regarding wages in some countries, particularly in China.</p>
          <p>At the same time, and you were mentioning, in your question that because of our business model, because of our sourcing in proximity, because of the long-term relationships that we have with our suppliers, we are less exposed. And also that, as we always say, the gross margin is a combination of many different factors; of course, markups but also markdowns, fashion trends, product mix, currencies. So there are many, many factors involved in the gross margin, so it is difficult to isolate one of these factors. But in any case, as I was saying to you before, we will elaborate more in the full year results presentation.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Rebecca McClellan, Santander. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Rebecca at Santander. I've got just a couple of questions. Firstly, could you explain please the growth in trade payables that we're seeing at the end of October? It's sort of about up 30%. And equally, can you give us an idea as to your intentions vis-&#xE0;-vis pricing going into 2011 in view of the COGS inflation that's being experienced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps before Ignacio, our CFO, explaining the first part of your question about trade payables, regarding the second part of your question, what we are thinking about the year 2011 is, in general terms, is to maintain and stable our prices in the different markets. This has been our policy in the last few years and our plans are to continue with this policy. Now Ignacio, do you want to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The position of payables, at the end of the third quarter of 2010 reflects the use or sourcing proximity to respond to sales growth, as you know the flexibility of our business model enables us to respond to the demand in season with short lead times. This means we cash in sales before we have to pay our suppliers resulting in a working capital inflow. It includes many small components like payables from franchises, fiscal accounts and credit cards, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Hughes from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Andrew Hughes from UBS. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Perfectly, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to the gross margin. Was there a noticeable impact from the VAT increase in Spain? I think you mentioned that you were looking to absorb that yourself. Was that a reason for the slower gross margin gain in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Regarding the VAT, there have been some VAT increases in different markets and yes, as you were saying, we always try to compensate that through efficiencies in the different markets. No, what I would say about the gross margin &#x2013; well, first of all, you were asking about the gross margin in the third quarter. The first thing I would say is that, as we always say, we prefer to analyze the gross margin on a full-season basis, no in the &#x2013; but we anticipated what we were expecting regarding the evolution of the gross margin in the second half. And what we anticipated is that we were thinking that, in the second half 2010, we were going to see normal drivers in the evolution of the gross margin. And this is what is been the case.</p>
          <p>And we are expecting, in the second half 2010, a very similar gross margin to the one we achieved in the second half 2009, which, by the way, is a very, very relevant figure in terms of gross margin. So it is very much what we were anticipating at the beginning of the season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And just on the U.S. market, with your e-commerce plans there, does that signal that you're likely to open more stores there as well in the next few years, or are you happy to roll out e-commerce with a relatively small number of stores on the ground there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are not planning to change our strategy regarding store openings in the U.S. Every year, we could open a few number of stores, but we are not planning to accelerate the openings because of the e-commerce launch.</p>
          <p>We think that it's something very &#x2013; I mean, it's very positive for store sales, to be present also with online sales in any given market. But we are not changing our strategy regarding the U.S. market because of the online launch.</p>

          <p>Right. Why is that? Why aren't you perhaps opening more stores there, now that conditions look more favorable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but &#x2013; we have talked about that previously. First of all, you know that in terms of openings, in terms of growth, we have two very clear priorities, which are Europe and Asia. In the case of Europe, a combination between Western and Eastern European countries. And then Asia is our very &#x2013; other very, very relevant priority. Of course, inside Asia, China ,because of the size of the country, the size of the market, the number of cities, is the more relevant &#x2013; the most relevant part of it. But not only China, also Japan, South Korea, India. And then, not everything can be a priority at the same time. We think, currently, this is the best strategy we can follow.</p>
          <p>Of course, in the U.S., as I was saying to you before, we will continue with selected openings every year. But in terms of priorities, in terms of the most relevant part of our store growth, our focus in the year 2011 will remain in Europe and Asia.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question's on the gross margin. Is it fair to say that you've had a negative impact from currency on the gross margin in Q3 and that that will get worse in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say not &#x2013; in the second half, we are not expecting any relevant currency impact in the gross margin. We already anticipated that, that we were saying that we were going to have a slightly positive currency impact in the first half gross margin and very neutral or &#x2013; impact in the second half. So we are not expecting any relevant currency impact in the gross margin in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick question on current trading, in the first six weeks of Q4. There does seem to be a little bit of weakening. Is that due at all to any slowdown in Spain? Is there any weather impact? Or is it entirely down to a tougher comparative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically as we mentioned, we're talking about just a few weeks, and I believe a 10% sales growth in local currencies is a very reasonable growth.</p>
          <p>Linking with your first question regarding currency impact, not only on the gross margin, but talking about the top line; as you know, in the first half, we had 300 basis points of currency translation into sales. And this is very much what we expect for the second half, 300 basis points, probably higher in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But regarding any other different aspects of the business, I would not remark anything especially. Sales in Spain remain stable.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Can you just talk a bit more about stores and space? Judging from your comments at the beginning, it sounds as though you're finding it easier to source more good quality, particularly flagship stores and, as you say, your overall space guidance for the year will be at the top end of the range. So are you finding it easier, and should we assume a better number for next year as well? And within this, are we seeing a higher proportion of flagships? And if so, does that have an impact on average store costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we would say is that, as you know, our store growth is always a combination of flagship stores in very good city center locations and then, of course, also stores in shopping malls in the different markets. So we are always combining this type of approach; opening very flagship stores in the best capitals of the world from a commercial point of view, and at the same time, of course, opening stores in shopping malls all across the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of the opportunities that we are finding to open stores, well, you know that we are present in nearly 80 countries, and then there are many opportunities in all the different markets. So this year, as we were saying during the presentation, we are going to be in the top end of the range that we announced to you last March.</p>
          <p>If we think &#x2013; I mean, what we said in the 2009 full year results presentation; that the space growth in the coming three years could be between 8% to 10%, remains the case. Space growth will be between 8% to 10%. And as I was saying to you before, this year, we are going to be in the top end of the range. And if we think about the coming years, we continue seeing a lot of opportunities in the different markets in which we are present; always combining flagship stores with openings in shopping malls, which is our strategy regarding our expansion. Of course, for Zara, but not only for Zara, as we were mentioning during the presentation, also for all the other brands in our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you've &#x2013; and over the last few years, you've brought your average cost of new space down quite considerably. Can you keep that down at current levels? Or is there &#x2013; or will that naturally creep back up again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. You talked quite a bit in your presentation about the opening progress in China and Russia. Can you talk a bit about your experience regarding profitability in those two markets, relative to the profitability at Group level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when we compare our profitability in the different regions: Europe, America, Asia, our profitability in the different regions of the world is very similar, because we have that in mind also, in order to establish our price positioning in any given market.</p>
          <p>Sometimes what changes is the profile of the profit and loss account. I mean, there are countries in which the gross margin is higher and then the cost structure is higher to arrive to a good level of profitability and countries in which the gross margin is lower, because we can assume that, because the cost structure is lower.</p>
          <p>But globally, there are not big differences in terms of profitability between the different regions in which we operate. So nothing very material in order to have an impact on the global profitability of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you just remind me of what your average price point is in Russia and China, relative to the base of 100 in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If we take the base of 100, instead of in Spain, in Europe, because you know that Spain is around 15% below the average in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if Europe would be the base of 100, China would be very much in line and Russia depends also on the currency evolution. But it could be around 30% above that figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning. A question, actually just coming back to space growth. Could you say &#x2013; I'm assuming you're going to open, say, 425 stores this year according to your comments &#x2013; what that translates to in terms of square meters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I don't &#x2013; the amount of square meters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have now in mind a figure. But what you must assume also, in terms of space contribution inside the year, the 2010 year, is that space contribution, on a weighted basis &#x2013; not because the calendar of openings in this year was 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. So in terms of space contribution, it will be between the range &#x2013; between this 8% to 10% range that we anticipated in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So weighted space contribution rather than store openings, yes? Weighted space contribution will be between 8% and 10% yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, between 8% to 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, as I speak to people about your opportunity in Asia, I'm often told that you have many, many hundreds of stores you could open in China. Could you talk a little bit more about the sort of size of opportunity that you see in China currently, particularly for the Zara brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we would say about China is that the size of the opportunity is very, very, very big for us. We were saying during the presentation that currently we are present in 28 cities. Of course, we have a very, very strong presence in Shanghai, in Beijing but there are many, many other cities in which we are building our presence.</p>
          <p>And from next year on, we will be present with all our different brands, and then if we think about the next 5, 10 years, China will be a very, very relevant part of our expansion. There is no doubt. We see that the size of the opportunity is very, very, very big. And in China, people like very much fashion. So we have all the elements to continue growing significantly in the coming years in China.</p>
          <p>You should assume that Asia globally, not only China, but Asia globally, in the coming years will be at least 50% of total Zara openings in the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So when we think about that Zara, I think, this year at the top end, you might open 120 stores, so we should think that around 60 or so per year is a likely number for Zara in Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It will depend on the total number of stores. But if you assume a range between 8% to 10% space growth in the case of Zara, at least 50% of that will take place in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's actually Karen Howland from Barclays. Was wondering you talked about the fact that you would be willing to keep your &#x2013; you wanted to try to keep your prices flat next year. I just wanted to confirm that despite the fact that prices will be going up as far as raw material costs, so presumably, that means you'll be willing to sacrifice some margin next year to keep your pricing flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I was saying is &#x2013; well, first of all, I was referring to that when we were talking about the 2011 gross margin, related with that question. I would say that well, of course, there is some cost inflation regarding raw materials, regarding labor costs in some countries, but the gross margin is a combination of many, many different factors. It has to do not only with markups. It also has to do with markdowns, with fashion trends.</p>
          <p>And we are thinking &#x2013; when we think about the next year, we are thinking about the stability of our prices in the different markets. So what we are trying to do is to run in the most possible efficient way our operations. So we are not planning to increase prices in the different markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, not increasing prices and maintaining the policy of gross margin either up or down, 50 bps one way or another?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, prices will be stable and as we have discussed, we will comment on the gross margin in March.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment that you're seeing out there now. I know amongst the UK retailers, we've been hearing price increases around 4%. Are you seeing that amongst your players &#x2013; amongst the players you compete against on a global basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Just bearing in mind your comments about the expansion in Asia, I know you've been asked this before, it's just an update I want really, is at what point it's worth trying to replicate your current sourcing system within China? I know you source stuff from China, but moving to more of a proximity sourcing model in China as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not thinking about that in the short-term, in the near future. We think that our sourcing model remains very valid. We like to manage our stock on a centralized way; it has a lot of advantages for us in terms of distribution, in terms of many, many, many different factors. And we are not thinking about changing our sourcing strategy in the coming &#x2013; in the next few years, I would say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are always thinking about everything, as you can imagine. So we are always thinking about the possibility of having some logistic capacity in Asia. These are things that are permanently on the table, and are permanently analyzed, to see if they are more efficient or less efficient, compared to our current way of managing things. We always are a very flexible company and we adapt ourselves to the circumstances in any case. So these type of things are permanently analyzed, as you can imagine.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning to you all. We are now going to go through the questions that have come in through the webcast platform. Some of them relate to topics that have already been answered, such as sales, space growth, gross margin and online</p>
          <p>We have a question regarding our expansion plans in Australia and South Africa; and more generally, asking what potential does the Southern Hemisphere offer Zara and non-Zara formats?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding our openings in Australia and South Africa, thinking about next year, well, of course, we are opening next year in both countries. In the case of Australia, it would be in what in Australia is the autumn/winter season, which is in the first part of the year. And in the case of South Africa, it will be in what in South Africa is their spring/summer season, which is in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>We think that the opening in these two markets will complement very much our South Hemisphere collection, in the case of Zara, that we currently have. As you know, we are selling in Brazil, in Argentina, in Chile and in Uruguay, and then now we are adding in these two new markets. We are opening two very flagship stores in Australia; in Sydney and Melbourne, in Peter Street in the case of Sydney; in a very flagship building in the case of Melbourne. And currently, we are not thinking about expanding ourselves with other brands in those markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question regarding online. How does the online platform work for the different markets? Will the current system change when you go to USA and Japan next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in a very significant way. The way we think about our online approach is that it would be a store. This is our state of mind; we always consider the online platform as if it would be an additional store. So everything will be very similar in general terms, in the case of the new markets.</p>

          <p>Well, in India, I would say that we are quite happy with the evolution of sales. As we have transmitted to you previously, of course, we will continue opening stores in India, in the next year. We will be present not only in Delhi and Mumbai, but also in Pune and Bangalore.</p>
          <p>But the rate of growth, the number of openings in India will be much lower than the number of openings we are expecting in the case of China, because of shopping mall developments; because of many, many different factors. So in India, we think about next year, we are planning around five shops, to open five Zara stores during the year.</p>
