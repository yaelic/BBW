          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us at our first quarter results briefing. The last time we met was back in February when we announced our record full year 2011 performance. We're very proud then with our S$3.04 billion results.</p>
          <p>This time around, it's yet another record quarter for us. Indeed, I have to say a very rosy set of results and I think without further ado, I'd like to hand the floor over to my colleague Sok Hui, who will tell us more. Sok Hui, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We reported another set of strong results in the first quarter as growth momentum was maintained across businesses. Net profit rose 28% from the previous quarter and 16% from a year ago to a record S$933 million.</p>
          <p>Total income crossed S$2 billion for the first time, underpinned by sustained loan volume, higher net interest margins, broad-based fee income growth and higher customer flows for treasury products.</p>
          <p>Net interest income reached a new high of S$1.34 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter. Net interest margins rose 4 basis points to 1.77% as loan yields increased. Loan and deposit growth remained healthy during the quarter rising 3% and 4% respectively excluding currency effects.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income also reached a record, rising 31% from the previous quarter to S$820 million. Fee income rose 19% to S$406 million as contributions from a wide range of activities increased. Higher customer flows for treasury products and better market conditions resulted in a doubling of trading income to S$292 million. The increases in fee and trading income were partially offset by lower investment gains. Expenses of S$898 million were little changed from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The cost-to-income ratio was at 42%. Asset quality remained healthy, specific allowances for loans were 9 basis points of loan similar to recent quarters. We took S$85 million of general allowances in line with a prudent provisioning policy. ROE rose to 12.8% from 11.0% in 2011.</p>
          <p>Net interest income continued its quarterly up trend, reaching a record S$1.34 billion. The increase in net interest income in 2011 have been due to strong loan and deposit volume growth. This helped to offset margin pressures from soft interest rates in Singapore and higher deposit costs in Hong Kong. In the first quarter of 2012, loan growth moderated while we recovered part of the margin erosion in 2011 as loan yields improved and deposit costs stable. While some interest margin headwinds remain, margins are likely stabilize in the current range over the coming quarters. Loan growth is expected to moderate to the low teens this year.</p>
          <p>Excluding currency effects, underlying loans grew 3% or S$6.7 billion and deposits by 4% or S$9.6 billion during the quarter. This was in line with market trends. Based on February industry data, we maintained our Singapore DBU plus ACU loan market share which was unchanged from December 2011 at 15.7% while our deposit market share rose from 18.3% to 18.7%.</p>
          <p>In Honk Kong, our loan market share eased slightly from 5.0% to 4.9% while deposit market share increased from 3.0% to 3.3%. Our loan growth during the quarter was led by Sing dollar corporate and housing loans. Constant currency U.S. dollar loans grew 4%, while Hong Kong dollar loans contracted 2%. Half of the constant currency growth in total loans were from trade.</p>
          <p>The increase in deposits was led by U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollar and Sing dollar deposits. This reflects our ability to garner deposits not only in Sing dollars but also U.S. dollars as we diversify into sources such as Western MNCs.</p>
          <p>Our loan-to-deposit ratio remained healthy as it moderated to 85%. The non-Sing dollar LDR eased to 113% from 116% in the previous quarter from strong U.S. and Hong Kong dollar deposit growth. The Sing dollar LDR rose one percentage point to 65%, reflecting a greater utilization of our Sing dollar deposits.</p>
          <p>In addition, our liquidity position was boosted by issuances in the wholesale market. We raised a net US$3 billion in medium term note and commercial paper funding during the quarter bringing our total outstanding wholesale net funding to S$11 billion. Our strong liquidity position and strengthened funding capabilities will enable us to comfortably fund loan growth in Sing dollars, U.S. dollars and other currencies in the coming year.</p>
          <p>This quarter's non-interest income of S$820 million was also a new high as fee and trading income increased from higher customer activities. Fee income rose 19% from the previous quarter to S$406 million. Gross management fees grew 39% of our investments in the business unit results. Contributions from loan activities, stock broking and trade and remittances were also higher. This quarter's fee income was the second highest on record after first quarter 2011, which had included substantial investment banking fees of S$45 million from a large IPO. Adjusting for this, fee income would be a record this quarter. Other non-interest income rose 46% to S$414 million, with most of the increase accounted for by higher costumer income for treasury products.</p>
          <p>Customer income for treasury products rose to S$256 million, up 71% from the previous quarter and 14% from a year ago, as we expand the treasury cross-selling to corporate and retail customers. This quarter's customer income for treasury products was also at a new high.</p>
          <p>Expenses were little changed from the previous quarter at S$898 million. An increase of staff cost in line with higher income was offset by lower computerization and general expenses. The cost-to-income ratio of 42% was similar to the 43% for full year 2011.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong recorded earnings of S$190 million, up 48% from the previous quarter in constant currency terms. Non-interest income increased while expenses and allowances fell. Net interest income was stable at S$209 million from the previous quarter. Loans were little changed. Deposits rose 7% with growth in U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar deposits. Interest margins were stable at 1.34% as higher loan yields were offset by increased deposit costs.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income rose 19% in local currency terms to S$176 million. This came from higher customer flows for CNH treasury products. Investment gains were also higher. Expenses fell 14% in constant currency terms to S$155 million as staff, computerization and general costs declined. Allowances also fell as both specific allowances and general allowances declined. Asset quality was healthy with the NPL rate remaining unchanged from the previous quarter at 0.8%.</p>
          <p>Asset quality for the group continued to be healthy. Non-performing assets were little changed from the previous quarter at S$2.9 billion with 37% of NPA still current in interest and principal. The NPL rate of 1.3% was unchanged from the previous two quarters. Allowance coverage improved further rising to 128% and to 172% if collateral was included.</p>
          <p>Our AFS investment portfolio rose S$3 billion from the previous quarter to S$35 billion as we deployed some of the additional liquidity we gathered during the quarter. Of the increase, S$2 billion was deployed in other government securities including U.S. treasuries.</p>
          <p>European government and bank debt amounted to S$2.3 billion or 0.7% of assets with most of the holdings in AAA-rated government or supranational entities. The total AFS portfolio had unrealized gains of S$447 million at end March 2012, compared to S$411 million at end 2011.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains strong. The core Tier 1 ratio with phase-in deductions of 12.7%, Tier 1 ratio of 12.7% and total capital adequacy ratio of 16.4% are comfortably above regulatory requirements. Compared to the previous quarter, the Tier 1 ratios are slightly lower because of an increase in credit and market risk-weighted assets. The Tier 2 ratio rose from 2.9% in the previous quarter to 3.7% due to an issue of S$1.9 billion of subordinated debt during the quarter.</p>
          <p>This sub debt issue is intended to replace existing Tier 2 instruments callable in May this year subject to regulatory approval. This quarter's record performance was underpinned by sustained momentum across all businesses, which drove total income to a new high both a result of the investments made over the past two years and our focused execution of strategy. With a strong balance sheet, we have the capital, liquidity and risk appetite to support customers' financing needs.</p>
          <p>Our strengthened regional franchise remains well-positioned to capture opportunities across the region in the coming year. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks, Sok Hui. I thought I would do a couple of things. One, maybe reflect a little bit on some of the more important driver of our financial performance including comments on liquidity and asset profile. And then I thought what I'd do is take a little bit of time and walk through the nine priorities we had laid out. Actually, we laid out the nine priorities in the first quarter of 2010. And so it's exactly two years since we spelled them out. And it's probably not a bad time to reflect on how we've done against those priorities and where we are at this point in time.</p>
          <p>So slide, please. So you can see from the first slide, I just thought I'd mention this, it's quite clear that our income growth has been sustained. It's consistent and we're going up quarter-by-quarter. It's 26% up from the first quarter of 2010 which will give you some 12%, 13% CAGR in the markets that we faced over the last couple of years. I'm actually very pleased with their performance. I'm frankly, even more pleased with the sustainability of the performance, it's just very consistent. And we're beginning to work at what we call a clearly higher plane from where we were a couple of years ago. It's obviously gratifying that every line this quarter was a record high, non-interest income, interest income, total income, everything was a record high for us, so as net profit at S$933 million was also record high for us. It's 16% up year-on-year, 28% over the previous quarter as Sok Hui pointed out. And finally, ROE at 12.8%, I'm actually very pleased. I mean that's really being able to deliver substantially better than our cost of capital. So that's something which is quite gratifying.</p>
          <p>So some of the reflection drivers, on loan volumes, as you can see loans on a currency adjusted basis grew 3%, call it 12,%, 13% annualized, and that's consistent with what we indicated end last year, that loans would come off from the breakneck growth that we've seen in 2011. It's consistent with the indications that we gave that's where we think our loans are. They reflect two things obviously, a, the agenda is slowing down in Asia at the margin; and second, obviously, some of the one-timers from China related trade finance loans were not going to continue as China eases up.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there are two or three extremely positive stories behind the loan growth, the first is our loan pipelines continue to be very healthy. We continue to see robust loan business and to be able to grow in the low-teens is something that we think is quite doable given the pipelines we have and the nature of business we're seeing around the region.</p>
          <p>Second, our trade loan, the China-related trade loans are proving to be quite sticky. So as the loans come over for a rollover, it's not as if they're all running off which would cause you to figure that the loans booked last year might run off. We're being able to replace a significant amount of these loans. So on an annualized basis, our trade finance portfolio is still continuing to grow notwithstanding the run-off.</p>
          <p>And third, in the market actually what happened in the quarter is a lot of corporate shifted from bank financing to capital market financing. And we were unfortunately able to position ourselves well for that shift. We had extremely strong fixed income performance in this quarter. We have 45% market share of all fixed income issued out of Singapore in this quarter. So while the loan shift to fixed income is happening, we are right in the middle of that so it's actually a fairly good news from our standpoint.</p>
          <p>From a NIM standpoint, you can see the NIMs have crept up to 177 basis points. I told our folks earlier that we started taking advantage of the re-pricing opportunity in the third quarter of last year, and we're able to start pricing up. It didn't show up entirely in our quarterly numbers because it was at the fag end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>But the results from the re-pricing have been able to trickle through into this quarter's performance. Now, clearly NIM, going forward, is a function of market conditions and where we are. I don't think we have continued pricing power at this point in time, unless Europe really tanks. And if that happens then you have a liquidity event then maybe we might get renewed pricing power.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I don't foresee any substantial headwinds which will cause our NIM to deteriorate substantially from where it is right now. So I think at this level of NIM, we have reasonably good stab at being able to hold it stable. On fees, I'm actually quite pleased I think a quarter or two ago I've indicated that we were somewhat disappointed with the momentum we had in our fee income lines. That has changed over the last few months. This is the highest ever fee income quarter, we're up 19% quarter-on-quarter. And while we look like we're 2% down on the year, in the R&amp;D if we adjust for that one large IPO that Sok Hui referred to, we are up about 8% or 9% on the year and this is broad-based fee growth. We are getting fee growth in wealth. We're getting fee growth in trade and remittances. We're getting fee growth in our card business. And so these are sustainable annuity kind of fee growth, which is coming through now, so quite pleased with that as well.</p>
          <p>And finally, trading income, doubled over the previous quarter. It's obviously a function of a, favorable market conditions and like all of the big houses in the world, we obviously benefited from that on our trading portfolios. But the more interesting part of it to me is the customer part of that activity. It's just continuing to chug along way nicely. So our total customer flows of treasury products also hit a new high for this quarter and that's very sustained. We'll show you some graphs on that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Moving on to a couple of other things, I should comment on liquidity. Our liquidity position stays very robust. Our deposit gathering capability remained strong. If you remember, I indicated last quarter that in the past, we had been raising S$13 billion, S$15 billion of deposits every year. In 2011, we've more than doubled. We grew S$32 billion in deposits.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, we continue to run at a rate of north of S$30 billion in deposit gathering. In fact, if you currency adjust, we raised deposits over S$9 billion in this quarter, so that would be north of S$35 billion, S$36 billion annualized. And the growth is coming from diverse form. We're getting Sing dollar growth, we're getting U.S. dollar growth, we're getting Hong Kong dollar growth. It's coming mostly in the transaction banking and cash management business, but it's also coming in nicely from the wealth franchise. So it's a very broad-based deposit growing capability and so I'm quite pleased with that.</p>
          <p>As Sok Hui pointed out, we further supplemented that with some wholesale issuances in this quarter. And so where we stand in the course of the quarter we build roughly another US$10 billion liquidity surplus and we already had some surplus liquidity at the end of the last quarter. So we're now actually quite flush, and frankly we flushed &#x2013; so this is actually proving to be a headwind in terms of impacting our NIM. If we hadn't build the extra liquidity, our NIMs would probably have been another couple of basis points stronger than they are. Given the uncertainties still out of Europe, I'd rather stay liquid, so I'm quite happy to bear that incremental cost as the price for staying liquid. Our group LDR as you can see therefore the non-Sing dollar LDR continues to improve, it's down to 113%. Our overall LDR at the bank at 85% is quite healthy.</p>
          <p>On asset quality, again, we're seeing no headwinds notwithstanding concerns that analysts have about Asia and huge amounts of problems in Asia, we're not seeing them. We've stress-tested our portfolio across the border, as I said repeatedly, our non-performing assets are unchanged from the previous quarter. Our NPL rate is stable at 1.3%. As you know, in our non-performing we are very conservative, 37% of our assets we classify as non-performing when actually they haven't defaulted on interest or principal, so technically we would classify them as performing.</p>
          <p>And we took the opportunity in this quarter to further build up our results. Our provisioning policy is continuing to be very prudent. Our cumulative and general provisions are well in excess of 1% to 1.2%, frankly. Our allowance coverage is at 128%, 172% if including collateral.</p>
          <p>So, A, we're not seeing any headwinds; and B, even if some expected headwinds do pop out, we're just more than adequately provisioned and reserved to deal with any of them. So that's just a few comments on the financials and the numbers that we spoke of.</p>
          <p>Let me talk you through the nine priorities that we laid out exactly two years ago and tell you at the end of two years where we are and how we are doing against those, and I'll take you through all three sets, the geography priorities, the business line priorities and then the enabling priorities, if you will.</p>
          <p>So the first one, in Singapore, if you look at your total Singapore performance over this period of time, I think has been stellar. I reflected two years ago that we've been losing in Singapore for most of the decade. Well, it's quite clear to us that in the last two years, we have clearly turned that around.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter income is up 15% from year ago. It's up 14% quarter-on-quarter. And if you look at the underlying, that shows up in both our institutional side of our business as well as in the consumer side of our business. The institution side, now these are MIS numbers, so these are the way I look at the management books, but they're not very far-off from what we report.</p>
          <p>Our institutional business is up 20% year-on-year. And interestingly it's now powered by the SME business. Our SME business grew at 23%, the large corporate grew at 18%, and so the SME focus is beginning to yield tremendous dividends to us as we're quite clearly outperforming the market all around.</p>
          <p>Our focus on cross-sell over these couple of years have been helping. Our cross-sell fee income grew 17% year-on-year and we've obviously continued to lead the market &#x2013; top the league tables on almost every capital market activity. Like I told you, this year, the big deal is the bond business. We've done 25 issuances at 45% market share, total issuance of over S$5 million as you know in the market this year. So whether the SME part of the institutional franchise, or the large corporate capital markets part, I think we've done extremely well over this period of time.</p>
          <p>On a product line business, our transaction banking business has been up 39% for the year. Our treasury business customer flows is up 38% for the year and so on. So it is broadly defined.</p>
          <p>If we look at the consumer business over the same period, again, MIS data, we are up 32% year-on-year. And we are showing traction in both segments of the consumer space, both the wealth segment as well as the mass retail segment. As you can see from this, the wealth segment has grown 58% from first quarter to first quarter. The mass retail segment has grown 26% in that same period of time.</p>
          <p>But overall, plus, minus 30% growth in the consumer franchise in Singapore quite clearly demonstrates market share. And that has what has been happening. We've begun to gain market share across all of the segments in which we are operating. I've mentioned before and I do want to take the opportunity to mention again that our branch operating model where we're using our distribution points across Singapore as sales offices or to generate &#x2013; originate sales income, that's really kicking in very nicely. It's providing very robust growth.</p>
          <p>So if you look at all the products we're now selling through the branches, if you take mortgages, in the first quarter 74% of our RMs in the branches sold a mortgage, at least one mortgage. That number was 40% a year ago and 20% two years ago. Our investment, insurance and treasury sales across each of our branches is up 33% quarter-on-quarter but 10% for the year.</p>
          <p>And the three segments in the mass market that we've chosen to focus on, we call them client well established, family-focused, whatever, but each of those segments is growing in the high 20%s, 22%, 27%, 29%. So quite clearly, the focus on leveraging the branch system on the back of improved service and sales is paying off and the focus on the wealth segment is paying off. So I feel quite good about having achieved what we set out to achieve in Singapore to a large measure which is turnaround shift which was obviously a losing share to a situation we are now clearly gaining share all around.</p>
          <p>Our second priority from a geography standpoint for me was Hong Kong. Obviously, we really needed to think about how we leveraged the Hong Kong business we bought 10 years ago. And again, I mentioned this before, when we bought Dao Heng, our whole thirst was we should use Dao Heng to build out China. We weren't successful in doing that for most of the last decade. But as this data will show you, I believe we've been very successful in doing that now in the last two years. We've completely reoriented our business in Hong Kong to anchor the growth of China.</p>
          <p>And if you can see from this data, this is again MIS data, so it's not this thing, but it is again quite close to reported data. We have grown 45% between the average of last year to first quarter this year, our renminbi business in Hong Kong. So the total renminbi business we now have in Hong Kong is 24% of our Hong Kong business, right? So if you'll think about it is today one-fourth of our Hong Kong business is really China and that's what we set out to do two years ago. It was 17% last year, it was 0% two years ago. So in two years, we switched the Hong Kong franchise to being a purely Hong Kong-centric franchise to being now one-fourth of China anchoring franchise.</p>
          <p>And the way we're headed, we see this continuing to go. And so this old agenda <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:55) for Dao Heng of 10 years ago which is we will use Hong Kong to grow China, we're beginning to make it happen. If you look at the numbers below, they're obviously impressive numbers. Our renminbi loan volume while in Hong Kong is up 27 times in these two years, our deposit volume is up 10 times, our corporate deposit account base is more than 5,000 accounts. Now obviously, these are small basis, so the multiples are disingenuous in fact. But the point I want to make is that our agenda of switching and reorienting the Hong Kong business that's clearly coming through.</p>
          <p>The other thing we've been able to do in Hong Kong, which again we spoke about, is see how we can build a niche capital markets capability. And so we focused the efforts on doing the midcap business out of China and then this opportunistic we found there is an agenda to drive the Singapore capital market into Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>But on the back of that, we've actually build up very sweet niche capital markets business. We did four Sing dollar bond issuances, to date; we did nine all of last year. We did six dollar bond issuances to date, we did three last year. We did two CNH issuances, we did nine last year. We did one Hong Kong dollar convertible bond this year. So if you look this, 13, 14, 15 trades in the first quarter, that's a nice niche position for us in the Hong Kong market. So that's second thing we said we'd do in the Hong Kong institutional space.</p>
          <p>And in the Hong Kong consumer space, it's quite clear we're beginning to make progress with a refocused affluent strategy. Our total consumer income was up 15% year-on-year. We've, in the course of the quarter, we scaled down some branches, we've got a couple of more to go, we've begun renovating and relocating the branches to serve the affluent strategy and the affluent footprint and the numbers are beginning to come in, right? So we feel quite pleased about that as well. So, all together, I'm quite upbeat frankly about how we've been able to reposition the Hong Kong franchise over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Our third geographic priority was the other four countries, the other four markets. And we said we really need to rebalance the mix of our earnings by generating more from what we thought were high growth &#x2013; well, China, India and Indonesia, high growth, Taiwan, because of our acquisition was an opportunity to build out.</p>
          <p>And again, as you can see from the numbers over here, these markets grew 35% in the first quarter compared to year ago. They grew 18% for the quarter and each of our markets is growing. So Indonesia is growing 33%, Taiwan 17%, that's actually excluding some one-timers in the first quarter 2011, but China, India are still growing in the 50% range. And if you look at the little boxes below, the growth is broad based. Our loans are growing, our deposits are growing, our cross-sell fee income is growing, our distribution points are growing. We opened our Chongqing branch in China in this quarter, so we're up to 25 outlets. So it's broad based, robust customer franchise growth, and this continues to increase the relative weight that we get from these markets in our overall income mix. So again, this part of our strategic priority agenda has been coming through quite consistently.</p>
          <p>If you go to our business line priorities, so we said we'd build SME, we'd build wealth, we do GTS and treasury and markets. And if you look at these charts in each of the business lines, the SME business, as I told you before that our SME business was a slow start-up. So you can see till the fourth quarter of 2010, we didn't see that much traction. But since then in the last four or five quarters, you can see the momentum beginning to come through. And compared to first quarter of 2010, this business is up 29%, frankly it's up 30% year-on-year, 19% quarter-on-quarter. Our loans are growing, deposits are growing.</p>
          <p>One of the good things about the business is that a substantial portion of the business is now coming from outside Hong Kong, Singapore. Remember SME, the Hong Kong business of the Dao Heng franchise, Singapore we've been growing, but we're now being able to push the businesses outside Singapore and Hong Kong. So in the first quarter, Taiwan grew 64%, India grew 35%, Indonesia grew 41%. So we're beginning to leverage our regional SME platform in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p>On the next slide of wealth, now on wealth, I indicated to you the traction started showing up much earlier. So if you can see, after the middle of 2010, from the third quarter of 2010 onwards, this has been a consistent one-way story. It's going extremely nicely and over the two-year period, first quarter 2010 to now, the business is up 66%, right? So going certainly well north of 30% every year. Between last year and this year, it grew 44%, quarter-on-quarter it grew 20%. And it is broad based. The private bank component of the business is growing, the treasurer's private client of the &#x2013; component, actually, is growing fastest, the new segment we launched, that is going gangbusters and the treasurer's component is going as well. And our earnings asset base down there which includes deposits, AU and the loans continues to grow. It's up 18%, up for the year.</p>
          <p>I'm particularly pleased about the treasurer's private client, the new segment we launched. We are doing extremely well in that segment and I'm also pleased that unlike the market, our wealth business is getting to be extremely profitable. Our cost income ratio in this business overall are running around the 70% range. The market is running in the high-90%s. So I'm just very pleased that the model we've created for wealth looks to be the right model, it's profitable and it's growing both.</p>
          <p>If you look at the GTS business, that is the third region of business, the traction there started showing eight quarters ago. And if you look at this, we've been chugging along every quarter and moving up every quarter for the last eight, nine quarters. In fact, the business today is more than twice what it was in the first quarter of 2010. And that's true for the cash business and it's true for the trade business. It is up 67% year-on-year, which is impressive. You can see it in the underlying driver numbers as well, deposits have grown, loan &#x2013; the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:53) loan growth obviously were very strong but deposit growth was also extremely strong.</p>
          <p>And again it is very broad based. The cash income is growing in Taiwan, in India, in Indonesia, in Hong Kong. Markets outside Singapore and Hong Kong today account for 33% of our total GTS franchise. It's again the markets are contributing and kicking them very nicely. So you feel very good. This is very sustained annuity business, it is relatively low-risk business, it's business which is high returns business and it's just beginning to come in nicely quarter-by-quarter every quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally if you look at the fourth thing we said we'll focus on from a regional standpoint which is the customer part of the treasury activity, slide please, next. So you can see this too is up about twice from the first quarter of 2010, right? In the first quarter of 2010, <mark type="ph" /> 125 (31:39), a slightly low quarter, but directionally you can see that. This is a little more choppy because the fourth quarter of every year, customers trade a lot less. And since customers do less coverage, you can see the dips in the fourth quarters. But if you were to draw the trend line across the quarters, you can see that this business is also growing in a very sustained way.</p>
          <p>This is very good business. This again tends to be a very high return business. It is sticky, customer engaged and customer-related business. And by the way, as you do more and more customer business on the side, it improves your ability to do trading business because you're right in the middle of the largest flows in the market.</p>
          <p>This is by the way also coming both from the corporate cross-sell as well as from the consumer retail cross-sell, right, well cross-sell. So again &#x2013; so if you look at all our business lines, which we've said we would build a regional business platform, SME, wealth, transaction banking and the treasury thing, every one of those, you can see every quarter, it's chugging along very nicely.</p>
          <p>Finally, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:37). We've said looking and doing &#x2013; being more customer-focused was an important agenda and we've done a lot of things. But I think this graph probably says the best. This is the SMU index of customer service which SMU puts out. And the rest of the lines up there are our competitors and different banks. These are all &#x2013; we didn't want to put the names up obviously. They're all real banks; you can go check the data.</p>
          <p>And the DBS POSB was the bottom performing bank in Singapore for several years. We're really very chuffed and the fact that we're not only the number one performing bank in Singapore for the last year, we're number one by a mile and we're number one notwithstanding obviously some unfortunate newspaper headlines that we stumbled into through the course of the period. So we're very pleased with this performance. This comes on the back of a lot of hard work. We've run 130 service improvement projects since 2010, broad based. We launched this service culture program <mark type="ph" /> RED, so it's (33:39) respectfully the dependable program. We have trained over 4,000 people in that period of time. We focus hard on our distribution like the SingPost tie-up, et cetera. So there are a lot of different things we did to be able to get this customer engagement kicking.</p>
          <p>Slide, in terms of what we wanted to do with our management processes, our people and our culture, I told you several times that we weren't really running a regional bank, we wanted to run a regional management construct and framework and above a solid team. We now have got a very stable management team. My one-down team and frankly my two-down team is solid, it's stable, we have almost no holes in our system. We had a leadership conference in February. We brought in 250 of our entire two-down team into Singapore, spent three days. It's an energized team and frankly, the collective performance of this team is what is delivering results.</p>
          <p>We spent time aligning our management policies and processes across the region, so today I feel very comfortable. We're not 100% there, but we've made substantial progress towards running a fairly standardized set of policies and processes around the system, around the bank. We created a balanced co-card approach with a regional management framework, with a matrix management model, with a customer-centric management model, all of that is kicking in nicely. People have got comfortable with those models, people operate to those new KPIs and this new paradigms.</p>
          <p>We created a corporate treasury function under <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:59) a couple of years ago. The corporate trading function has been a blessing, a boon. It functions really well and make sure that from capital, from funding, from liquidity, we're just doing a very top knot job frankly even though I'd say it myself.</p>
          <p>And the last slide on technology, we have got the bulk of our infrastructure residency projects behind us. So in terms of standby, active, active data centers, we have to do some more tweaking in our data centers in Hong Kong and Singapore this year. But the bulk of our infrastructure residency is behind us. We rolled out a core &#x2013; standardized core banking platform across 12 markets with far more standardization and application suite &#x2013; the core application suite.</p>
          <p>We've also rolled out several key applications, but many of them are really going to kick in this year, including Internet banking. We did the beta launch in North Asia two months ago, we're going to do the beta launch for South Asia in May or June, and then we should be able to really go gangbusters with this in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And we've got a good innovation agenda in place. We were ranked the fourth best mobile phone banking application suite in the world last year. Our data analytics platform, data mining and data warehousing is also working extremely well, increasingly a large part of our business growth in the consumer retail branches, in the wealth space and now even in the SME space is being analytics driven and fed out through data this thing. So again I feel good about the technology improvements as well.</p>
          <p>So in summary, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:27) said how do you do this? The fact is this is nine quarters and if you look at the data, it's quite compelling. We've got nine quarters of very sustained performance and very sustained growth. It's underpinned by a strategic vision that we do out, strategic clarity which pervades through our entire business. And I think it reflects disciplined execution; our ability to be more than just talks and promises, we've been able to execute and to deliver.</p>
          <p>We've invested in some new engines of growth which are delivering. So GTS was a new engine of growth for the bank that's delivering, wealth is delivering, SME is beginning to deliver. Even geographies; the investments we've put into China and India are particularly up being of extremely well. We clearly started reaping the initial benefits of most of the work we've done over the last couple of years and so I call it &#x2013; we're operating at a higher plane from where we were a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p>But the truth is we still have a long runway. We have just a lot more opportunity because many of the things that we're beginning to see the results of. The opportunity is huge and given the traction, we have we think that our ability to realize our full potential to fully realize all the potential out there is still out there ahead of us.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to stop there. And we have sometime I think for some questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to say <mark type="ph" /> Gula (38:19) all questions on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:22) we really I have nothing new to really tell you but you can try anyway.</p>

          <p>All right. So how confident are you of getting regulatory approval for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:29).</p>

          <p>I have nothing more to add to what I have said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, of course, there was a reaction from your shareholders. So what did you tell &#x2013; I wasn't there. So what did you tell them to sort of bring them up down &#x2013; up &#x2013; bring them on to your side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the shareholder AGM Meeting, I think there were two or three shareholders who voiced concerns out of a room of 400 shareholders. So frankly, I suggest the media should look at its reporting on this matter. Certainly, the local language press captured it a lot more accurately than some of the rest of the media.</p>
          <p>The three &#x2013; two or three people who raised their voices were concerned about whether the price was appropriate and whether they were being diluted. I think there was lack of understanding on the concept of dilution, right? And so I explained &#x2013; we explained to people. At the end of the day, you should be concerned about do you get lower earnings for every share that you own. That's what dilution is, EPS dilution. And there is dilution for a couple of years, but I think the real thing which Chairman took pains to express is this is a fantastic opportunity for growth. It's a growth market. It's a huge opportunity for growth and as you think over the next five, 10 years being able to avail of this opportunity and to change the nature of DBS to be more actively engaged in growth market is a good thing for our shareholders. But in the medium term, they will make a lot more money. The bank will do a lot better. The bank will be in the largest growth opportunity and that is what they needed to think about and reflect on. And point of fact, I think the vast majority of the shareholders made quite clear that they understood and appreciated that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="ph" /> Gula (41:08) if I could just add to that. I think out of the entire auditorium of &#x2013; with respect to shareholders, perhaps maybe no more than five actually had some questions and in particular one was a bit more vocal. So just to put things in perspective, yeah. Next question please? <mark type="ph" /> Sam (40:38)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a math question to begin with, where does this earning, where does this result put DBS' non-Singapore revenue, if you have it at hand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>59%, if I remember. The Singapore is 59%; non-Singapore is 41%, if I remember right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question on U.S. dollar loans. Some plateau-ing there just from previous quarter if I'm not wrong. How do you see this space going or this particular sector of the market given that it has been a key driver of loans in the past three &#x2013; two to three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah <mark type="ph" /> Sam (41:13) this is what I mentioned in my speech. This is consistent with what we'd flagged last year, that we saw loan growth coming down to low double digits. And we think low double-digit loan growth is pretty much what we expect to see for the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>If you remember last year, we grew loans at 28%, right? And so clearly, from 28%, it was driven by &#x2013; the last year's loan growth was half the China trade finance, half of the China trade finance. And we had all indicated that the China trade financing would not continue to grow at that pace. It could not. But &#x2013; so low double digits is what I think we should be able to get.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then just given that you don't think this China loan &#x2013; trade story &#x2013; loan story will continue, where do you see that growth now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is broad based. We are continuing to see growth across all of our markets, including China by the way. So it's not that we're not seeing &#x2013; we've &#x2013; we had trade finance loan growth from China in the first quarter, so it's not that it's stopped. It's just not growing at the same pace that it was growing last year.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin Lim from Reuters. Okay, first apologies. I &#x2013; after the story went out, I think I should have said &#x2013; analysts thought the price was fair. But anyway, going forward, clearly, MAS Data loans growth in the Singapore market has &#x2013; sort of remains very strong on a year-on-year basis. So I'm just wondering if you can explain say the nearly 30% year-on-year growth for January and February as reported by the MAS Data for Singapore banks versus say your forecast of low-teens. Can you like just explain the differential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I'm not sure I recognized that people send loan growth number. The DBU issue data that we look at and compare against, grew pretty much &#x2013; as Sok has said, our market share is flat, it's 15.7%. So we think the market grew exactly the same rate that we grew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe offline we can check out and compare data.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:26). I have a question on the corporate finance trends that you mentioned. There was a shift from the bank financing to the bond financing. Do you see this &#x2013; where do see the outlook of this trend? Do you think it's going to continue? And if so, what's your strategy to keep your high market share of 45%?</p>
          <p>And if I may, one more question about CNH. It seems that you're working in banks, bridge banks are quite putting &#x2013; focusing on this market. Where do you see the competition? Singapore wants to be the CNH hub after Hong Kong, but what do you see the competition right there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Right. So we continue to see interest in corporates looking at Singapore as a funding base in the fixed income markets. So there continues to be a lot of interest because the Singapore &#x2013; Sing dollar has proven, has got both the liquidity, depth and pricing works on solved basis. So we continue to have a fairly active pipeline. As you know, <mark type="ph" /> perps (44:35) have been very popular, and we continue to see a fairly active pipeline for that business.</p>
          <p>Quite clearly, we are competitively advantaged in that space, because of our ability to distribute into the individual, private and retail network. So nobody else has the distribution power that we do on the individual site. And some of the issuances are dramatic. If you look at the last Genting issue, the S$500 million issue, we &#x2013; it was a pure retail issue. We just distributed entirely in the retail space. That tells you how much demand there is for these products in the retail space given the interest rate environment obviously. But people get nothing on the deposits so they're quite happy to put money into some other stuff. So yeah, I think we have some fairly good capacity to retain market share in the business. So pipeline is good and I think we'll retain share.</p>
          <p>On the CNH, I've said this point before, so let me say that again, I don't believe the way to think about the CNH market is in competitive frames. The right question to ask therefore, do you ever ask and say so who's big in the dollar market. And is Singapore doing more in the dollar market than London or than Tokyo I mean you do, but it's not really the right question. The reasons that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:48) have report and the London data is obviously interesting and it interested me as well. But you've got to remember the European trade with China is S$700 billion, none-Hong Kong Asian trade with China is S$350 billion.</p>
          <p>So just the size of the European-China trade corridor is double the size of the Asia-China trade corridor, right? And if people start converting to renminbi as a currency for trade, then you would expect that to at some point in time also be double the renminbi this thing that Asia has. Now we normally expect the Asian conversion to renminbi be quicker than Europe, because it expect Asians to be more comfortable dealing in renminbi than the Europeans would be.</p>
          <p>So to me, the interesting part of the story was really that almost 7% of trade floors from Europe into China are now being denominated in renminbi, and that's caught up with the Asian number. So my basic premise was that Asia would convert much faster and therefore, I've been arguing that Asia would create a renminbi trading block much quicker than the rest of the world. It just seems to me that maybe the rest of the world is also converting as quickly as Asia is converting.</p>

          <p>Hi. I just like to know how is DBS trying to grow the Taiwan business and is the bank looking for other opportunities in Southeast Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Taiwan business has been grown principally leveraging the BoA franchise that we bought. Remember, we got this franchise, it was a non-performing franchise but it did come with a branch network and a customer footprint. And therefore our focus has been how we take the valuable network and customer footprint and drive performance and value out of it. That's the general theme of what we're doing. And that's continuing to pay dividend. As you know Taiwan is a tough market to grow, so our growth rates in Taiwan actually are quite impressive given the competitive frame. But that's because we have this ability to leverage the BoA access that we bought and that's what we are doing. And outside of this thing and as you know we're clearly interested in both Indonesia and Malaysia and you already know our efforts in both directions.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:35). Your SME business is still doing quite well. Can you just elaborate a bit more on what's the expectation for the Singapore business as well as you mentioned that you are trading also outside of Singapore and Hong Kong. And just curious how <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:54) scamming ATM thing affected the expenses or results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah okay. So the SME franchise is doing well. As you know, we've created a regional SME architecture, that's what we spent a year, a year-and-a-half doing &#x2013; Elbert, our Chief Risk Officer is over here, between him and his team and the front office team, we've created an architecture which creates a pretty standardized model for how we identify the customer segments, how we go approach and originate the customers, how we underwrite the customers in an efficient quasi-programmatic way, how we service those customers, how we cross-sell and use data analytics into selling into those customers. We've created a broad regional architecture which is what we rolled out in every market, right?</p>
          <p>And that's been linked to yield results so we are actually seeing some good impact of that in every market in which we're operating. So we feel quite confident that as you go through this year and going forward, we will continue to see the same momentum that we now started seeing in the last couple of quarters so we're actually quite bullish about it. As you know, the SME business does correlate positively <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:08) cycles. And therefore, of course, there's a very protracted slowdown in Asia if things become unexpectedly slow then we will also slow down the business. And so we will be aligned to the macro-economy. But at this point in time, things are looking reasonably comfortable.</p>
          <p>On the ATM thing, again, remember there is no real cost to the ATM. As I told you, we paid S$1million for all the scamming incidents that had happened to all the people and that was in the early part of the year. We haven't had to pay anything out after that.</p>
          <p>We're obviously like everybody spending a lot of money in terms of upgrading the whole process from where we are to the chip-based technology. So we're hoping that by 2014, we will also migrate to chip base that requires two forms of expenditure, one is upgrading our network. We are about 75% done in terms of network upgrades. It's not something we started now by the way, we've been doing for two years. So about 75% of our ATMs and cams are chip-enabled and work with chips. So we've got some way to go there.</p>
          <p>And then the expenditure involved in re-carding the whole card base to give them everybody chip-based cards, right. Again, we made substantial progress. Again, it's not new. We've been doing it now for two years. We've got maybe about 700,000 cards done. But we've got 4 million cards to do. So the rest of that we will continue to do over the next two or three years. So both of these will be expenditures over that period of time. But we've already factored them. And so to me, they're sort of like the usual business expenditures.</p>

          <p>Okay. What were the mortgage applications like in the first quarter of this year compared to fourth quarter of the last year and year-on-year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the mortgages came off quite sharply in January and right after the same mortgage applications came off and then in February they also got impacted by the Chinese New Year rush. But by March, the applications were actually almost pretty much back on track. I think I saw the March data we were only about 5% down from what the normal <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:21) would be. Remember there's a lot of new launches which have been happening in the market and so that's been propelling a lot of mortgage activity in the back of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think this is holding pretty stable so far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, Piyush, early on when you talked about the earnings drag because of the transaction, I think the earnings drag is minimal on EPS right, for the first year. <mark type="ph" /> Do you think so (53:46)? I think someone had a question about...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking about the ROE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right and the EPS impact. Yeah. So just to clarify that, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:58). There is a drag in the first couple of years because of the premium we're paying for the trade. But the drag is actually not consequential work, it is less than 5% the drag for a couple of years and then gets positive uplift assuming we can do what we're saying we are doing of course.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:16) so far, so what is your prognosis for the rest of the year given that we're already four months, are you still confident that &#x2013; actually GDP will probably hit 3% and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Rather than the government 1% (54:34)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the government said 1% to 3%. I said I think we'll be at the high end of the range was my comment. And I still think we'll be probably closer to the high end of the range because as we look around, our SMEs as well as our corporate customers, there is a high degree of resiliency out there. Again if Europe &#x2013; if Spain happens, if Europe tanks, there's another freeze in the global economy you can't say. But barring that I think in my original call, I'm still on track with that. I think Asia will slow down by about 1.5 percentage points, maybe 2, as overall. And my own take is that Singapore will do certainly better than the down &#x2013; the low part of that range, I think we should be closer to the high part of the range.</p>
