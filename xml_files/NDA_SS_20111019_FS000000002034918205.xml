          <p>You are most welcome to Nordea and our presentation of our third quarter report. As usual, the report will be presented by Nordea's Group CEO and President, Christian Clausen. That will be followed by an opportunity to ask a few questions on the report. And after that, we will ask normal split up the group, so that investors and analysts can follow Fredrik Rystedt, Chief Financial Officer, and Ari Kaperi, Chief Risk Officer, down to Nordea's hall and then ask more detailed questions there. Media are invited to stay in this room and ask Christian more questions.</p>
          <p>I think down in Nordea's hall, you will also be accompanied by Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n, Head of IR. And if he's a bit distracted, it's only because he, less than 30 hours ago, became father again for a little Esther. So congratulations, Rodney.</p>
          <p>When you ask questions in this hall, I would very much appreciate if you could state your name and the company or media you represent since this whole presentation is webcasted. If anyone is tweeting on it, the hash tag is NordeaQ3#.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and I hereby hand the floor to Christian Clausen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and I'd like to welcome you all to this presentation of the Q3 report. And the key messages today is that we still show a robust customer business development. Income is up. We get more customers. We do more business with our customers. And the underlying costs are down.</p>
          <p>But of course, the financial turmoil during the quarter has also had impact on our results. Increased volatility, the spreading out and everything made it very difficult to run the trading operation and the balance sheet in general. I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>But we are well prepared to face the New Normal, new regulation, and we are ready to or are actually embarking upon our New Normal plan as we speak. And we think we can increase ROE substantially in the years ahead. I will come back to that as well.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the numbers. And as we can see, net interest income is up reflecting that we are doing more business with our customers. We get a significant inflow of customers again this quarter, more than 30,000. Net fee and commission holds up well. But net fair value result, as you can see, is down, which means that income is down 11% on the quarter. However, still on the year, as you can see, for the first three quarters it's still up by a few percentage points.</p>
          <p>Expenses underlying are down, but we had charge, a restructuring charge, this quarter for our New Normal plan, I will come back to that, which means that the actual profit is somewhat down. Adjusting for the restructuring expense, it's down 22%. But on the year, operating profit holds up well, so the first nine months is in line with the same period last year.</p>
          <p>I think the main effects this quarter, which needs a bit more explanations, are the fair value adjustments, which hit our top line. This has been an extreme quarter in Europe, maybe the most volatile financial quarter we have ever seen. The markets have spreaded out. And this time compared to 2008, its core spreads, it's core government spreads, spreading out.</p>
          <p>We talk a lot about the PIIGS countries, of course they have spreaded out a lot. But if we talk, for example, the spread between Germany and France, it's out significantly. Of course, what spreads out, i.e., the core transactions we do with our customers have also been impacted even though we have no exposure to the PIIGS countries, we have less risk in our books that we had previously. So we are not taking on risk. We had actually, as I said, had lower risk. And this means that the trading conditions have been challenging, which have meant that the income is somewhat lower in this area.</p>
          <p>We have been open for business on all days, even the most volatile ones. So we have helped our customers hedge their positions, big corporates wanting to hedge the interest rate positions, in particular. We have done the transactions. So our customer income is actually up. But however, the positions we get when we do these transactions have been very difficult to hedge. Volatility has been high, it's spreading out, as I said, which means that the income in the backbone has been lower.</p>
          <p>Also, the credit valuation adjustment, which you had to do on a derivatives book, is part of this number, the &#x20AC;115 million. The credit evaluation is the one we do because the contract we do our customers has to be evaluated. And with this extreme spreading out, the customers have owed us more money and we had to make an adjustment for that in the P&amp;L. Even though it's not very big numbers, it has a negative impact on the top line.</p>
          <p>Also, the equity and interest rate positions have had some impact, as we can see, not very big. And then in the Life companies, particular in Denmark, the buffer situation is lower. We still have positive buffers, but we will not take out a shareholder fees this quarter. That is postponed on the so-called shadow accounts for later quarters, which will also mean that our income is down. So all in all, the income is down and then the underlying income from our customer business is up. So this is the main impact from the financial turmoil we see in our result.</p>
          <p>Let's go through the lines and the result, as we see them. Net interest income is up. We do more business with our customers. We get more customers, as I said. We increased our lending somewhat, corporate lending, a little up and household lending somewhat up.</p>
          <p>The net fee and commission income is slightly down, partly seasonal. Q3 is always seasonally low. We also saw that last year. But also, assets under management is obviously down with the drop in the equity markets. But it's holding up quite well and underlying is looking well.</p>
          <p>Net items at fair value, as I already described, is down. The customer business is more or less on the same level, as I said, as previous quarters. The customers have indeed been active hedging their positions and so on. But as I said, the non-allocated income, as we call it, has a negative result this quarter, mainly or a big part of it, as I said, the credit evaluation adjustment on the derivatives book. This evaluation will probably come back in coming quarters when the customers close their contracts.</p>
          <p>Expenses is under good control. Underlying expenses are down this quarter. We take the restructuring charge, as you can see, for the reduction of staff and various other items. The reduction of staff is probably 80% of the restructuring charge, and the rest is mainly due to closure of branches and other areas where we restructure and reduce cost.</p>
          <p>Credit quality is good. Loan losses is somewhat down. The only area we have an increase is Denmark, which is still a difficult market in the small and medium-sized area. We still have some reservations in shipping, though not alarming, and in all other countries we see improving levels.</p>
          <p>And we still see a positive migration, i.e., a healthy credit book. This is the credit migration we show here in Q3 on our corporate book. And we can see that we up-rate more customers than we down-rate. So on average, the credit book is improving. The average risk weight is down. And we have a fairly good development here, pointing into the future with a healthy credit situation.</p>
          <p>Lending portfolio is slightly up. As I said, corporate lending is only slightly up. Corporates are holding back on their activity level right now due to the turmoil. Mortgages, our lending to mortgages, are up slightly.</p>
          <p>The capital position remains strong. Our risk-weighted assets are slightly up, partly due to the growth in lending. We also have the positive rating migration we moved in the other direction. But all in all, a fairly stable development in risk-weighted assets. We still continue to improve our efficiency here in various ways, as I described at our last meeting, which means that the core Tier 1 ratio is unchanged in the quarter at 11%.</p>
          <p>We have introduced the new organization before summer and we now report in these new organization for the first time in our three business areas, the three business areas which sort of conduct the whole value chain within each area. And Retail Banking is showing strong results. Income is up. Loan losses is stable. And we see an operating profit up significantly.</p>
          <p>Retail is still working on changing the branch format. A lot of branches have been transformed into the new format where we have less branches with cash and more branches with advice. And loan losses are unchanged, as you can see.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking is down, mainly due to the fair value adjustments I described in the beginning. But again, the underlying customer trend is solid, although here, loan losses are very small and stable. And also here, a good result.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management is showing a decline. It's mainly due to the life companies not being able to pay the shareholder fee this quarter. We have positive financial buffers in life, as it says, 4.4%. So, actually our life companies is doing better than most others, but when life buffers get close to a minimum, we do not take out shareholder fee, especially the Danish situation where we put it on the shadow account in order to take it out later when the technical result is above the guaranteed level.</p>
          <p>We have quite strong performance in asset management with a 65% of the investment composites overperforming their benchmark in recent three years.</p>
          <p>Let me give a few comments to the New Normal. As we all know, it's been a massive value destruction in the wake of the financial crisis. And this red line is the European banking index, the Stoxx banking index, which shows a decline since 2007 of 65%. If we add in that, the same banks actually raised capital in the period, it's actually &#x2013; actually, the underlying is down 75%; a massive value destruction. Put in Nordea, also, the blue line which, of course, doing much better.</p>
          <p>But all-in-all, it is clear that the big question that we're asked two years ago, "What can we do to avoid new financial crisis hit the economy the way it did?" And the answer is the New Normal, the new regulation. The banks need to hold more capital, more liquidity and more funding, which means that the banks are being transformed into a buffer zone in the economy. The banks should be able to absorb shocks in the economy and still lend money to the real economy, so we avoid severe recessions like the one we saw.</p>
          <p>But, of course, also from the banking sector, it is not nice to see value destruction like this. And, of course, also, the banks need to review their business models. And some business models were tested during this period and didn't do very well. Others did much better.</p>
          <p>This is the market caps of our peer group in Europe. And you can see that Nordea has, in relative terms, moved up significantly, and is today the fifth largest bank in Europe, measured this way on market cap, which just shows that a number of banks have to change their business model to become more robust. Other banks can adjust them. And Nordea is in the league of banks who would need some adjustment, but underlying our business model is a robust one.</p>
          <p>What we are doing in the New Normal plan is actually adjusting to the new levels of capital funding and liquidity that is required. And it is, in essence, a continuation of the journey in our relationship strategy. We embarked upon this journey in 2007 in order to produce more business with our core customers.</p>
          <p>When the crisis hit in 2008, we took a middle-of-the-road approach for the balanced risk and revenue and cost and capital in order to help the customer through the crisis. This has served us extremely well. We have all the way through the crisis been opened for our customers to help them and lend money.</p>
          <p>In 2010, when the financial crisis lifted somewhat, we went through prudent growth, not growth at all costs, but growth in order to help our customers accelerate out of the crisis. And now, in the New Normal and the financial turmoil, which hits us again, it is about securing that we can finance our customers. And this require a higher ROE.</p>
          <p>ROE levels have come down; as you can see from the graph, around 20% in 2007 to a level below 11% right now. And to restore ROE is the way to be able to service our customers. I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>So, we will continue on the relationship strategy, which has served us well and which will also, in the future, be one of the winning business models in banking. And the reason is that the relationship strategy, where we target the other segments of our customers, is a win-win. It's better for the customers and it's also good for the bank. We satisfy customer needs this way. We provide safety and stability. You can count on Nordea being able to serve you. You can count on Nordea giving the right advice, someone who cares for me in these difficult times. We give the full range of advice and we create products with the view of serving to all our customers.</p>
          <p>We also focus on the most attractive customers, which is also very positive for the bank point of view that those are the most profitable customers. They have the highest growth potential going forward, clear growth segments. They are the most satisfied and loyal customers. They are significant more loyal than customers on average. And it's possible to gain high efficiency in the service, because we have the customer meetings. We talked with the customer about all these needs. So, obviously, it's an efficient way to service customers.</p>
          <p>It's also very good for the capital and funding efficiency. We get a balance between capital deployment and funding. You can say we become the mirror of the customer balance sheet, because we get all the customers' assets and liabilities, of course, turned around and the payments and the transactions. So, in essence, our balance sheet becomes a mirror of the economy. And this gives us a high resilience in the business models, which we also have seen during recent years. And it's very low risk.</p>
          <p>We have, during the crisis, seen that we had virtually no loan losses on these segments. We have automated credit scoring. We know the customers extremely well. We're on a very close dialog. If the customer runs into problems, we can help the customers. We know and we are very close to our corporate customers. So we can also there enter in early with help and assistance. And it gives a very strong diversification.</p>
          <p>So, all-in-all, this type of business model building on a relationship strategy is a strong thing and creates a strong relationship with the bank, between the bank and the customer.</p>
          <p>And the New Normal is continuing the relationship strategy, but more focused. We will focus more on being more efficient on the way we use capital for each customer segment and each customer, the way we use liquidity for each customer and each customer segment and the way we use funding. In other words, we have to reengineer our business. We have to create products, which use less of these resources and we are doing that as we speak. But we also have to advise the customers saying to them, "If you really want these products, you should know they draw a lot of capital and liquidity in the bank. So they are quite expensive. But we can solve the problem in another way, which is cheaper, because it requires less capital funding and liquidity."</p>
          <p>This is a focused relationship strategy. We'll focus on each segment and focus on each customer to make it more efficient. And that is in essence what the new regulation requires of banks. We have to be more efficient in the usage of these resources. And this is also creating a sustainable business model, a model that is sustainable in the sense that it attracts funding and liquidity. It builds capital and thereby makes it possible to service the customers. And we believe this relationship strategy will generate a top-league ROE and we have translated this top league, one of the strongest banks in Europe, to 15%.</p>
          <p>We believe this business model in a normalized economic environment would build an ROE around 15%. Of course, in this environment, with interest rates below 1% and no growth, obviously this is not possible. But we are taking actions in the New Normal plan which will substantially increase the ROE. And when interest rates and growth gradually normalize, we believe that we will be at the 15%, and thereby be in the top league of European banks.</p>
          <p>And this is key. I think banks have no choice except increasing the ROE, because if you're not a strong bank, showing that you can actually yourself generate the resources to lend money, i.e. build capital to lend money to customers, it will not be possible to support the customers. So, a strong ROE will also mean that you have low funding costs, you will also have lower capital costs, you will become competitive and it will be possible for you to service your customers.</p>
          <p>A lot of banks out there with a weak ROE will simply not be able to build capital and they cannot service their customers. So, an earnings capacity is the license to have the right rating, the right funding cost and the right competition. And, of course, servicing your customers increase the business momentum, which makes it possible to have a higher ROE. I think this is the only circle that works. And our New Normal plan is actually directed exactly towards this.</p>
          <p>We already have a very strong position. We have our AA rating. We have a good earnings capacity. ROE is close to 11%, but we believe that we can take action to become much more efficient in terms of the new regulation and ensure that we spend as little capital and funding and liquidity as possible in serving our customers' needs.</p>
          <p>We will tell much more about that next week in London, where we have our Capital Markets Day, where I hope to see you. And these nice-looking gentlemen and women will present our plans in much more detail exactly what it is. So, the New Normal plan is not rocket science. It's actually hard work going through every single segments, every single product, reengineering, making it more efficient and thereby gradually improving our efficiency and our performance.</p>
          <p>So, the key messages, again, we have an underlying robust development in the quarter. Our customer business is up, revenues is up and underlying cost is down, but the financial turmoil has some impact and I would say a limited impact on Nordea. This has been an extreme quarter and I'm sure that all banks, also the stronger banks, have found it difficult to maneuver on the balance sheet and the trading book in this quarter. So, this is, to me, a limited impact.</p>
          <p>And we are well prepared. We know exactly what we're doing. We're executing New Normal plan and this will substantially increase ROE. And when things normalize, we think we would be one of the &#x2013; or still be one of the top-league banks in Europe, delivering around the 15% ROE level.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. I think we have time for some questions.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much, Christian. I'm open for questions. We have the usual suspects. Let's start here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Magnus Andersson at ABG. Just some questions on lending margins. You raised your lending rates a couple of times in Denmark since the beginning of July and the last thing you did was announcing a lending rate hike in Norway in the beginning of October here. Can you say something about what kind of NII impact you expect from those hikes and have you done anything on the deposit side, et cetera? Should we expect to start seeing something from this coming through in the first half 2012?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on the cost savings program, staff reduction program, when do you think we will have the full impact in the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are, in general, pursuing this New Normal exercise where we view every segment and every customer in the light of how much capital, funding and liquidity they draw. And the mantra we have is fair pricing. We have to price the customer segments according to the usage of capital and funding and liquidity.</p>
          <p>And this is a new exercise. Not many years ago, liquidity was free of charge. A few years ago, Nordea's short funding was significantly below LIBOR. So we didn't have to price the cost of liquidity. Now we have big liquidity buffers, we have to price that in. So, in general, we're viewing all our pricing both under process and lending. And this will, of course, mean that because of the New Normal biologic, the margins will go up. This will be a ongoing process. I cannot give you a final figure, but it's part of our target, the 15% target, that's a part of it, not a substantial part, but a part of it will come from lending margins.</p>
          <p>The full effect on the costs, we are actually saying that we'll keep the cost unchanged for a long period of time, even though we have to take on a lot of cost from the new regulation and we also have the inflation rate, of course. So, obviously, we are taking down the actual cost level quite considerably. And that will be something we will see the effect of in coming quarters, the coming year and next year. So, I think, flat cost is still what we say is the expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a microphone over there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This normalized macroeconomic environment, can you please describe what that is and what it entails in terms of interest rates, credit spreads, economic growth and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's certainly not what we have right now. Hopefully, this will not be normalized for the coming years. We are not talking about very rapid growth or anything. We mean, just we're returning to some growth rates in the economy. We're not specifying exactly, but a limited growth rate, which, of course, is expected in the coming years in Europe with the all the debt problems and interest rates returning to a normalized level, which could be somewhat between 2% and 4%.</p>
          <p>We're not defining it very precisely, because the plan is not that reliant upon that specific interest rate level, because depending on the rate levels, margins will also develop in various areas. So, you can say we're not having, sort of, a very optimistic view, we're just saying that when this crisis is over, when we find a solution to the very acute debt problems and start to eat into the underlying problems in Europe in general, then we will restore a sort of a normalized picture.</p>
          <p>So, we are not defining it in great detail. We will say a little more about it next week in London and we will show the sensitivity of various changes in interest rates and growth rates and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A wild guess, when might this happen, the normalized markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's up to you to decide what you think. I think it's very difficult to foresee right now. We still believe that we will see a normalization sometime next year, but we cannot be sure and the plan is not reliant upon that. We have a lot of other things we are doing, which will, as we say, substantially increase ROE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andreas H&#xE5;kansson from Exane BNP Paribas. Have two follow-up questions. One, on the return of equity target. The rate is right that now you are focusing on 15%, regardless of where your competitors are or are you still saying that you're going to be best-in-class, because if some of us believe that best-in-class is not going to be 15%, when interest rates are normalizing, that doesn't really help European banks. It can actually be bad news for European banks, but it helps you. Do you believe that you can get there even if top-class European banks are going to be at 12%, 13% in the future? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And second one is on Denmark. We're seeing that the Danish banks are repricing aggressively partly to reflect their much higher funding cost. Your funding cost hasn't been increasing at all as much for obvious reasons. Are you not actually going to be operating with a better margin than your competitors and actually benefiting from the weakness that we see in the Danish banking system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one, no, we are saying the same things that we think that the banking sector in Europe will spread out. There will be some top-league banks with good ratings, low-funding costs and the capability of delivering a high ROE. There will be a group of banks, which are, sort of, in between and then the banks with low rating and high-funding costs will really struggle. And we believe that level will be around 15% for the top-league banks. The average will, of course, be somewhat lower.</p>
          <p>And we still think that's around 15% in a sort of normalized environment as we say. So, we are saying the same things still. Of course, we do not expect to be much above the top-league banks. That is probably not likely, but there will be a few banks in the top league, which will be able to deliver a significant ROE. And we have now a plan, which we will elaborate more next week, which will deliver a substantial increase in ROE. And with just some normalization of the markets, then we think the 15% is clearly within reach.</p>
          <p>As for the funding cost, yes, we have a competitive edge on funding cost and we want to keep that. That's one of the reasons why we have these targets. We want to ensure that we are still a strong bank with a high earnings capacity, which the customers like, of course, because they want a bank that makes money, builds capital and can lend money, that's obvious. So, we have this advantage.</p>
          <p>When we come down to the actual household segments and so on, the difference might not be that big, because most part of the balance sheet is still funded by deposits and banks pay more or less the same interest rate on deposits. Then it's funded by covered bonds and covered bonds banks. There are some differences, but they are very small. So, with only a small part of the balance sheet, which is actually funded by the area of senior unsecured debt where you have a huge difference in funding costs, very, very big as you say.</p>
          <p>And, of course, in those areas, where we use that kind of funding typically for the other segments, the competitive edge becomes big. But for a normal household customer that may not be the biggest difference, but, of course, we hope we will have the competitive power and we have the competitive power and we will, of course, utilize that as best as we can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter Grabe, Handelsbanken. I was wondering if you can give some more details on the positive impacts from cheap refinancing levels in the quarter on the NII. You're saying that the lengthening &#x2013; that the duration of the short-term funding has been lengthened in the quarter. At same time, you're issuing more on the covered bonds. So I assume that you have replaced some of the maturing senior unsecured bonds with covered bonds. And if you can give us some details on the, sort of, what's the impact from the change in funding mix on the NII and also if you can say something on the matched funding period, how that has been affected in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the year, the first nine months of this year, we have increased the maturity of funding in general and that, of course, hits into Q3 as well. So it's not only quarter-for-quarter. So, over the year, as we have stated also in the quarter and also in the last report, we're taking in more long funding and we are way ahead of our plans for funding. So we have raised funding for the full year.</p>
          <p>In the middle of this turmoil, we have actively prolonged all our short-term funding to 9 and 12 and even 18 months. And even all our dollar funding is long into next year. So we did that for precautionary reasons not to be trapped if the markets got even worse. So, we have had full access to all funding markets. And for the quarter, I should say that the impact on our funding cost is roughly unchanged for the quarter, but we have these full-year effects, of course, for building the maturities. And we are still in a situation where the maturity of funding is very close to the behavioral maturity of our assets, which is a very strong position.</p>
          <p>We also have built further our liquidity buffers during the quarter and we have &#x2013; so, our funding and liquidity position is stronger than ever and we stand out very strong. And as I said in my presentation, we have reduced risks in general, both in Q2 and Q3. So we went into Q3 and all this turmoil with a low-risk level. So, the fair value adjustments we see is not because risk-taking, it's actually the opposite. But it's more, because the transaction turnover we've had has been very difficult to maneuver in, in the quarter. I think all banks have faced that.</p>
          <p>And you had one more question or was that it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was regarding the matched funding period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, but that is still around the same levels as previously. I think, it's 3.2 years &#x2013; 3.4 years we have on the asset side. But right now in the middle of turmoil, it's equally important that medium-term funding is very strong. So we're not reliant upon, sort of, week or month or three months funding. We are out there now on 9, 12 and 18 months on the medium-term funding. And the long fund is still long. So that has been the development. Yeah?</p>

          <p>Hi. Christian Hall from Swedbank. I just had a question on loan losses and assumption, taking into account what you're saying as normalized macro environment. We are now at 16 basis points of loan losses and we have quite low loan losses in Sweden, Finland and even reversals in Norway. How do you view loan losses going forward? And how do you factor in that in your outlook of substantial increase in your ROE even in an environment we're seeing right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give any forecast on loan losses, because it's a very difficult thing to do, but we're giving the leading indicator our rating migration. Our rating migration is clearly a leading indicator. When we rate customers up, because they're doing better, then, of course, the risk of loan losses &#x2013; the expected loan loss goes down. So, we expect loan losses to be lower, but this is, of course, super reliant upon the financial turmoil, how much this will spill over to real economy. It hasn't done yet to a large extent. That's our judgment.</p>
          <p>We still think the company is doing well. And we also think households have quite a lot of money in their wallet and being ready to spend it. But they are saving instead right now, because of the uncertainty. So, if this drags on, if there are no solutions to the sovereign debt problems, this may filter into the economy and then it's a new situation. We still expect that solution to be found, maybe even quite soon. And that would gradually stabilize things as we see it. So, the harm to real economy is still limited, and therefore, we expect loan losses to follow the leading indicator trend of improved quality, but no forecast on loan losses. That is not possible.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Fredrik and Ari, please start and then we'll go to the Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodney. Okay, I will start with just one slide with net interest income and the composition of that. This is a little bit more detailed than you've seen in the report. So you can see that there has been slight growth both in the corporate and the household sector. And that volume has basically contributed to &#x20AC;50 million in additional profit in the quarter, as you can see.</p>
          <p>Spending is the majority, &#x20AC;30 million, but we also have some deposit growth in the quarter. The margin has increased on both deposits and lending and as you can see here, about equal contribution to the profit of &#x20AC;14 million in lending and to deposits of &#x20AC;11 million.</p>
          <p>I think there was a question here before relating to Denmark and what was the expectation of it. Just to give you a little bit more quantification of that figure, the actual amount that we're basing those price increases on is approximately &#x20AC;9 billion or so. That's the portfolio we're addressing with our price increases that we had started to execute during the quarter. And the expectation, as an annual number, is approximately &#x20AC;20 million or something in that ballpark.</p>
          <p>So, we have started to do that. We think it will actually play out okay and the expectations remain exactly where they were last time. We also had a little negative in group functions, but a positive contribution. And that was another question during the previous session, how has actually group treasury contributed in terms of NII? And that has actually been positive.</p>
          <p>You have seen from the result that we had negative items at fair value in treasury during the quarter. And, of course, that is partly coming from the interest rates and that's actually, mostly, hedging of the liquidity buffer position. So, we have hedged the interest rate position. But the backside of that coin is the higher interest rate or higher NII from the liquidity buffer in treasury. So, that's why you see this positive number from group treasury. So, it's negative on the items at fair value, but positive on the NII. And that makes up the total of &#x20AC;53 million, as you can see.</p>
          <p>So, with those words, I'll leave you to with Ari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I will just simply go through few issues on the asset quality. So, that you saw that our great loss or credit quality is solid so that, in terms of basis points, we are at the level of 16 if we exclude these Danish guarantee scheming impact, which was now benefiting us in Q3 because we got a little bit more our money back from the Amagerbanken than we had to pay on -because of this Max Bank.</p>
          <p>But as you can see, the credit loss level in I said also in the earlier as I said part of the meeting in Finland, in Sweden, in Norway, it's very low. Actually, we are talking about very low levels. Also that's the case in Baltics and Poland. You may see that there is an increase in terms of basis points, but then again, if you talk about the absolute losses in terms of euros, we are talking about &#x20AC;6 million because those portfolios are relatively small ones.</p>
          <p>So, and then in Wholesale Banking, actually this 9 basis points, that includes even to the shipping. So, that if we take away the shipping from Wholesale Bank and then take a look on corporate merchant banking units, these large corporate, the units, it's a reversal, so that we booked more recoveries from earlier-made provisions than new provisions.</p>
          <p>So then, of course, the shipping is still relatively high level, 76 basis points. Actually, in the background, there is one individual customer, old problem case, a Nordic problem case, where we start to be in the, let's say, final phases of the work out and asset values are coming down. So that also in the shipping actually that the whole lending book as such is developing still relatively well.</p>
          <p>Then in Denmark, as you can see that we came a little bit up from the very low level we entered in Q2 so that you have seen that a little bit negative macro signs in Denmark. And then what is the composition of these 57 basis points now in Q3? It's mainly household lending. We still have this tale of problematic SME corporates where we still have to make new provisions, but then now we see also some needs of increasing our provisions for the household customers.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans, no big issues there; they are more or less stable. These total allowances, you see that actually still, because we are seeing this positive rating migration improvement in our credit quality to collective provisions, they are coming down. But still, in absolute terms, we have roughly &#x20AC;6 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;600 million of those collective provisions.</p>
          <p>Then finally, just showing this risk-weighted asset composition. So, as you saw that we were now up by, in absolute terms, &#x20AC;3 billion in our risk-weighted assets. You can see that that was largely driven by volume increase, so that you see this growth 5.1%; that is the growth in our internal rating base model portfolios.</p>
          <p>And then you see this standardized approach is 2.2%. That is also growth in those lending portfolios. We are in standardized approach. Roughly half of this growth comes from these increased market value of derivatives because they are included, this counterparty credit risk and derivatives in these lending growth figures because that the value of those agreements, customers owe us more money, that went up because the interest rates were down. That is also visible here.</p>
          <p>But then a part of this growth was offset by improvement in credit quality. As you can see, this 1.9%. Also, we are very low levels in terms of market risk. And also we continue to find out ways to improve our risk-weighted asset efficiencies, so that that also contributed.</p>
          <p>So, I think that those were the background slides I wanted to show to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let's start with a question-and-answer session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll start with Mats Anderson followed by Peter Grabe, Hampus, and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mats Anderson, Cheuvreux. Two questions for Fredrik, please. The first one is that you mentioned here that the loan book in Denmark, which is where you've strived to raise prices, is approximately &#x20AC;9 billion or as far as I understand it's 15% of the total Danish lending book. Could you elaborate a little bit on what types of loan that is and basically why you're leaving 85% of the book unaffected?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, if you could, if I may trouble you with taking us through the funding situation again and the impact of what you have done during the quarter. We discussed it a little bit previously here with Christian in the general presentation. But if you can give us some more detail on that, I would appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with the latter first. The funding situation is pretty much where Christian answered. We had an issue of approximately &#x20AC;4.5 billion in the quarter. We've issued so far this year about &#x20AC;28 billion, which is a little bit above the plan we had originally for the year of long-term funding. So, out of those &#x20AC;4.5 billion, &#x20AC;4.1 billion was in covered bonds. So, we have issued quite a significant portion of senior unsecured this year, so &#x20AC;11 billion out of the &#x20AC;28 billion, roughly.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at the quarter, it is actually not so much a replacement of senior unsecured versus covered bonds. In fact, that's not the case. It's just basically maturing covered bonds that we have. And we also prefunded quite a lot in the first quarter, as we have elaborated on. So, yeah, in total, long-term funding has actually been advantageous, or somewhat advantageous, for us in the quarter, roughly about the same, a little better, and basically, because of old credit, high or costly debt actually expiring replaced by cheaper debt. So, in summary, long-term funding is doing quite well for us.</p>
          <p>On the short-term side, what we have actually done is we have extended a little bit the maturity profile of the short-term funding. But actually, not that much because we did that &#x2013; if you recall in the first and second quarter, and predominantly in the second, we did that quite a lot. So, we continued that journey, but really not that much. So, that's one effect, but actually the impact on the funding cost has been rather marginal. However, what we've actually done is that we have borrowed more in the short-term market and less in the overnight market. Basically, our funding gap, as measured on the overnight side, is zero.</p>
          <p>So, we have created at the early part of the quarter actually even bigger resilience towards disturbances on the interbank market. Again, you can question is this good or bad. We think it's actually good because it creates an additional resilience and the cost is very small. So, we are, as Christian alluded to, I think in an extremely good liquidity and resilience position, and I think that's pretty cautious to be <mark type="audio gap" /> (47:59). That's pretty much the summary of it. So, all in all, the funding cost has basically been fairly stable between Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>Then you were talking about the fund &#x2013; or the corporate or the lending book in Denmark, yes, of course, we should address all of it and we are actually doing that. But the announced price increases, as I discussed or as we also talked about in the second quarter, is attributed to this part of the portfolio on the corporate side. So, of course, part of that limitation, you can say, is this is a corporate issue. Then, we're also making other efforts on pretty much all the portfolios.</p>
          <p>We're not doing that just in Denmark. As you have heard, we're doing that in Norway. We've actually done it, as you can see, also in Sweden and it's not restricted to deposit; it is also a lending issue. Of course, we're not helped by significant interest rate increases, but we're trying to actually as far as we are able to interest &#x2013; or to increase the margins on both deposits and lending.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, I think that journey is progressing well. It takes time, but I think there is some good progress pretty much everywhere, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was wondering if you can give us an update on the expected positive impacts when moving the corporate book to advanced IRB foundation and also when you expect this to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me say, first of all, that we'll actually &#x2013; I will not actually give you a number to start with, but we will &#x2013; during the Capital Markets Day, we will try and quantify a span or a range for all the model implications, plus the number of other capital efficiency measures. So, hope you can bear with us until next week. But just from a more general standpoint, we actually still don't know.</p>
          <p>We're engaged into very fruitful discussions with the FSA, so we get a &#x2013; we have a better clue now than we had three or six months ago. But it's still an uncertain issue. So, we're discussing various parameters and various pool compositions or other statistic data, et cetera. So, we'll be able to give you a range in about a week's time.</p>
          <p>Then the second question is, when do we expect to actually have this approval? And we've previously stated first half of 2012, but there is, of course, always a risk that that may be prolonged. I don't expect it to be really shorter than that. I don't think it's Q1; it's more likely to be Q2, or potentially even Q3 of 2012. So that's pretty much the time span.</p>
          <p>I think you can say maybe more from a philosophical standpoint that you can probably make this quicker. You can push this through maybe. But maybe the final result will be less advantageous for us. And therefore, I think in the balance between time and result or accuracy of the model implementation, we prefer the latter. So, I cannot actually give you a good estimate, but somewhere in that ballpark of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was just wondering if we could have perhaps an even more detailed explanation of the trading line, primarily the treasury and the Group Corporate Center. First of all, the Group Corporate Center loss of &#x20AC;86 million, it says in the text in the report that it's mainly equity related. I'm just wondering what else is there than Pandora that makes up the bulk of &#x20AC;86 million?</p>
          <p>And then in the capital markets trading, where we also have the remaining negative effect, if we could discuss that a bit more in detail, what actually went on there. For example, how much is lost on bond holdings and how much would be a third item and what could that be then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In capital markets, that was your last question, how does...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Or in total, like I said, if we have equity-related losses, bond-related losses and then the other, whichever that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, inventory. Yeah, let me start with GCC. First of all, the number is, as you say, &#x20AC;86 million. Out of that, &#x20AC;36 million is Pandora, &#x20AC;22 million related to other equity holdings that we have, so either investments into private equity or other holdings as part of the liquidity buffer. That makes up a total of &#x20AC;58 million, and the remaining figure is related to what I talked about before that. Basically, the hedges of the buffers, the hedges that we run, so just an adjustment. So, you can say by this, you can say this is not a result of active management. We've actually not done trades that were negative. These are reevaluations, if you put it that way. One of the things, of course, that you probably have noted is that we have actually centralized all these holdings in terms of equity into treasury as of 1st of July 2000 and &#x2013; as of 2011.</p>
          <p>So, from a treasury standpoint, that doesn't look too good, right? Before we actually had that spread out in the business areas. We have now centralized all the private equity possessions to one unit and, of course, that contributes to that &#x20AC;58 million. And so, it's not actually a true treasury loss, so to speak. It's just holdings that we have.</p>
          <p>And then the other &#x20AC;22 million, as I previously mentioned, related to just fair value adjustment of hedges that we have. The counter side of that is, of course, a better NII as we go forward. So, you can say without making, and I don't want to do that. I don't want to speculate on individual holdings, and particularly not Pandora, but generally, if you take the rest of it, it will come back if markets go back to where they were because of these &#x2013; just the nature of being holdings.</p>
          <p>So, although it looks like a big number, these are the components of it. If you take the capital market, it's actually very limited related to the inventory side. As Christian alluded to, a fairly significant part of that decline relates to the fair value adjustment. And this is just more or less automatic. It's not a result of bigger volumes.</p>
          <p>You've seen that the balance sheet is increasing significantly. And if you actually track that versus the EURO five-year swap rate, you will see that the development of that and the balance sheet size and the derivatives is pretty much 100% correlated, not fully because there are also FX positions in there that will value over time. So, basically, when interest rates go down, the market value of the derivatives book goes up on both sides. And of course, we have more collateral when we hedge against the banking system than we do against the OTC customer. So, basically, the positions versus the customers that are not collateralized basically increases.</p>
          <p>So, the sheer market value increases, thereby you have a fair value adjustment just because of that. And the second thing is that credit spreads in pretty much all credit counterparts have increased, also creating a fair value adjustment.</p>
          <p>So this is basically pretty much half, you can say, of the decline in markets. And once again, this is not an active management issue that will come back. Your credit spreads once again contract or maybe more reasonable if interest rates once again increase on the, let's say, five-year end, but it's spread out on the curve.</p>
          <p>And of course, the other thing that will actually take that out or increase the profit once again is, of course, that <mark type="audio gap" /> (56:09). So, that's pretty much the story. The rest of it is just truly lousy trading environment.</p>
          <p>So, we've got lots of flows. And of course, with a volatility like this and a very, very low risk level, the profit just actually comes down in a turbulent market. So, it's not &#x2013; there is no drama, you can say, although the numbers are not good. This is very much the result of the market conditions <mark type="audio gap" /> (56:36).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just pose then a follow-up question? When you went through the delta in NII, you mentioned this &#x20AC;29 million in treasury. Is that a one-off step change or is it a one-off NII that goes away next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all, I think it was reasonably good. But it actually has to do with you get the little bit of a negative on the items at fair value, and you get a positive on the NII. So, again, you can say that if markets stay where they are, you have a little bit of a positive uptick in Group function &#x2013; or treasury also going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Just stable. So, of course you get that benefit. And the other part of that, as I previously also alluded to, is that we had a fairly reasonably good funding market with replacement of all funding at a fairly expensive level. So, it's actually both those two.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, it was reasonably okay. In the interest rate environment of treasury, the combination of the NII and the items at fair value, there was a loss of a little bit over &#x20AC;20 million or approximately &#x20AC;25 million, and there was a positive &#x2013; or negative in items at fair value of about &#x20AC;25 million and a positive of &#x20AC;29 million. So, basically, you can say the treasury result in total was due to just the holdings of equity, in summary.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and two questions. First one is on the stress &#x2013; the new stress test that's coming up. Do you know now what possible rules they're going to be using? This summer they used the floor rules, but now if we talk about 9%, you're getting closer to it if we continue to use the floor rules also in the new stress test?</p>
          <p>Second question is, if I look under Note 4 on items at fair value, you have the first item to hit on equity-rated instruments of almost &#x20AC;2.2 billion. I guess that's life related and so on. But could you just tell us a little bit on that item which stands out quite a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can &#x2013; I guess you can answer the EBA's stress test which you are asking. Let me just &#x2013; this note is, of course, extremely complicated because it has to do with all the holdings to support the life obligations. So, you can actually not see from that note. So, you can say life has in all fairness fairly limited to equity holdings, but still given, of course, all the outstanding obligations, a fairly significant size and amount. And that, by definition, when interest or when equity markets decline so much, that has a significant impact. But you have, on the other side, the positive impact from counter side.</p>
          <p>So that does not actually impact the bank. That's just the way we do the notes. So the impact you see from our numbers, it actually impacts the bank, it relates to only these three things that we &#x2013; actually, the equity holdings in treasury, that's pretty much here. EBA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're right that actually the capital ratios EBA is using, they are including transition rules. So, then our ratio is 9.3% in end June, 9.2% now. But any &#x2013; if the threshold is 59, I can assure you that actually there are more or less no banks in the Europe who can, more or less, let's say, be on &#x2013; let's say, on the right side of that threshold. So, that would be very severe requirement for the whole banking industry if that's the threshold, not to mention about the Nordic banks because it's typical in the Nordic banks that we have quite a lot of risk weight. So that then the difference between the, let's say, transition rules included and excluded is quite high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if we're actually going to have the new stress test on 9% and transition rules, what do you think you're going to say? I mean, you can't say that it doesn't apply to us and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, then we use &#x2013; that they are using our capital ratio, including transition rules. But then, of course, as you know that we don't hold sovereign exposures to these PIIGS countries so that then this whatever haircuts are applied. And then the impacts for us is more or less nothing or is nothing. But that is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we can add to this, but the previous stress test also, they actually had both. You had without and including transition rules. And in the transition rule case, we actually have an improvement because of mitigating actions that were part of that exercise. So this time, although I guess or in fairness we actually don't know the final outcome, it's still lots of speculation and discussion all over. So we don't actually know exactly what's going to happen. But I think it's a much, much more rigid stress test this time.</p>
          <p>In all fairness, you can say just making all these haircuts is part of a stressed scenario, you can say. And in addition, you don't have that mitigating impact. So, it's a very, very rigid scenario that is now currently at least portrayed to be used. Despite that fact, we are above that threshold. So, it's not going to impact us whatever. I think that's a pretty good news, I think. And whether it's &#x2013; whether if we don't like this and what kind of implications, there is lots of speculations on &#x20AC;260 billion to &#x20AC;300 billion or &#x20AC;200 billion of equity increases in European banks. So, the effect, how this is going to play out is quite uncertain yet. But still, as you can see, we are clearly above this threshold and we don't have any exposure.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. So, if we look at CRD3, which is implemented now later this year, could you remind us how big that effect is, from the &#x2013; purely the CRD3 there and how much you would expect on your core Tier 1 and risk-weighted assets? And if you can do any mitigation on that, and then, furthermore, what kind of mitigation we can see going forward? I know that Fredrik alluded to the CMD here and that we will see more of your total model impact, but is that a meaningful impact on your risk-weighted assets? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second is on the funding there. It seems like you did not push out the more beneficial funding situation to your branches on the banking operation. Rather you kept those in the Group treasury, if I look at the &#x2013; in the accounts. Is that correct, or will that continue, so you will not push out any lower funding cost to branches? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with this CRD3, so as Fredrik indicated, we are going to show you this kind of large, let's say, summary of implications of this regulatory changes in terms of what is increasing our risk-weighted assets and then what may decrease the implications, so that we have not given any kind of precise estimation from, let's say, a issue-to-issue basis. But it's not anything this kind of very significant, so that &#x2013; you know what, because it's mostly related to the market risk, let's say, side and then our trading activities, how we calculate those type of risk. Actually, it's not so relevant in our case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just trying to market the Capital Markets Day, so you would actually be there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Otherwise, if we say everything, you may not come. The second question, cap funding and treasury. I think your question was cap funding and treasury. And, yes, the sure answer is yes. The way we apply internally is that we use the benchmark rate or LIBOR or SIBOR, et cetera, in the internal treasury rate that we use for our operations versus the business areas. And on top of that, we add what we call the liquidity premia add-on for most of the lending &#x2013; not all, but most of the lending and most of the deposits.</p>
          <p>The exceptions to that 20-basis-point rule is actually for covered bonds or for mortgages where you don't have that add-on to the same amount. And the second thing is specific deposits, which are of more, you can say, non-stable nature. So, that means that actually a substantial part of the funding cost over and above LIBOR stays in treasury and also, of course, the swing factor. So if it gets more positive or more negative, that will stay in treasury.</p>
          <p>We are discussing, and we have elaborated on this before that we are working on models that will, you can say, transfer all the liquidity cost, including the liquidity premia out of the businesses on a more frequent and transaction base. And we will start working with that basically during next year and finally, you can say, implement it in 2013. This is a very, very heavy exercise to do this from an IT environment, but we have the models ready, we have the systems ready, and it's about an implementation issue.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had a question regarding costs and the restructuring program and the redundancies. If you could give us some more flavor to how this will evolve during 2012 and how quickly we will see the actual impact from the 2,000 that you're now laying off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; I'm not sure exactly what kind of detail you ask for here because I cannot give you a number by quarter. And the reason for not being able to do that is, of course, that we are still in the midst of negotiations with the unions and formulating the plans, et cetera. And it's actually also varying between the different business units.</p>
          <p>So if you take the Retail, the branch network, for example, you will execute or we will execute during the entire part of 2012. And in some of parts of the organization, we will be much, much quicker and we will start executing or have actually started executing in some areas and we'll execute even more as we go forward in the fourth quarter. So you will gradually see the implementation of this up until end of 2012.</p>
          <p>But of course what we're trying to do here, it goes without saying, is to be as rapid as we possibly can. So, it's just trying to find the balance between a smooth process, as inexpensive as possible and speed. So, I cannot give you figures by quarter, but we're doing it as quickly as we possibly can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a follow-up on your presentation there on asset quality. I saw that risk migration in the corporate portfolio was still positive. I was just wondering whether that also goes for Denmark or not. And secondly also in shipping, you said it was primarily related to one item. Is there also an element of building up any collective reserves, or is that not the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in Denmark, actually the corporate rating migration was also positive. That was good development, so that the positive rating migration was visible in all our portfolios. So that also, by the way, in shipping, so that overall quality of the shipping customers was improving still in Q3. So that the answer to the first question is yes.</p>
          <p>Then the shipping book, yes, that the loan losses Q3, they were entitled to more or less one specific customer. And then because the positive rating migration in the whole book was visible, we actually didn't increase so much of our collective provisions in shipping. We have identified, as we always do, this type of customers in problems and then we are doing provisions in due course.</p>
          <p>And then if we little bit elaborate or discuss more about the shipping, let's say, issue, because I know that it's interesting and there are lots of this type of opinions that whether or not that will hit in the crisis. Our shipping credit portfolio is &#x20AC;13 billion in volumes. 25% of that is oil and offshore, which is now currently very strong actually market. Then the most crucial sub-segments in the shipping for the time being, they are related to the tanker markets.</p>
          <p>But also in the tanker markets there are different, let's say, sub-segments. And then the worst one today is crude tankers. And these crude tankers, which we feel that there we have problems in the shipping market, that's 10% of our credit portfolio. And then there we have, from our, let's say largest six or seven customers, only one is not investment grade customer.</p>
          <p>So that also in a way, I try to illustrate that how we deal with this shipping segment as a lender so that, first of all, we are diversified in various segments. Those segments, they are behaving in different ways, so that there will always be some sub-segment in shipping, which will be in problems. But there will always be, there are many segments which are strong.</p>
          <p>And then even in those, let's say, weak segments, you can choose your customer, so either good or bad. And so far, our selection has turned out to be quite good so that we have only few of these type of identified problem customers <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:12:00). Then, of course, we will eventually see more and more customers in problems. But today, actually, the situation is relatively good and strong.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when you say that you're replacing all of your financial targets with the 15% ROE, does that really mean all targets, so including dividend policy and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You must know the dividend policy is a policy and not a target. So, no, not, of course not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But still you need &#x2013; about capitalization per se then, do you have anything new to say on capitalization because, of course, that's a key parameter in terms of reaching 15% ROE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No. Yes and no. I think we have nothing new to say. We still estimate that 11% is an adequate level to be at, and that's also what we base our target on. We have had lots of discussions with the regulators on this issue and, of course, the regulators have stipulated 10% to 12% as an adequate level. So, we feel that we are in that 11% or within that bracket with the 11%.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to have any other views for us at this point in time. So, we will &#x2013; at some stage when life becomes clear as relates to, for instance, capital ratio, Tier 1 ratio or whatever in terms of instrument eligibility or whatever it may be, we'll be back with the capital policy. And I think I'm getting a little tired of myself actually saying that, I really, really would like to put a capital policy in place, but unfortunately we're not in that position. And no bank basically has that possibility of this. But nothing in our discussions with the FSA or anyone else have suggested that 11% for Tier 1 rate is not applicable. We think that's relevant.</p>
          <p>So, can we be wrong? Absolutely. Is it likely to be right? Yeah, probably. So, 11% is the base.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that based on today's book or after positive migrations of --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Of course, it's a Basel III level that we are looking at. So, if you &#x2013; I guess I take it you're asking me about future and what this is, how this is going to play out as we go forward. And again, just to try and market our Cap Markets Day, we'll try and give you that story a little bit more.</p>
          <p>But in all fairness, there are lots of things happening here. So first of all, of course we have the impacts of CRD3 and CRD4. So, it's the market risk. It's the other things, CVA and other things in Basel III that we've been discussing. So, those are the negative things.</p>
          <p>And then we have an ordinary growth, which also adds to risk-weighted assets. Then we have a lot of positives including the model changes that we're working on, and in addition, efficiency measures that we're working in all parts of the organization, and then finally also addressing customer by customer. So, all of these things are basically there that we have talked about before. And the 11% is on a future level, i.e., including the CRD3, CRD4, IRB, efficiency, migration, whatever, everything. That's pretty much the estimation we are making.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the net impact of all that what you mentioned, is that positive or negative, excluding volume growth, of course?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, <mark type="ph" /> Tomas (01:15:45), that we have communicated a moderate growth of risk-weighted assets, right? I mean, you're basically saying that. That's what we've been communicating. So, we also say that we see a moderate growth in our business in general. So, moderate risk-weighted assets and moderate growth and lots of negative things happening and also lots of positives, so you can say you get the balance. We're basically giving you that balance.</p>
