      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and welcome to our Q3 '08 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 22, 2008 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.  Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.</p>
          <p>During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.</p>
          <p>Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2007.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the call over to Tom.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I will begin with comments on our financial results.</p>
          <p>Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased 21% to $970 million. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 448 million shares compared with 435 million. Return on invested capital was 32%, down from 42%. Worldwide revenue grew 31% to $4.26 billion or 28% excluding the $80 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>In Q3 2007 worldwide revenue benefited by approximately 290 basis points of year-over-year growth from Harry Potter 7 sales plus attachments. Excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments and changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue growth was 31%.</p>
          <p>Media revenue increased $2.49 billion, up 19% or 17% excluding FX. EGM [Electronics and other General Merchandise] revenue increased to $1.64 billion, up 52% or 49% excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 38% of worldwide sales up from 33%. Worldwide unit growth was 30% or 32% excluding Harry Potter 7 plus attachments.</p>
          <p>Prime membership increased more than 70% from the prior year and Amazon Premium, the French version of Amazon Prime launched on October 1. We expect more customers to save time and money by using Amazon Prime to ship their gifts to friends and family this holiday season.</p>
          <p>Active customer accounts exceeded 84 million, up 17%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.4 million, up 17%. Seller units were 31% of total units, unchanged from the prior year. Worldwide gross profit was $999 million, up 31%.</p>
          <p>We recently lowered the free shipping threshold from &#x20A4;15 to &#x20A4;5 in the UK. Super Saver shipping is an important component of our overall value we provide and customers have saved more than $700 million with our free shipping offers over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing and technology and content in G&amp;A combined was $768 million or 18% of sales, up 8 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $378 million or 8.9% of revenue compared with 8.7%. We opened new fulfillment centers in Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania to support continued expansion of selection and customer demand. Technology and content was $226 million or 5.3% of revenue compared with 5.6%.</p>
          <p>Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we did not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense. In the North America segment, revenue grew 29% to $2.3 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $1.25 billion.</p>
          <p>Kindle selection continues to grow. Since inception, we have more than doubled the number of books, magazines, newspapers and blogs available to be delivered wirelessly in less than one minute. Kindle titles already account for more than 10% of unit sales for books that are available in both digital and print formats. We have ramped up manufacturing capacity over the past 10 months and Kindles are in stock and available for immediate shipment. Kindle sales since launch have significantly exceeded our expectations. We will not introduce the new version of the Kindle until next year at the earliest.</p>
          <p>EGM revenue grew 51% to $950 million, representing 41% of North America revenues, up from 35%. North America gross profit grew 28% to $586 million and gross margin decreased 24 basis points to 25.5%, driven by lower prices for our customers including free shipping offers at Amazon Prime and changes in product mix partially offset by higher other revenue. North America segment operating income increased 12% to $88 million, a 3.8% operating margin.</p>
          <p>In the international segment, revenue grew 33% to $1.96 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $80 million year-over-year favorable FX impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 24% to $1.25 billion or 18% excluding FX and EGM grew 54% to $690 million or 48% excluding FX. EGM now represents 35% of international revenues, up from 30%.</p>
          <p>International gross profit grew 37% to $413 million or grew 32% excluding FX while gross margin increased 53 basis points to 21.1% driven by increases in 3P [Third Party] product sales and improvements in vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices to our customers and changes in product mix. International segment operating income increased 46% to $143 million, or 7.3 operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from FX, international segment operating income increased 39%.</p>
          <p>CSOI [Consolidated Segment Operating Income] grew 31% to $231 million or 5.4% of revenue, unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the $5 million favorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 28%. Unlike CSOI our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 26% to 154 million or 3.6% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expense was $59 million in Q3 or a 33% rate for the quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2008 will be approximately 28% and that cash taxes paid will be less than $75 million. However there is potential for significant volatility due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting the amount and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction and business acquisitions or investments. We are endeavoring to optimize our global taxes on a cash paid basis not for tax expense on a financial reporting basis.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income was $118 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with $80 million and $0.19 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $416 million to 2.32 billion year-over-year. Our cash and marketable securities primary consist of cash, government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value.</p>
          <p>Inventory increased 36% to 1.32 billion and inventory turns were 12.4, changed from the prior year even as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels across product categories and geographies and introduced new product categories.</p>
          <p>Accounts payable increased 34% to $2.24 billion and accounts payable days increased to 63 to 62 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $240 million from a year ago to $731 million. Our Q3 2008 capital expenditures were $102 million.</p>
          <p>During the quarter approximately $132 million in principal amount of our 4.75 convertible subordinated notes converted into 1.7 million shares of common stock and we redeemed for cash the remaining total 266 million in principal amount of the notes.</p>
          <p>I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.</p>
          <p>We experienced slower rates of growth towards the end of the third quarter coinciding with disruptions in the global financial markets. While guidance takes into account these growth rates, our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It is not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.</p>
          <p>As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as marking euro denominated debt to market quarterly, intercompany balances and foreign currencies that settle amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that FX rates remain approximately where they have been recently.</p>
          <p>For Q4 we expect net sales of between 6 billion and $7 billion, a growth of between 6% and 23%. This guidance anticipates greater than 500 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be 145 and $305 million and between 46% decline and 13% growth. This includes $85 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.</p>
          <p>We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 230 and 390 million or 30% decline and 19% growth. For the calendar year 2008 we expect net sales between 18.46 billion and 19.46 billion a growth of between 24 and 31%.</p>
          <p>This guidance anticipates approximately 100 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $716 million and $876 million or between 9% growth and 34% growth. These amounts include the impact of the $53 million non-cash gain recognized in the second quarter of 2008 on the sale of the company's European DVD rental assets. This includes approximately $300 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.</p>
          <p>We anticipate 2008 consolidated segment operating income which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $964 million and $1.124 billion, or between 13% growth and 32% growth. We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.</p>
          <p>We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks. And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. It looked like your third quarter margin was better than your guidance despite the new fulfillment centers whereas for the fourth quarter you are guiding for margins to be flat to down year-on-year. Is that delta going into the fourth quarter primarily because you anticipate cutting prices to sustain sales growth or is there anything else that is going into the margin evolution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the guidance that we've given &#x2013; we gave a relatively wide range of guidance that we believe to be appropriately conservative and prudent certainly in this environment. So, it depends on really where you look at the range. You see also a fairly sizable range on the operating margin as well as on the bottom but it reflects again both the wide range and also the fact that our &#x2013; implicit in the assumptions we gave for Q4 is certainly a sizeable change from currency as well which is impacting both the top and the bottom.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Can you tell us what you are seeing in terms of early discounting from your competitors as we go toward the holidays and what level of discounting does the midpoint of your CSOI guidance imply relatively to last holiday season? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we operate in a very competitive environment. That is not something that is new. We have competitors off line. As you go to your home or office you drive by or walk by those every day. We have certainly a number of online competitors as well. So we have &#x2013; we are very used to operating in a very competitive environment and we have been very successful at making sure that we have great prices for customers in this environment and that is not something that is new. That is something that we have been dealing with for many years and so certainly hard to predict what will happen over the course of any given quarter. But what we think will happen is reflected in the guidance that we have given today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Scott Devitt with Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Two questions if I could: first, in terms of the gross and operating margin by region, the domestic margin continues to go down and international go up and your third party units have been sustained at about 31% of total. So, I'm just wondering if the margin impact is driven by the mix shift where the US business first party is growing faster than third and third party faster than first international?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you give either a number or the impact that you had implied in fourth quarter guidance for currency when you gave guidance on the third quarter call for the implied fourth quarter guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your questions on margins to start with, those were operating margins or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, both. But I guess maybe just looking at gross margin. Because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You were cutting out or -- operating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Certainly you are seeing &#x2013; just think about it from an opportunity standpoint, we have more room to certainly &#x2013; or more opportunity certainly in our international segment as you look rat our gross margins. That is something we have been talking about for quite some time. There is a number of factors there certainly. We had a lot more newer categories over the past few years than in North America although we are adding categories in both segments and selections dramatically in both segments. But you have a number of factors but certainly we are earlier in third party in international as well as the category mix in terms of where we are from a charter free standpoint our ability to get better prices with suppliers has improved. So those are factors that are certainly impacting our international segment.</p>
          <p>In terms of the exchange guidance, we obviously didn't give &#x2013; you said implied. We didn't give guidance for Q4 last time. We give guidance for Q3 and the total year but I think this will be helpful. Basically if you take the top end of the range, the 20.1 billion that we gave last time for revenue, right now we are talking just under 19.5, 19.463 so that's a little over $600 million. We said that &#x2013; last time that the total year would be more than 400 basis points of favorable impact from exchange. Now we are saying approximately 100 basis points. In dollar terms, that is approximately $500 million and so the bulk of that, more than $400 million, is in Q4 from a change from last time if that's helpful. The remainder is in Q3. If you remember we said approximately 450 basis points for Q3 for exchange. Came in approximately 240 roughly, so that is the delta if that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, a couple of quick questions. That was a very significant increase in head count this quarter, more than we have seen in the past. Was there something new about where the people are being deployed?</p>
          <p>Secondly you made a comment about seeing some disruptions at the end of the third quarter from some of the economic dislocations. Did you see that continue into the December quarter?</p>
          <p>The final question has to do with the very high end of your range, your guidance range in Q4. If you adjust for FX it implies very little deceleration on a much tougher organic revenue comp. So I guess the question is are you seeing something that &#x2013; what would allow you to actually do something like 28% organic revenue growth? Are there new categories, new international launches that could allow you to get to the high end of the range in a really troubling market with a tough comp? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry; could you just repeat the first part of the question, Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, a lot of new employees, 2,100 new employees added in the quarter. That's a lot more than we've seen in the past. Any new place for the deployment of those employees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The vast majority of those employees, a very high percentage of those are in operations and customer service as we get ready for Q4. In some of my opening remarks you also heard me talk about we opened three new fulfillment centers and certainly that is part of that increase. So, again, a very high percentage of that is again ops and CS related.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance, you mentioned the upper end. We gave a pretty wide range of guidance. We think that that is prudent during this, when the environment's uncertain and we have limited visibility as all companies have in this environment. So we think that that is appropriate. But again certainly the upper end of guidance if you look at our Q3 we saw very solid growth, 31% on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange, keep in mind that we are overlapping Harry Potter 7 from last year. The impact that we mentioned last year was approximately 290 basis points. So if you back that out, it rounds to 31% growth excluding Harry Potter and foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>And we think we are relatively well positioned. We have been working very hard for years on making sure that we have a great experience for customers. We are trying to make Q4 even better than last year. We think we are well positioned to do that. We have added a lot of selection and we've worked very hard at pricing. We have not only our free shipping offers around the world but certainly Prime has grown a lot since last Q4. So we are very optimistic from a customer experience standpoint and we will have to see where that ends up from a revenue perspective. And that is why we have given the wide range that we have given today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In September, can you talk about the fundamentals? You did see softness. Was it customers, units, I imagine also ASPs on the currency, but any detail on that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, some nice metrics on the Kindle. As books go more digital and you hopefully can capitalize it on the Kindle, does that help Amazon's long-term profitability or hurt it? How do you look at that over a long-term basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of what we have seen, I talked about currency. Currency moved a lot as part of the disruption in financial markets towards the end of the quarter &#x2013; through the quarter and toward the end of the quarter and obviously much more recently as well. And in terms of &#x2013; we certainly saw some slowness of growth in the areas as you would expect with the disruptions in financial markets. One data point certainly, we saw a deceleration of growth in purchased items over $1,000. So, that is certainly one item that we saw.</p>
          <p>But again, what we have seen is factored into the guidance we have given. As I mentioned, because of our model and because we have worked very hard at not only having low prices and affording low prices but knowing where we are relative to others, we think that position us very well in this environment. Positions us well in up environments. Customers want great values in good environments, but they want especially good prices in this environment, the macro environment we are under today. So, again hard to tell, which is why the range we have given for guidance, where we will end up but we think we are positioned very well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Kindle, how do you see that affecting your long-term profitability in the book segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing that I think you could imagine happening over the long term there is that the prices of books will be cheaper. So, most of the books that we are offering on Kindle today are $9.99 even if they are $20 or $25 in print form and so you can see that. I think that probably the best way to answer your question is we would hope to sell many more units and make less money per unit, but all in have a very strong business.</p>

          <p>Hey guys, a couple of questions. First of all, Jeff, maybe &#x2013; can you characterize how &#x2013; what you are seeing in this downturn or kind of the issues in the marketplace or spending habits compares to what you saw maybe Q3, early Q4 back in 2000 when the bubble burst just as a basis of comparison? How would you characterize it?</p>
          <p>Second, your operating margins &#x2013; consolidated segment operating margins are down sequentially in Q4 when typically you get the effects or economies of scale advantage on your side. I guess I'm trying to figure out understandable that the FX is going against you. But it seems like you should be seeing your cost come down a bit, at least from an international standpoint. Is there something else going on in the number? Your plan to keep spending up as it relates to marketing or overhead and fulfillment that is going to be the drain from a margin standpoint as you look at Q4 relative to Q3? Thanks.</p>

          <p>On the first part of your question relative to 2001, it is a very difficult question to answer in large part because Amazon has changed so much in that intervening time period. We have so many more product categories now than we did then. The scale of the business is very different. The operating efficiency of the business is very different. We have spent a lot of time and hard work reducing defects at the root so that we can have lower operating costs and pass on lower prices to customers. I love our position today in the marketplace because we have been spending so much time making sure we are the low cost provider. And that is something that is likely to be appealing to people in this kind of economy. So not only low cost but also &#x2013; low cost on product prices but also matching that with free shipping.</p>
          <p>So, difficult to make that comparison. If you go back in time, we were able to find back then certain segments of our business which were impacted. They were very technology related like computer books and investing in business books and so on. Our business is now so much more diversified across product categories, although as Tom mentioned, we have seen deceleration in items of, for example, above $1,000.</p>
          <p>I guess I would leave it at that. Very difficult to make crisp comparisons relative to that time period.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your operating margin question, in terms of looking at it sequentially, as you see from the guidance the implied operating margins would have &#x2013; at the higher end being sequentially up and on the lower end down. And certainly when you plan for the seasonal quarter you plan for a peak, you know, we are getting ready certainly for what we hope to be a strong quarter. We think we are well positioned for that in having facilities and associated structures to support that. So that is what we are trying to do, trying to make sure we support it so if we are at the lower end of guidance we will have certainly some of the cost but not the revenue to support that. But again, we think we are well positioned for Q4.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. We have seen third party data suggesting that your share increase in the large TV market has continued to do very well. We are wondering if you expect the move to digital broadcasting by February to accelerate TV and related sales in Q4 and Q1.</p>
          <p>Separately, would you provide any additional color on the growth in advertising related revenue to your business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is really hard to say on the TV side. What I would say though is, like the comment we made on &#x2013; across the business, we are going to make sure that we have great prices and that is something that we have been doing and we do have great selection in that area that you are referring to in terms of the large TVs.  So we are certainly a &#x2013; you know, we should be in the customer's consideration set given the service that we provide and the selection and the prices. So I think that is in terms of what will happen related to next year is difficult to say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then just on advertising, any comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Historically, our primary means of driving demand has been to focus on what we consider to be the primary customer experience drivers: low prices, free shipping, selection, speedy delivery, and we are going to continue &#x2013; we think that is likely to continue to be the best way to drive demand in our business.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Would you be able to give us some insights into your plans for the payments business and how fast you see that moving ahead? And do you think it is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth or margins going forward? If so what time scale?</p>
          <p>And then also, could you just give us an indication when you make electronic sales of media, are they completely cannibalistic to your traditional media sales or are they additive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far what we have seen with the Kindle book units is that they are additive to physical book units. So when somebody buys a Kindle, in the period after &#x2013; sort of the post-purchase period, post-buying a Kindle, they buy 1.6 times as many Kindle books as they bought physical books prior to buying a Kindle and they continue to buy the same number of physical books. So, that is what we have seen so far and it is obviously a very positive outcome. We hope that continues.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. One key question is, if this recession lasts longer than many of us would like to, a lot of companies are talking about cost containment. As you look out over the next 18 to 24 months how are you thinking about managing your costs over the next 18 to 24 months? Do you think you continue to invest in the business or you think if there is a recession you will contain some costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our thinking is that we are going to continue to invest in the business but we are going to be especially prudent in how we make those investments. We just think that is sensible in the context of this macro environment.</p>
          <p>And let me answer the payments question from the prior caller who I forgot to answer. Basically we have a couple of services today, external payment services, one called the Flexible Payment Service, Checkout by Amazon, Simple Pay. Those are the three primary ones. These things are new offerings.</p>
          <p>The Flexible Payment Service is designed for software developers to be able to design and build their own payment services or to deeply integrate payments into whatever application they happen to be building and it has a sophisticated and very well thought through set of APIs that enable great flexibility.</p>
          <p>Checkout by Amazon and Simple Pay are for merchants on third party websites to be able to incorporate Amazon payments into their websites so that their customers can use their Amazon credentials when checking out. These are new seeds that we have planted and the question was what kind of timeline might those businesses become meaningful and that is very difficult to say. We would keep working at those businesses and hope that over time they would become meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add on to Jeff's previous answer related to the next 18 to 24 months, speaking from a program perspective, keep in mind that we have been operating in an environment of challenging prices, very competitive environment for some time. We have also been operating in an environment where we have been offering free shipping, for example, while fuel prices have been going up dramatically. These are things that are not new to us. So in addition to the programs and being prudent we are going to continue to work on defect reduction and which will help us from a cost structure standpoint. Continue to work on other things to make our overall cost structure improved over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask one more question? So I was going to ask, you talked about the weakness in the overall business. Could you give us maybe more color into that what kind of trends you are seeing in the UK market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a lot to add to the UK but again on the total business we are actually very pleased with what we saw in Q3. We think in a relatively challenging environment, we think 31% growth on a dollar basis, 28% excluding exchange and 31% excluding exchange and Harry Potter is relatively strong and we think that we are well positioned for customers and the environment that we are in during Q4 and we are getting ready right now for that seasonal time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our final question will come from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize taking two questions but my question is once again you have dramatically broadened the revenue range guidance for the fourth quarter this year versus a much narrower range for example in the fourth quarter last year and I fully understand that the world is a different place today unfortunately from what it was then. But does the broader revenue range purely reflect greater uncertainty about constant currency spending by consumers or are you effectively building in some headwind or tail room for further FX moves given how volatile the currencies have been the last few weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It reflects a broad range of items and as I mentioned earlier, all companies have limited visibility, we think, right now and we are no different. So, we are putting together what we believe to be appropriately conservative guidance. It is a wider range than we have given before both in dollar and percentage terms. We think that is prudent in this environment. And again we are going to focus on what we do best, which is satisfying customers and we think we are well positioned to do that. So that is what we plan on doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a super quick follow-on question? It looks like you cut the Super Saver delivery charge in the UK from &#x20A4;15 to &#x20A4;5. Do you see yourself stimulating growth globally through lower shipping costs this Christmas? And is that part of what's going into your margin consideration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We reduced the Super Saver delivery threshold from &#x20A4;15 to &#x20A4;5 so you now in the UK only have to order &#x20A4;5 or more of items to get the Super Saver delivery. Basically, we did that because from a cost structure point of view we were in a position to do it. So you should think of that as an example of us doing the kind of things you have seen us do over the last 10 years which is try to figure out how to lower prices and then to lower prices.</p>
