          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to BNP Paribas Second Quarter 2011 Results. We are going to be starting with a presentation. Presentation will be followed by Q&amp;A session. We're going to be starting by questions in the room and then we're going to take questions from the conference call. And I would like to ask people in the room please to turn off your cell phone as the presentation is webcasted on our Internet website and also conference call through the telephone. Thank you.</p>
          <p>And I am leaving now the floor to our CEO, Baudouin Prot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon to everyone. We are going to present you with &#x2013; Jean-Laurent and Philippe the second quarter result of BNP Paribas. I think the highlights of this result are that we had a strong growth in volumes in all our domestic networks. Deposits grew 7.4% and loans altogether 4.7%.</p>
          <p>We have increased the cost of risk as a result &#x2013; entirely as a result of the provisioning of the new program for Greece where we are going to tender our bonds and we are going to take a &#x20AC;534 million provision on our second quarter P&amp;L. Even including this negative impact of cost of risk for Greece, our profit capacity and our profit generation capacity is maintained at &#x20AC;2.1 billion, up 1.1% compared to the second quarter of 2010 in the challenging environment. So I think that our solvency is also improving, it now stands &#x2013; the common equity Tier 1 ratio stand at 9.6% against 9.5% as of the end of June and 8.4% as of the end of March, and 8.4% as of the end of June of last year.</p>
          <p>The annualized return on equity for the first half is 13.8%. So I think these are strong results confirming the strength of the Group business model and in a challenging environment. As for revenues, the Group revenues at &#x20AC;11 billion are down 1.7%. This is entirely due to the Corporate Centre where we've had a sharp decline in revenues against the high level of the second quarter of last year of which we &#x2013; this time we have only &#x20AC;14 million of own debt revaluation against &#x20AC;235 million in the second quarter of last year, so this is the biggest item of difference.</p>
          <p>For operating divisions, so outside from the Corporate Centre, revenues are up 3.4% which I think is a good number. Operating expenses for operating divisions are up 3.2%; excluding the new systemic taxes, they are at 2.3%, therefore with a positive jaws effect against the revenues of 1.1%. The systemic taxes because they represent &#x20AC;55 million in the second quarter, therefore around &#x20AC;220 million on a yearly basis, &#x20AC;130 million is the French tax and &#x20AC;70 million is the UK tax with some overlap, as you know, between the two taxes.</p>
          <p>Gross operating income is down 8% for the full Group because of the Corporate Centre, up 3.7% for the operating divisions and then net income attributable to equity holders at &#x20AC;2.128 billion is up 1.1%, so a stabile performance despite the significant impact on the provision of Greece.</p>
          <p>Regarding the effect of the Greek assistance programme, I would say that as the part of the voluntary participation by private investors to the Greek assistance programme, BNP Paribas intents to exchange all its eligible debt bonds under the programme. Actually, as of the end of June, BNP Paribas exposure to Greece bonds in the banking book have been reduced to &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>This is important because everybody keeps in mind the &#x20AC;5 billion, but it's not &#x20AC;5 billion, it's &#x20AC;4 billion, which is bit different. So from this &#x20AC;4 billion actually &#x2013; of which &#x20AC;2.3 billion are within the plan because their maturities are between July this year and December 2020 and the remaining &#x20AC;1.7 billion of maturity beyond 2020 are outside of the plan.</p>
          <p>The depreciation in the P&amp;L at fair value of the bonds eligible under the Greek assistance programme, It's a &#x2013; well, it's a provision at 21% against &#x2013; for &#x20AC;2.3 billion and  21% times &#x20AC;2.3 billion, there you get to &#x20AC;516 million in the cost of risk. You have to add up to that &#x20AC;17 million in the cost of risk for the &#x20AC;500 million in outstanding in the insurance.</p>
          <p>This is &#x2013; the effect there is mitigated by way of specific provisions for the insurance sector, and then we have another &#x20AC;26 million in associated companies for minority stakes in certain subsidiaries including Ageas in Belgium. So this is the impact of the Greek assistance programme on the second quarter of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>And I say that the 21% discount is &#x2013; well, is discounted under 9% long-term normalized rate for the Greek debt against the present interest rate we will get on the new bonds that will be 4% for the first five years, 4.5% for the years 5 to 10, and 5% for the remaining 20 years.</p>
          <p>So moving now to revenues of the operating divisions, I said 3.4% altogether, it's 1.5% for Retail Banking with just over &#x20AC;6 billion of revenues. It is 6.8%, a strong increase, for Investment Solutions at &#x20AC;1.6 billion. And it is 5.7%, at &#x20AC;2.9 billion for CIB. So we actually had revenue increase in all of our operating divisions in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were under control. Retail Banking expenses excluding the effect of systemic taxes, were up 0.7%, so with a jaw effect of 0.8% against the revenues up 1.5%. Investment Solutions, costs excluding systemic taxes were up 3.8%, with therefore 3 full points of positive jaw effect against the revenues at 6.8%, and therefore, the cost income ratio improved in both Retail Banking and Investment Solutions. Investment Solutions we had nearly two full points of improvement at 68.6%. And CIB 56% cost income ratio, 1% increase versus the second quarter of last year, still the best level in the industry with costs up 7.6% and 5.4% excluding the systemic taxes.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk, well, the cost of risk for the quarter stands at &#x20AC;1.350 billion of which &#x20AC;534 million relates to the Greek assistance programme. Excluding this Greek assistance programme, in fact, &#x20AC;534 million cost of risk stood for the second quarter at &#x20AC;816 million, which is down 11% to the first quarter and down 24.5% to the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>So altogether excluding Greece, this is 48 basis points net provisions to customer loans annualized against 54 in the first quarter of this year and against 66 in the second quarter last year. So, as we had predicted, a slight decrease in the cost of risk in all of our main divisions.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cost of risk for CIB financing businesses, we actually had a write-back of &#x20AC;40 million, actually we had more write-back than new one-off &#x2013; than additional provisions. And for our Retail operation, France and BeLux Retail at respectively 23 and 21 basis points maintained a low level of cost of risk, whereas in Italy for BNL banca commerciale we break &#x2013; we broke the 100 basis points to 98 basis points, so we see the improving trend in cost of risk that we expect to continue over the next few quarters to materialize at BNL.</p>
          <p>Europe-Mediterranean, cost of risk &#x20AC;47 million, 85 basis points, a decrease in all regions this quarter. BancWest, cost of risk of &#x20AC;62 million, 69 basis points down also, well we see a continuing improvement of the loan book quality and continuous reduction of the cost of risk for now the last five consecutive quarters.</p>
          <p>At Personal Finance, cost of risk &#x20AC;406 million. Now I would like to remind you that this is a big chunk from the &#x20AC;836 million of cost of risk at Group level. Personal Finance is a big chunk because it's nearly half at &#x20AC;406.</p>
          <p>That number &#x2013; the cost of risk is on a downtrend, 883 basis points. It was 186 in the first quarter of this year and 231 in the second quarter of last year. We do believe that this ongoing trend of reduced cost of risk should continue to prevail in the next few quarters for Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>The pre-tax income, good performance in all business units, the increase in Retail Banking is very strong, up 25.5%, well over &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Investment Solutions up 15.6% at &#x20AC;550 million and CIB up 2.4%, a very good performance in relative terms and better than the &#x2013; above &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>For the first half, revenues down 0.2% at Group level, up 1.9% for operating divisions and the net income attributable to equity holders for &#x20AC;4.744 million, up 8.1%.</p>
          <p>The Group was very much delivering on the business model of BNP Paribas. Retail Banking 56% of the revenues, CIB 29%, Investment Solutions 16%, nothing new. I think this is very much what we go for. In terms of pre-tax income, Retail Banking is 44%, CIB 41%, so CIB is 29% of revenues, 41% of pre-tax income and will get back to the high profitability of our saving platform in a minute or a bit later on. Investment Solutions 15%, 15% exactly the same contribution to revenues as to profits.</p>
          <p>The &#x20AC;4.7 billion of net income attributable to equity holders puts BNP Paribas after JPMorgan, HSBC, and Wells Fargo, well &#x2013; I think, well in the peer group, concerning the profit generating capacity and in terms of return on equity at 13.8% just ahead of JPMorgan at 13% and BBB at 12.9%. This time we seem to be best-in-class in terms of ROE. This is for one set, for the first half. It is annualized, but I think it's still significant.</p>
          <p>We'll now leave the floor to Jean-Laurent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon.</p>
          <p>As Baudouin told you that the net result pre-tax for the Retail is up 25% this quarter, a strong result, I would say. You will see that this is the product of two strong elements, first one in the domestic markets, we've been able to post a <mark type="ph" /> positive euro effect (14:06) of more than one point is in France, Italy or BeLux. And on the other hand, we benefited from quite a strong increase in terms of cost of risk, especially in BancWest and with Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>So to start with the French Retail, strong business activity. Loans are up by 4.7%, especially with mortgages, but also with some kind of a pick-up in the corporate loan part of the business, especially with small and very small companies.</p>
          <p>Deposits are again up, plus 10.1%, which is strong, and current accounts are up close to 8%. And on top of it, we enjoyed with the new mobile banking services, quite a strong development with more than 300,000 users monthly &#x2013; on a monthly base. And we have just announced an exclusive partnership with Orange. We will comment more in details late this year.</p>
          <p>Built on that, revenues were up by 2.5% at &#x20AC;1.767 billion with net interest income up 1.9% and fees up plus 3.4%. Based on the operating expenses that are quite under control at plus 1%, plus 1.3%. The gross operating income is up 4.7% at &#x20AC;651 million. And based on a small decrease in cost of risk, pre-tax income is at &#x20AC;536 million. That's more than 10% up as compared to the second quarter of last year. So in a nutshell, quite consistent growth of volumes and income for the French Retail.</p>
          <p>In Italy, revenues even stronger, with a growth of 3.6% at &#x20AC;782 million. Loans were up 4.2%. This is the main driver together with financial fees like in the insurance life products. Deposits were down 3.7%. This is based upon the very strong competition we have in this market, especially with local authorities and very large corporates.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are up 2%. This is the continuous effort we have to do to continue to invest in that market, especially with opening of new branches, six new business centers in this quarter and six new retail branches this quarter, and four small business centers opened. As a result, cost income is down one point this quarter. Due to a slight decrease of the cost of risk, pre-tax income is up 25% at &#x20AC;129 million. So all in all, good sales, marketing and operating performance.</p>
          <p>For BeLux, this is the domestic market in which we enjoyed the strongest development. Loans are up 5.1%, with quite a good balance in between individual customers and SMEs. Deposits are up 8.4% with current accounts up close to 8%.</p>
          <p>We have just closed the acquisition of Fortis Commercial Finance. This company, together with the BNP Paribas Factor company, will enable us to create the number one player in that field in Europe. So based on this activity, revenues are up 4.4% at &#x20AC;876 million, especially driven by net interest income due to volume growth.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are at plus 3.3%. This represents the high level of investments we're doing in this market, especially with Internet, multi-channel banking, private banking, commercial banking, and based on that, gross operating income is up 7% at &#x20AC;254 million.</p>
          <p>Based on the very low cost of risk, pre-tax income is at &#x20AC;194 million. That is to say close to 25% up compared to last quarter, to the second quarter of 2010. So all in all, a very good performance driven by volume and growth.</p>
          <p>Europe-Mediterranean. Even if some geographies are still difficult, overall we had <mark type="ph" /> went for (19:09) good sales. Deposits are up 8.8% with a very good growth in most countries. Loans are up 5.8%, especially in Turkey, close to 23%, and despite the continuous decline in Ukraine, minus 17%.</p>
          <p>Revenues are plus 2%, &#x20AC;385 million, 3.3% excluding Ukraine, 7.8% in the Mediterranean Basin and minus 4% in Ukraine when we continued to restructure the bank.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses at plus 6% paid for the opening of branches in Morocco. 22 branches since &#x2013; in one year and seven branches this quarter, and the strong organic growth plan we've been following.</p>
          <p>Based on the reasonable cost of previous quarter, pre-tax income is at &#x20AC;40 million versus &#x20AC;20 million second quarter of 2010. So we can start in that division some kind of turnaround in the pre-tax income, even if the absolute level is not satisfactory enough.</p>
          <p>For BancWest, revenues are at plus 1%, &#x20AC;541 million. This is very much linked to the growth in deposits, plus 12%, especially with the strong and regular growth in core deposits plus 10%. Loans are down minus 1.2% due to the mortgage loan business that is down 7%.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are up 5.5%. This is based upon the fact that the base in 2010 was low after the cost-cutting program we did in 2009. We are paying for further investment in business development and, of course, we are continuously adapting the bank to the new regulatory framework.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax income is up close to 29%, &#x20AC;177 million, due to a sharp decline in cost of risk. Annualized pre-tax return on equity is 23% first quarter this year. So as you can see, BancWest is really back to a very good profitability level.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance now, <mark type="ph" /> well went out (21:37) some kind of good growth in most countries Italy, Germany and Central Europe and, of course, in the countries of the Mediterranean environment divisions were Poland, Ukraine and China. We have closed and we have acquired the final remaining stake in Findomestic, as it was decided two years ago and announced two years ago.</p>
          <p>Revenues are up 4.3% at &#x20AC;1.298 billion. Consolidated outstandings are up 6.4% and, of course, we are paying in France and Italy, due to the new restrictive legislation for commercial consumer lending. Operating expenses are up 4.1%, and all in all, due to the decline in cost of risk, pre-tax income is up 42% this quarter at &#x20AC;299 million. That is almost &#x20AC;300 million. So here you can see that Personal Finance is back to a very strong profit generation capacity, and we believe this to be the story for the quarters to come.</p>
          <p>So, Baudouin, give you the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving to Investment Solutions, I think it is important to see that assets under management stood at close to &#x20AC;900 million exactly &#x20AC;896 million as of the end of June, against &#x20AC;901 million as of the end of last year. This is especially due to a foreign exchange negative impact of &#x20AC;13.7 billion, this is the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. In terms of net asset inflows, the net asset inflows stood at &#x20AC;5.2 billion in the first half of this year, leading to a 6.1% annualized asset inflow rate. In Private Banking we had a strong asset inflow at &#x20AC;7.7 billion, especially in Asia and in domestic market. Personal investors, particularly in Germany, had a significant also positive outflow.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we had a negative asset outflows of &#x20AC;7.9 billion. This was accentuated by client's decision to end the outsourcing of its management for &#x20AC;3.2 billion, but also notably by the impact of outflows from money markets funds and the switch to bank deposits, the trend we've seen in the last few quarters. And for Insurance, outside of France, we had a strong inflow especially in Italy, Luxembourg and Taiwan for a total of &#x20AC;3.9 billion. So assets under management outflows were more than offset by the good asset inflows in other business units. Investment Solutions revenues were up 6.8%. So Wealth Management and Real Estate Services, we had good performance that partly offset &#x2013; well, a small decline in revenues from Asset Management but it was a negative figure for Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Insurance revenues were up 15.6% driven by the good performance of protection insurance products outside of France especially. And security services a strong double-digit growth of 10.7% against the second quarter of last year, the result of asset growth in terms of assets under custody and also the effect on &#x2013; the positive impact of higher short-term interest rates on the big balances that are security services customers keep with it. Our operating expenses up 4%, so we see positive jaws effect. And the pre-tax income &#x2013; on operating expenses, I just want to mention the investment partners costs were down 10.5% which was the positive impact of the Fortis integration planned synergies.</p>
          <p>Our pre-tax income at &#x20AC;560 million, up 15.6% against the second quarter of last year. We had a one-off disposal our Asset Management JV; we had two Asset Management JVs in China because we got the Fortis <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:38) joint venture. We keep this one and we sold the other one and we had a &#x20AC;67 million one-off gain, capital gain, out of this disposal. We also had the impact of the new Greek assistance programme, which I remind you for total of negative &#x20AC;43 million. So altogether a good income growth.</p>
          <p>Corporate and Investment Banking, revenues at &#x20AC;2.9 billion, up 5.7% against the second quarter of last year. A good performance in equity derivatives, equity derivatives at &#x20AC;680 million had nearly close to the &#x20AC;690 million of the first quarter, so strong performance in equity derivatives. Last year performance was a very low, because we had only &#x20AC;270 million, so we are booking 2.5 time more revenues in equity derivatives and advisories than last year. And I think this strong performance in equity derivatives is especially interesting because it came with a very low VAR and very low allocated equity, which we'll get to in a minute, and drove the return on equity to a high number.</p>
          <p>Fixed income, down against the backdrop of significant turbulence in the debt market, and fall in revenue from the financing businesses against a record level in the second quarter of last year. So the pre-tax income is up 2.4%. I think it's important to mention two key ratios for our Corporate Investment Banking, each of them I think stands like best-in-class in the industry and they are very important to meet both of them.</p>
          <p>The first one is the cost income ratio. Cost income ratio at 54.2%, still best-in-class within the industry. May I remind you that JPMorgan is at 60.1%, Citi is at 62.3%, Deutsche Bank and Barclays respectively at 64% and 65% and the two Swiss players are enjoying 80% cost income ratios.</p>
          <p>And then we have the &#x2013; very important also the pre-tax return on equity. Due to the combination of efficient capital allocation, good revenues, cost control and cost of risk &#x2013; low cost of risk, the pre-tax return on equity stood at 44% for the second quarter. So no doubt that the CIB platform at BNP Paribas is enjoying very strong value creation for the shareholders. We are seeing that consistently and we're going, hopefully, to continue to see that in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>And as for CIB capital markets, I already commented the equity and advisory, let me say that fixed income we had &#x2013; it's 12.2% less than the second quarter of last year and 32.2% less than in the first quarter of this year. Certainly, the business was affected by the strong volatility and investor's wait-and-see attitude in credit and rates. But we maintained significant activity because of our ranking. We are &#x2013; in primary markets, we are the number one for all those in euro. And we are for all international bonds for major currencies, we are now the number four fixed income platform in the world against being numbers nine in 2010 and number 13 back in 2007. So we enjoy a quite a strong footprint and we see many of our customers even in a rather adverse environment generating business both primary and secondary for BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>Energy and commodity derivatives, we had a good performance under difficult market condition. As for Corporate And Investment Banking businesses, in the second quarter revenues were down 8.5%. The record level of last year was &#x2013; well was significant &#x2013; changing reference. The U.S. dollar was down 11.6% and that certainly impacted our revenues. And we had some declines in outstandings due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the new regulatory environment. The new regulatory environment, capital requirements and liquidity requirements, is starting to show its effect on the availability of financing both volume wise and price wise. I think we are going to see more of that if we &#x2013; as we go on. Apparently this is what the regulators want and they will get it.</p>
          <p>Structured finance, we had a very solid performance driven by fees and in corporate banking and flow product. We continue a strong push in cash management and trade finance services with significant business developments in all regions with increased volumes offsetting lower margins.</p>
          <p>I think that I want to &#x2013; in conclusion, I want to move now to liquidity. As for liquidity our 2011 mid and long term issue programme of &#x20AC;35 billion is 100% completed as we speak and this year we raised US$20 billion, much more than last year, the average maturity was six years and we've had an access to diversified  funding sources. We not only could rely on many different currencies, but as you seen in this slide, private placement was 26%; retail banking 13%; senior unsecured public issues 37%; covered bonds, mostly with mortgage collateral, 21%; and our long-term repos 3%.</p>
          <p>In terms of our short-term liquidity, we kept to an active management, we had a significant extension of the average maturity of short term funding since the crisis. We are financing in all currencies sub-LIBOR 3-month and we keep &#x20AC;150 billion of unencumbered assets eligible to central banks of which US$30 billion eligible to the Federal Reserve. As for solvency, our common equity Tier 1 ratio stands at 9.6%. We had organic generation of 20 basis points in the second quarter, and the acquisition of the outstanding stake in Findomestic that we now count for 100% represented 10 basis points decrease of our equities run ratio. Therefore, plus 20 minus 10 this is why our common equity increased from 9.5% to 9.6% in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>The shareholder's equity stands, common equity Tier 1, stands at &#x20AC;57.4 billion and our risk-weighted assets stood as of the end of June at &#x20AC;595 billion, unchanged against the end of March figure. Earnings per share, earnings per share &#x20AC;3.8 for the first half, up 7.2%, and the net book value per share &#x20AC;56.7 up 7.2%, and the net tangible book value per share &#x20AC;55.5 up 9.4%.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, I'd say that in terms of unrealized capital gains on our AFS portfolio as of the end of June this unrealized capital gains stood at a positive &#x20AC;814 million. So I think we're continuing to generate robust growth in asset value through this cycle.</p>
          <p>Altogether, I think the second quarter results show that we enjoy growth in business and volumes allowing BNP Paribas to fully absorb the negative impact of the cost of the Greek assistance programme, maintaining a high profitability and solvency. May I just remind you that the return on equity was 13.8% and for the first half, annualized, the return on tangible equity stands at 17.3%.</p>
          <p>So altogether, we saw resilience of the diversified integrated business model anchored into solid retail banking market. We now are ready to answer your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>You mean for the financial businesses of CIB?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Then the second question is on the terming out of funding. You said that you issued bonds with an average maturity of six years? How far you think you are down that process of further lengthening the maturity profile of your liabilities there?</p>
          <p>Then in the NIM in Retail, so you have this strategy of hedging the net interest income with the sovereign bond portfolio and, obviously, there's been a bit of a paradigm shift with regards to sovereign holding, I suppose. Just wanted to have some color of whether there is any plan to change that or to alter that strategy there? And then lastly, I seem to notice that there is a slight reduction in the Basel 2.5 impact. Is that correct? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Philippe will answer most of your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try. I'll start with the easy one, the six years indeed we, I think, we try and adapt to the circumstances, of course, and we try and optimize the cost. So during the crisis it was a bit difficult to issue very long-term bonds, so the average maturity of new issues were somewhat lower, you will remember. We are proud enough to be able to issue much more than two-three years like others, but the average was more like four or five years. And so we have taken the opportunity of a, I would say, relatively shaky, but overall good first half to issue a little bit longer.</p>
          <p>But indeed, I would tend to say that over the long run, we don't need that kind of average maturity because this is average maturity, so we have issued up to 12 years during the first half. Indeed, our loans are rarely that low, 12 years, so on average I think something like 4.5 to 5 years would be enough. So indeed, we're not necessarily going to try and issue longer than that. It is probably well enough and maybe already too much and it was just a kind of catch-up effect compared with the crisis period.</p>
          <p>And then about the impact on Basel 2.5, it &#x2013; while we stick to &#x20AC;40 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;40 billion, sorry, risk weighted assets &#x2013; additional risk weighted assets, and we had already announced so there is no real change. That being said, as we're growing, the ratio as a proportion it is becoming smaller and smaller. So this why &#x2013; now it was only &#x2013; we had said that it would represent 70 basis points. In that case it's a rounding up effect, it's only 60 basis points, but it's the &#x20AC;40 billion that's not been changed.</p>
          <p>Now the productivity of risk weighted assets in the financing business, you have the series of figures, because you have &#x2013; each quarter we give the risk weighted assets and &#x2013; or cumulatively year-after-year you have &#x2013; you can look at this historical series. I mean, each year, you have the risk weighted assets of the financing businesses and the revenues and so you can take the ratio. I think it has moved up and down. Clearly, there was a kind of peak in terms of margins right after the crisis, you remember, early 2009. Since then it has come down somewhat. But at the same time while we have &#x2013; so at the moment, I would say it's rather stable. I'd say we keep risk weighted assets in the financing business system to come down and revenues are more or less stable, so it's stable plus I would say at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to going forward, have you got any expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean. It's difficult to give predications on that front. Our &#x2013; if I had to guess something I would say that given the fact that everybody in the world is trying and reducing their risk weighted assets, especially in that kind of business. Normally margins should widen and so the productivity should improve progressively.</p>
          <p>And the last question about the strategy of holding sovereign bonds in order to hedge the structural interest rate risk. I think, well, you should not exaggerate what happened and what is happening. Clearly one has to make good choices and clearly the decision of investing in Greek bonds was not s good choice. I mean, after the fact it's easier to see that, and but I think that the Greek situation is totally exceptional. It has been said and repeated by the European governments. So we are not going to &#x2013; I mean at the end, sovereign exposure is still less dangerous than the most corporate or other kind of exposures. And so I would tend to say that it's not going to change our strategy significantly. Maybe we're going to be even more cautious in the selection of the bonds, but basically, the basics of the strategy is not going to be changed.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Omar Fall from UBS. Three questions, please. The first one is, I think you've given it in the past, could you give us the amount of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't understand what you're saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you've given it in the past, could you give us the amount of your reliance on U.S. commercial paper? And then more broadly, if you could just talk about some of the &#x2013; how you're navigating the stresses in that market. Secondly, your 48 basis point cost of risk seems almost normalized with write-backs in CIB potentially offsetting a high number in Italy in a normal environment. Could you give us an outlook on how far we could go, or even if that's just a vague bit of color for our models? And then finally, the revaluation reserve, the AFS reserve through equity, has not moved much in the half, I think, &#x20AC;300 million, which is surprising given the moves and spreads that we've seen even on the debt, ex Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which is now level three, one would have thought it'd be a bit more than that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well maybe just to answer to your last question. The number concerning our AFS is, it is surprising but it is the number. So this is why we want you to know that we have a strong balance sheet and that's the number. And then certainly that takes into account all mark-to-market revaluation of the sovereign bonds as you would expect from BNP Paribas to do as of the end of June. Regarding the cost of risk, I think we would not go into the guidance for a group cost of risk because that doesn't have a set. You can &#x2013; it's a result of &#x2013; so we would &#x2013; we could potentially have an idea of guidance. For CIB financing businesses, I expect the cost of risk to remain very low in the next few quarters. So now low, whether it's a positive write-backs, or 10 or 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>Regarding French Retail and BeLux Retail, we think that about &#x2013; that is as low as it can go. And we expect it to remain that low. For Italy, we hope that the slow erosion in the good sense will continue as a melting glacier. And regarding, if we move to Europe and Mediterranean, we would expect the cost of risk in Ukraine to continue to be, well, under control. And so that overall, I don't know, maybe it could be a bit lower than that but still certainly higher than in our French and BeLux Retail. BancWest, it could go bit lower, but it's already we've done, maybe most of the way, most of the work. And Personal Finance, it should continue to go down whether it's <mark type="ph" /> 160, 150, (46:13) but it's very important because then the amounts are important. So altogether, if you melted up, you would still see a light trend down in the cost of risk for the next few quarters, which yes, that's what we would still expect.</p>
          <p>And your question on the reliance U.S. of commercial paper...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I'd like to stress that we have several sources of U.S. dollars in the U.S. and outside the U.S., We tried and &#x2013; well, like for the rest of the short-term funding we have while systematically increased the maturity of our issuance on the short-term market, including in U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>I think that it's true that the figure for the commercial paper market is public, because of reporting or something, that's regulatory reporting and it's in the region of $15 billion, but this is really a partial figure. You should &#x2013; I think it's just part of the total picture, and we don't want to give more details and to give all the breakdown of the different sources, because &#x2013; well, because you can imagine that while we are always trying to find the lowest cost and we prefer to keep some kind of a, I'd say, leeway to manage that issuance programs &#x2013; those issuance programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, you have questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Rob Down from HSBC. Couple of questions really. Firstly, could you give us a bit more color on the minority charge, which dropped quite a lot in Q2 versus Q1? I know there were a lot of moving parts with Findomestic and some of the Turkish operations, but perhaps if you could tell us how sustainable that Q2 minority charge is?</p>
          <p>Second question really on the &#x2013; coming back to the cost of risk. Obviously, the Personal Finance business is half of the current cost of risk. You gave us very good disclosure in BancWest on early arrears level and non-performing loan rates, can you just give us similar color for the Personal Finance business? Some sort of color, if you like, as to why you're confident that the charge there will continue coming down over the next couple of quarters?</p>
          <p>And then just a final question really, coming back to the Greek sovereign debt question. I notice in your consolidated financial statement, I think page 43, that the Greek bonds that are outside of the scope of the agreement. I think on your &#x2013; you're now measuring them on a level 3 basis, and there's about a balance &#x20AC;790 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;770 million shortfall versus the risk exposure. Have you considered impairing those Greek bonds that sit outside of the agreement? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Philippe will answer to the minority shares and Jean-Laurent will assess the cost of risk in Personal Finance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On minority charges, there has been quite a lot of volatility on minorities over the last year and the beginning of this year because we had all those transactions between the Fortis perimeter, BNP Paribas Fortis scope and the 100% BNP Paribas scope in order to align all businesses and avoid having businesses with one leg in one scope and another leg in the other scope.</p>
          <p>And so we had the lot of internal transactions and those internal transactions created capital gains at Fortis or capital loss, depending on the transaction. And so this is why the minorities went up and down and it just happened that this quarter, they are a little bit down and this is partly due to that and partly also due to &#x2013; well, part of the Greek portfolio is in Fortis and Ageas and so the hit, the &#x20AC;500 million provision, is also partly in with minority impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Personal Finance we could expect a drop of, let's say, 20 to 25 basis points next year. So this is more or less the magnitude of the decrease we're looking at for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Greek bonds that are not part of &#x2013; that are not illegible to the exchange, we have not considered that they were impaired. Just due to the fact that the public support to Greece, the <mark type="ph" /> BSFF (51:34) loans maturities have been extended also because, well, as market has focused on the private sector involvements, but there is also a strong public support at the same time that was announced.</p>
          <p>And so the new &#x2013; well, the support to Greece has been extended, including the old loans and the previous loans, and maturities have been extended to 10, 15, 30 years. And at the same time, the interest rate has been lowered down to 3.5% on the public side. And so during the next 10 years, in fact, until 2020, Greece will have to pay interest only, no redemption of any principal. And those interest will be at relatively low rates, 3.5% on the public side and 4.5% on the private sector side.</p>
          <p>And so while at the same time that Greece is in the process of closing its fiscal deficit, there should be &#x2013; and the commitment is to be in primary surplus in 2014, starting 2014. And so at this stage there is really no reasons and at least no objective evidence of Greece defaulting on the bonds maturing post 2020. So there has been no impairment on those bonds, and just, of course, the OCI still, as always, on a level 3 basis.</p>

          <p>Other questions? Here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just ask &#x2013; it's Jeremy Sigee at Barclays Capital. Could I just ask two questions. One is a follow-up just on the discussion about cost of risk. In Europe-Mediterranean, there's been a big jump in this quarter. Do we trend down from that lower level, or is there any sort of bounce back that you expect? Are we now at a new trend and we improve from here in your Mediterranean provisions?</p>
          <p>And then second question, there's one or two different bank levies already being booked in the second quarter numbers, partly in Italy and partly in CIB. I wonder if you could just remind us how much is booked in the different forms of bank tax in this quarter, and how much you expect to book in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure <mark type="ph" /> if we're regarding (54:33) into bank levies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can start with that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:36) because indeed we have &#x2013; well, the total amount expected for the year is &#x20AC;200 with a kind of split roughly &#x2013; well, in the UK it should be something like &#x20AC;70, and in France, the French tax, something like &#x20AC;130. But in the UK it's more or less concentrated on CIB in the UK because it's based on the balance sheet of the activities conducted in the UK, and most of them are conducted by CIB.</p>
          <p>But as for France, the basis for this tax is the risk-weighted assets worldwide. So by the way, there is some type of double taxation, by the way. And those risk-weighted assets are, of course, all risk-weighted for all businesses. So we have broken down the tax charge on all businesses, not only Italy or whatever, on all businesses.</p>
          <p>And so even at BancWest, for example, you will see there is a stake of these tax that is the French tax, but we try always to push down the constraints to the businesses, to help the basis of the risk-weighted assets, all the businesses are impacted.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Do we trend down from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have two elements in this quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first of 2011. Fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011, we did some provisioning in specific countries. Egypt, Tunisia, Ivory Coast.</p>
          <p>And on top of it, this quarter, we have started to see some relief in trend. So if you look at this quarter compared to the first quarter of this year, you have two elements. In the first quarter of this year, exceptional items for very specific situation in a limited number of countries. And on top of it, in the second quarter, an improvement of the overall cost of <mark type="ph" /> receiving credit. (57:48)</p>
          <p>So if you look at the second part of this year and next year, we would assume that, on average, cost of risk is going to be in between these two numbers. Let's say around 120 basis points. That might be roughly speaking on average what we could expect for the second part of this year and for next year. But Europe and Mediterranean division is based upon very different situations. Always very difficult to give an aggregate for the cost of risk.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I've got a couple of questions.</p>
          <p>The first one is on the balance sheet. If you look at the customer deposits, they're down 4% from the beginning of the year. Just wondering whether you can explain this increase of securities? And also the loans have decreased 2% from the beginning of the year. There has been decrease in the loan book for BancWest and from other divisions. Is it the trend we're going to see going forward?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the jaw between net costs and revenues. If you look at the second quarter this year versus the second quarter of last year, revenues were down 2% and costs were up 3%. Just wondering whether you think we're going to continue to see a similar trend in the second half of the year, and whether you can comment on this, please? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The revenues were down 2% and the costs were up 3% -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I comment on that? I already commented, but I am glad to do it again, that revenues, excluding the Corporate Centre, the Corporate Centre revenues were down 50% between second quarter last and second quarter of this year. Certainly this is not operational.</p>
          <p>The operational revenues of the Group were up 3.4%, and the costs were up, I think, 3%, including the systemic taxes &#x2013; 2.2% including systemic taxes. But excluding systemic taxes they were up 2.3%.</p>
          <p>So you can't compare the Group &#x2013; I mean the Group costs don't relate to Group well &#x2013; well to Group revenues including Corporate Centre. The Corporate Centre, we had last year own debt for valuation of &#x20AC;235 million, and we have in the second quarter of this year &#x20AC;14 million. So just on that item, you have &#x20AC;220 million revenue difference &#x2013; or revenue loss in the way &#x2013; or difference. This is nothing operational.</p>
          <p>So I personally concentrate on the operation divisions, because there, I can maybe have some guidance and have full control. But the operating &#x2013; the revenues of the Corporate Centre have some volatility.</p>
          <p>I do believe personally that the <mark type="ph" /> old debt re-valuation (60:55) accounting is a bit, well, funny strange, because as your &#x2013; when your signature is getting wet, you book revenues. Having been a banker for the last 30 years, I find it bit strange. But this is how accounts should be established, this is the beauty of IFRS, and we stick to it, even if we don't really understand deeply the economic significance of it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Balance sheet and the evolution of the balance sheet, yes, there is a decrease of all balance sheet. You have bear in mind that over the period, we had a significant decline in the value of dollar against the euro. And so I would say something like two-thirds of the decline of the balance sheet is due to a dollar effect, so it's not something that is not really driven.</p>
          <p>And the rest, I mean, of the decrease is due to some reduction in outstanding amounts especially in the financing activities of CIB. And on the other, well and I think that's &#x2013; and we have also some trading volume that has been reduced specially the repos have been significantly reduced. And also, on a more passive way, the net present value of derivatives has been reduced just because interest rates have gone up and the net present value has gone down. That's something that also somewhat passive. So the reduction in the balance sheet is explained by different movements and some of them are &#x2013; two- third of them coming from the decline in the dollar.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Afternoon, everyone. I have two quick questions, first of all on your AFS gains. They were around &#x20AC;300 million at the end of March and then increased to &#x20AC;800 million. Would you mind actually giving us some color from where that's actually coming from?</p>
          <p>Secondly, also, on your sovereign bonds for Italy, Spain and Portugal and how much OCI, I mean, mark have you actually taken already in your equity? And if I just can add a last question on your short-term funding, the &#x20AC;150 billion of liquidity reserves that you have, is it possible to get some granularity on the currency split of that and actually how much is excess cash, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think these are all CFO questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the AFS gains first, so this is a figure that is post tax, that figure that you find in the OCI, so it's post tax. In the increase to, while you have, first you have the post tax effect of the losses that have been taken on the Greek bonds by definition because there are no more latent. When you move latent gains into actual gains, you reduce the latent gains, the latent losses, I mean. When you move latent losses into actual losses, you reduce the latent losses. And so, it increases the net positive gain, but this is relatively limited because you have to take that after tax.</p>
          <p>And the rest is coming from, is mostly coming from increasing value of equities. And because they are here, you have both equities and fixed income securities in the total. About the excess &#x2013; well, the liquidity available, I'm sorry, we're not going to give more detail than what we've given. Meaning, we have already given the $30 billion eligible to the Federal Reserve. So this is &#x2013; and so, we don't want to give more detail than that.</p>
          <p>It is true that part of it is just cash, short-term excess cash, especially in dollars, I have to say, because as we are &#x2013; since we are seen as a safe haven, we have a lot of very short-term deposits in dollars that are coming to us in excess to what we really need. And then, so part of this is that and is just deposited at the Federal Reserve. But of course, the bigger &#x2013; the much bigger part is made of eligible securities and eligible assets available for the windows.</p>
          <p>Your last question was about the OCI on Spain, correct, and Portugal.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... and Italy and Portugal. I'm sorry I don't have the figure right here. Maybe you should give a call to our investor relations. I don't know &#x2013; well, we are &#x2013; as far as Spain and Italy are concerned, actually we are &#x2013; well, it's mark-to-market so that OCI you have the amounts, the total amount. You should look at the price and you can make the calculation yourself. I don't have that here, sorry.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jon Peace from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have two questions, please. The first one is on Basel III core Tier 1. After we had the systematically important financial institution disclosures, it was indicated that you might operate at around 9.5%. And I just wondered practically how close to that limit do you think you will be able to operate, or how much additional buffer do you think for safety you might have to carry on top of that?</p>
          <p>And the second question related to this is, I think you made a couple of comments about return on equity in the new regulatory environment. And I wondered based on where you thought your Basel III core Tier 1 would need to get to, do you think in time &#x2013; what do you think in time your ROE will look like? Can you sustain that 15%? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that regarding the Basel III core Tier 1, as much as we resent it as unnecessary and excessive, but if we have to comply with the capital surcharge, if and when it is finalized, we certainly will do it. And if it's 9.5% in 2016, we are going to go for it. We will have no problem to get there by retaining earnings, and so we will get there. That will certainly &#x2013; the higher your capital liquidity requirements, the higher &#x2013; well, somehow the pressure on return on equity, so there will be a trade-off. In the meantime, I think the industry will somehow adapt and reprice and then we will certainly have some management action to make sure that even in this context of high capital requirements, we will have an adequate return on equity.</p>
          <p>Now for the moment, we stick to the 15% post-tax return on equity as a target. I mentioned already several times that in the new environment which I find high and even excessive in capital requirements and liquidity requirements, the 15% looks challenging. But I have to quote that this quarter we are at 13.8% and we are, at least for this quarter, best in the industry. So it confirms that 15% target is challenging for everybody. But I rather start from 13.8% than some other who start from 5.9% or 8%. So we were going to continue, well we have to improve, but it's easier to improve from 13.8% than from much lower capital. And many of our competitors apparently don't think the cost of equity, which is not a problem. And we are  &#x2013; this is how we see things.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; if we were to be &#x2013; to have a 9.5%, don't expect the BNP Paribas to meet much above that, because when you get to excess, you know, I'm not going to put another capital surcharge on the capital surcharge. Well, I don't think &#x2013; in the meantime, Jean-Laurent  will be CEO and I will be Chairman, but I don't think things should change much.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is that, so I think that's our return on equity, that's how we see things. And actually the industry, we are seeing certainly in cost management and in my view also pricing wise, we're going to see the consequence of this new regulatory environment in the next few quarters, and I am sure that if we sit here in a year and a half or two years maybe, well, significant things will have changed in the industry to cope with the new capital and liquidity requirements without certainty &#x2013; which our certainly in most ways not only in stringent but, in my view, excessive.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Anke Reingen from RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Anke Reingen from RBC here. I had some follow-up questions, please, on the exposures first. I was wondering the &#x20AC;1.7 billion of exposure to Greece not eligible for the plan, how does thus this square with the numbers you've given in the half yearly report of the &#x20AC;1.8 billion of risk exposure and the carrying value of &#x20AC;1 billion?</p>
          <p>And then you very helpfully give us the &#x2013; an update on the exposures for the individual countries and I just wanted to confirm, that I understand the banking book and trading book exposures correctly. So you were basically a net short position of &#x20AC;1.2 billion on U.S. sovereign and &#x20AC;1.7 billion net long on Italy, that's on page 41 of your half yearly report? And then I was wondering, you have talked about the AFS reserve being &#x20AC;800 million positive at the end of the first half. Were you willing to give us an update where it would stand as of end of July? And then lastly, on the financing revenues, you mentioned that FX had a negative impact on the financing revenues quarter-on-quarter. And I just wondered would the revenues be flat adjusting for currency? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Philippe answer your question, but as a general statement BNP Paribas hasn't moved yet to the monthly or weekly balance sheet and result. So for the result of July, come and see us in the third quarter results. But before that &#x2013; so we're sticking to end of June numbers. So, Philippe, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. One question is easy, so I start always with easy questions. The exposures, in fact, on the financial statements, we have the notes to the financial statements, that is a new note, number four, exposure to sovereign risk, on page 41, 42 and 43 and 44. So we have four pages devoted to that, so you have a lot of detail and you have already looked at that, I'm sure.</p>
          <p>And the answer to your question is that the &#x20AC;1.7 billion we are mentioning as being bonds that are not eligible to plan are bonds. And in page 43 we are reporting all the exposure on the sovereign be there due to securities loans or credit derivatives even, and this is &#x20AC;1.804 billion. So the &#x20AC;1.7 &#x2013; that is I think &#x20AC;1.748 billion, indeed, that is rounded to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. If you add a few loans, we have also wanted to bring &#x2013; if it goes up to up to &#x20AC;1.804 billion and this is the &#x2013; I would say, the way too square the &#x20AC;1.7 billion and the &#x20AC;1.8 billion below. And, you had another question about?.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, everybody. I have a few follow-up questions. First of all, if you were to assume that your core Tier 1 under Basel III would be 9.5% including the deficiency risk. I mean ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Including what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Deficiency charge &#x2013; I was just wondering whether in term of bank management, that you intend to take any action to decrease this level, I mean to reduce the surplus capital for the GCC?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was just wondering whether you're still looking for any kind of acquisition in Poland? We know that KBC is trying to fill in his active job over there. Thirdly, I was just wondering whether you see &#x2013; when do you intend to see a decrease in term of cost to income in your political activities? I think that we're still at the level of 70%. I was just wondering whether a chance to see a level of 55% back in the French Retail? Those are my questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that regarding your first question the core Tier 1 and SIFI capital surcharge, on the one &#x2013; well, if we can mitigate by taking clever management decisions, why not, especially if you are sure do so. But we're not going to kill the cow, to kill the business just for the sake of managing the capital surcharge. So in the capital surcharge you have a number of parameters. One, which is specially absurd is that if you do cross border lending in Europe, this is considered as a SIFI criteria. This is crazy. This is &#x2013; eurozone is a monetary zone, I don't see why in the U.S. if you lend from Arkansas to &#x2013; it's not in Europe, so this is absurd. And we are certainly not going to stop being a eurozone bank for that reason.</p>
          <p>Another criteria is if you are managing asset under custody or your share of payments on SWIFT is considered a criteria for being a SIFI. So we don't think that you're going to stop serving customers for that. So that &#x2013;  on the other side you also &#x2013; the total size of your balance sheet is a criteria. So well, we are the &#x2013; we have a balance sheet which is going south and then decreasing every quarter. So we'll see how we mitigate and manage the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So in one sentence, we'll continue to manage the group professionally and according to the best interest of our shareholders and of our customers. And if it happens to be a bit less of capital surcharge we'll take it. As a regard Poland and BeLux, Jean-Laurent will give you the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Poland with the current operation we are close to 2% market share. The organic growth plan is aiming at giving us close to 4% market share in the mid-term. Obviously, if there is a nice acquisition to be done at decent prices why not, but this is not part of our first plan that is organic growth. So if there is an asset at decent price, then we'll have a look at it.</p>
          <p>For BeLux, currently the cost income is about 70%. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:10) that is now the new CEO of the Bank has started since early this year to look at the 2014, 2015 plan and of course, he'd like vey much to reach something, I would say, close to the French Retail. So the French Retail is around 65% cost income. Here's the bank at about 71% this year, 70%, 71%; next year, we should be down to 69%, so the mid-term, it could be reasonable to expect something in the range of 65%, I would say, comparable to the French Retail. There is still a lot to do in terms of better organizing the bank. There's lot of initiative that can be taken on top of the industrial plan that is going to be closed end of this year. So this is more or less the ideal for Belgium.</p>
          <p>As for any networks, we are considering also for BNL additional plans to reduce again the cost income. We are now below 60% and we would like to be even below. So let's see what will happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. If I may ask two little question please, the first on is still on the GCC, I mean, could we consider that being identified as a global systemic bank could be an opportunity in term of funding or even customer gathering?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I haven't get the answer on the minorities, should we consider the level of Q2 as the run rate or should we take the level of Q1 or please? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe being a bit provocative, it didn't take &#x2013; we didn't need as BNP Paribas to become a global SIFI to have a competitive advantage of funding. We already enjoy it. So the flight to quality is already there, so I don't see any type of pressure to get there. So if you give me the choice, I don't take it, okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Guillaume Tiberghien from Exane BNP Paribas. I just have two questions, one relates to your funding cost and your CDS. Have you got an idea roughly how much below your CDS you fund at the moment or during the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with regard to the current situation in Italy, is it possible that maybe in six or nine months some Italian banks, which have done quite a lot of funding already, may have some more funding difficulties due to the sovereign situation and that you might have opportunities to grow in Italy? Would that be something you would consider? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your second question, I mean, this is &#x2013; we don't give guidance on that kind of the situation, so we will see. I think that certainly any consolidation in Italy would take for to me to write the check an extremely compelling story of value creation for the shareholder, but you can't exclude that totally.</p>
          <p>As far as the question of the funding cost, Philippe will answer.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the last, I'd say, one year or so there has been growing disconnection between the CDS levels and the funding cost. So, I think the CDS spread is not representative anymore of the funding cost. At BNP Paribas, for example, over the first half or the program of this year the average, for the same we should take the five-year senior debt that is the CDS is suppose to be five-year senior and for the same maturity, same kind of issue, the funding cost was on average something like 80 to 90 basis points below the CDS spread. So we're finding ourselves at much lower levels than in the CDS spread.</p>
          <p>So, I think on top of that CDS is price is extremely volatile, reflecting a very nervous markets with some weeks without any &#x2013; even sometimes any possibility to issue some weeks, because the market is closed, and also periods where the liquidities are bundled. And a lot of clients want to &#x2013; well, all of the investors want to invest, so you have to be very opportunistic and to choose your windows for issuing. And then, of course, well, we tend to choose windows where the cost is somewhat lower than the average, so it's a picture that is much more complicated than in the past.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just a couple of questions. Firstly on CRD4 CRO1, whether you learnt anything on the LCR ratio which changes your position compared what you told us before? And secondly on your..?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, this was on the LCR, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, whether you learnt anything from CRD4 documentation that changed your view or your position on a liquidity coverage ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to make sure, you ask us whether on the LCR, the recent documentation is changing anything in what we think, is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Does that change your position &#x2013; does that put you in a better or worse position? Because their language seemed a bit different, slightly different from the language I'd seen from the Basel documentation.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly just on your very resilient performance in equity derivatives which, especially compared to the peer group, looks pretty good, whether there was anything going on in terms of volume spreads or trading performance which would help us to understand that a bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, Philippe will answer on the LCR. Regarding the derivatives, the feeling I have is that our teams in equity derivatives have done enormous management work in the last few quarters to somehow very much reduce the level of allocated capital and the level of position not proprietary, but resulting from connectivity, and then also moving to flow product. So I think extracting revenues from a less risky way of managing the equity derivatives platform. And I think they have been very efficient and they have worked on that consistently and tenaciously and I think this is result we see. And I am pleased by the revenue performance especially considering the adverse environment altogether and their low capital consumption. That's the comment I would make on equity derivative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the LCR, I think the CDR4 has made probably one step more in the direction that had been already shown in the Basel III paper, but more, well, in a kind of shy way. And as you say that the regulators are acknowledging that they are not really ready to issue precise liquidity ratios.</p>
          <p>The experience they have is much less than about capital ratios, and they are not completely sure of what is the right calibration and even the right ingredients in the ratios. And so it's true that I think we will have real interim periods where there will be &#x2013; well, we'll report a certain number of balance sheet items and some number of indicators to the <mark type="ph" /> distributors (1:29:21). And they're going to observe that, they are going to make some calculations, some homework and they have several years anyway to come back with a ratio that hopefully will be more appropriate than the first draft we had seen in Basel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. And maybe just one follow-up just on your flat risk weighted asset trends this quarter, within that was there any important kind of changes in terms of the FX impact, credit risk, market risk or anything notable for us in it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been relatively flattish on all items, I would say, including &#x2013; well, the biggest one is a credit risk and it's also relatively flattish, somewhat down, due to &#x2013; well, again you have the dollar effect that has helped. I would say that on the one side, you had the dollar effect pushing the credit risk down. You had also the &#x2013; well, on the volumes, some volumes effect that were also pushing the ratio down and some reduction in outstanding amounts. On the other side, you had some deterioration of risk weight on the sovereign side because Greece deteriorated, Ireland, Portugal. And on the corporate side, you had some improvement on the risk charges, so it's a mix of different trends up and down. And overall the credit risk weighted assets were rather stable and so for all the other ones as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, first question, we have seen many of your competitors announce some redundancy plan, How do you see this phenomenon? Do you feel that these competitors are using, I guess, the crisis to get rid of some archives in their organization or do feel that they are really in big trouble? And in that case, do you feel that it could be for you an opportunity to gain market share? How do you feel this kind of unknown, because we see many announcements of that kind?</p>
          <p>And my second question is a kind of reverse question, we can see that BNP in Q1 and Q2 announce some investment in Asia in different areas, CIB, Investment Solutions, notably. Could you give us a bit more figures in terms of money or human resources invested in Asia? And your mid-term objectives there in terms of capital allocated to this area? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that regarding the redundancy plans banks have announced in the last few days regarding our competitors, you have to put them in the context of some of our competitors have low ROE and very high cost income ratio. And in that sense &#x2013; and that the &#x2013; so they &#x2013; if you have such a low ROE and such a high cost income, I think it's a good time to reconsider. And cutting costs, if I had such a high cost income ratio, and such a low ROE, I don't think I would have hired so many people in the last few quarters. But I think they had a view, some of them like 18 months ago they were buying and they have been buying talents at &#x2013; sometimes at a high price, that now they are going to make redundant.</p>
          <p>And, so I think that these &#x2013; I'm very impressed by how dispersed the ROE and cost income are amongst every platform in the industry. I think this is very, very &#x2013; the spreadsheet is wide. And I think it's &#x2013; I understand the action. At BNP Paribas, we are not complacent with costs and we are not &#x2013; it's not because we are best-in-class and we won't feel satisfied. So expect BNP Paribas to continue to manage the cost in the next few quarter and -well, rigorously.</p>
          <p>And regarding our investments in Asia, as far investment in terms of &#x2013; as for CIB, the investments are and we have some &#x2013; if we take example, security services, if we take wealth management, if we take asset management, if we take so many of our investment services business and insurance, they have planned to organically grow in the &#x2013; in Asian. Those plans are measured, those plans are realistic, they are not big plans and we don't go for big push. So they are &#x2013; we are pushing &#x2013; if we hire people, it's dozens, it's not hundreds, it's not thousands. And if we add costs, it's in the million of euros, so it's not &#x2013; and this is why we can do it while still keeping our costs under control.</p>
          <p>We are going certainly &#x2013; the budget for next year will be decided in the autumn and the budget and then we look at expenses and trends in costs and we will update if in the context of the organic growth standard we have in Asia, how we want to address cost stuff and organic investment in Asia. So we will flexible and rigorous, but I think we will most probably continue to organically grow in Asia, on a continuous, tenacious and rigorous basis. I think that's the answer to your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I have three questions please. Could we have some more numbers regarding the stake of Fortis, regarding the Greek impairment or the Greek exposure within the minority, for instance?</p>
          <p>Secondly, question on Retail France. Specifically on mortgage, regarding the evolution of margins, and any first signs of the announced slowdown in the mortgage in France, which is probably going too fast ultimately?</p>
          <p>And the last question is just a few numbers to square the non-operating number on &#x20AC;197 million. I have two box missing, which is in Corporate Centre, beside the badwill on Antin pension funds, &#x20AC;46 million? I don't know where they are coming from. And the same for the <mark type="ph" /> &#x20AC;21 million (1:37:20) in CIB? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Jean-Laurent will answer to your &#x2013; I'm not sure l get your Fortis question, but the mortgage environment in France, we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at the current situation, I would say that the evolution of stocks outstanding is still high because of production we made last year.</p>
          <p>As for other banks, if we look at this year, there is some kind of a decline in the mortgage new production. We believe that this trend will continue for the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>Is it going to have an impact on margins? Maybe. It's always very difficult to say. For the time being, we can say that margins in the mortgage business in France are still, I would say, too low, and in any case, not very much in line with the new requirements of &#x2013; in terms of capital for banks.</p>
          <p>So first, we believe that this market will slow down. And second, in principle, should see some kind of improvement in terms of margin. But this is not for the, I guess, the very short-term.</p>
          <p>For Fortis, I would say that the contribution out of the full &#x20AC;500 is above &#x20AC;100. &#x20AC;120, &#x20AC;125.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the Corporate Centre, I'd say the kind of a bit less than <mark type="ph" /> &#x20AC;200 (1:39:25) to square the gap. That's that due to series of small positive exceptional items that were there in the second quarter of 2010, and that are not there this quarter.</p>
          <p>You remember that our guidance on the level of revenues for the Corporate Centre is around &#x20AC;300 million to &#x20AC;400 million per quarter before one-offs and before PP amortization. And here we are, quite fully in line with this guidance, because that's &#x20AC;534 million less, I mean less the &#x2013; on that capital gains that is negligible, and less the PP amortization, you are at bit less than &#x20AC;400 million, so we are there.</p>
          <p>So the current level of the second quarter is more indicative of the run rate than the last year's level that was relatively high.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Sorry for the interference at the background. I've got two questions, please. First of all on risk-weighted assets for your sovereign bonds. Could you confirm what your policy is there, specifically with Greece? Do you use a zero risk weighted asset charge, or do you use an asset charge commensurate with what the rating of the bond is? And similarly, could you comment on bonds for Italy and Spain, in particular?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you said that there was regulatory impact on financing revenues. Could you give more color on exactly what the interaction is of the regulations on the revenues, and what normalized level you would expect that to be at going forward, and by when we would achieve that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might try to answer the second question, on the impact of regulatory environment on financing revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we at BNP Paribas &#x2013; we tend to be proactive and maybe, I think, leading the market in charging to the customers and to the clients the funding cost we consider in the new capital &#x2013; the funding and equity cost we consider in the new coming environment.</p>
          <p>And by doing so, we are maybe certainly not taking market share in the financing <mark type="ph" /> medium (1:42:37), because we see some of our competitors seems to be late in the process, and we don't want to be late in that process. And we also will see this might be a factor to lessen the overall financing demand, because the price is going up.</p>
          <p>And also it might &#x2013; there might be a certain trade-off with maybe some corporates going more to the capital markets and less relying less on banks for the financing. And then we will get that on our capitals market fixed income platform as additional revenue.</p>
          <p>So it's difficult <mark type="ph" /> this is a trend. (1:43:15) We are, I think, going to be there for a few quarters, maybe in the next maybe two, three years, gradually. And we will see how things will adapt in a competitive market environment. As to the -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just say that the redundancy plans we were just talking about a few minutes ago are part of that trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because if the competitors are laying off some of teams, necessarily they are reducing their loans production capacity.</p>
          <p>Well, coming to the risk-weighted assets on sovereign bonds, we are working with an advanced approach in terms of credit, so we are assessing a rating to each sovereign, and the risk-weighted assets are calculated on the basis of that rating and <mark type="ph" /> a loss given before it's a valid mark (01:43:43) assessment as well, so probability of default was given before, like any corporate.</p>
          <p>So I'm not going to give you the ratings for each sovereign, but it's the way it works. And this is why when there is an obvious deterioration, it increases the risk-weighted asset.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jacques-Henri from Autonomous. I have two questions for the Chairman-designate actually. You've been lobbying a lot on behalf of the French banking sector over the last three years and basically, just a little wrap-up in the form of two questions.</p>
          <p>First of all, do you think you've been successful in convincing the international regulator that there was a specificity of the French banking model, that that was successful and that it could go on? This was first question.</p>
          <p>And the second, on behalf of the Greek plan that you initiated, what is your degree of understanding of, I would say, how the eurozone politicians is getting the market dynamics? Is it something that they really get right now? Is it something on which you feel you'll have to spend a lot more time on? Are we going to sit down next year with all the banks, quality banks below book value <mark type="ph" /> with a P of 5 (1:46:05) or &#x2013; I was about to say, is there any hope, Obi Wan, but I'll basically stick to that. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Concerning your second question, my intimate conviction is that the market vastly underestimates the degree of commitment of the European leaders to their common good, which is the euro.</p>
          <p>And I think that they're going to prove the markets wrong. For anybody who believes that the euro is going to go, or any country is going to leave the euro, we'll see that in the next few quarters. As you said, I will move at the end of the year to another <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:46:44) position, but I'll still be around. And I am happy to update you on that in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>As regarding your first question, certainly our degree of success has been limited, because if we'd been very successful there would no capital surcharge for SIFI because I think the capital level of the first decision of September of the BCBS was quite sufficient for the industry.</p>
          <p>So as far as the &#x2013; well, French banking model. I think that it is solid and successful and we are going to continue to make that business model, and certainly at BNP Paribas, a success. By adapting we've been &#x2013; I think we're showing that we're flexible and we're going to adapt the business model to the newer environment as it is.</p>
          <p>And we are pragmatic, so if and when things get finalized by regulators this will set the rules. And we are going, as you could expect from BNP Paribas, to play by the rules, but with our full strength of management. I am very impressed in these days how committed, talented and really professional the BNP Paribas teams are.</p>
          <p>I have no &#x2013; I am not concerned once again that we will continue to perform and without being arrogant, I think to continue to outperform quarter-after-quarter in the new environment as we did in the present environment. Thank you.</p>
