        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we start. I speak in English or I try to speak in English, because we have some of your friend in UK, in London or perhaps in U.S. So before talking about the figures, I would like to come back a little bit on the group, and if you remember &#x2013; but I'm sure you remember, the mission of the Group, bring health through food to the largest number of people. And I think it's really important you remind this because I will show you how this mission, which is delivered by all our businesses which &#x2013; how this mission is translated within the different result and the different business.</p>
          <p>We'll speak about the objective, what do we reach. The shape of the group, because I think it's really important you really consider what will be our future and especially in term of geography. Obviously, Unimilk, which is perhaps the biggest platform we have for the future. And two subject very important for us; the Danoners &#x2013; the Danoners are the people working in the group and obviously how do we deliver this result in a sustainable and responsible way.</p>
          <p>If we come back to the results, to be very short, let's say that we overpassed all the result, even the margin, I remember when we said we will deliver stable, 15.3%, many people had a doubt we can reach that, so we don't overpass very strongly, plus 3 basis point. But clearly that was the most difficult target to achieve, especially after the reset effect from the previous year, but Pierre-Andre will come back on that.</p>
          <p>As you know, the line on which I am focusing the more with Emmanuel and Bernard is the free cash flow and for the third year we grew 20%, which means we really think we will achieve the target to 2012, which is &#x20AC;2 billion. So clearly it's &#x2013; now we really think it's something we can reach.</p>
          <p>Now if we switch to the top line, as you can see, the top line growth has been restored. We have back &#x2013; we are back into our ambition, and our ambition was, if you remember, to be the fastest growing company in the consumer good business. So I think we are coming back on that target after the crisis even if I don't think that the crisis is over.</p>
          <p>The good thing is, it's not one shot for one quarter or two quarter, it seems to be really regular, and as you can see, the average is above 6% even in the Q4 &#x2013; and I'm saying even in the Q4 because, as you can see, the Q4 2009 was very strong. So the base of comparison was very strong for us. But you have to remember when do we start the reset and how the reset was implement so that will &#x2013; but again, Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will, I think, explain that in detail.</p>
          <p>If you &#x2013; if we look at that by businesses and by region, as we can see, all the businesses are participating to reach the target, the Dairy at the average. The Waters, it's really good news for us to see how the Waters is growing, because I think that will continue and perhaps even accelerate, because obviously the emerging countries are still growing double-digits. But in the same time, we really restore the market and I'm even not speaking about our brands, but if you look at France and Germany, the market is growing and thanks to the way we are doing that.</p>
          <p>We are really now talking to the consumer about water, not even on our brand but just water, drink water. Obviously, the next step is to ask the consumer to ask our brand more than the other. And I can tell you that not only Danone is doing this strategy, but our main competitor, a Swiss one, is doing in the country where it is strong exactly the same strategy, which is I think a good illustration how to put strengths together to re-build, to re-state the quality of the market.</p>
          <p>If we look at Baby and Medical, nothing to say, except that these two businesses are really contributing to our top line growth and on top of that you know what kind of margin we have in Baby and Medical. So to grow faster in these two businesses is also really helpful in term of mix.</p>
          <p>If I look at the country, good news, Europe is positive. Now Europe is positive and you have to understand that I agree, obviously, Europe is not the growth stream for the company. But having Europe positive when you grow double-digit in the rest of the world, you leverage dramatically the rest of the world. And you will see the new deals for the company.</p>
          <p>So for us, it's clear that we are focused on how to stabilize Europe. So we give a role to Europe and give another one to the emerging countries. And when I am talking about the emerging countries, you see Asia plus 14% and, let's say, rest of the world plus 15%.</p>
          <p>Brands, if we can do that, it's, obviously, because we have strong brands. I will not spend a lot time on this, but you can see how perhaps it means nothing for you to gain 0.9 point market share the world level in Waters, buts it's huge. It's huge. So we gain market share in, let's say, 98%, 96% of all over countries in every businesses.</p>
          <p>We are used in this company to speak about profitable growth but the profitability must participate also &#x2013; or the target must help us also to build the future of the company, and you remember that the reason why we said margin stable 2010. As you can see after very strong growth, we still have a small one in year 2010, but that was exactly what we plan. And as I already said, the most important for us is the free cash flow. We have three years growing plus 20%, plus 21%, plus 20%. As I already said, I think there is no issue to reach the &#x20AC;2 billion by year 2012.</p>
          <p>Now the shape of the group. So obviously with the acquisition of Unimilk, it's one step more in the, let's say, the new shape of the Danone Group, because we really develop our presence in the emerging country. We put there 2010, as you can see, the emerging markets are 49% pro forma 2010 means you can consider that 2011 will be 50%, even more than 50%. If I look at my budget, it's around 51%, 52%.</p>
          <p>On top you have to add U.S., because as you know, we consider U.S. because of the consumption per capita yogurt as an emerging country, so &#x2013; and it's growing double-digit also. So for us, if you add emerging &#x2013; the global emerging country definition of the group, we have more than 60% of our net sales in the emerging country, where I told you we are at double-digit.</p>
          <p>The charts &#x2013; I am not sure you are used to see. You have the ranking of the different countries for Danone in ten year ago, in 2000, and you have the same ranking now in 2010. Again, you can see that including the U.S., six emerging countries are part of the top ten for Danone.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you can see that even if France is still the biggest with 11%. Russia is at the same level and I think its not difficult to understand that within two, three years, you will have perhaps two or three emerging countries in the top five of the company, mechanically, not because France will go down, but because the other one are growing two times, three times, four times faster than France and Spain.</p>
          <p>The other thing I have to say on this chart is the risk. If you look at the world and the world in the future, we have to consider that emerging countries are the growing part of the world, but they are also sometimes little bit risky. That's the reason why since now ten years, we tried to build a kind of balance between the different countries, not in the emerging, but globally speaking if you look at the top ten countries of the group, you can see that everything is between 4% and 11%.</p>
          <p>So if there are risks in terms of &#x2013; I don't know, currency, politics, economics, we think we can at least &#x2013; not control the risk, but balance the risk having good result in another country. I add to the risk also the climatology or the natural risk. If you have earthquake in Chile that will destabilize Chile, but you know that you have Uruguay which will compensate the effect in Chile. And it's really &#x2013; it's not by luck, we want to build a good well balanced portfolio in term of country, even thinking to China.</p>
          <p>We know that China will dominate one day our figures, I don't know when, but one day. We have to build perhaps India, or perhaps we have to develop more our businesses with &#x2013; far as, I mean, Indonesia or look at Mexico. It's exactly the kind of balance we want to build.</p>
          <p>If I switch to the merger and acquisition, nothing every new. As you can see, if we are doing acquisition or if we divest, if we divest this because we have no more interest to keep the business like, you can see Wimm Bill Dann and Huiyuan in China. If we acquire a company, it's because we need a new platform like the one you have in Medical. Medical Nutrition Inc. which is MNI on the chart. It's going to help us to enter a new channel of distribution for the Medical.</p>
          <p>If you look at YoCream in U.S.A., it's exactly the same. It's a new product and a new channel, but perhaps we have project, a new product develop in that category. So we already have a platform to become bigger in the U.S. which is also target for us. We want to become bigger in the U.S., not buying a huge company, but we consider we can accelerate on the Dairy base. We can accelerate our presence in the U.S. The fruits, we already discussed a lot about the fruits. It's a new platform for us, but I will come back on that.</p>
          <p>Unimilk which was on the previous chart, the biggest circle. Unimilk we already explained the strategy for Unimilk. First of all you have to know that we are totally enthusiast about Unimilk, even if it is in Russia, even if Russia is difficult, even if it is not China, blah, blah, blah. Why do we are enthusiast about Unimilk, because you have to understand that with Unimilk we are not running and we are not going to protect the market share of Unimilk. We are not interesting by the market share of Unimilk. We are interesting in the platform that will give us to develop globally our very presence in even perhaps the Baby food, because there is a small business as you can see.</p>
          <p>In a company which is growing faster than the other, with some impact because of the, and Pierre-Andre will come back on that, on the price of milk last year, because of the fire you have everywhere in where the cows are. But short-term, mid-term, long-term, we want to have one day 40%-45% market share, Danone market share, leveraging the brand bottom of the pyramid of Unimilk, but using all their facilities.</p>
          <p>Just imagine that we produce Activia in Chekhov, Moscow. We sell Activia in Siberia. I think it's something like 500 or 600 kilometers, something like this or perhaps less. So you can imagine just the cost of distribution. Tomorrow, but really tomorrow we will produce Activia in Siberia. And I am talking about Siberia, because it's exactly the target we fix tomorrow. We want to build, to produce Activia in Siberia.</p>
          <p>So, where are we now. I was there with Bernard two weeks ago, and we changed the governance of Unimilk. Means we are not going to do as Danone is doing usually. With the agreement or after, let's say, strong discussion with our partner in Russia, we decide directly to put a Danone General Manager and at the end we have Danone General Manager of Danone Russia. Now we have Yves Legros, the guy who developed Japan for us, is totally in charge of Unimilk. We are going really to merge as quick as possible. We are just waiting the building to put everybody in the same place close to Moscow, not in Moscow.</p>
          <p>And I ask especially to Bernard, Bernard Hours, to look at and to drive the synergy plan by &#x2013; through the top-line and also the savings directly. So this is under the responsibility of Bernard, which is very important because we have to express the power of the group in this joint venture. So Bernard will take care of the savings, and Danone people will drive the two businesses. And it's done &#x2013; we have a special board two weeks to agree on this and it's done. So we are going to enter in a more, let's say, Danone vision in this country.</p>
          <p>I think I can jump on this one. You can read it. It's exactly what I explained in term of platform. So Unimilk is going to be one of our best platform for the future.</p>
          <p>The Danoners, few words on the people because I got a lot of question about the world is crazy, it's more and more difficult, the competition, blah, blah, blah. If we deliver the result we deliver or if we will deliver the result we planned for the future that will be just because in Danone you have a team of fighter. These people like competition, love competition, they are ready to fight and they want to win the match.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and we have a lot of matches in every country. So this people as you can see, their engagement rates, which is the most important when you're making that kind of survey we overpass all the score of the consumer good company, with 87% people engaged, 91% of the Danone employee are proud to work for Danone and the &#x2013; every figures are increasing and we measure that every two years very deeply, every year some of the KPI, and let's say 90% consider Danone as a good place to work.</p>
          <p>Now, part of the culture of the company, I will not re-explain everything, but I would like to illustrate to you how what we call the double project or our social innovation project, how do we consider sustainability in the group impacting the business, really the business not the culture of the company. The culture of the company &#x2013; we are working like this since 1970, so we will not change, even if it is more fashionable today than that was 10 year ago.</p>
          <p>First of all, if you look at impact on public health, what does it mean for us. The mission is to bring health to the maximum number of people. So if you are thinking about our price positioning, we are talking in term of public health. If you are thinking about the strategy we have to reach the maximum number of people, bottom of the pyramid. We have, as you know, a strategy which is called bottom of the pyramid. I'm sure you have a lot of question about raw materials. What will be the product range of Danone within 10 years. I think that will be not 100% with milk or dairy, for example. You have to know we have all-ready product redevelop for bottom of the pyramid or redevelop for our Algeria product with 70% milk, 30% vegetable &#x2013; vegetable refined locally.</p>
          <p>So this impact on public health, which is important in term of culture for us and to achieve the mission, on top of that push us to develop new formula, new process, new channel of distribution, less &#x2013; less costly than the other. So it's for us and three elements here on the chart are the way to learn about the future, because it's very easy to say tomorrow we will launch a new product less expensive. No, you have to revisit all the marketing mix, you have to revisit all the post industrial process even the channel of distribution. By the time being, we are learning with all this Danone communities and so on and so on.</p>
          <p>If I switch to the next one, I can see impact of nature, it's exactly the same. I know that whereas in France they canceled the tax on CO2, we put a tax on CO2 within the company. We decide, for example, that Evian is going to be neutral in CO2 by 2012. We are going to reduce 30% of our CO2 impact. We save money by doing this. When we cancel the pick-up on all the buy-four format of Activia, we save money, we achieve the target.</p>
          <p>When we are using now more than 40% in recycle PET to produce the bottle of Evian, we save money. Mid-term we save money, because we will use less PET and PET is petrol. I don't see any reason to see the petrol going &#x2013; the price of the petrol going down.</p>
          <p>In the same time, when we are using &#x2013; launching a bottle of Volvic with vegetable plastic, we are going to save money also. Where do we learn this? Because of the curve of the product we launched in Bangladesh, which help us to find new supplier and new industrial facilities.</p>
          <p>The last one the ecosystem, perhaps you don't know or you miss this, but we decide to create a special fund called Danone Ecosystem, because we are convinced that the role of the company is not just between the four walls. We impact &#x2013; our factory impact around the factory, our edifice also &#x2013; the way we work impact the community around us.</p>
          <p>And just imagine one day we have to close a factory, how that will be more difficult and more expensive, if we don't take care of the economics around us. Because we want to find a job for the people working who are used to work in our factory, which is an example.</p>
          <p>And I will speak about Egypt, very famous country by the time being, like the way we reopened all our factory in Tunisia, Egypt &#x2013; that was eight days suspension or ten days, nothing more. But in Egypt we are creating our own farm. We send cows over there to produce our milk, but we do that through the ecosystem, means all our projects which are include in our ecosystem program coming from the business unit are directly linked to our business, but we are leveraging NGO, we are leveraging people likely to help us to develop that kind of &#x2013; especially, in the emerging country, where we have also deal with our relations with the people of country.</p>
          <p>We also have a farm in Mexico impacting &#x2013; big farm, impacting 10 or 12 small farm around to collect the milk. We improved the way the &#x2013; doing this &#x2013; we improved the efficiency of the cows of these people, because very often in that countries you have two cows, three cows with very, very low efficiency.</p>
          <p>I think I will conclude on this one, which is just to remind you the commitment of Danone to all the stakeholders. I know that is very fashionable, but I really want to express that in Danone it's not a question of fashion. We work for the shareholder, we work for the environment, for the ecosystem, for the consumer and for the shareholder, obviously. So that's the reason why we are very proud about our result.</p>
          <p>And now I let Pierre-Andr&#xE9; comment the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning to all of you. I'll try to go pretty fast on the financial part, which is quite dense and detailed. We thought it was very important for you to have all the elements to assess not only the reported numbers, which are see &#x2013; are shown on the screen in yellow, but also to well understand the breakdown between what is our performance and what is &#x2013; what has been the impact of Unimilk due to first &#x2013; the first consolidation in December. It was important for you. It is important for you to have the elements to access the performance of Danone, which we call stand-alone and that's going to be the green part. And it is important as well for you to understand what is going to be the pro forma for next year and, therefore, what is the base on which we are going to build 2011 and this is in a very nice tableau.</p>
          <p>So I'll go through all that, in fact, I'll first give you some key figures of all these elements. Then I'll walk you through what's the performance of Danone stand-alone has been with all the divisions. Then give you some elements of performance of Unimilk and all the impacts on the group. And then I'll end up with all the reported numbers at group level.</p>
          <p>So first, snapshot on what the group numbers look like. You have a table, therefore, with the green, yellow and purple elements, i.e. Danone stand-alone reported and pro forma. The key points to be taken out from this chart are the following. The first is a good performance on stand-alone. As Franck already told you, we've achieved all our growth. This is true for top line with a 6.8% ex-Unimilk therefore. Top line performance for the year with margin improvement of 3 basis points on a like-for-like basis against stable margin targets with a free cash flow which is extremely strong at over and above &#x20AC;1.7 billion, and an EPS at &#x20AC;2.71 per share on an underlying basis with a growth of 8.5%.</p>
          <p>The second conclusion is that one month of Unimilk already shows in the numbers. It shows in the size of the group. With this one month, the group size is increasing to &#x20AC;17 billion sales. It shows in the pace of growth. Just one month of Unimilk is going to contribute 0.1% additional top line, and it shows in margins as well with 9 bps dilution.</p>
          <p>Obviously, when you look at full-year impact, it has a further impact on our profile. We have sales which are going to be, on the 2010 pro forma basis, in excess of &#x20AC;18 billion. So the size of the group is really changing and with an operating margin which as starting point for next year is 84 bps lower i.e. 14.3%.</p>
          <p>So this is the standpoint if you look at the evolution of sales on top of what's, I already mentioned the interesting points on these charts are the foreign exchange impact, which is positive by 6%. In fact, it's a positive by 6% at all levels. This is true at top line level, but also at operating income level, and we will see at net income level. So it has basically inflated all of our figures by about 6%.</p>
          <p>The second one is the breakdown between the volume and value element in the organic growth of the top line. You see the 6.8% which has been fuelled by 7.6% growth of our volumes and a negative 0.8% in value terms, which of course and we will see that now going through the division has been progressively shifting for the year. And we are ending year 2010 and entering into 2011 with a positive volume, of course, but also with a positive value element. This leads us to &#x20AC;16.5 million sales, then &#x20AC;17 million, then &#x20AC;18 million.</p>
          <p>If you look at the margin, nothing really to add, except may be to comment the first part of the bridge, the three basis points like-for-like, I already discussed. You can see that in addition to that the ForEx has contributed a positive three basis points and the scope for &#x2013; not for Unimilk, but for the rest of the transaction has been contributing a negative 12 bps, which is basically relating to two things, the fruit transaction and secondly, the last impact of Frucor which has been divested at the very beginning of 2009, but still has an impact on the margin in 2010. So on this basis, the stand-alone margin stands at 15.25%, becoming 15.16% in reported and 14.3% in pro forma.</p>
          <p>So all these elements about the whole snapshot being made, I will now go through the stand-alone business and through all the divisions. To start with one word about the top line, what is, I think, important to keep in mind, is that we had a good end of the year 2010, with a 6.4% top line in Q4, which is slightly below year-to-date on a high daily comparison basis, but which is also ahead of consensus; the consensus was 6.1%.</p>
          <p>The second news and you can see that very clearly with the light or the blue shaded boxes is that the pricing improvement which was already noticeable in Q2 and Q3 is definitely confirmed. We are delivering a 1.8% value contribution this quarter. And this is resulting for Q4 in a growth which is not only strong but which is also very balanced between volume and value and I'll get into the details of this now.</p>
          <p>So I'll start with the Fresh Dairy, a solid year end, I think, at 5.4% which is stabilized versus the 5.5% of Q3 as expected. The key emerging countries keep playing their role. This is the case definitely of the U.S., this is the case of Brazil, this is the case of Mexico, this is the case of Russia. All of those have been keeping growing double-digits in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Europe remains solid with continuing pressure in Spain on weak consumer trends, but a good performance in all the other European countries and in particular in France and the UK. And in France the effect of the reset continues to be extremely positive.</p>
          <p>Last point about the brands, Activia is and remains definitely the key driver of the growth of the division. It represents 50% of the increase of sales as this was already case in the third quarter of this year. And we keep using the potential of the brand.</p>
          <p>So, one important element is, of course, the rebalancing of the growth in Dairy after three quarters in 2010, which had been negative in value including the last one, which was at minus 0.1%, so say, stable. We are back to positive pricing and mix contribution. This is on the back of the price increase we had mentioned to you at the time of H1 and Q3, which had been taken in high inflation market, but also in Russia on the back of very sharp increase in the cost of raw material, as Franck already said, due to the exceptional weather conditions, and we have now in Q4 a much more balanced growth than in the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>I think it's interesting not only to have look at the last quarter, but also to have look at things with a broader perspective and in particular to look at the evolution of volume and pricing in Dairy over the past three years. And why over the past three years, because this is exactly the timeframe over which we have had to deal with significant increase of the cost of milk then a decrease of the cost of milk then the re-increase of the cost of milk. And basically we've adjusted our model progressively and, at the same time, going through what has been an economic slowdown in most Western European economies.</p>
          <p>I think the lesson to be drawn from that are very clear, volumes over the period have increased, pricing over the period have increased with ups and down, but they have increased by 4%. And one thing which is not directly readable on the chart, but which is obviously key for us as we enter into 2011, we have also reduced our gap to competition from 126% as percentage to the average global category to 120%. And this is, of course, absolutely important because it means that we have improved our position in terms of gap to competition and, therefore, the ability we have to manage competition in an environment which remains volatile.</p>
          <p>Okay. To end up with Dairy before we have a look at the new products, one word on market share. They keep strengthening; they keep strengthening, obviously, in the key emerging geographies. This is the case of Argentina, Mexico, Russia, which we have on the right. But they also keep strengthening in most of the western European economies or mature markets. This is the case of the U.S. of France, Germany, UK, Spain being the noticeable exception, which relates to the change in the trade and, in particular, to the increase of market share of McDonald's. But overall, market share remains a point of attention. We want to keep building the business medium-term and this is delivering facts against our ambition.</p>
          <p>I won't stay too long on this chart. We can have questions and discussion about that, but clearly we keep working on our products and innovating. The level of innovation in Dairy in 2010 has been 50%, i.e. 50% of the additional sales of the division have come from innovation or renovation or line extension which have been launched in the past two years.</p>
          <p>And I think this shows very much the fact that we keep working on innovating on our portfolio. Obviously, very much on our core product and key products, this is the case of Activia, this is the case of Danonino with My funny yogurt, Yaourt Rigolo, in France, but also on Actimel with Powerfruit and note Greek yogurt, which is a very promising segment, which we keep pushing on in both the U.S., Argentina and Spain.</p>
          <p>So that's really for Dairy. One word about Waters now, the heading I think is very self explanatory. We are entering 2011 with a healthy face. I very often say that, if you want to understand where the performance evolution of Waters is, you have to look at Q1 and Q4. So look at Q4, 5.2% sales growth, which by the way is fully in line with the performance for the year.</p>
          <p>This is very much again driven by the very strong performance in emerging markets, but also by the fact that progressively mature markets are progressing, returning to positive, and this is obviously, the case of France and Germany.</p>
          <p>You can see that extremely clearly on this slide, which is giving you the breakdown between value and volume, where you see that the volume performance, which is essentially driven by emerging, remains strong. And the value element is basically going from significantly negative to slightly negative as a result of the better performance of the Western European economies.</p>
          <p>And on this division, too, we keep launching new products, two examples here. One is the full recyclability of our bottles, our PET bottle in Mexico, so we've reached another gap, another level, which is to have fully recycled bottles. This is a case for Bonafont in Mexico and Qua in India, which is one of the acquisitions, small acquisition of the year. We have acquired a platform of water coming from the EMEA and we'll of course be working on that as a base for the whole of India and the European platform.</p>
          <p>So Waters is good, Dairy very solid, Baby is excellent accelerating out of 2010. We have reached in Q4 performance which is very close to 10%, 9.8%, top-line growth very solid performance still driven very much by our Asian countries, predominantly China and Indonesia, but also by some of the European geographies, UK, Poland and some others.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the performance remains driven by the expansion of the milk category but also by increasing market share on this category. The news of this quarter is that the food part, as opposed to the milk, has been positive and, therefore, is showing some a very positive and reaffirming signs.</p>
          <p>Here as well innovation, I will not explain on that but, clearly, we keep building two very strong platforms on the milk side, one about the immunity with Aptamil and Dumex Gold, the other one with Bebelac which is not shown on these charts. And we have two very strong offers to be brought to the consumer. And in addition, of course, we keep developing and innovating on the food side.</p>
          <p>The last division is Medical, steady growth against what have been a tough basis of comparison. I already commented that in the performance of Q3. This is still valid in Q4, 7.7% with good performance driven by all regions and by all products. France, UK, China, Brazil and Turkey have been the main growth contributor. We grew our market share on most of our key markets, end markets. And pediatrics, gastrointestinal, allergy products and Fortimel Compact, of course, which is being rolled out, are contributing to that growth.</p>
          <p>We will take probably a bit more time to go into the details of the product of this division, which are quite interesting, but a bit far away from our everyday life, during the Investors Seminar we will have in May. But that's really a very interesting category with a lot of potential.</p>
          <p>So that's the evolution of sales by division. If you want to take a geographic perspective, all of our geographies and regions are growing. This is the case of Europe with 1.2% growth. This is the case, of course, more so of Asia with 13% and the rest of the world by 14.4%. So again, as Franck said, most of the growth is coming from our key emerging geographies. But at the same time, Europe remains solid.</p>
          <p>This is it for the sales. A word now about the margin; I'll just switch this one, but just to remind you the performance, 3 bps at 15.25%. This means that in the second half of this year we have delivered an improvement of our margins on a like-for-like basis of 79 basis points on Danone stand-alone to 15.20 and I will not comment further, but basically we have done what we said we will do, i.e. the rebalancing of the margin, which had been extremely debalanced in 2009 and now very much balanced in 2010 with a 15.25%.</p>
          <p>We've done that in a context which was everything but easy. Why not easy, because we've done that on the back of, number one, the end of the reset impact which means negative pricing overall and you can see the minus 71 bps on the chart. And we've done that in a context of increase of raw material, rose in tax which for 2010 have increased by 10% and I don't believe there's been so many sectors with that kind of trend.</p>
          <p>How have we done that. We've basically offset this to impact and stabilize the margin with two things: number one, with the leverage and with the very strong top line. We're also growing our top line which we have delivered. And number two, with productivity and productivity in this slide shows in the input costs which is net of negative 300 growth impact and therefore productivity which has offset more than half of it, through the other COGS and also productivity in the services, and in particular, in the A&amp;P. I will come back on that, but this has contributing &#x20AC;80 million, the productivity on the A&amp;P line.</p>
          <p>So on the COGS line, I won't go further. 10% input cost inflation, &#x20AC;560 million of productivity. This is a record. This is a new level of Danone. This is an ambition , we will have to reproduce in 2011 in a context which, of course, we'll come back on. This is made of strong productivity, again, across the board in all sectors. This is true in industrial. This is true in purchasing. This is true everywhere and this is true, as well, in services.</p>
          <p>A&amp;P, 93 bps improvement and yet we've been able to keep increasing the pressure, we put on the market. How have we done that, with two things. Number one, with as I said &#x20AC;80 million of productivity which have contributed to 50 basis points improvement out of the 93. And secondly, because we have been over the second half, in particular, reducing the intensity level of promotion. And again, what's extremely important is that at the same time we've been able to keep expanding our level of advertising, which has remained stable in percentage of sales and, therefore, expanding in absolute a lot.</p>
          <p>So what does this all give at divisional and a geographic level, as you can see a margin on Dairy, which has been stable. Margin on Waters and Baby Nutrition, which have been expanding on the back of a very solid performance, in particular in Asia. And a Medical Nutrition margin which have been weakening on the back of investments, which we had already flagged in the first half of this year and which we have continued during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Investments in building additional countries and investments as well in the OTC category, which we will keep pushing in 2011. You can find, of course, the consequence of my comments in the geographic breakdown of the margin evolution.</p>
          <p>So that's Danone's stand-alone. One word about Unimilk now. Things are progressing well. Franck gave you the context in which we're operating and the actions we're taking. We're progressing basically with a plan with two elements of context to be kept in mind.</p>
          <p>The first is a surge in milk price, which has been of about 30% in Russia on the back of the forest fires and the heat wave, which has impacted Russia during summer. And the second is dynamics of top line and the focus on market share in top line by the management of Unimilk in 2010 which has been extremely strong.</p>
          <p>So you can see the result of what I said in the numbers. First of all, top line, frankly bigger, over and above what we expected, 24% sales growth. This is the sales growth of the full year. And if you look at the sales growth of December, we're talking of 27%. So throughout the year a very steady volume growth and sales growth for Unimilk, which has in this context continued to gain market share, adding up 1.2 points of market share to it's previous market share of 2009.</p>
          <p>This, of course, as also showing in the margins, which from a record of 6% in 2009 have declined to 2% for the average of the year 2010, and within 2010 from 3% in the first half to about 1% in the second half and the level of margin in December 2010, which stands at 2.68%. This is obviously the direct consequence of the exceptional increase of the cost of milk, which we expect is going to progressively fade away.</p>
          <p>So what does it mean in terms of impact on Danone. It means an impact on the margin pro forma, so for the full year, of negative 93 basis points from the 15.25%, and therefore a margin from &#x2013; as a starting point for next year, which is going to be 14.32%. We're progressing in front of that in this environment.</p>
          <p>We have adjusted the management and Yves Legros is now fully in charge of the management of Unimilk, within a team which is head by Filip Kegels, with the strong supervision of Danone. And we've clear priorities in terms of action plan, we can come back on that. But we have whether on the financial and administrative side with the implementation of plan, whether on the commercial side with the project on the key accounts on the purchasing side, we have very clear synergy streams which are being pushed and followed by the teams locally and which are going very well. They will deliver first synergies as soon as the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>I now move to the reported parts. So again, I won't elaborate too much on that, but &#x20AC;17 billion sales for Danone in 2010, 15.6% of margin -sorry &#x2013; on operating income, which stands altogether at &#x20AC;2.498 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;2.5 billion, which is made of recurring parts, &#x20AC;2.578 but also of some negative other operating or non-recurring items, which are principally linked to some restructuring we have undertaken on our business in Turkey plus the acquisition cost of Unimilk sold for &#x20AC;80 million.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the P&amp;L, so you know the format. You have on the right, the underlying performance of Danone; left to it, the non-current items; and in the column of the middle, the total reported P&amp;L. What's to be noted is in the non-current items column, the effect of the divestment of Wimm Bill Dann in &#x20AC;225 million, financial expenses non-current.</p>
          <p>The impact of the divestment of Huiyuan in the net income of affiliates, &#x20AC;41 million, for total non-recurring element which amount to &#x20AC;200 million. And net income attributable to parents underlying, so recurring of &#x20AC;1.7 billion with financial expenses which have gone down, with a tax rate at 25% and net income of affiliates which are back to positive at &#x20AC;80 million.</p>
          <p>I won't comment on the tax rate. I'll go to the EPS, which is therefore reflecting the progression I've shown adjusted for the number of shares. We're moving from an EPS restated for 2009 at &#x20AC;2.50 to an EPS for 2010 which stands at &#x20AC;2.71, and I'll come back on the dividend, but we'll have the dividend progressing at the same pace as the EPS, i.e. &#x20AC;1.30 versus &#x20AC;1.20, which is 8% increase.</p>
          <p>If you look at the bridge of the EPS evolution, so starting from the &#x20AC;2.50, which is adjusted for the TERP distribution of 2009, we have the last dilutive impact from the capital increase by 5%. We have a negative scope effect which corresponds to the divestment of Wahaha last year. We don't have the performance which we had in our book a year ago.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, a positive 6.3% currency impact and a performance on the like-for-like basis, so the rest of the performance which stands at 12.7%, moving the EPS up to &#x20AC;2.71 per share.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, I've already mentioned that, 20% increase, out of which approximately 6% ForEx, and therefore the rest of the performance is 14%. We are talking reported for the 20%. This is based on CapEx which have remained steady at 4.9% of sales and &#x20AC;832 million and, at the same time, significant working capital improvement and this has been the case, in particular in Baby which has no level of working capital to sales, which is close to that of Dairy at about 4% negative of working capital. So very strong and significant improvements will continue and we will continue on that.</p>
          <p>In fact if you look at the drivers of this, we keep being in a very ambitious and virtuous management of our cash flow which we think is extremely important for the overall performance of the group and for driving the EPS up and this is based on principally working capital but also what we call the <mark type="inaudible" /> in French, which delivers &#x20AC;1.7 billion, so up &#x20AC;300 million versus last year.</p>
          <p>Nothing really to comment on that, you can see the level of dividends paid, &#x20AC;900 million. You see that we have done 50% overall buyback, i.e. &#x20AC;233 million out of the &#x20AC;500 we announced in October of last year. This &#x2013; the other 50% is basically being done as we speak, is going to be completed by the end of the first quarter. And then you can &#x2013; the impact of Unimilk is basically spread over different lines. Antoine and the team can give you all the details which you need.</p>
          <p>This gives a balance sheet which overall remains stable with, however, different effects and I will come back on some of them. A positive, so inflating effect, which comes from the revaluation of the currencies, but also from the performance of the business. A second positive effect which comes from the acquisition of Unimilk, which is adding some intangible, tangible, but also some debt on the liability side. And a negative, or a reduction, which comes from the restatement we have done on the treatment of the goodwill on the put options on minorities, which I will explain you right now.</p>
          <p>So first element, the first consolidation of Unimilk. Again, these are all elements provided to you for you to get the right numbers. But basically we have done the PPA, the preliminary PPA at the beginning of December. This is completed. Unimilk is adding &#x20AC;300 million of goodwill and &#x20AC;278 million of brands. It's adding &#x20AC;400 million of tangible assets. And on the other hand, on a financing part, it's adding up &#x20AC;1.3 billion of debt as this was announced at the time of the acquisition &#x2013; the announcement of the acquisition, and reducing the net equity by &#x20AC;280 million.</p>
          <p>We have identified an envelope of &#x20AC;100 million of integration costs, which are going to be spent and cashed out over the next few years as non-recurring costs. The IFRS 3 is basically making it impossible to keep treating the goodwill on the puts to minorities the same way as we used to treat them before. We are now accounting them, they get directly as a negative to net equity. This is the case of Unimilk. And as a result of that, we've taken the decision to change the accounting treatment for all the production we have in order to have consistent numbers across the board. And therefore, there is an adjustment in the balance sheet of &#x20AC;2.7 billion, which is decreasing the goodwill and decreasing the net equity on the other hand. This is the application of the IFRS 3R and IAS 27, and its consequence &#x2013; a consequence we've decided to take on the existing productions.</p>
          <p>That's all for the financials, I'll now hand over to Franck for to talk to you a bit about 2011 and the way we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a crystal ball, but I will try to explain to you the Danone vision about 2011, trying not to repeat what you already heard from everybody. Very quickly, environment expected remain challenging, not only for 2011. From my point of view, you have to consider this position as a position for the next 10 years. So for me is 2011 and the following still made of depressed consumption in mature economies, still made of strong growth in emerging markets, still made of high volatility and inflation in our raw material and packaging cost.</p>
          <p>The only comment on raw material, we have to be careful to consider the milk totally different than corn or chocolate or coffee, because the speculation is less, less, less impacting the milk, which is a local product, than world raw material, which is a competitive advantage at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>So to conclude on this chart, normally I have to conclude very negatively, but as you know, I am always driven by huge contradiction. I look at the future and I feel it's going to continue to be challenging, but I am totally optimistic about Danone.</p>
          <p>Why? Because if I look at in the past, don't &#x2013; you have to remember the cost of the price milk increased for us two years in the row, &#x20AC;300 million. We cover by productivity and consumer transfer. And the second year, again &#x20AC;300 million, and we cover also. After that it's going down, we reset and, as Pierre-Andr&#xE9; explained, as a competition in fact we have a gap. We can play something with our very strong brand; number one in every market. So it mean that even if we have to do &#x2013; to deal with a price increase of the raw material; first, productivity; second, mix; and third, only price increase to the consumer in a competitive way.</p>
          <p>And I think I explained that last year. We are not going to give air &#x2013; fresh air to our competitor like pushing at our price too much; first of all, productivity; secondly, the mix; and third price increase to the consumer. And if I hear what I hear by the time being it seem that the most impacted brand by the raw material effect are not the brand like Danone &#x2013; are the private label because, obviously, the weight of the raw material is far more important for them than add value product like Activia. But I will comment on that.</p>
          <p>So why I am optimistic, perhaps you would think I am very proud, but I am very proud of Danone. First of all, we have the right categories. We are playing in the fastest categories in the food business.</p>
          <p>If you think about Medical, if you think about Baby food, even Dairy and now even Waters, whatever the feeling about the water in the past, and it's definitely easier to deliver result in a difficult context when your categories are naturally growing, which is exactly the same for the geographies. And as I said, we have the right geographies and the right balance within the right geographies. It's clear that it's for us easier to be &#x2013; to deliver the result to expect in countries which are naturally growing, especially when you are number one, especially when you have the full range of innovation in Western Europe, you can spread all over the world.</p>
          <p>And the good news for us is the fact that innovation is perhaps less coming from France and Spain, because now we have a number of countries like Mexico. If I'm thinking about Dairy, for example, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil which achieve already or will achieve soon the size of &#x20AC;1 billion net sales, which are now innovating for their own countries and the only thing we know in this company is to roll out the best practices and the innovation. And you will see a full range within the next two or three years of product. You've even know emerging we can do. I am not sure they will be even in the Fresh Dairy, even if we are going to leverage the brand.</p>
          <p>I will tell you one thing we spoke last year, the powder under the Danonino brand in Brazil working very, very well. It means a lot of countries are now achievable for us with our brand and less expensive to develop because we will not have the fresh &#x2013; the cold chain to respect, because milk &#x2013; because powder is easier to develop, but we can leverage the brand, the strength of the brand.</p>
          <p>Unimilk, I will not come back. It's a unique opportunity for us, not very far from our base camp, three hours by fly. We have a country which know exactly everything about Fresh Dairy milk. We have the full segmentation from the bottom of the pyramid to the premium premium.</p>
          <p>And something you have to understand, even in a category called Activia, everybody is dreaming about, we have the price segmentation. And I said that since now two or three years. We are not just building price segmentation with product, bottom of the pyramid and the premium. Within the same family, we are using exactly the same segmentation. You have the K3 Activia and you have an Activia with cereals in the cup which is very expensive. And we will develop new product with this Activia brand with another opportunity but on productivity, but I will come back.</p>
          <p>The last is, as I said, we have natural hedging. More and more our raw materials are close to our factory, we produce locally, we sell locally, the consumer is local. So the price of milk, for example, is not the same in every country all over the world. There is very small speculation perhaps more on the milk powder, but on this, we can cover at least six months or seven months.</p>
          <p>So on more than 50% of the group, we have less impact by the raw material increase, because it's a liquid milk. We are using liquid milk, so it's a local production. And as I told you, we start to organize the way we can be involved in the production for our needs.</p>
          <p>The second reason I am positive is what we call our management, strong brands, also the market share. And we continue to say we want to be locally number one with a big gap with number two, why, because of the retail. Just imagine that the biggest retailers for us, the French one, is very important for us, but more and more important in the rest of the world because France is just 11% for us; France is something like 40% for them. So it's a total different level of negotiation, because in Argentina where they are strong, we have 80% market share. So the G4 is very important. But I'm not sure that that will &#x2013; growth will come from Belgium, France, Italy, Spain. I can extend to G5 with Greece. So we think we have, again, a real good position even in that sectors.</p>
          <p>Productivity, Pierre-Andr&#xE9; spoke about productivity. We don't have a huge plan. We are not going to claim 100 basis points because we are going to spend &#x20AC;1 billion to make productivity for a very simple reason. We don't have -we do that every year. Last time I did it, I remember that was in the biscuit, difficult to forget, but since now &#x2013; since this time every year, every year, we are making productivity. It's part of our DNA. And productivity is not only to reduce the number of people or number of factory, productivity will come also through our research.</p>
          <p>Today if you look at the price of classic recipe in Fresh Dairy, it's something like &#x20AC;500 per ton. We know already how to produce recipe &#x20AC;250 per ton, so half the cost just to put the right marketing around. That will come. That will come very soon. I will not comment the last two one, because they are for me to tell your views. So if I give you the priorities, for the first time I give you the management priorities for 2011, which is, I think, a good summary of what we just explained, Pierre-Andr&#xE9; and myself.</p>
          <p>First obviously, we will focus on the system growth in key emerging platform, because it's our future. Means we will continue to invest deeply in this, in that kind of countries. Obviously, the JV Danone-Unimilk. What we call the MICRUBs, which is very important for Fresh Dairy companies. MICRUBs, it's Mexico, Indonesia, China, Russia, USA, Brazil, not very difficult to remember, but clearly we are going to accelerate in the MICRUBs. And obviously profitable top line growth.</p>
          <p>We know that we start new countries where we are losing money, but we know exactly that these countries will make money in the future. So we just have to control how many countries we want to open. That will depend how we stop the decline for example of Western Europe. So you can see that everything is converging in the same direction.</p>
          <p>Strengthening our model. We are by the time being changing, I will not explain now, we will do that perhaps during an Investor Day this year or next year. We are transforming totally the way we connect to the consumer. Why, because it's more and more expensive, because of EFSA, because of everything. So we are not sitting like this waiting; we change. And you will see in some countries, we will &#x2013; as to our marketing people &#x2013; even for a very, very big brand, you are no more allowed to use television, stop. We will see what &#x2013; it's going to be a ladder.</p>
          <p>In another country, we will say this business unit, especially a small one when they don't have money, you stop television and you stop advertising agency, you do by yourself. You connect directly with Apple and Google, because these people are going to help us to save money. Even the way we're making consumer survey, because community is more important for us now than to express ourself about our brands. And you will see some example in the next future.</p>
          <p>So we are transforming the way we connect consumer, means we transform the way we organize our marketing organization. We will continue to innovate, because we want to reach more consumer. It's part of our mission, bring health through food to the maximum number of people. So even at the board level, we follow the number of consumer we reach, more every year.</p>
          <p>So we have to develop new products, we have to develop new channel. We have to reinvent our formula, and we will really do that and you will see new products &#x2013; and you can already see new product, as I said the Danonino powder, we have some fruit product and look at what we develop for Danone communities, or the products we are &#x2013; we will plan to launch with first on a little bit in Algeria, which is 70% vegetable milk. That kind of product, Ambient, will arrive as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we will continue to develop the creditability toward the healthcare professional. I am not talking about EFSA. I am talking about the key OL, because these people drive the community. And as I told you, we are going to spend more and more money on how to connect ourselves directly to the consumer.</p>
          <p>If you look at the new tools of communication, we already multiplied the group level &#x2013; last year, we multiplied by three the money we spend in Internet or Facebook and two more, Google and Apple. I am totally convinced these people will become our advertising agency. So don't repeat that to the advertising business, but I am sure we will have a huge transfer in that sector. That's the reason why all the advertising agency are taking over a lot of small company. I think we can connect ourselves directly, not going through intermediary, which is another way to make productivity.</p>
          <p>Sustain very high cash and productivities; again, we will continue to focus on our cash flow generation. I saw some of you surprised by the level of the working capital in the Baby food. It's another example about what I think is the culture of the company. We are very strong in Fresh Dairy. In Fresh Dairy, it seems easier to deliver that kind of result. It's just because we transfer people from the Fresh Dairy to the Baby food and they decide to do exactly the same, even if they don't have the shelf life, even if there is &#x2013; they can have stock or whatever. They find their way to replicate their culture, their DNA, they learn in the Fresh Dairy in the Baby food.</p>
          <p>It's true for this subject. You will see that it's going to be true also for the marketing. But this will come perhaps more from Nutricia to the Dairy, because Nutricia is already no more working with classic advertising campaign. They are already connect to the consumer and the community through the medical key OL. So we would transfer both side every good practices we have. And that's the reason why, even if I think that for the next 10 years, nothing new in term of raw material or relation with the trade, risk, whatever, that's the new world. We have to learn and we have to use our people to live in that context, but we think we have the right platform to succeed. That's the reason why I am optimistic and confident about Danone perhaps mid-term, long-term. It's their job, not my job.</p>

          <p>And just a couple of more slides, so on the basis of the assumptions described by Franck and the priorities, within the context of the priorities which he has expressed, number-wise, what we will target for 2011 is on the screen. It's top line growth, organic, of 6% to 8% which is going to be fueled by both volume and value, and which is going to be, of course, helped by Unimilk, which we keep expecting to contribute between 50 and 100 basis points of top-line to the entire group.</p>
          <p>Secondly, free cash flow, as you've seen, we're very well in the direction of reaching &#x20AC;2 billion in 2012. Our target this year will be to continue growing our free cash flow and to keep building in this direction, again with the ambition to be at &#x20AC;2 billion in 2012, and I think it looks more and more clear that we'll be there.</p>
          <p>Last, on the development of margin on the like-for-like basis, i.e. that's going to be on the pro forma, which I've shown you in the first part of my finance presentation. We expect to grow margins by approximately 20 basis points. These 20 bps are going to be coming both from Unimilk and from the rest of the business. It's going to be coming &#x2013; zero to 10 from the rest of the business and 10 to 20 from Unimilk.</p>
          <p>And in terms now of splits between the year, it's going to be, of course, given what we've said about the evolution of the cost of raw material, which is going to be increasing faster in the first half than in the second one, given that the synergies are going to be delivered more in the second part of the year by Unimilk. This is going to mean a decrease of the margin in the first half by approximately 20 basis points and an increase during the second half by approx 60 bps, which overall is going to be giving an expansion of 20 bps overall.</p>
          <p>When I say decrease of the margin of 20 bps in the first half, this is going to be entirely explained by Unimilk, the rest of the business being flat. I just want to be very precise on that to &#x2013; for you to be clear about what you can expect from us, and the way this margin expansion is going to be delivered.</p>
          <p>In terms of return to shareholders now, the board is going to propose to the AGM in April a dividend of &#x20AC;1.30 per share. This is an increase completely in line with the increase of the EPS at 8%, and the payment of that is going to be in cash. In cash, because we are now back to a period where we use the share buyback as a tool to adjust our financial structure.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, we've done that for a part in the last quarter of 2010. We complete the first phase in the first quarter of 2011, and thereafter, we'll be keeping buying back shares up to a maximum amount of &#x20AC;500 million during the first half of this year and depending, of course, on the evolution of our cash flow and the credit matrix. But currently, we assess that we can go up to that amount during the first half.</p>
          <p>I will just give the final word to Franck, because there's been some evolution at the board level, which he wants to comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we change &#x2013; the board decide to have some evolution in the board, so you can read then on the chart. So Michel David-Weill will become Honorary Vice Chairman of the Group. And the board and especially myself are very happy to keep Michel, which is after my father, after Daniel Carasso, the guy who was at the beginning of the wonderful journey we have with this company. So to keep the advice of Michel as an Honorary Vice Chairman was very important for us.</p>
          <p>And Jack Nahmias, perhaps you don't know Jacques Nahmias. Jacques Nahmias is the husband of the daughter of Daniel Carasso, a big shareholder of Danone and Danone Spring too &#x2013; son-in-law, sorry. And Jacques for personal reason ask us to retire from the Broad of Danone, but he will continue to be beside us, especially with Daniel Carasso Foundation. They will participate through our Danone Communities plan all across the world.</p>
          <p>So we decide to appoint two new board members, Isabelle Seillier, perhaps you know her working at the head of J.P. Morgan, which is &#x2013; I think it's important for Danone to have a close relation at least with a U.S. bank for our future, for everything. So we are very pleased to have Isabelle and we are not choosing Isabelle because it's a lady, even if it is a lady &#x2013; she is a lady. I think the competence of Isabelle &#x2013; we know quite well Isabelle through the acquisition we did and through the relation we have with this bank.</p>
          <p>The second one is going to be Jean-Michel Severino. If you look at the emerging &#x2013; the way we develop our business in the emerging country, I don't know if there is a paper about Jean-Michel in the slide in the press release. So you will read &#x2013; I will not do all the panegyric of Jean-Michel, but clearly the competences and the connection of Jean-Michel in the emerging country, specially in Africa could be very, very positive and interesting for Danone. So it's &#x2013; I think it's not original, but it's really going to bring something to the Board of Danone, different guide, different origin, different vision, but I think it's going to be very, very positive for the group.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least, Jacques Vincent will be represent as a board member of Danone, but no more as a Vice Chairman. And I personally proposed to the Board to nominate Emmanuel and Bernard as Co-Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. That's I think with this, I said everything.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. C&#xE9;dric Lecasble from Kepler Capital Markets. I have two questions, so first one on your average calculation for 6%, 9% for net impact of commodities and packaging in 2011. Could you maybe help us come to this estimate between milk packaging and the different important parts of your P&amp;L?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Unimilk. Versus the initial comments, it seems that the margin, because of the milk increase in the second part of the year, was more dilutive, or that the absolute margin of Unimilk was lower than we could have thought six months ago. Can you help us &#x2013; we can do the math for the margin expansion, but can you help us understand how you deal with this milk issue and what kind of margin do you expect on a full year basis for &#x2013; or at the end of 2011 on Unimilk and where we should go medium-term, two to three years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the two. The first about Unimilk, indeed the very high inflation on the cost of raw material, and in particular cost of milk, in the latest part of 2010 has brought margins to a level which we did not expect at the time we completed the acquisition. It does change the base on which we are going to build. It does change somehow the targeted margins we have for next year. It does not change the medium term view we have on the evolution of this business.</p>
          <p>So what kind of margin can you expect in 2011, and how that is going to be built? Basically, what I said about the contribution of Unimilk to the improvement of the margin of the group means that we'll have a profitability average of 5% for this business. Obviously, the increase of profitability is going to be skewed far more on the second part of the year than on the first year.</p>
          <p>How will we do that? Number one, because by &#x2013; through price increase, which we have to take as the rest of the market does, and that's the case of Danone and Wimm Bill Dann. But also through a very, very big push on productivity, which we are already doing as we speak, a very big push on synergies as well. And also taking care of the brands which are the essential case of the Unimilk &#x2013; the essential aspect of the Unimilk case, i.e. developing the brands and therefore adding strong consistence and positive effect on the mix of this company.</p>
          <p>So developing T&#xEB;ma, developing &#x2013; keeping developing Prostokvashino. Developing the brands of this portfolio rather than the rest of the portfolio is, of course, very key and that's something we are going to push not only next year, but the following and the following and so on. Okay.</p>
          <p>So that's for Unimilk. About the assumptions from &#x2013; for the evolution of the cost of raw material, I have two things to add to what we said. And we said 6% to 9%. In this 6% to 9%, we expect milk to be increasing, average year to average year, by 5% to 8% and, therefore, the rest of the raw impacts increasing faster and, in particular, the packaging costs.</p>
          <p>Again, if you look at the balancing within the year, it's going to be clearly higher, stronger, let's say about 10% in the first half, just due to the lower base of comparison in the first half of 2010 and lower, around 5%, in the second part of the year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. What is your view on the possibility to get an approval from the EFSA in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is, I don't know. So that the reason why, since now more than one year, we try to speak about our brands without any authorization, and if you can see Activia or Actimel since, in France, for example, in more than one year, you have no more health claim on our advertising.</p>
          <p>In the same time, if you walk in the street in Paris, you will see a huge advertising on Activia, on the Activia program for ladies. And if you go on the internet site of Activia, My Activia program, you will see what we propose, how do we reconnect the consumer on our science basis, on our clinical survey, on our benefits. And I was just in Chile last &#x2013; two weeks ago, and it's fun to see that small countries having less money, they really reinvent the way to connect people and to transfer the health benefit.</p>
          <p>So the way for us is not to spend time on EFSA. We will continue to develop the science. It's going to be more and more positive, as I said, because everybody try to understand, what do we have to deliver to get the green light? But, as I said, we need time, both side, to understand what do they want, what do we have to produce to get the green light. I'm still positive on that. But I have no more, let's say, timing target on that. The day that will come, that will be a good news, not only for us, for the food business, otherwise a lot of companies will stop to invest in research and science, which is going to be very nasty for &#x2013; even for the consumer.</p>
          <p>And I think that kind of argument start to impact the people in Brazil. The good news is, as I said, we have a total support from the key OL. So that's the most important thing for us, because they can claim for us about our product, even if we are no more using the classic TV advertising. But I think you understood that, I think, where our future is more to connect the consumer differently than just with a 30 second ad at 8:30 in the evening. I think we have to really build something new. So positive that will help us or force us to imagine, and it's already done. And in the same time, we are going to continue to work with this institution.</p>
          <p>I will add something on the health positioning of Danone, because clearly we are in an evolution. Means, first of all, we include pleasure in health, and you will see a lot of product coming back in the pleasure segment. And on the other side, you will see, let's say, very, very healthy focused products, but perhaps more on the Nutricia brand. Because if I look at the portfolio of signature or the portfolio of brand we have, and we still not really play that game, it starts from, let's say, Danette, if I take a sub-brand. In the middle you have Activia, and I'm running on the pleasure health, Danette, Activia and Nutricia.</p>
          <p>And you will see a lot of new products, perhaps we will decide, even if they are Fresh Dairy or whatever, we will decide to sign with Nutricia, no more with Danone. Because we have to respect the brand territory, and the way we can stretch the different brand on different territories. So it's something on which we are working, but just imagine that it's a Danone Nutricia company, not only a Danone company.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just on the cost saving, the productivity, &#x20AC;516 million, I just wonder whether you can give us a feel for what kind of figure you think you can achieve in 2011 ex. the synergies from Unimilk?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just in terms of the water business, you referred to the healthy water business in the slides. Obviously, there has been a lot of discussion about your commitment, particularly the to developed side. Are you committed to develop water business, but is there scope maybe for partnerships, in terms of distribution and marketing, that maybe we should look out for in the future? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the second one, very cautiously. Yes, as I always said, the water business of Danone is based on two legs, one is on the major market and the other one, which is now more than 58% of our net sales, growing double-digit as the emerging countries. Within these emerging countries, we have huge success with Bonafont, not only the brand, but the brand positioning of Bonafont. So we are going to roll out the brand positioning of Bonafont. We start, as you know, in Brazil. It's a huge success. We are already number one in the S&#xE3;o Paulo region. We are going to extend, means we have to find &#x2013; and I come to your question with a very local answer, but we can imagine that kind of local answer all over the world.</p>
          <p>First of all, the first synergy was with the Fresh Dairy, because the Fresh Dairy distribution system is distributing Bonafont in S&#xE3;o Paulo. We are looking for some other agreement with somebody else in the rest of the country, perhaps not the Fresh Dairy. In the same time, you have to know to come back to the synergy and Pierre-Andr&#xE9; will answer on that, but for example, how do we reduce our cost of distribution in Fresh Dairy? We distribute some &#x2013; in some countries, some fairly old products and it's a big part of our savings at the logistic level.</p>
          <p>Now for the water, as I said, everything we can do and I know &#x2013; I try to understand your question, everything we can do to develop our brand and the volume behind our brand by joining somebody else stronger than us in a region, in the world, why not? I just remind you that who is distributing Evian in the U.S. &#x2013; Coke, CCE the bottling of Coke, they are distributing our Evian brand in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So, everything we can do to reduce our costs, to increase our volume, we will do it. For a very simple reason, when you are in the water &#x2013; local water, mineral water business, you have the spring, you have factory. And it's not because you sell 10% water more, then you would increase your CapEx or you would increase the number of people or &#x2013; no, it's marginal.</p>
          <p>So, it's directly going in your margin. So if you find somebody to develop your Evian brand, I don't know where &#x2013; in Philippines, which is absolutely not in our target, but if we find somebody to do that &#x2013; if we &#x2013; that will increase the number of the volume we sell ex our factory, that will be helpful in term of productivity and margin improvement for the Evian brand.</p>
          <p>And as you know, we need to reach the consumer so sometimes &#x2013; I think in the U.S., we are ready have an agreement, a distribution agreement, with CCE. If we can do that with somebody else in another country, why not? That's the only comment on the water division.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on productivity &#x2013; and before that, one day, David, you will have to tell me how you do to always be in the first position in the Q&amp;A session by phone. But jokes apart, the answer is pretty simple, we're targeting a level of productivity which is going to be very much in line with that of 2010, so around &#x20AC;500.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Franck, Pierre-Andre, Antoine. Can I ask two questions, please? The first one is, could you elaborate a bit on the performance within Dairy in Q4, in Europe specifically, and your outlook for 2011? I'm particularly interested in Actimel, because the Nielsen data has been very weak for Actimel in Western Europe in Q4. And I was wondering what your plans are to reinvigorate that brand? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one &#x2013; second question more for Pierre-Andr&#xE9;, on the margin guidance for 2011. You're now saying down 93 basis points from Unimilk, you were previously saying down 70 basis points. And you're saying 20 basis points underlying. So that would be down 73 basis points reported, which would give me a margin of nearer 14.4% for 2011 reported, compared to consensus of 14.7%. Would you to be more comfortable with a margin reported nearer 14.4%, 14.5% for 2011 compared to the consensus of 14.7%? I know it's a specific question, but you were giving specific margin guidance, so hopefully you can help me on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To answer the first one, so just to clarify the 70, 7-0 which I gave, was 70 for the first full year after closing, which means 2011. So to me, there is no contradiction between the 93, which is a 2010 number, and the 70, which is a 2011 number. Now the reality is that the 93 is, yes, a bit in excess of what we had forecasted. And the sum of the elements I gave you about Unimilk means that its impact in 2011 is going to be in excess of 70.</p>
          <p>Now, just to make things simple, because I think after a while &#x2013; and this a reason why we have built a pro forma, you need to be simple on that. The pro forma says, if we had had Unimilk for one full year in 2010, the margin would have been 14.3%, okay? Which means, that when we do the like-for-like exercise next year, we'll have something around 14.3% then, plus or minus the evolution of the currencies and other possible scope impacts. And this is to this base, 14.3%, that the 20 bps forecast of increased margin, like-for-like, applies. And I hope it clarifies the topic, so a basis of 14.3%, 20 bps on that and that's it. On, yeah...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer to the first one, which is a really good question. First, though, there is many thing; first of all on Nielsen and the other one be careful, because first of all, we are not using Nielsen everywhere, because the coverage is not always 100% of the distribution channel. If you take the U.S. for example, you don't have Wal-Mart. If you take Europe, you don't have the hard discount. So it depends where we are developing the brand or not.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to Actimel, it's true that the health benefit of Actimel is the most difficult to really transfer to the consumer. That the reason why, since now many years, you just have to look at the evolution of Activia versus Actimel. It's clear that we focused, and all the teams are focusing on Activia. And when we open in new country we launch Activia, we don't launch Actimel. It's much more longer.</p>
          <p>So clearly the focus was on Activia, not on Actimel. Actimel is a little bit positive, but stable. Now in Europe, the biggest country of Actimel is Spain. And Actimel is the most expensive product in a country which is close to be an economic disaster and a country where we have a retail customer called <mark type="inaudible" /> decide &#x2013; which decide to cancel something like 10% or 20%, depend the company or depend the strength of the SKUs in the shelf, to promote dramatically the private label. That's the reason why Actimel is really impact in Europe.</p>
          <p>What are we going to do? We didn't know, but in term of innovation, Pierre-Andre present to you a fruit Actimel in Germany, we just launch. It's less expensive, same fermentation, same benefit, so it's a lab. We &#x2013; it's working correctly. So I will be not surprised to see some new extension, new formula or, let's say, to reinvent Actimel, and it's exactly what we are going to do within the next months. Not sure we will focus that in a major country. Perhaps we will launch an Actimel with the new formula having the same health claim, but in emerging country, to really benefit of the growth. That's the idea behind Actimel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have time just for one last question which we'll take from the room, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon Marshall-Lockyer from Jefferies. Just a couple of questions. Can you give us some idea maybe of what &#x2013; in the 1.2% growth out of Western Europe you achieved in 2010, how much &#x2013; do you have an estimate of how much the PIGS impact was? Franck, you were talking about Spain and how difficult that was, do you have an idea of how much that drag is, overall, on your growth for &#x2013; can you circle back on that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, maybe can you make a broader comment in terms of, you were saying something, Franck, earlier on about the Middle East and the developments in the Middle East geopolitically. Give us some idea of magnitude of impact? That's the first &#x2013; sorry, that's the first question. Beg your pardon. Then could I ask you, possibly, can you say something about your market shares in Fresh Dairy in the United States? Just give us an update in terms of developments...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Market share in the U.S., first of all, the U.S. business is growing double-digit .So we are very satisfied about the U.S. performance due to the reset. So you can't read that directly, as I said, in the market share, because they are not covering Wal-Mart. And as you remember, we said we really focused on Wal-Mart. Because when you have success with Wal-Mart, you'll be sure that the other one will follow. So we put all our effort on Wal-Mart. And as you know, we even developed private label for Wal-Mart to develop our relationship with them tactically. So we have no issue on the market share in the U.S. And as I said, we are two players. Until the two players are launching innovation and driving the market, the country is big, with 5 kilos per year per capita, so it's clearly for us, a huge potential.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; not the second one, but the second part of the first one, was &#x2013; is the Middle East. The Middle East, we have to be very transparent. The Middle East is part of our strategy for the future. If you look at our position in Tunisia, in Algeria, in Egypt, even in Saudi Arabia &#x2013; if I look at all the zone, even in Iraq, because we export some product in this country. Clearly, it's part of the future of the group. And in the country I just mentioned, as you know, we are already number one.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, it's always less than 1% of our net sales. And the different, even we ask to our French manager or foreign management to quit the countries. I think that was two weeks or one week and a half, something like this. We'll reopen the factory. We'll find a way to debark the cows, because we just have the cows in the port of Egypt at this time. So three of them died, sad, but the other one are okay.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; this is part of the risk I was just describe. But that will not change the &#x2013; our mind-set about where do we have to build the future of the group. Algeria is still a priority. We don't have to make politics. We don't have to look at the bumpy &#x2013; short-term bumpy we have in front of us. The awareness of our brand in these countries are already incredibly strong, and I'm sure that the new ways of connecting the consumer will be even more efficient in this &#x2013; in that kind of countries &#x2013; we get the illustration in the last two weeks &#x2013; than in the major market. So they are still in our focus, even if there is some difficulties by the time being, but there is &#x2013; not really impacting long, mid even short-term.</p>

          <p>And to answer the first part of your question, indeed, the PIGS and primarily Spain, but also Portugal and Italy, have been negative in the fourth quarter. They continue to be negative. I will say by approx mid single-digit. And the rest of Europe, and in particular the key big countries, have been positive. This is the case of France, where all of our business units &#x2013; so all businesses have been growing. This is the case of the UK, where the Dairy, Baby and Medical have been growing. This is the case of Germany, where all the businesses have been have been growing. So you're right to find that there is a contrasted situation between the PIGS, the South of Europe, and the rest of the countries.</p>

          <p>Yeah, just to come back on your question, we are in the consumer goods business. Even if you think we are premium product, as I told you, since now many years, we tried to have a &#x2013; let's say, the full range of offer for consumer. So okay, Actimel could be more impact but we know &#x2013; everything we learned from what we do in Bangladesh, it's something we learn. We can replicate that in a major country. So it's true that, when I look at what happened even in the UK, for example, with this incredibly stronger, let's say, productivity plan at the country level, I already asked to Bernard to really look at what are the impact on our brand to see what kind of solution we have if the consumption collapse.</p>
          <p>But we have the solution. We know we have the solution, means all the productivity we develop to launch a &#x20AC;0.08 Fresh Dairy product in Bangladesh or in Algeria means we have the recipe. We have the marketing tools. We already know how to do it. Perhaps we can even launch that kind of product in difficult countries, but not at the cheapest price, at an average price with good marketing around. So Danone is not a company which is going to be, let's say, like this, waiting a better time to deliver results. We know we can fight against this.</p>
          <p>Now come back to Pierre-Andr&#xE9; said, we look at Ireland, we look at Greece, we look at UK, our brand are even not resisting, they continue to grow. Again, it's also because, like I said, the ratio quality price we have with Activia, we have on top of the health benefit, which is helpful. That's the best yogurt you can find. That's all.</p>
          <p>In the same time, when I'm talking about how to connect the consumer, and I think that will be interesting to present to you, how we're going to organize our marketing department. It's very important to understand that, even if the digital will push us in the future, in the same time we have to go back in the past. The quality of the product &#x2013; we must have the product manager in charge of the P&amp;L. No more spending time with I don't what and &#x2013; so we have to go back to the basic. In the same time, we have to transform the tools of communication.</p>
          <p>And how do we &#x2013; how &#x2013; as he said, productivity is everywhere, everywhere. We just have to invent the productivity, not just think that productivity is to close a factory. We have to reinvent everything within the company to save money. It's a question of mindset more than a big restructuring plan. And we are exactly in this mood in the Danone Group by the time being, because, through your question, I can tell you, you are right. You call it the PIGS and that will be difficult when you will have to put an F somewhere. Because France will have to deal with the same thing when they are another. It's my assumption, I told you. My job is not to have a crystal ball to look at the future; my job is to take the right assumption to be sure we put the ski in the right basalt.</p>
          <p>My assumption is &#x2013; and that's the reason why I told you, 2011, nothing new. Business as usual, challenging as 2010, but not 2011. The next 10 years are going to be like this. It's my assumption. Within this context, we have to find our way to continue to grow and to deliver a profitable growth. We not stop on that. That's the reason why- last year we said margins stable, because we build. We know what we build. We will build Unimilk. We will succeed in Russia and within two years, three years we will have 40% of the market with a margin we have to add the Danone in Russia and the Unimilk. It's a little bit early to really say what will be the margin.</p>
          <p>We have a good context that the number two, the number two guy in Russia is now belonging to a U.S. company you know very well. I hope for once you will not ask me the question about my wish. I am the number one player in Fresh Dairy &#x2013; I am, they are not. They have to learn. It's a good context.</p>
          <p>So okay there is danger, there is positive, there is negative, but we don't have to lose the context. We have to fight to deliver what we plan to &#x2013; what we explain to you as the target for 2011. That's all. It's our job.</p>
