          <p>And to begin the results presentation for the first semester of 2011. To repeat the procedure, after the presentation, we'll have questions from the floor, by phone and we'll end up with questions via the website. And I'll hand the floor over to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Mr. Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you all very much. As usual, I thank you for your presence, both those of you that are here and those that are connected via phone or the website. We'll have the structure just mentioned by <mark type="ph" /> Ignacio (0:47). I'll comment on the highlights for the first half of 2011, and then the Financial Officer will explain the details for the period and the financial position of the group and then finally, we'll have questions.</p>
          <p>The net profit for the first semester was &#x20AC;1.564 billion, with a growth of 9.4% in recurring terms, thanks to the positive performance of the group, both in operating and financial terms. From the offering point of view, the balanced business portfolio enabled us to continue to improve our results, as we have done in recent years. This improvement is reflected by an increase of 3% in the gross margin, in spite of the situation of the liberalized business in the United Kingdom that you are all aware of.</p>
          <p>We have deepened further cost reduction measures, which, together with the growth in the margin, has enabled us to improve efficiency by 6%. As a consequence, EBITDA is increased by 4.4% to more than &#x20AC;4 billion in just six months. From the financial point of view, during the semester, it's been a particularly intense semester. We have carried out a number of operations with which we have continued to strengthen our balance sheet structure. With this, we have been able to contain financial expenses and improve liquidity, which currently covers the needs for 24 months. This has brought about a significant improvement in our financial ratios, based on an increase of 6.4% in cash generation that the Financial Director will explain later.</p>
          <p>Regarding the highlights for the period, during the second quarter, we have closed two very significant operations from the strategic point of view, the acquisition of Elektro in Brazil, and the merger with Iberdrola Renovables. At the end of April, we completed the integration of Elektro, and in just two months, it has contributed &#x20AC;80 million to the consolidated EBITDA. Regarding the merger with Iberdrola Renewables, the operation was completed, thanks to the support received, not only from the Iberdrola shareholders, but also from those of Iberdrola Renovables, over 74% of which, have voted in favor of the operation.</p>
          <p>This high degree of acceptance reflects the level of general welcome for the proposals submitted at the shareholders meeting. And at the Iberdrola shareholders meeting, there was a historic forum of over 82%, thanks to over 170,000 attendance cards received. This has been an increase of over 50% in the last three years.</p>
          <p>Regarding the vote, the votes in favor were between 79% and 95%, and the vote against was less than 1% in 12 of the 17 points on the agenda, and none of the items on the agenda had a negative vote of more than 16%. This clearly reaffirms the support of the shareholders for the increase in the industrial model that has been implemented in recent years, and this support received will help the 33,000 employees to continue with our efforts day by day to defend the company interest.</p>
          <p>Moving onto comment on the main aspects for the results of the period, I would like to highlight that during the six months of 2011, the group has continued to show very strong position from the operating point of view. During the period, there has been a significant increase in gross margin in spite of the economic situation, an increase of 3% to &#x20AC;6.114 billion. The positive performance of the regulated business that reflects out of the improvements achieved in the remuneration of the various businesses in the group and the incremental contribution of Elektro in Brazil together with the growth in Iberdrola Renewables, whose gross margin grew by 11%, driven by the good performance of wind power activities, the production of which has increased for the first time and has exceeded both hydroelectric and nuclear production. That's the first time wind production has surpassed traditional hydroelectricity and nuclear production.</p>
          <p>This has more than compensated the drop in the liberalized business affected by the narrowing of margins in the UK. Regarding expenses, the group has reacted in the operating area in the semester and costs have fallen an additional 3.2%. Savings have been obtained both in net personnel expenses, which improved 5% and in external services, which have been reduced by 1%. One of the key factors to obtain savings has been the reorganization of the group in the global business areas. And in this sense, we can highlight the reduction in costs in the regulated business thanks to efficiency improvements obtained in the United States and cost reductions in Spain.</p>
          <p>The operating costs in Brazil increased mainly because of the contribution of electro. But this has been practically offset by the lower cost in the divestment of the Connecticut gas companies carried out last year. Regarding the liberalized business, net operating expenses increased 4% because of the increase of the costs related to the increase in commercial activity in Spain.</p>
          <p>Finally, Iberdrola renewables has improved the operating cost ratio per megawatt by another 8%. The improvement in gross margin together with cost savings has made it possible to obtain an increase of 4.4% in EBITDA, amounting to &#x20AC;4 billion, and by businesses, we should highlight on the one hand, the good operations in the regulated activity driven by the increase in gross margin and the efficiency improvements, and the worst performance in the liberalized business affected not only by the complex operating environment in the United Kingdom, but also by the increase in levies in Spain as a result of nuclear taxes and local levels, which in the semester, amounted to &#x20AC;265 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, we should point out that EBITDA growth was 6% in like-for-like terns, in other words, after excluding the contribution of the divested assets in 2010 and the Brazilian company, Elektro.</p>
          <p>Regarding the balance sheet management during the first semester, we have continued to optimize our financial solidity and liquidity, and this is becoming especially important in the current environment of the financial markets. And we can say that the prudent management carried out in recent years and very especially during these last six months enabled us to face the future from a tremendously comfortable position.</p>
          <p>And this is the case because at Iberdrola, the door to financing markets is open under very competitive conditions. In the last six months, the companies in our group have carried out operations in euros, pounds, dollars and Brazilian euros amounting to over &#x20AC;6 billion. These operations have enabled us to improve the debt profile whose average maturity is more than six years, has enabled us to maintain liquidity over &#x20AC;10 billion after coping with the payment for the acquisition of Elektro, and the plan for the repurchasing of shares linked to the merger operation for Iberdrola Renewables. Today, the group has its financial needs covered for the next two years.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would like to highlight that Iberdrola during this year has collected over &#x20AC;2.1 billion related to the tariff deficit. We hope that the situation of the markets will improve in the next few weeks or days, and that issues linked to the deficit can continue according to the plans of the Ministry for Industry and Economy.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of all these financial management measures, the rating agencies of Moody's and Fitch have reaffirmed the level A rating in recent months. And in the case of Moody's there has also been an improvement in the prospects to stable. This performance in debt and in company equity make the increase in the solidity of our balance sheet obvious. Also, the increase in operating cash flow together with the investment controls and the collection of amounts owed because of the tariff deficit in Spain has made it possible to reduce the debt by &#x20AC;1.5 billion in spite of the payment for the Renewables operation.</p>
          <p>The net value increased by &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;32.3 billion and leverage is 44%, representing an improvement of more than two points compared to 12 months ago. Additionally, the main financial ratios have experienced a considerable improvement, as the Chief Financial Officer will explain. The solid evolution in operations and the improvement in the financial position for the company has been translated into an increase of 9.4% in the recurring net profit and 6.6% in the total net profit, amounting to more than &#x20AC;1.5 billion. And finally, I would like to mention the continuous increase in the operating cash flow, increase by 6.4% to close to &#x20AC;3 billion, showing that the Iberdrola industrial growth model is capable of generating results and cash in any financial and market environment.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand the floor over to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, so that he can comment on this in greater detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And starting off with the initial transparency, it has to be said that the company has been growing in all the business lines in this first semester. It's a very complex semester, because of what is happening with the slumps in demand. And this growth has to do with all the business lines with &#x2013; we're talking about 4.4% net of profits have gone up 6.6%. In recurrent terms, we are talking about 9.4%. So in other words, it's nearly 10%.</p>
          <p>So what we have to point in this semester, we've had variations in the consolidation perimeter. We've had the incorporation of Elektro since May 1, which currently compensates the effects arising from the sale of the gas companies in the United States and the electrical business in Guatemala. The net affected by type or rate of exchange has been negative this semester as regards the EBITDA, and we have deducted &#x20AC;12 million due to the devaluation of the dollar by 4.2%.</p>
          <p>And as was already pointed out by the president, the gross margin has increased 3%, and now stands at &#x20AC;6.113 billion although the rate of exchange has deducted &#x20AC;20 million, and also because of the diversified business model of the group with growth in the regulated business and in renewables and in the liberalized business if we were to exclude the United Kingdom, allows us to compensate the weak behavior of this business in the UK that has dropped &#x20AC;195 million.</p>
          <p>The consolidation of Elektro that has provided &#x20AC;113 million allows us to partially compensate the &#x20AC;193 million of the assets sold in the United States and Guatemala. Although we have improved the balance of the businesses thanks to Elektro, we're losing more because of the sales of the businesses in the United States and Guatemala. The basic margin has gone up 3% in line with gross margin, because the worth of the allocated emission rights is the same as we had in 2010.</p>
          <p>And as was already pointed out by the president, net operating expenses have improved by 3.2%, and the lower expenses arising from the deconsolidation of the Guatemala and Connecticut businesses, that is something like &#x20AC;49 million, are compensated by the costs associated with the incorporation of Elektro and the buying operation, representing &#x20AC;40 million.</p>
          <p>Staff expenses have been reduced by 0.4% and the average size of the staff has been reduced 4%. And the external services have undergone a reduction of 0.9% and now stands at &#x20AC;859 million. And we have contention in the regulated business, because in the first quarter, although there was a very big drop in the case of expenses related to external services, the comparative analysis was not homogeneous, whereas now it is. And the net operating expenses, recurrent expenses are reduced even further, 3.8% instead of 3.2%, which is what we had before. And then we have levies with an increase of 14.7% and now stands at &#x20AC;515 million due to the increase in the liberalized business in Spain.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned before, should we have maintained the same consolidation perimeter, the consolidated pro forma EBITDA would have grown nearly 6%. In other words, it's 5.7% and it's been the sales of the businesses in the United States and Guatemala that have made the EBITDA growth to be reduced to 4.4%. And it has to be pointed out that this 4.4% growth has happened and although, as you can see in the transparency, levies have grown nearly 15%, if we would have had an increase &#x2013; if we wouldn't have had such a big increase in levies, EBITDA would've grown much more.</p>
          <p>As the president pointed out, EBITDA growth is based on our diversified business model which has been reinforced by the growth of the more stable businesses with less risks, as the case of the regulated business that's gone up 18% and Renewables that have gone up 11% and which provides 67% of the total EBITDA and which is to compensate the greater variability or volatility of this business.</p>
          <p>And by &#x2013; moving on now to the regulated business, that provides an EBITDA of nearly &#x20AC;2 billion in the first six months. This includes Spain, the UK, the United States and for the first time Brazil, after incorporating Elektro, and growth has been 18.4% and the total of the EBITDA of the Regulated business, which has improved growth by 7.4% in the gross margin thanks to the 13% reduction operating expenses. All the business areas have provided growth, and they've been boosted by the regulatory improvements in Spain, the UK and the States.</p>
          <p>Cost savings and synergies arising from the implementation of the same standards and best practices within the business as a whole. The Regulated business in Spain is the one that provides both 41% of the EBITDA, the UK 22%, the United States 18%, and Brazil totals 19%.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to give you the details of the results. The EBITDA of the regulated business in Spain grows 25.3% and now stands at <mark type="ph" /> &#x20AC;780.4 million (17:02) thanks to a 15% increase in the gross margin and thanks to an improvement of 11.8% in net operating expense. And the growth we have in the gross margins is because of the increase in income or revenues for the Regulated business. And in the first months of 2010, we had a temporary remuneration that was lower that was approved after the publication of the ministerial order on rates based on the reference grid. So that means that the regulated revenues cannot be compared or at least, they couldn't be until the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And then we have the growth of 25.3% in EBITDA, which exceeds 15% of what we had in the gross margins thanks to the improvements that have been reported and net operating expenses that have dropped by 11.8%. The Regulated business of the UK has reached an EBITDA of &#x20AC;412 million, which is a growth of 13.2%, because there's been a 12% increase in the gross margin due to the larger investments made and programmed by the new remuneration of the business, which is DPCR5 that has been in force since April 1, 2010.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have grown at 5.9% below the level we have seen in the case of the gross margin, and this has improved the efficiency of the business, and this progression has been normalized in relation to the greater increase we saw in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And the regulated business in the United States provides an EBITDA of &#x20AC;335 million under the IFRS standard, which represents a growth of 2.1%. And this positive development has been achieved even though we, in spite of the sale of the business in Connecticut, which has represented &#x20AC;87 million less in EBITDA. So we're talking about 39% growth, because there has been operating improvements in businesses, because rates have increased, and because of the contribution made by the main transport line.</p>
          <p>And the effect of the rate of exchange is negative, because of the devaluation of the dollar, which has been compensated partially by the transfer of the results of the U.S. government regulations to the IFRS, which provides &#x20AC;11 million more to the EBITDA.</p>
          <p>And  the EBITDA of Brazil has increased 28.8% and now stands at &#x20AC;364 million after incorporating Elektro into the consolidation perimeter since May 1 with &#x20AC;80 million. And the revaluation of the real has provided &#x20AC;14 million in terms of growth. And this growth has been sped up by the growth in electrical demand, in Brazil 4%, and by the new hydraulic plants that have been commissioned. And EBITDA with Elektro would grow 0.5% because in 2010, there were &#x20AC;17 million more in positive settlement.</p>
          <p>The gross margin of the business has reported an increase of 34.6%. Of the &#x20AC;113 million or of them, &#x20AC;113 million have to do with the incorporation of Elektro. The GON has gone up 54.1 and after this incorporation and because of the effect caused by rate of exchange and by the increases due to our inflation and the greater activity.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to move onto the units in Spain, UK and Mexico. The EBITDA of the liberalized business has dropped 14.7% and now stands at &#x20AC;1,290 million. The <mark type="ph" /> expensive (20:33) behavior of the business in Spain, whose EBITDA has grown 2.1% and represents 52% of the total, in spite of the strong increase in the levies paid, does not manage to compensate the slumps in the other two businesses in the UK, whose EBITDA has dropped 53.7% because of the lower margins and sales and a 14.7% decline in the Mexican business that has been affected by the sale of the business in Guatemala and the devaluation of the dollar.</p>
          <p>But talking about the liberalized business in Spain, the production levels have been reduced 12.3% basically because the 26% slump in hydraulic production. However, 80% of the production is still free of emissions.  And the average price is &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour, which has given us greater margins, although we have growing provisioning costs. And in this context, the EBITDA has grown 2.1% and now stands at &#x20AC;931 million because of an improvement in the basic margin.</p>
          <p>7.6%, it now has reached &#x20AC;1.5 billion. And although there's been nearly a 40% increase in what applies to levies and there's a positive effect, a non-recurrent positive effect totaling &#x20AC;100 million related to the provisions of previous year. And the operating expenses have grown less than the basic margin of 5.2%. And the increase of expenses linked to high levels of activities has been compensated by the efficiency actions that have been implemented. 98% of the production that has been estimated for 2011 is being sold above &#x20AC;58 per megawatt hour and we already have sold 33 terawatt hour for 2012, above &#x20AC;60 megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Look, as I said, the EBITDA growth in the liberalized business has been affected by an increase of 38% in levies, &#x20AC;265 million, and it represents almost 30% of this EBITDA. And effective the last two years, levies in this business have increased by over &#x20AC;100 million from &#x20AC;158 million in the first semester of 2009 to 265. Most &#x2013; up to &#x20AC;172 million is a result of the new nuclear taxes that together, nuclear taxes amount to &#x20AC;97 million. And the new taxes related to funding the saving and energy efficiency plan and the social bonus. And it has to be said this, because it seems as if they need to add more taxes, but we've already had a lot of levies added in the last two years. The rest of the levies represent another &#x20AC;93 million, include the Extremadura eco levy, although we have appealed between the Extremadura government and the Supreme Court of Justice.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the liberalized business in the UK presents a drop of 53.7% to &#x20AC;182 million. This negative performance is a result of lower margins, lower sales, and also, our non-favorable comparison with the first semester of 2010. And sales in the retail gas area were especially good because of the favorable climate.</p>
          <p>The basic margin had a drop of 30% in an environment of a drop in sales, as we can see on the slide. Electricity sales dropped 4% and gas 17%, and very low spreads, with high supply costs that have not been compensated by an equivalent increase in the sales price for electricity. There's also a low availability of the plants, which has meant a reduction in output. However, the business is close to its turning point. We estimate that during the second semester of the year, there will be a progressive recovery of the margins both in electricity and gas, with an increase in the unit margin as a result of the increase in tariffs that will be applied from August 1. And this will be especially significant, this impact, in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for the liberalized business in Mexico fell 14.7% to &#x20AC;176 million. The exchange rate effect is minus 4.2%. On the other hand, there is an impact of the selling of the business in Guatemala, which reduced EBITDA by &#x20AC;24 million. And the underlying operation performance of the business improved by 2%. Regarding Renewables, the operating capacity increased 14.1% to 12,792 megawatts, while installed capacity increased 13.8% to 12,977 megawatts. The average load factor was 27.4%, above the 27% one year ago. This means an increase in output of 16.8% to 15 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>As the Chairman said, more than the hydraulic and the nuclear output for the group, prices were &#x20AC;64.5 per megawatt hour, somewhat below the &#x20AC;67.9 for the same period last year because of the greater weight of the business in the U.S. Additionally, efforts have continued to control expenses and the OpEx per operating megawatt has improved by 8%. The total EBITDA for the business grew 11.1% to &#x20AC;785 million. The EBITDA for the Renewable business increased 10% to &#x20AC;755 million.</p>
          <p>This good performance in the Renewable business contrasts with the weak contribution of the Gas business, affected by the weakness of prices in the U.S. Although there is a positive effect in mark to market of &#x20AC;32 million versus a negative impact last year of &#x20AC;33 million. And this makes the total EBITDA for the company &#x20AC;785 million.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA for other businesses had an increase of 37.7% to &#x20AC;67 million, because of the improvement in engineering margins associated to the shutdown of several international projects where the group has been working, such as the case of Qatar, Egypt, Russia, et cetera. And this more than compensates the weakness of the rest of the other businesses that mainly include real estate and other industrial shareholdings, and there is an effort in cost reduction which has led to an improvement of around 10%.</p>
          <p>The group EBIT rose 5.1% to &#x20AC;2.626 billion. Amortizations and provisions increased 3%, with a 5.4% increase in amortizations and a drop of 25.1% in the provisions that are not recurring in 2010. Amortizations were &#x20AC;1.3 billion because of the incorporation of Elektro, and investments in the Regulated business. Provisions dropped 25% since in the first quarter of 2010, nonrecurring provisions were provided for real estate assets and others that have increased the comparison base. The financial result improved 23.6%, thanks to the impact of the exchange rate hedging for the result of the subsidiaries in other currencies.</p>
          <p>Iberdrola continues to be faithful to its policy of reducing the net volatility by partially hedging the subsidiaries through financial derivatives. There's a slight improvement in the debt compared to 2010 as a result of a reduction of the debt to 6.4% as a result of the policy to contain the investment and the starting of the securitization of the deficit. On the other hand, the higher remuneration rate for the deficit had a positive impact of &#x20AC;12 million. This is a remuneration system linked to the three-month Euribor for the previous year, which in 2010 was 0.7 and in 2011, 1.05.</p>
          <p>The net recurring profit shows an increase of 9.4% to &#x20AC;1,448 million. The smaller contribution of non-recurring profits is compensated with lower financial expenses and the lower tax rate as a result of the 1% drop in the tax rate in the UK that was applied in March 2011. As a consequence, the reported net profit grew 6.6% to &#x20AC;1.563 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to financing, in the first semester of 2011, there has been a reduction in the tariff deficit pending collection to &#x20AC;3.5 billion, in other words, 33% less. There has been a new deficit of &#x20AC;542 million and &#x20AC;2.106 billion have been collected through the securitizations, to which we have to add another &#x20AC;178 million through the usual settlements. And it has to be said that the bank's place in the fifth and sixth issue have already been chosen by the Treasury and they are working to see which is the most suitable time to issue the next tranche of tariff deficit, and this will be done as soon as there is an opportunity on the market.</p>
          <p>However, as a result of the difficult market conditions, there has been a delay in the deficit securitization process which has been extended one year. The deficit generated by the system in the first semester is in line with government expectations, finishing the year with &#x20AC;3 billion. The company has continued with its policy to strengthen the balance sheet in the first semester of 2011. The net debt, not considering the tariff deficit, was &#x20AC;25.779 billion, &#x20AC;1.430 billion less than the &#x20AC;27 billion in June 2010, even after the payment of Elektro, as well as repurchasing 4% of the shares, as the Chairman said.</p>
          <p>So in this second quarter, the group has disbursed &#x20AC;3.5 billion, and in spite of disbursing &#x20AC;3.5 billion for Elektro, plus the purchase of the portfolio, we are continuing to improve our leverage, and this shows the cash generation capability of the group. Therefore, the leverage improves to 44%. If we include the tariff deficit, debt is at &#x20AC;29 billion. As I said, the policy to strengthen the balance sheet and the growth achieved by generating cash flow enables the company once again to considerably improve its financial ratios compared to the same period last year. And as the Chairman said, this has enabled or have made it possible for Moody's to improve the outlook from negative to stable and Fitch also reaffirmed a stable outlook for Iberdrola.</p>
          <p>The FFO ratio over debt net improved 3.7 points to 23.6% and if we include the tariff deficit, it's almost 21%, and the retail cash flow over net debt improved 7.1 points to 20%, if we include the tariff deficit, 18.4%. As you can see, these are very comfortable ratios for the rating we have. And we also have an excellent liquidity position at this time. We have &#x20AC;10.342 billion in liquidity and credit lines available.</p>
          <p>And as the Chairman said, we have refinanced &#x20AC;3 billion in debt at five years. We have recently made an issue in pounds of &#xA3;350 million at 15 years. We have just signed an enlargement of credit lines in the U.S. for $600 million. We have just carried out two long-term bond financing operation in reais in Brazil and this enables us to have an extremely comfortable liquidity situation which enables us to cover the next 24 months of financial requirements.</p>
          <p>Among other things, because as you could see on the transparency, we only have &#x20AC;1.652 billion in debt maturity in 2010, that is in the next 18 months. We only have around &#x20AC;3 billion in maturity. The average life of the debt, as the Chairman said, has been increased to 6.4 years from 6.2. And as the Chairman also said, this enables us to face the current situation of uncertainty on the market in an extremely calm manner. And now, the Chairman will end the presentation.</p>

          <p>Well, thanks a lot, Pepe. But to conclude, I would like to say that these results for the first semester showed, as I've said many times before, that the industrial project of Iberdrola is capable of providing sustainable growth in the long term for its shareholders, even though the conditions are unfavorable. It is a project that is based on the Energy business, which provides 90% of the operating profits. And within it, in the Grids and the Renewables that represent the EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So in both instances, we're talking about activities that are expanding very strongly, responding to the social demands of security of supply and environmental sustainability. And I would like to underscore the important growth perspectives in the Grid business in the States and the UK, and the investments we're going to be making in the Transport business and the latter in the next 10 years will multiply by three our asset base. And another, both our regulated activities are therefore of a predictable nature, especially after the regulatory improvement achieved throughout the most recent years in all the areas in which we were present.</p>
          <p>And based on the situation which the traditional energy business in Spain provided practically all the operating results, 99%, the Iberdrola project in recent years has also represented the fact that we've put our stakes on the internationalization and diversification of the business. And here, we've made our clean energy generation capacity grow. We are a pioneer, first with the hydroelectric development and then with wind power, a technology in which we are leaders in the world. And of course, this industrial model cannot be understood without our approach in terms of operating efficiency, an aspect that I would even dare say, has become one of the signs of identity to the group.</p>
          <p>And in this regard and after the process of geographic expansion, in which we already sought to obtain synergies and to exchange prospectuses, we've recently taken another step through the implementation of a single corporation and global business areas. Implementation of this industrial project, which is nowadays Iberdrola, wouldn't have been possible if it were not linked to a management system with a balance sheet based on caution and maximizing financial solidity, a model that has made it possible to reduce our risk of exposure to a specific currency, thanks to the business diversification model.</p>
          <p>But it's focused on activities that generate cash flow in a sustained manner and which is also based on maintaining an optimum financial structure, therefore making it possible to maintain solid financial ratios, and it's a model that anticipates and covers liquidity requirements, which means that we can guarantee our needs for the next 24 months. And finally it's a model that, as a consequence of the sustained growth of results and the financial stability, it allows us to maintain a stable policy as regards remuneration for the shareholder.</p>
          <p>In the first six months of the 2011 fiscal year, we can clearly see the effects of this industrial project. It appeared that it has been characterized by a complex financial and operating environment. The group has carried on improving its results. The gross margin has grown, thanks to the fact that the regulated and renewable businesses have worked very well. And this has compensated the evolution of the liberalized business, affected by the situation of the British market.</p>
          <p>So that means that the management model of Iberdrola, whose main element has to do with achieving efficiency, has made it possible for the results to be increased as we have evolved. So, from a 3% increase in the gross margin, we now have reached 9.4% increase in the recurring net profit.</p>
          <p>I really hope that in the future, by operating the liberalized business in the UK, which are linked to continuous growth of the renewable and regulated business and the <mark type="ph" /> matter (38:02) also boosted by the contribution made by Elektro in Brazil will, allow us together with the continuation in the management actions of the balance sheet, that we'll be able to achieve the positive expectations that we presented during the Investor Day for 2011 and 2012. So you can all be sure that the men and women that work for the group will work as hard as possible for this model of global growth can maximize the results of the group in the long run and that this will be beneficial for everybody.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And now, we're going to be moving onto your questions.</p>

          <p>Hello, Javier Garrido from JPMorgan. I have several questions on the liberalized businesses in Spain. Firstly, I didn't really understand. Could you just talk about the provisions figure that you have for the first semester? I didn't understand that figure. And do you expect there to be more reversions of provisions in the rest of the year, what remains of the year? And could you please tell us where we stand as regard to the increase in the payments for capacity, which I think the Ministry Center, the rough draft of the report to the National Energy Commission, and I'd like to know where we stand?</p>
          <p>And as regards the British business, could you please explain to us &#x2013; could you please explain if there &#x2013; are going to be any strategic changes when the time comes to making the hedges for the commodity prices, considering what's happened in the last 12 to 18 months? Are you going to maintain the same strategic approach or is there going to be a change in this kind of hedging? And lastly, could you please tell us, do you think or has there been any loss of customers in the UK, because you were the first to announce your increases in tariffs. So has this had any negative consequences? Have you lost any customers in the UK? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the liberalized business, we have reduced provisions, which this affects commercial activities and this also affects something that we have in relation to the market operator. We're talking about &#x20AC;100 million on the whole and there are not going to be any changes in provisions, at least as far as I know in the second semester.</p>
          <p>And as far as the ministerial order is concerned regarding power payments, this is a ministerial order that deals with capacity payments and availability payments. And at this point in time, the ministerial order has been sent to the National Energy Commission that is looking into this. And according to the news I have, well, I don't think that this is going to be released before the month of September.</p>
          <p>And we're talking about &#x20AC;150 million that correspond to capacity payments that are independent, or <mark type="ph" /> completely dependent (41:33) regarding relative to the date of publications. In other words, they're in force or have been in force since January 1. And then we have availability payments of &#x20AC;270 million which are only going to affect one of the quarters in the year 2011. And we also have to look into the generation tolls, which is what we call them. And I think that the commission has already sent this information to the ministry and we're talking about toll of &#x20AC;0.50 per megawatt-hour in the case of the grid. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:09), can you say something about the hedges in the UK, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes as far as the hedges go, when one closes a position, if you don't really close it in both extremes in the sale and the purchase. So more than covering, more than hedging what you're doing is speculating. So therefore, we are working in two directions. Firstly, we are much closer to the market, so instead of focusing on the long term, which is what we have been doing in the past, we are focusing more on the short term.</p>
          <p>So we are following up the market and we are acting in the next 12 months or 15 months or 18 months and not in three years or four years. And the most important thing is that we are promoting our fixed-price products among our customers so that we can close our positions, because closing the purchase without having closing the sales price is like speculating really, which is what happened, in fact. So we are boosting those two actions.</p>
          <p>Well, as regards the loss of clients, this is something that was contemplated. We'll not talk about large figures. Possibly, well today, Scottish has announced an increase in rates and prices. So practically, we are all in similar conditions. I think that it could be a few, 30 million, 40 million, 50 million customers that <mark type="ph" /> end up (43:34).</p>
          <p>I think that what is very important is the fixed price, in other words &#x2013; and that is counting the number of customers and like in telecommunications. It is not the same thing when we are talking about 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 customers. And it's not the same thing if we're dealing with customers that have large consumptions, vis-&#xE0;-vis small level of consumption. But we're only talking about several thousand, and it's not going to be a dramatic slump, <mark type="ph" /> not meaning to get (44:05) thousands of customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions, I'm Raimundo Fernandez-Cuesta. And the first question is somewhat subjective. When you say that you have a financial position that is very comfortable in this environment, what I was wondering is, are you ready in your mind for the environment we're facing today? Or are we thinking about the fact that we'll end up like Portugal, or if it's only the environment in which we are nowadays?</p>
          <p>So if we were to end up like the Portuguese, where the ratings of the Iberdrola company could drop, where the funding costs are higher, would the company have to do anything about this or do you think that the situation is comfortable because of the liquidity situation and how things on the CapEx front?</p>
          <p>And the second question, and as we are now getting closer to the general election, the popular party, it seems that they're not that worried about the tariff deficit, because that's being sold, but we are talking about the high cost of energy in Spain and the need to do something about this to control it or to reduce the cost. Could you please let us know what your proposals are and are you concerned about this possible transition into a new government?</p>
          <p>And then, as far as the UK is concerned, any business that can be solved, well, except that Iberdrola is interested. I suppose that the News of the World will not be listening to us anymore. But there's been some speculation in the case of RWE. So have you anything to say about this? Would it be interesting for Iberdrola?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the financial issue, I think that this is nothing new under the sun, the fact that we have this financial position in the company. But I think in the 11 years that I have been here and 10 in the case of Pepe and 30-many in the case of <mark type="ph" /> Jose (46:04), I think that this company knows about all this nonsense in the financial system. In the many times repeated strategic plans, we've said that we never wanted to be at levels of leverage above 50% and that's how we've always worked. We've always used a sustainable model from the point of view and payment of dividends. We have maintained the same payouts for many years. And since I've been here, it's been always the same payout, always growing. And from the liquidity problem, we can say that the situation is comfortable.</p>
          <p>So this is no different from what we've done in the past, although it has to be underscored that in spite of our complex environment, markets &#x2013; well, there is still something Iberdrola. Basically because of this cautious policy that we've been implementing for many years and I think that this is what the financial &#x2013; the CFO has put it out, because I think this is a very positive element. And I also have to say that in this regard, the CDS at Iberdrola, and correct me if I'm wrong, is about half of what we have in the Kingdom of Spain, which shows that we are very cautious and that we are also diversifying a different market, different currencies and different countries.</p>
          <p>As far as the elections go, I'm not going to say very much about that. But the cost of energy, well, one of the most significant items in terms of the cost of power has to do with the premiums applied to non-mature technologies, and I've said this time and again. And nobody can have any doubts that our company has put its stakes on renewables when nobody did that. But putting your stakes on renewables means that you are putting your stakes, but you have to do so sensibly, which means that you shouldn't develop immature technologies when they're not sufficiently developed, increasing costs in a significant manner. And the cost of solar power, which hardly produces 2% of the power in Spain, accounts for more than 10% of the total energy of the country.</p>
          <p>So if we were to still build further solar plants at more than &#x20AC;300, we would obviously make the electricity bill more expensive, as happened with TV. If we were to make them now, instead of paying &#x20AC;466, which is the price we're paying, we could pay this at &#x20AC;160 or &#x20AC;130, which is the price we have now.</p>
          <p>So I think that it's an era of planning. I think that it's an era of control and a management era that is making things expensive. And I trust and hope that any new government that will be created, I trust and hope that they will be able to tidy up this mess we've had over the last few years. And this is one of the clear-cut consequences of the increasing costs that we have in the Spanish energy business.</p>
          <p>And the other day there was a report. I'm not sure if it's been made public, but I think that at <mark type="ph" /> Onessa (48:53), they had looked into the percentage of renewables and the percentage of the cost of this energy in Spain as a consequence of these renewables, or their prevalence. So in other words, we are leaders in Europe as regards the increase in the costs of our energy as a consequence of this lack of control in terms of planning in the development of certain technologies that I repeat, are immature. Having them postponed or if we do postpone them, we would be able to achieve our objectives without increasing costs.</p>
          <p>And as far as the UK goes, I don't know how to say this anymore. We are not involved in any corporate operations there. And I'm very grateful to all those people that do believe that we have a very abundant cash flow to buy whatever is in the market. But I think that in that regard, we are more than a predictable company. When we say no, it means no.</p>
          <p>So we are not involved in any operations with the exception of, well, if you can call it that way, the rearrangement or the re-management of Brazil with the takeover of Elektro and the possible merger with our participation in their energy. But apart from that, we're not involved in any operations. And in this particular instance, what I think that is that not even our colleagues from RWE have decided anything.</p>
          <p>So it's very difficult to look into things if they haven't taken any decision. But we have no intention whatsoever of becoming involved in any operations in the UK. And I'm not sure if that's clear enough. Perhaps by repeating it many times, the message will eventually become clear. But there you are, that's what I have to say.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Alejandro Vigil from Cygnus Asset Management. Just a question, could you elaborate a little bit more on Renewables in January? Since the presentation of February, when you significantly reduced your investment level, do you see any signs on any markets to increase your investment or is it the opposite? Are there negative signals that imply that you could even reduce them further? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this stage, I think I'm repeating this again. We are currently putting our stakes on Renewables UK offshore. A few days ago, we approved an investment of over &#xA3;700 million, I think it is for the first offshore farms in the Irish Sea. We have some projects for more than 10,000 megawatts in the UK and we have here the person responsible, recently appointed person responsible for coordinating all the business in the UK. The CEO for Renewables and responsible for offshore and these are our big stakes. We are in many countries and we continue to be in many countries. We're doing things in Romania, in Poland, in Spain. But the major investment for the next few years is called Offshore UK, Offshore Germany. We're going to take part in a tender in France and this is the issue. Next question please, Virginia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I'm Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I have several questions, first of all, regarding this process you mentioned, the restructuring in Brazil. I would like to know whether it's possible that you will announce something before the end of the year. And also, whether the size of Brazil right now in the EBITDA, considering that Elektro started to contribute for the beginning of the year is more or less the weight that can result from this structuring? Or is it possible that the weight of Brazil will go up or down in the future activities of Iberdrola?</p>
          <p>And then I would like to know with the results you've given and the evolution from here to the end of the year, where you've already said that the UK will possibly improve somewhat, is it reasonable to assume that this year, the growth of EPS will be at the top of the range you gave in the strategic plan? And then two short questions, first of all, what do you expect from the cost of debt from now to the end of the year? And is it reasonable to accept the 23% tax rate you also have for the end of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Brazil, we're negotiating. We're continuing to negotiate the &#x2013; aim the target and the agreement is that Iberdrola will take a majority shareholder and Energia to be able to consolidate it globally. And this automatically will mean that there will be an EBITDA increase on a group level, what the percentage will be. This is what we are negotiating right now, how much we'll take on, let's say. And with the integration of Elektro, all this is now on the table. But clearly, there's going to be an increase in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The second issue, the cost of debt to EBIT, well, we expect to end the year with a cost of debt of around &#x2013; from 4.3, we have now to 4.5, 4.6 basically for two reasons of three. First of all, because the euro rates going up, secondly, because as we already said, we are in the process where we're establishing the &#x2013; definitely the balance sheet from 50% to levels of 65%, 70%, and as you know because of the FX long-term rates, they're higher than the short term rates. And the third element is that we also need to consider that with the consolidation of Elektro, we're putting in debt in reals at 12%. So the three elements basically mean that we are going to somewhat increase the cost of debt from levels of 4.2 last year to levels of 4.5, 4.6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the tax rate, the tax rate &#x2013; I don't know whether you want to comment on that, but there's something missing yet. This year, the tax rate has dropped 1% as planned, plus an additional 1% in the UK and I think that there are two more years or one more year to go. Another 1% in 2012. And this year, 1%, I've already said, we've taken 1% and another 1% in the second semester and in 2012, an additional 1%. And regarding the results, well, as I said, the outlook will be in the range we announced. I can't say more than that. It will be within the range. Next question.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had several questions. I'll start with fraudulent marketing. I think this refers to the fixed tariffs, how are things going there in that investigation? And secondly, the sale of generation assets in the United States and the problems you're having to sell them. Can you give us an update on that?</p>
          <p>What is your reaction going to be in the UK when you increase prices regarding generation and sales? Because you've closed the position last year and now you're in a fairly well balanced positioned. And finally, looking at developments in the tariff deficit this year, in the first quarter, there was good news. The deficit for the sector dropped by 33%, but in the second quarter, it only dropped 4% and I would like to know whether we should be concerned or not. Thank you. And <mark type="Inaudible" /> (57:33) Ofgem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we can highlight regarding the Ofgem investigation is that it's currently an investigation. Data is being taking regarding the practices we carried out in the commercial area in the UK. And we are collaborating in an absolutely transparent way with Ofgem to provide all the pertinent data and I don't think that any comments should be made until the investigation has concluded.</p>
          <p>We're investing very significant amounts of money to automate the sales force so that the process will be as transparent as possible, as well informed as possible. And so that customers will have the best possible options to make their decision as to buy from us or not. But I think that we should let the process continue and wait.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the question on generation in the U.S. This is an issue we agreed as a part of the acquisition by Iberdrola to sell some small generating plants we have. We tried to sell them. We're not successful. However, the commission has asked us to try again. Again, these assets are very small to the company, 100 megawatts. Most of the plants don't even run. Not even that, maybe 5 million, very, very minor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that answer the question. We're talking about 5 million. There's no need to go into the issue any further.</p>

        <plist>

            <mark type="ph" /> Paco (59:02), can you comment on the generation sales balance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The position at this time is balanced. We're practically selling what we're capable of producing, although with the market opportunity adjustments, output varies. But the long-term strategy includes trying to anticipate customers, because there will be a new generation, as the Chairman said, offshore in the UK. And therefore, we will always try to keep that position in balance regarding customer portfolio and the output possibilities. Deficit?</p>
          <p>The deficit volume in the first semester was around &#x20AC;1.5 billion, which is exactly what was expected. Our forecast for the end of the year, assuming that any increase in the price of energy can be absorbed through the tariff in the month of October, places the deficit at between &#x20AC;2.9 billion and &#x20AC;3.1 billion. That's in line with the government forecast. We don't expect &#x2013; well, if a tariff increase is necessary in October, we don't think it will be really significant. It will be similar to the one in June. I don't think that the &#x2013; whatever the tariff policy is from the government, I don't think there is going to be a major change in the end of the year deficit, and it was estimated at &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I have a few questions. The first is related to something that was already mentioned, but I would like to clarify it. Assuming that in the market, there are attractive projects for Iberdrola, from a strategic point of view for the company, in what area would Iberdrola like to increase its position, in which geographic areas? And in which regions, excluding Spain would you probably not make any more investments? And excluding Renewables, could you invest more in the UK or in the rest of Europe?</p>
          <p>The second question, an update on the agreement with Gamesa and the sale of minority shareholdings in wind farms. The third question, does it make strategic or financial sense to invest more in EDP or is there an aim to sell a position? And the privatization of the company, what impact could it have on your decision? And finally, regarding cost savings, can you give us some more explanations on what you're doing in the regulated business in Spain and in more general terms, can we say anything about the changes in the perimeter for Elektro? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I can put the first two questions together. I think I said fairly clearly that we have no intention of carrying out any corporate acquisitions, apart from what we're already negotiating in Brazil. So I'll say it again. This includes EDP, Gamesa or anything else.</p>
          <p>Secondly, from the point of view of cost savings in Renewables, I didn't understand the question, perhaps you did. Or was it the regulated business then? Oh, sorry, I didn't understand the question. Yes, in the regulated world in Spain, which I think is what the question was about, the company position is to make investments, which we're already doing in new technologies. We've been doing this for some time. Investments to improve the network and this means improving the processes, being more efficient and obtaining the cost savings we are obtaining, so incorporating the new technologies to the grid in order to be more efficient.</p>
          <p>The next question, I think, is from Alberto Gandolfi. Yes, we hand over to Alberto Gandolfi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Alberto Gandolfi. I have just one question, please. Can you reconcile the reported net profits and the recurring of &#x20AC;1,448? And I didn't quite understand the &#x20AC;100 million in provisions in the liberalized business, this is a non-recurring revenue, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reconciliation between recurring net profit and final profit is as simple as the capital gains or losses by the selling of assets. And last year, I think it was a partial sale of an EDP portfolio and this year, it was a minus sale of co-generators in Latin America. So if the net profit of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, we take out the usual atypicals and also exceptional tax effects as mentioned in this presentation, the effect of the drop of 1 percentage point in the UK in the company tax, this gives us this growth of 9.4% in recurring profits, it's as simple as that.</p>
          <p>So, profits or losses because of sale of assets and exceptional effects in the settlement of the company tax. And regarding the &#x20AC;100 million that have to do with settlements, the policy of this financial firm is conservative and therefore, we reinvest provisions or settlements from prior years to future years. And next year, it is possible that after everything is accounted for and the adjustments made, there may be further settlement or provisions. So it's not an extraordinary profit we're including at the top. But it's the way we normally manage the accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we do in terms of accounting is by reversing a provision. This is done into the same account where the expenses have been recognized. So in the case of the liberalized business, we were talking about revenues. So therefore, the provision was done in this account and that goes back to that same account, too. I think that the next question comes from Jorge Alonso. If I'm not wrong. Yes, we're going to give the phone to Jorge Alonso. Go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, everybody. My question is related to when you want to gain more weight in Brazil or when you want to go for other opportunities, you might be able to identify, what are the company's policy as regards funding of these operations? Would you reduce your positions in other business areas or would there be divestitures in financial assets, or how would you approach this subject? And what do you have at your disposal as a support for these potential operations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that firstly, we need to see how much is involved and then after that, there's something that we've always said is that we have to maintain our A rating. So we choose the most suitable path in order to be able to preserve our A rating status. But the &#x2013; first, you need to have the money, and then you have to decide the path to be followed.</p>
          <p>I think that it's still too early to be able to say something, because we are talking about something that has to do with the future and we don't even know how much money is going to be involved. But we do want to maintain a solid financial situation, and we want to maintain our A rating and we will do whatever has to be done, as we've demonstrated over the years. We have plenty of imagination as regards funding our investments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question, I think, comes from Pablo Cuadrado. Go ahead with your question please, Pablo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good morning, everybody, just a couple of very quick questions. One, could you please say something more about Brazil? Could you please give us some more up-to-date information on how the negotiations are going with the regulator, as regards the revision of distribution and remuneration? Have you any proposals that will be approved?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I would like to ask about the Distribution business in Spain. I was surprised to see such positive results, especially if you look at the OpEx control in the division, and it is clearly a non-comparable effect as regards the increase in regulation relative to last year and possibly in the second semester, it's not going to be that benign. But could you please give us an overview of the growth that is to be expected at the end of the year, which I think shouldn't be something like 20% to 25% in EBITDA, just to have a clear picture of what will be going on? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; we've held a number of meetings with all the distributors, and they modified the same, the first remuneration. And I think that the new rates will be applied or will start in the month of July. And we're talking about November, but conversations are going to continue. The whole thing has been postponed, and they're still discussing the terms of the regulators, and let's say that they are better than the initial terms we contemplated. As far as the regulated business, as Spain is concerned, <mark type="ph" /> Javier (1:09:57) or Jose, perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as it was pointed out before, we can't compare the first semester with the rest of the year and the forecast we have until the end of the year read between 2% and 4%. So yes, we are going to continue consolidating our cost efficiency, but we have to make the entire year comparable. Sorry, microphone has been <mark type="ph" /> stretched out (1:10:23). Well, you know that some improvements will be implemented before the end of the year and then after that, we will perform the comparative analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Javier Suarez. Go ahead with your question, Javier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody, my name is Javier Suarez. I have two questions on the liberalized business. And the first has to do with the liberalized business in Spain, because you said that in the first half of the year, there has been a certain expansion in margins. So could you please quantify these generation margins of the liberalized business in Spain? And above all, I want to know what do you think about what sort of evolution that is going to occur in the second half of 2011 and 2012?</p>
          <p>And the second question has to do with the liberalized business, but in the UK, because you've said that the margins are extremely low and that the turning point should take place in the second half of the year. There should be an increase in tariffs as from August, but why should this be especially significant in the last quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Paco (1:11:32), can you answer the question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start off with the second question. It would be especially significant in the last quarter, not because of the margins but rather because of the volumes and demand. And the UK seasonality is a very important thing and focuses around the winter months. So that means that the results are going to be especially important or we'll see that there will be a significant recovery when there's more demand. And as I've said on previous occasions, possibly the most appreciated thing we have is our cost structure and our revenue structure so we shouldn't give any more details on what our margins are like, nor should we even say anything in relation to the competition. I'm sorry, but we cannot advance any more information in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if there are no more questions then, anybody want to &#x2013; the web questions? One comes from Collins Stewart, and the first question is, what do we think about the possible change in government. Will this go into &#x2013; are they going to use the electricity business as a source of funding through different taxes? And considering the publication of the energy paper in the UK, could we please inform on what our plans are like as regards nuclear power stations in our country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the first question is concerned, the future government is &#x2013; well, we don't even &#x2013; nobody knows when the election is going to take place, so we'll have to look into their programs once they have been released. But what I can say is that the program of the current opposition is not available. But there are some sources like the <mark type="ph" /> Fias foundation (1:13:25) that has released a couple of documents.</p>
          <p>And I think that, well, you can look it up on the website, if not, we can send it to you. And there's nothing on what you've mentioned, but there's just things on the market and things on trying to do things more efficiently. And controlling those expenses or those costs of technology that are excessively costly, so that they can be made much more reasonable.</p>
          <p>Now, as regards the energy paper, the nuclear issue in the UK, we have a joint venture with Swift. We also have an office for the people that are working on this. And they are currently engaged with the licensing, with the designs, with the approvals. But in no case whatsoever shall we take a decision before 2015. So let's say that we are in the preliminary stages, and we took over a company a couple of years ago. And we are now in the process of analysis. We are in the pre-design stage and the licensing stage. But no decisions will be taken before that time. So it's a very early stage in the process. But yes, yes, we do want to carry this out, although we will take a decision as from 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question comes from <mark type="ph" /> Ramon <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:14:47) and he's saying that while we've said that we have liquidity for the next 24 months and how much have we included in terms of the forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we've been talking about something like &#x2013; or what we saw in the first six months, we're talking about just over &#x20AC;2 billion, &#x20AC;2.4 billion roughly. But we have to bear in mind and as Raimundo pointed out, we have a stress tests. So if nothing were to be issued, if nothing were to be funded, we'd have liquidity for 15 months and without doing anything about the investment policies or without doing anything along those lines. So let's say that the situation has an enormous amount of liquidity and tranquility, too.</p>
          <p>And the next question and the question is that considering the situation of the financial markets in the Iberian Peninsula, in Spain, will we contemplate increasing of funding in North American dollars or in Sterling pounds and do we believe that our optimum &#x2013; our debt is optimum or are we going to reduce our exposure to the euro because of the uncertainty we have in the Eurozone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, as you already know now, our funding policy wants to protect the cash generation ratio relative to the net debt. So we are basically funding those currencies in which we are performing our cash generation. So in principle, we have no plans as regards increasing or changing our funding structure.</p>
          <p>As far as the possible funding mechanism is concerned and as I've pointed out before, we have one of the big advantage of the group's internationalization process, is that we can fund ourselves in different markets as we've already demonstrated. And as most of the investment, as we've already pointed out, in the strategic plan outside Spain, it would be very good to fund abroad the investments that we are making abroad, too. So this is where we have part of the funding that we have done in pounds in Scottish Power, and this is going to serve to fund our investments in distribution.</p>
          <p>We could also do so in transmission in the UK or in renewables in dollars. We are also &#x2013; and we have a credit line totaling $600 million for the funding we're doing in operations in the United States. So we have funding capability, and we could fund those investments we make in those countries where we operate. And as I say, 75% of the investments of the strategic plan are going to be made outside Spain. So we can fund all this from outside the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:44) from BNP.  And he was asking us about our dividend and the possibility of maintaining discrete dividend or the flexible dividend in December. Are we going to maintain that option? That's the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are going to maintain the option, no decisions have been taken and what we'll decide in the months of November and December. But if we still have these tax advantages and if there's still a demand on the part of investors, as we've heard in frequent &#x2013; in recent issues, we will look into this, and the option will be on our table and we will take a decision whenever it has to be taken which will be in November or December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question that comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> <mark type="ph" /> Rodriguez from Aventis (1:18:24). And he's asking us &#x2013; he would like to have updated information on the negotiations with Gamesa as regards them acquiring the pipeline that's under execution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that since 2009, many things have changed. The world has changed, and the expectations of renewables have also changed in some countries. So we've been talking for them to see how this agreement can be reformulated, how we can reform it in such a matter that it can be adapted to our campaigns, so that we can give continuity to our collaboration.</p>
          <p>So, before the president closes this event, I would like to say that we have introduced an attachment on the productive data of renewables because we want to provide you with information, we want to provide you with technical information on this business. And that you could see that at an annex at the end of the presentation and that's it.</p>
