          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Ltd. third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session with instructions given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you Julie. Welcome to today's third quarter 2008 results conference call for Schlumberger Ltd. Before we begin, I'd like to review the logistics and format of today's call. Some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.</p>
          <p>And now for the call participants and format. Joining the call from New York City are both Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the third quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Schlumberger's third quarter income from continuing operations was $1.25 per share, up $0.09 sequentially and $0.16 above the same quarter of last year. These results include a $0.04 impact from the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services' third quarter revenue grew 5% sequentially, reflecting strong growth in all geographical areas despite the impact of the hurricane season. WesternGeco revenue grew 33% sequentially reflecting the seasonal strength in Marine operations that was boosted by strong Multiclient data sales.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services generated $1.7 billion in pre-tax operating income, essentially flat as compared to the second quarter with margins slipping by 135 basis points to 26.7%. By area, Oilfield Services' pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows, my comments are on a sequential basis. North America pre-tax margin decreased by 283 basis points to 21.1%, whereas the recovery in activity in Canada was more than offset by the hurricane effects on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico activity and the seasonal slowdown in Alaska.</p>
          <p>Latin America pre-tax margin declined 287 basis points to 20.1%, as more favorable activity mix in Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Brazil were insufficient to offset increased third-party managed services in IPM [Integrated Project Management] projects in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket. This affect was amplified by start-up costs associated with Burgos 7 project in Mexico.</p>
          <p>For ECA the Europe/CIS/Africa area, the pre-tax margin improved 86 basis points to 29% as Russia experienced a strong seasonal activity rebound offshore East Russia. This improvement however was partially offset by the impact of declines in the North Sea for both exploration and development operations.</p>
          <p>Finally Middle East/Asia pre-tax margin moderated by 89 basis points to 35.5%, as a more favorable activity mix in a number of GeoMarkets was insufficient to counter the effects of a less favorable mix in Indonesia and a shift to lower margin workover type activity in the Gulf.</p>
          <p>WesternGeco pre-tax income of $355 million reflecting an increase in the pre-tax margin by 10.6 percentage points to reach 39.8% showed a strong growth over the second quarter and surpassed the performance of the same quarter last year. Marine had a strong quarter with higher activity at better pricing, while Multiclient margins improved with higher sales.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 21.4%, which was slightly higher than last quarter due to the geographic mix of earnings in WesternGeco. The ETR [effective tax rate] is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year. Net debt was $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, representing a sequential improvement of $300 million. Further, we ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion of cash and investments on hand.</p>
          <p>In addition $2.1 billion of committed debt facility agreements with commercial banks were available at the end of September. This compares to short-term debt of only $2.2 billion, reflecting the strength of the Schlumberger balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements.</p>
          <p>Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $545 million for the stock buyback program and $1 billion for CapEx including 75 million of Multiclient surveys capitalized. During the quarter we bought back 5.96 million shares for $545 million at an average price of $91.45 per share. Finally the quarter earnings included $44 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation costs. And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Good morning everybody. The strong continuation in sequential revenue growth in the third quarter was led by further strengthening of gas drilling activity on land in the U.S. and Canada, a very active summer drilling season in Russia and continuing growth of IPM activity in Latin America. Margin performance was generally satisfactory apart from the heavy impact of the hurricane season on North America and higher than usual third party managed services revenue at low margins in Latin America due in part to the startup of the Burgos 7 contract. Among our technologies, growth was strongest for Well Services, Wireline and Drilling and Measurements Services.</p>
          <p>Looking at the areas in more detail, performance in North America was led by the Canada GeoMarket as activities strengthened significantly following last quarter's spring breakup. Demand was strong for a range of technologies from Well Services, Wireline and Drilling and Measurements. On land in the U.S., improving weather in the North and expanding rig counts across all GeoMarkets yielded a solid result. These positive effects were partially offset by a sharp reduction in activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico resulting from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike as well as by the seasonal slowdown in Alaska for rig and infrastructure maintenance.</p>
          <p>In Latin America sequential revenue growth was strong across the area led by Mexico, Central America GeoMarket due to increased IPM activity. In addition Peru/Colombia/Ecuador continued their robust performance in the second quarter on a more favorable mix of Wireline and Drilling and Measurements technologies while Brazil grew as exploration activity led to more demand for Wireline logging services.</p>
          <p>Sequential revenue growth in the Europe/Africa/CIS area was driven primarily by activity in the Russian GeoMarkets particularly in the East with the summer exploration campaigns in the North and South. Through demand for Well Services, pressure pumpings remained strong as well. Exploration was also responsible for the strength in the Caspian through both activity and service mix. In Africa, Libya was particularly strong as activity grew in both exploration and development work. Our West &amp; Southern Africa also recorded exploration related growth. These positive factors were somewhat tempered by a decrease in North Sea activity in both exploration and development that matched an effective rig count reduction.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East and Asia area sequential growth was led by Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines GeoMarket as increased exploration activity resulted in robust demand for exploration-led Wireline and Well Testing Services. The GeoMarket also benefited from strong Completions product sales.</p>
          <p>Good results in Qatar came through service mix that outpaced rig count while the East Mediterranean and Arabian GeoMarkets also saw improvement. The area's sequential growth was however blunted by a decrease in the Gulf as activity shifted from drilling to workover type services.</p>
          <p>Our WesternGeco sequential revenue grew significantly led by excellent Marine results and a strong recovery in Multiclient data sales. The third quarter is seasonally the strongest in Marine and the results were backed by strong activity in the North Sea and the transfer of three vessels from multi-client to proprietary surveys during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Multiclient increased sales were seen in North America, Latin America, and Europe with the results in North America underpinned by a significant sale in the U.S. Data Processing also recorded higher revenue particularly in Europe, North America, and India. The positive combination of these performances however was partially offset by decrease in Land revenue where the activity reduced and contracts were completed in North Africa and Latin America.</p>
          <p>At our Investor Conference on September 30, we highlighted a number of unique Schlumberger technologies that both singly and together offer marked benefits in helping our customers improve performance and reduce risk. The manner in which these technologies can be integrated also offers substantial customer benefit and a number of these were evident during the quarter. I would draw particular attention to the StimMAP LIVE realtime fracture mapping and stimulation as well as to our full-azimuthal Coil Shooting Q-Marine data acquisition as examples. I would also point out the continuing uptake of PeriScope and other members of the Scope family of technologies with jobs performed in Texas, Alaska, Italy, Ecuador and Brazil.</p>
          <p>As we enter the fourth quarter, the recent rapid deterioration in credit markets will undoubtedly have an effect on our activity. Though we anticipate this will be largely limited to North America and to some emerging exploration markets overseas. The strengthening production profile of North American natural gas has also led a number of customers to reduce spending early.</p>
          <p>At the present time, the rate t which the world economy will slow has become increasingly uncertain. We have always maintained that the one event that could slow the rate of increase in worldwide exploration and production spending would be a reduction in the demand for oil caused by a severe global recession. At the moment it is still too soon to predict to what extent current events would affect overall activity in 2009, but we anticipate a slowing in the rate of increase of our customers' spending.</p>
          <p>However, the weakness of the current supply base, the age of the production profile, and the decrease in reserve replacement ratios, all of which we have indicated on many occasions are such that any significant drop in exploration and production investment would rapidly provoke an even stronger recovery. Schlumberger has an unparalleled technology position, a strong balance sheet, an unmatched global presence, and an excellent and highly motivated workforce. I have no doubt that we will emerge from the current turmoil even stronger than before.</p>
          <p>And now I will hand the call back to Julie.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Andrew I was just wondering just looking at International Land, is it fair to say the majority of your projected 2009 business is already locked up either through contracts or long standing agreements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically Land Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes just International Land.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say for the drilling programs that certainly the first half year to nine months are locked up. As you know well that's not true for workover programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words they're on a much shorter time scope and could eventually be canceled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then if I look more just towards offshore work, is it fair to say that probably a much larger percent of that is locked up because they're going to be linked with drilling contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean I think, the fundamental cycle of three-year contracts overseas hasn't changed a great deal so you can assume that one-third will roll over in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But with the contracts that are existing in place, can you envision any scenario in which you see, start to see contracts being broken? I think that's a pretty big concern in the investor community right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know the operators don't break contracts, they shut down rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Normally a contract is for a specific or an envelope of rigs and they can always shut down rigs within the contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it depends on the drilling contract Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I could just ask one more question. Looking back when oil prices peaked back in 1998, it looks like it took something like 12 months until OPEC activity really started to come down.</p>
          <p>I'd just kind of like to get your perspective on whether we should start to expect a similar pattern on OPEC and other NOCs this time around. I recognize there's a lot of changes in the market and things, it is not a perfect historical comparison, but perhaps you'd just give us your perspective as to how long you think it's going to take, or how long oil prices have to stay low until you really see a dramatic reduction in their spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would be dishonest to say that I know, I don't know but I will give you my opinion. My opinion is that it's, this is not 1998. But the same basic rules will apply and the period of time before they meaningfully impact activity is probably not dissimilar from what you just quoted Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you think something like 12 months or so from the peak, just roughly some you think 12,15 something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends because there is no such thing as two OPEC members who behave the same way. So it's very, very generalized what I'm saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm asking the question from a general perspective as well. Thank you very much, very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Andrew, just want to understand a little bit better your thoughts as they are today. May be six months ago, a couple of conference calls ago we were looking at International as a 15 to 20% top line growth market for you guys in '09. I realize we don't know at this point but I'm just trying to understand order of magnitude around your comment on the rate of growth slowing. Do you think it's, I mean are we a single-digit growth rate now, is it a few hundred basis points softer kind of ballpark for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan I don't know. I am sorry I don't know. We're going to take this quarter by quarter but today I have a little bit better visibility on North America because you know as I well as I do what's been happening every day. But on overseas I just don't have a good visibility to allow me to look at a number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the follow up then would be for both North America and International you've talked historically about kind of Plan A and Plan B. Plan A is usually the markets continue to grow as you expect, Plan B is they soften. When does &#x2013; when do you pull the trigger on a Plan B in North America or on International. I mean what's the timing &#x2013; walk us through the thought and evaluation process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that Plan B in North America, we will be thinking in Plan B mode unless the temperature drops and heating days become such that it's obvious that gas supply coupled with the cuts that people have made in expenditure means that we're going to get to the end of the winter with a low storage situation. So, but today we're certainly thinking in Plan B mode. So, Plan B mode means that we're careful on head count increases, we're careful on CapEx, we're extremely careful on discretionary expenditure and &#x2013; but we have &#x2013; when we have Plan B in place we're working on Plan A at the same time. So, if something does change in the spring we can react.</p>
          <p>Overseas is very, very different because no two areas behave the same. Therefore, we can't, if you like, apply a universal plan the way we can to North American gas. So, I would say that it's the Plan B overseas we haven't invoked any of it yet. We are being more careful but that we &#x2013; the areas &#x2013; we'll make a plan B as and when things start to become a bit clearer. But I have to say between Simon Ayat, myself and Chakib Sbiti this is the third time we've been through this. So, we have quite a lot of experience as how to manage the different reactions of the different parts of the world; not only on behalf of our customers but &#x2013; reactions of our customers but also the internal measures that need to be taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Andrew.</p>

          <p>Hi Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, maybe the first question I can throw your way and maybe ask you to expand upon how the credit crisis is impacting your business specifically. And maybe some of the things that you're doing differently in light of that to make sure that Schlumberger doesn't end up with any liquidity pinch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Michael as I mentioned in my comment earlier on. We have $4 billion of cash, we have an established credit lines committed from the banks although unused about 2 billion. Our cash flow this last quarter if you noticed we made almost $1 billion after spending 1 billion on CapEx. We continue, we never rely too much on the credit market. We did so opportunistic when we felt that it is more cost effective to borrow than using our cash. So, we don't live off our cash flow like we did before and we don't see this credit market to be very severe as far as our needs for cash because we have a good balance sheet and we always work very conservatively.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as the receivables are concerned, we haven't experienced any delay in collections. Now, this might start to affect us if there are delays of payments by our clients. But we know how to handle this and we mobilized our entire organization to make sure that the cash flow continue to come through. So, we don't have any immediate concern over the credit market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And even more specific &#x2013; you mentioned receivables &#x2013; any counterparty risk in terms of customers, issues related to their letters of credit, anything coming back to your way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we do reestablish the credit limits on some of the smaller clients and the relationship with the normal usual clients are contractual and we will, we have no issue with it for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Simon. Second question, Andrew if I can put to you, pricing in the business, I think is in general predicated upon maintaining a perception of scarcity. And as we start to talk about lower utilization rates, for everything from rigs to tools et cetera, we lose some of that scarcity premium. Can you maybe talk about the mix shift in terms of revenue growth over the last few years; price versus technology? You've used in the past the IEA [International Energy Advisory] chart showing 70% of E&amp;P CapEx as being inflationary.</p>
          <p>I would assume that Schlumberger doesn't have that kind of price inflation embedded into its revenue growth over that timeframe, but I'd like to get a sense from you in terms of where you feel vulnerable in terms of pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, if you go back I don't have to explain the dynamics of supply and demand on North American pressure pumping I hope. But if you look more broadly across the segments in which we participate, they are not generally wholly driven by pure supply and demand. Obviously they are to an extent, right?</p>
          <p>So, if you look across Well Services in North America we know the answer, overseas we've had similar dynamics in the pricing market in Russia for the last two years, supply/demand. If you look at Wireline, Drilling and Measurements; I think that yes, there is particularly in Drilling and Measurements, an element of pricing particularly in 2006, which was purely supply/demand driven.</p>
          <p>And that was also true to a certain extent for Wireline though to a lesser extent, but in the last two years I would say that in those services it is technology that has driven pricing more than pure supply/demand. Now, I have to say as a word of caution that in tight markets when money is short our customers tend to use little bit less technology and it's up to us to prove that, that using technology is cost effective for them.</p>
          <p>But I think that the answer to your question is that the big price sensitivity inflation in the services where we participate apart from pressure pumping was really 2005 and particularly 2006.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andrew you highlighted the credit environment and how certainly your customers are, they're not able to spend the same amount of capital as they otherwise would. But how about some of your competitors, and particularly North America start-up competitors in pressure pumping and Wireline and workover? I mean we've seen an army of these little companies enter the market over the past couple of years with their huge ambitions and borrowed money. Are you seeing any signs that this is getting shutdown now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be perfectly honest no, not yet. I haven't seen distress signals Ole. You mean real distress selling-type signals right? I think we are getting more phone calls than we got three months ago. I think we can see some deals that were made that are probably in negative equity territory. And how those will unwind I think is still completely unknown. But I have &#x2013; there's not an avalanche yet of distressed people calling or sending people around to sell us stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What if we review the offshore market, n you highlighted quite a few offshore rigs that were coming into the market. It appears that a lot of these rig projects are relying on a lot of debt and very little equity and very few of them have gotten funded. Have you had any thoughts about how that could develop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think it's going to if &#x2013; I think that both for seismic boats by the way and drilling rigs that the people who were financing these at the margin, they're not going to build them. They won't get built until their shipyard slot gets bought by a serious player.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so on the seismic side again I certainly see your point there. But in terms of your own revenues, exploration CapEx was meant to be the driver of much of the growth over the next couple of years. Historically, in '98 for example, exploration CapEx was one of the first things to get shut down. Could you discuss a little bit your exposure and how you see the seismic business or the Wireline business evolve over the next 12 to 18 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I think that the seismic business will undoubtedly be affected but there are two ways that it can be affected. The first way is that if operators decide to slow programs in which case it will be moderately affected, moderately affected not catastrophically? The catastrophic scenario is they start going into M&amp;A activities. So if my customers start buying each other then they shut exploration down altogether for a year or so you know while they evaluate the portfolios and they re-decide what they're going to exploit and all the rest of it.</p>
          <p>So yes, there is a risk that exploration revenue in the next year goes much lower, but I am now going to restate the caveat. And that is that the supply balance is extremely fragile. Nobody knows how deep the drop in demand is going to be but there is a limit to the drop in demand unless we have a 90 &#x2013; a sort of worldwide depression that's going to last 10 years.</p>
          <p>And to the extent that Dave Anderson's first question, if they shut down workover activity non-OPEC production is going to start sliding even faster than it is at the moment. And to the extent that they shut down exploration now, they are going to increase the reserve replacement problem that the customers already have. And I am not just talking about IOCs, I am talking about everybody. So to the extent that they actually shut everything down, which they may well do, the recovery is going to be always stronger at the first sign the demand is picking up again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, Andrew. I was wondering if you could actually specify a little bit more &#x2013; I mean you talked about workover being the first sort of threshold of activity adjustment. Regionally speaking, what areas should we expect to see the first rates of adjustment in terms of spending growth to take place internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bill, I hate to do this to you but I'm not going to answer your question directly because I consider that as almost proprietary information. But it's regionally; it's the type of customer you need to look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's, that's why North America is such a pure market is because the customers rely on capital mechanisms to fund activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So then if you look across to the North Sea, there is a whole group of customers in the North Sea now who rely on capital markets to fund activity. And as you know there were lot of small companies on the AIM [alternative investment market] market in London that grew up on the basis of funding from capital markets. It's a little bit true in some parts of the Far East and it's certainly true on the West Coast of Africa today. But beyond that I really don't want to go into what I, how I think the various NOCs or big guys are going to react.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me get this reaction from you. In the current environment where we've had a retrenchment in oil prices and it's a much less certain macroeconomic environment. Isn't it reasonable to expect really almost across the board even from an NOC standpoint that the sense of urgency just abates a bit at least?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I couldn't, I totally agree with you but the reading of a sense of urgency will be different in function of the type of customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Next line of inquiry, North America I think you've been consistently candid about the fact that we're in the Plan A and Plan B world for a period of years. And in the current environment given the fact that we've already have such a significant collapse in, for example pressure pumping pricing, and we've had an adjustment in general lower with respect to pricing paradigm for North American Oil Services. In the event that we get, call it a 2 to 400 rig adjustment in the U.S. what should we expect with regard to your North American margins? They've already adjusted lower significantly, how much lower can they go from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't, it's a very difficult question to answer like that, Bill but there's obviously in 500, you said 500 rig drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pick a number, 500 is fine, but they'll be anywhere 2 to 400 rigs relative to the recent peak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, initially they're going to drop quite a lot because I don't know exactly how much, because then you get all the people that Ole was just talking about trying work for the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I don't want to give you a number because I don't know. But you probably have to look back at our results. Do you remember what they went to in '99, 2000, Simon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Well, well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost of operation is going to go down as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But I guess the difference is this though and here's what I mean. We've already had an adjustment here from your North American margins compressing from call it north of 30% to in the low 20s. A lot of that came from pricing and I'm just &#x2013; clearly absorption is going to get hurt with regard to an activity adjustment, some pricing as well. But I guess how much, how severe will the rate of margin compression be in the event of a fairly meaningful pullback from this point forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look; I can't say more Bill than it will still be severe and I don't know how much.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question has to do with the Latin American region. Lat Am's been an area of strength for many in the sector. It's a big IPM area you noted in your release and talked about the rising costs in the area and you insinuated in your recent comments that peers have been, have been bidding aggressively in these areas in their IPM. First could you talk about the sources of the inflation and then comment on the rising price competitiveness for IPM work relative to the cost issues. And actually maybe throw into that also, sorry to layer it on, the financial needs or the ability to finance of the companies in the area. So what the step down in growth expectations from Lat Am region overall might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think the step down due to lack of funding is going to be balanced against the production performance of many customers in that area, which means that they really cannot afford to step down a great deal. I think that the inflation in the area is everything, it's materials as well as, particularly as well as wages. And that is going; that will abate. I mean it's quite obvious, it's going to abate in some of the larger items right now, particularly in materials; wages I am not so sure. And I don't really want to comment any further than I've done in the past on the entry of other competitors into the IPM business in Latin America. Their pricing is one thing, it's really whether or not that affects the pricing of the overall IPM market depends how they perform.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, you must separate Mexico from everything else if you want to &#x2013; if you are trying to use the read across from the IPM bidding of competitors to overall margins in the region, no. Also the other thing that is very necessary if you want to expand in IPM is a very strong balance sheet because there's a lot of upfront investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay all right, sure. And an unrelated follow up and I won't layer on a bunch of details to this one. Just in the Middle East there's a change in mix.</p>

          <p>Could you talk about, Andrew, opportunities for Schlumberger in the current credit crisis? And under your possible scenario of exploration revenue going much lower if we see widespread mergers in the oil industry, do you think this would lead to material consolation, sorry not consolation, consolidation in the oil service sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that an M&amp;A amongst our customers would necessarily lead to a consolidation in the Oilfield Services sector. It is correct I think to assume that some of the startup or recently formed marine seismic companies will get merged into other marine seismic companies. Because they won't be able to survive at the size they are in a down market. But I don't think that necessarily reads a consolidation amongst our large customers and a drop in exploration spend means that the rest of the industry will feel a need to consolidate.</p>

          <p>Okay, and my one follow-up is if activity in North America holds in relatively well here in the fourth quarter, does the, do the discussions with your U.S. customers on one year contract renewals, are they materially changed by the drop in natural gas prices and the credit crisis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well our customers are probably smart enough to know that if activity is going to go down they should read, they should delay their retendering, until they think that they can see what activity is going to be.

          <p>Thank you. Andrew, I know you don't want to talk about areas of the world where you expect to slowdown, as proprietary and so forth. But in the past two downturns that you've lived through, the North Sea has been one as a high cost area that usually leads the way and I just wondered if you would comment on what you're seeing in that market?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me just ask one other question; unrelated is in term, is there any inclination of the Board to reconsider the share buyback program in light of what's transpired with your stock price and where you've been buying stock and also if you could comment on the outlook for capital spending in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so I think that on the buyback we will honor our commitment to not allow share creep, but until credit markets settle down and we have clearer view of where we are going in '09, I don't think we will be doing much more than that. And in terms of the CapEx for 2009, it's too early to say for all the reasons I've outlined to other callers, but obviously we are looking at, as we have a six to nine months cycle, we're basically talking about the CapEx in the second half of 2009, and we will be looking at that very closely over the next couple of months.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be totally clear. What is the, it is clear that the North America credit situation will have an effect on Q4. Not a huge affect, but an affect nonetheless. When I talked about the credit crisis worldwide in '09 all I was saying is that it is going to have an affect but we don't what it is yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in fact the credit crisis I think by the time we get to '09 is going to be far less of a factor than what actually has happened to oil demand because of the general economy.</p>

          <p>Got you, that's helpful.

          <p>Sorry about that. Andrew, don't want to get too focused on semantics but I know you choose your words very carefully. Does your comment regarding a slowing in the rate of increase of customers' spending imply that you still expect spending to be higher in 2009 versus 2008 as we see sit here today?</p>

          <p>Fair enough. And then CapEx guidance was lowered ever so modestly for Oilfield as well as WesternGeco. I don't want to read too much into it but was that a function of the outlook that you see or just the timing of the projects are in queue?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, my question is on marine seismic and you've mentioned that your customers could slow down there, if it were a significant prolonged decline in prices. So amongst that backdrop, recap your vessel delivery schedule from here and what of that is currently contracted as it's delivered, maybe what is your variability on change in delivery for instance of some Eastern ECO [ECO-Oil] vessels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well next year we get two vessels in Q1, and then a vessel a quarter for the rest of the year. We're not anticipating any issues getting, some of them have contracts already, we don't yet see that getting the others contracts is a problem. And we, I think it will be difficult to delay shipyard delivery, but it would be possible to, if the market gets really bad towards the end of next year to mothball them rather than market them. We would probably mothball old vessels and put the new ones into service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Multiclient sales, a nice increase there in this quarter, but obviously most of us are concerned about what the future holds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned a large North American sale, is that the majority of the sequential increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not the majority, but it's a very large chunk. So, we quite deliberately mentioned that to put you on notice Pierre that there was one very large chunk in it, but it's not the majority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand. Is there a component of library sales that are somewhat on the continuous basis, somebody that has a contract for certain amount of sales regularly or is it really completely variable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes there is a continuous, a number of customers who have continuing Multiclient sales across a period of time, but don't forget there's always this year-end Christmas shopping spree that takes place in the last five or six days of the year, every year. And there it's almost impossible to guess, or to know how much that's really going to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand. And then, the kind of unrelated but if I could is, on some of these issues of what's contracted for the future, you addressed right on the first question right off the bat for the International. What about on the pressure pumping horsepower that is currently contracted for what duration for next year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Most of my questions were answered. So I just wanted to touch on one topic. You highlighted the establishment of a seismic data bank in Saudi to explore for natural gas. I was just wondering if you can give us some color on that, maybe timetables on when you think there could be some drilling activity out there for natural gas or when some projects could be planned. Is that something we can be looking forward to as a potential positive offset down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that we didn't discuss this in the context of &#x2013; I have discussed this in the past so I'm quite happy to discuss it now. But, while I don't think you should relate it to the establishment of a national data bank in Saudi, it is true that the gas programs in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, parts of Kuwait are very likely not to be affected by this because they are for domestic usage and in many cases to be substituted in the place of oil that is currently used domestically. So I think the gas programs will be much less affected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you just remind us on the timetables for those, is that an '09 event or beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well some are and some aren't. I mean Oman is starting now, a lot of the work, Saudi is probably '09 and the UAE, a lot of the UAE work is probably '09 as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Andrew earlier in the call you said this is not 1998, could you elaborate on what you meant by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I meant by that, that there's a really positive factor and there's quite a negative factor. So the really, the quite negative factor is we don't know how far demand is going to drop and obviously the economic crisis is much more widely spread than it was in 1998 where basically it came out of Thailand or the Far East or Asia. So that's the, so we don't know how far demand is going to drop that's the slightly negative unknown.</p>
          <p>The positive is that the supply situation is much, much worse than it was in 1998. I am very serious when I say that a decrease in exploration and production spending at this point is going to accelerate non-OPEC decline, which means that as soon as demand flattens or turns around the price of oil is going to go right back up again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I guess you, I think with Ole you gave an answer in terms of 18 months we would be back in balance if and that was, what conditions do you see or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am saying that demand would stabilize sometime in the first half of the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If demand stabilizes in the first half of next year we'll &#x2013; 18 months you would expect to see a rebalancing and I guess you mean upward direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You would see a tightening in supply/demand, which would change the momentum of the price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What if we had a scenario, if we had a scenario like the early 80s where actually we had three consecutive years of declining oil consumption cumulatively something more than, well roughly 10%? I mean would that be, do you see the supply situation being so fragile that we could get back into balance even in the context of that kind of demand decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't, but then I think you have to, I must point out the differences between now and the early 80s. And the first is the level of interest rates. In other words, at the moment we don't have a desire to control inflation through interest rates in the world system and probably it's a good thing. The second thing is that the capacity for oil substitution in the developed economies in the early 1980s was huge. So, a lot of that drop in the use of oil in the early 1980s or the mid-1980s was the substitution of other sources of power generation for oil. And today that just doesn't exist.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just a couple of maybe smaller picture follow-ups I guess. Can you comment on, perhaps I don't know how to ask it exactly, but comment on Multiclient interest versus contract interest within WesternGeco if that's somehow affected by all of the events that we're sort of thinking about currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think one has to have a clear policy on Multiclient. Our library is actually very small and we have had a very strong discipline of not shooting Multiclient unless it is, the cost of it is pre-funded to a certain percentage. And the danger with a seismic company in a downturn is that people will shoot Multiclient just to keep the boats active. And I think that it's incumbent on us to be extremely disciplined and not do too much of that. So, it's not really a question of just expanding the library for the sake of expanding the library, it's only expanding the library where you're sure you have a definite customer interest in what you're doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does it, relative to your efforts to shift your library I guess in your customers' interest in shifting your library to rich-azimuth, does that impact how much you expect to be able to do in '09, do you expect that trend will remain fairly stable or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No actually all indications at the moment are that, but it's early days, but all indications are that the '09 trend remains, for proprietary seismic, remains pretty positive at the moment. And a lot of that is to do with wide-azimuth or rich-azimuth as you say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. If I could ask you a quick question on M&amp;A opportunities outside of North America, if the change in operating environment increases the opportunity set?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it does Michael. But as you know there are not nearly so many, particularly for Schlumberger, targets outside North America that are very attractive. Yes, attractive from a company strategy standpoint I'm saying, not from a price standpoint. But yes there are but far less than the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there, okay. So if we look at distressed assets, probably the bigger market is still the U.S.?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If we look at maybe technology niche opportunities that are native capital will they be more outside?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say they could be either in or out.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick questions. Andrew, given the low level of visibility you seem to have on 2009 EPS and cash flow per share, and the fact that we obviously have down oil and gas prices and a weak credit market. Do you not think it's prudent here to be cutting CapEx more aggressively, in the expectations as the environment could possibly worsen further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I've said on several occasions this morning, we have a six to nine month cycle. So, basically that means out of the six to nine months, 80% of that has already been ordered. And therefore, we're not in a phase yet where our needs are so low that we start to cancel that. But beyond that we have not finalized the plan. But yes, obviously we're taking into account what we think the activity scenario is likely to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just on a last macro question, you talked about the 1980s. In the 80s, one of the things we've seen was that the supply really turned up when the rigs and service capacity turned up. And we've seen in the gas market recently supply rates turned up when the land rigs turned up and the service capacity turned up. Do you think there is a genuine risk here that we get to 2009-2010 and we have significantly more supply growth than most of us have estimated because that's when the capacity for services and rigs actually hits?</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are assuming that people keep spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm assuming that margins drop and volume improves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's possible, but it's a long, long way from stabilizing. In other words, it's going to &#x2013; the run up we've had in the last five years has been so inflationary. In fact if you relate the amount spent to the number of wells drilled, the activity increase has not been that huge. Now to the extent that prices drop and that the customers spend more and activity increases, yes. But you're really talking about beyond 2010.</p>
