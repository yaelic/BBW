          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is the EADS H1 earnings 2011 conference call. Louis Gallois, our CEO and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO will be presenting our results and answering your question.</p>
          <p>This call is planned to last about one hour. It's also webcast. To access on our homepage, we've set a special banner. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was e-mailed to you this early morning, with slides which we'll now walk through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain Safe Harbor statements which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now to, Louis Gallois.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nathalie.</p>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to our half year call. It's a particularly exciting time for our company, you imagine. Many of you have seen that we had a very successful Paris Air Show and a stream of further important orders including the A320 order from American Airlines. Our commercial figure around the world continues. Our outlook for the aerospace market remains confident.</p>
          <p>Commercial wins are the ultimate sign of the progress I believe we have made through a succession of positive management steps. We have given our customers the right answer to the cost changes with the fuel efficient offering of A320neo. With the award of the American Airlines, we have changed the competitive dynamic in this segment, and I could say the competitive landscape.</p>
          <p>We have talked at length in past meetings about our management's close attention to risk management which has lead to positive developments in the A380 and the A400M programs. This new level of prudence also extends to the A350 development, as those of you who attended our Paris Investor Breakfast surely know. Management is also giving its full attention to continued cost and margin enhancements. I think you will be seeing the growing results of this in our forward perspectives.</p>
          <p>Given our significant cash position, we are increasingly open to deals that broaden our portfolio. Our goal here is to give our shareholders increased enterprise values for a more balanced company. Our recent success with Vector Aerospace is an example of how the group looks at acquisition in terms of synergy and business model. You have also seen the Satair acquisition that we intend to pursue.</p>
          <p>Obviously as we evolve, our core shareholders continue to discuss our <mark type="ph" /> best governance (03:34) to our maturing company. I do not want to repeat ideas I have already shared in public on governance matters. What I do want to stress is that today's EADS has a system and business base which is successful and which can mesh within any sensible government system. After all, we now have a cohesive, transnational management. Organizational and national barriers to success have faded. Best practices are shared across the group for important business topics such as program management. Functions are better integrated. Thanks to future ideas, we have a highly confident management term focused on the future and long-term strategy. We have a stable and growing business.</p>
          <p>When I entered in this company, I said now we have to go back to business, and I think it's done. I think that these are the elements that investors care about, and they have good reason to be confident about EADS' future.</p>
          <p>Now Hans Peter will talk us through the financial highlights of the first half. Hans Peter, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Louis, and thanks Nathalie.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. We are on slide five now with the financial highlights. 2011 has started with revenue growth of 8% despite the usual seasonality pattern in our institutional business. The growth is mainly driven by volume effect at Airbus Commercial and Astrium. Deliveries remain at a high level. Defense revenues are slightly below the 2010 level.</p>
          <p>The EBIT before one-off stands at around &#x20AC;720 million for EADS and around &#x20AC;330 million for Airbus Commercial. The increase compared to last year is mainly driven by operational improvement including favorable volume and pricing and some favorable cost saving which more than compensates hedge rate deterioration and higher R&amp;D. The ongoing commercial momentum led to order intake of &#x20AC;58.1 billion for the H1 2011, well above the 2010 level.</p>
          <p>The 2011 order intake is net of 137 commercial aircraft cancelations and does not yet include all at Le Bourget. Our order book of almost &#x20AC;454 billion provides a solid platform for future growth. The Airbus Commercial backlog has been reduced by a negative revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;28 billion due to the deterioration of the US dollar closings for trade since the year-end 2011, the difference in the rate was $0.11.</p>
          <p>On slide six, we can look at the underlying performance of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin is at 3.3% at group level, it benefited from good performance in Airbus legacy programs and at Eurocopter as well as some favorable phasing in headquarters. The A380 continues to weigh on underlying performance but by roughly the same amount as last year.</p>
          <p>In the first half, the dollar mismatch and balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our EBIT result of around &#x20AC;100 million. Eurocopter booked a net charge of around &#x20AC;60 million related to the NH90 and SHAPE program. We have provided you with a complete EBIT before one-off view by division in the appendix on slide 21.</p>
          <p>If we go to slide seven, we can see that R&amp;D has increased compared to last year, driven mainly by development on the A350XWB at Airbus. The interest result has improved compared to the first half 2010 due to the higher average cash position. This slide includes interests related to refundable launch investments.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the other financial result deteriorated significant by around &#x20AC;270 million year-on-year. The main change comes from the negative revaluation of US dollar cash assets due to the deterioration of the closing spot rate of around 10 cents, 11 cents, as I said before, compared to the end of December 2010. This compares to an exchange rate improvement of 22 cents in 2010 versus December 2009, which led to a significant positive impact in H1 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition, there is a negative revaluation of our options. This line also includes the unwinding of discounted provisions. The tax rate for the year 2011 is expected to be around 30%. And the exchange rate variations create a lot of volatility in our financial results and net income. EADS has therefore decided to work on a net income before one-off. The EBIT one-offs and the revaluation of the US dollar and pound assets would be stripped out, as well, as the revaluation of our options.</p>
          <p>The first estimates of this driver are provided in the appendix on slide 23. You can see the material improvement on the underlying performance compared to last year. So we hope we make life a little bit easier for you in comparing performance and coming back to requests we have here on this topic.</p>
          <p>On to the hedging portfolio on slide eight. Since the beginning of the year, we have implemented $9.9 billion of new hedge contracts at an average rate of $1.38 per euro without collateralization. During the same period, $8.9 billion of forward contracts matured at an average hedge rate of $1.37 per euro.</p>
          <p>The recent deterioration of the US dollar is partly mitigated by the evolution of interest rates that has a favorable effect on forward curves. However, to protect flexibility and hedging capacity with banks in a volatile foreign exchange market, we want to limit the size of our forward portfolio to roughly the current level and further diversify our portfolio with foreign exchange options.</p>
          <p>We have therefore replenished the maturing hedges with new forward contracts, and in addition have implemented $1 billion worth of options maturing in 2013. Our hedge book increased from $70.2 billion at the end of 2010 to $71.3 billion at the end of June 2011.</p>
          <p>At the end of June, the mark-to-market of our hedge portfolio was positive at around &#x20AC;1.3 billion before tax compared to a negative &#x20AC;1.9 billion at the end of December. This movement is driven by the evaluation of the closing spot rate from $1.34 per euro in December 2010 to $1.45 for the end of June 2011.</p>
          <p>Up to the cash flow slide now, it's page nine. The H1 cash flow was robust despite unfavorable phasing at Eurocopter and Cassidian. Before Vector Aerospace, so the acquisition we did in the second quarter, the free cash flow for the first half is positive at around &#x20AC;250 million.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow from operations reflects the improvement in operational performance. Compared to 2010, the improvement is driven by the working capital, a higher level of customer advances received, particularly at Airbus and improved working capital management is partially reduced by a ramp up in inventories, particularly at Airbus and Astrium.</p>
          <p>Customer financing generated cash of around &#x20AC;100 million in the first half as the lessor and banking market appetite continues to be active. The level of capital expenditure is in line with the 2010 level. The net cash also reflects the cash contribution to pension assets of around &#x20AC;300 million, in line with our previous communication and the cash purchase of minority shares of Dornier/ DADC from Daimler for &#x20AC;115 million.</p>
          <p>Now, Louis will walk you through the EBIT performance in more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>If you could take the slide 11, Airbus Commercial booked 777 gross orders in the first half. The backlog now stands at 3,934 aircraft representing around seven years of full production. Airbus achieved, and you'll recall <mark type="ph" /> Le Bourget (13:28) 1,000 orders and commitments have been received for the A320neo, making it the fastest-selling airliner ever.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, American Airlines have since endorsed both the A320 and A320neo families with this latest <mark type="ph" /> recalled (13:47) commercial aircraft order. We are advancing on the A350 program, manufacturing and pre-assembly of the A350-900 is ongoing. The entry-into-service is still targeted for the end of 2013 which is a challenging time schedule.</p>
          <p>Following customer feedback, Airbus and Rolls Royce are now jointly developing an enhanced A350-1000 with more powerful front engines. The entry-into-service is now scheduled for mid-2017. At the same time, as more A350-800 customers are migrating to the bigger-900 version, the entry-into-service for the 800 is adjusted to mid 2016 allowing a clear focus on the two bigger models as per market demand. In its military segment, Airbus delivered five medium and light aircraft in the first two A330 MRTT to Royal Australian Air Force in the first half. One new CN-235 was booked resulting in a military backlog of 235 aircrafts.</p>
          <p>The A400 program continues its test flight program and has accumulated more than 1,800 flight hours by the end of June. The recent engine incidents are currently under investigation.</p>
          <p>On to slide 12, and a closer look at the segment numbers. Compared to H1 2010, Airbus Commercial revenues benefited from favorable volume and pricing effect.</p>
          <p>Airbus Commercial EBIT before one-off benefited from better operational performance including favorable volume and pricing, net of escalation. The improvement year-on-year is partially reduced by hedge rate deterioration of around &#x20AC;160 million and higher on the expenses particularly on the A350 XWB. At Airbus, military revenue growth of 10% is driven by higher A400M revenue recognition this year.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military EBIT and EBIT before one-off improved. H1 2011 results were impacted by negative foreign exchange impacts linked into the revaluation of A400M loss making contract provision as well as some under recovery of fixed costs.</p>
          <p>Now, Hans Peter will talk you through our other divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Louis.</p>
          <p>Up to Eurocopter on Page 13. The H1 2011 net order trend has improved compared to H1 2010, with 192 new net orders this year. The light helicopter and US markets are now in recovery. The contract to upgrade 12 German Armed Forces NH90 TTH for quick change medical transport mission was booked in the second quarter, and the NH90 naval version initial delivery to Italy was accomplished, which becomes the third NFH operator.</p>
          <p>Revenue and EBIT increases compared to a year ago are due to a favorable mix effect coming from commercial deliveries and support activities. A net charge of &#x20AC;60 million was booked in the second quarter. The charge relates to a <mark type="ph" /> contract completion review (17:34) on the NH90 as well as the charge linked to SHAPE, the transformation program in Eurocopter.</p>
          <p>The 2010 figure included a net charge of &#x20AC;70 million. Two important milestones were achieved in the second quarter to increase Eurocopter's global footprint. As, Louis already mentioned, the acquisition of Vector Aerospace was completed on June 30th for around &#x20AC;460 million. In line with the group's Vision 2020 strategy, this acquisition will help to increase the growth of support and service activities in both civil and governmental markets while increasing EADS' presence in North America and in the UK.</p>
          <p>In addition, a cooperation and distribution agreement between Eurocopter and Kazakhstan Engineering has been signed to formalize the industrial and commercial scope for assembly and customization of the EC-145 helicopters. Up to Astrium, it's page 14. Astrium order intake reached &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the first half. Second quarter orders included a telecommunication satellite for MEASAT, the Malaysian operator, for the provision of large capacity across Malaysia, Indonesia and India.</p>
          <p>In Earth observation, Astrium has been selected as prime contractor for the Sentinel-4 optical satellite as part of GMES program to provide information on atmospheric levels. In addition, Astrium was also awarded the prime contractorship for the Galileo Full Operational Capability Ground Control Segment which covers the provision of ground control segment facilities for the operation of Europe's Global Navigation Satellite System.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased by 11% compared to last year due to a higher activity in launches and satellites, and despite lower volume in services. EBIT declined by 3% year-on-year as the higher volume and productivity in launches and satellites was more than offset by lower services activity. During the second quarter, Ariane 5 recorded its 44th consecutive successful launch, taking more than 10 tons into geostationary orbit for the first time. Astrium continues to work on its transformation program AGILE to increase efficiency. The implementation of AGILE will trigger some non-recurring costs and higher R&amp;D in the second half.</p>
          <p>Up to Cassidian on the next page. Cassidian is feeling the first pressure from a changing business environment. Preparation of the transformation program is well underway and on track to become effective in the second half, with related non-recurring costs. A new organization should be announced shortly. H1 revenues and EBIT reflects changing business mix. The revenue and EBIT trend is in line with expectations. R&amp;D expenses are focused mainly on unmanned aerial systems and secure communications.</p>
          <p>Underlining its commitment to the European Talarion next-generation unmanned aerial system, Cassidian signed an agreement with Turkish Aerospace Industries to establish close cooperation in the program. The French DGA has confirmed additional orders for the DRAC system for the French army. In the second quarter, MBDA recorded the first submarine launch of the SCALP Naval cruise missile, which was carried out by the French Defense Procurement Agency, DGA, at its test center in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
          <p>Now lastly to other businesses, slide 16, revenues were lower than 2010 level as higher activity at Sogerma were more than offset by lower deliveries at ATR which are back-loaded this year. H1 2011 EBIT includes a gain on disposal from a divestiture in EADS North America that was completed in May.</p>
          <p>ATR enjoyed a historic Paris Air Show with the announcement of 60 new orders and 37 options confirming the success of the upgraded product range particularly in a high oil price and eco-sensitive environment. The latest commercial achievement bring total firm orders to 84 at end of June, 2011, and the backlog stands now at 226 aircraft.</p>
          <p>Now Louis, will comment on our guidance on slide 18.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter.</p>
          <p>We confirm our improved revised components of the guidance given earlier in the year based on an assumption of &#x20AC;1 for $1.35 for year-end closing spot rate. In 2011, Airbus should deliver between 520 and 530 commercial aircrafts, thanks to the ongoing commercial momentum, Airbus now expect its gross order to be above 1,000. EADS 2011 revenues should be above 2010 revenues as we assumed for the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>EADS still expect 2011 &#x2013; EADS EBIT before one-off to remain stable compared to the 2010 level at around the &#x20AC;1.3 billion. H2 EBIT before one-off at Airbus will be clearly positive, but lower than H1 due to higher R&amp;D expenses and a less favorable mix.</p>
          <p>Going forward, reported EBIT and EPS performance of EADS will be dependent on the group ability to execute on the A400M, A380 and A350 programs in line with the commitments made to its customers. Reported EBIT on EPS also depend on exchange rate fluctuations. At &#x20AC;1 for $1.35, EADS expects 2011 EPS to be above the 2010 level of &#x20AC;0.68. It may be below the 2010 level at &#x20AC;1 for $1.45.</p>
          <p>By increasing the free cash flow guidance, free cash flow is now expected to be around &#x20AC;1 billion before any investment for acquisitions. In 2012, the group expects a significant improvement in its EBIT before one-off thanks to higher volume, better pricing and improvement of the A380 performance at Airbus. We are feeling more and more confident as year progresses.</p>
          <p>We will now take your questions. Nathalie?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Could you comment on the pricing environment as you look out over the next few years? Boeing made some statements this week that they're seeing some pricing pressure in later years. That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the A380, you commented that you're looking at the negative impact of the A380 being the same at this period as we've seen before. When should we start to really some change there and some real improvement in performance that will impact the financial results?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I start with the second one. So, Doug, good morning for you. I think it must be very early. On A380 and when do we see the improvements, I think you remember the presentation we've made in Le Bourget and <mark type="ph" /> Tom (27:30) had a very, I would say, interesting slide on the development of the Airbus performance and you have seen the curve and the pattern of the curve, which had shown that there is significant improvement in 2012 and to a significant extent this will come from A380, so the first big step of improvement will indeed be next year, not 2011, yet as we have discussed before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the pricing environment, I could say that there is tough competition, but we don't see a negative evolution of the pricing environment for the time being. We &#x2013; I confirm that the American Airlines deal was done <mark type="ph" /> in the frame (28:20) of the business plan and the business case of the A320, A320neo at fairly rewarding price &#x2013; pricing for everybody. I don't feel that we are pressured downward for pricing. But it's competition, that's clear. It means that we have to be careful, but for the time being situation is more stable than negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you don't see the American, the American deal itself which I'm assuming was aggressive pricing on both sides. You don't see that as changing the environment in itself, in other words other discussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for the time being, no. And with the backlog of orders both Boeing and ourselves, we have, we are not tempted to play the pricing game. And I think the competition as I said, competition is tough, but <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:28) pricing is not under significant pressure downward, I have to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone. Two questions, please. First one for Hans Peter first, just around the cash, can you just explain, perhaps why the net cash came a little bit lower than we thought it might have done for the second quarter? And then just a question around A350, if we look at the release, I mean you've made this comment that it remains a very challenging time schedule. Has anything changed since the Air Show because that comment is was slightly more cautious and perhaps <mark type="ph" /> we have heard of (30:13) the Air Shows, has there been any change in the program at all or is it just reemphasizing that program remains tough? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you take the first question, Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll take the first one. Rupi, I mean if we look to the net cash, indeed it's about, I think &#x20AC;1 billion lower than we have seen it in end of March. There are several elements which contribute to that, first an acquisition, which was made, which is reflected in the free cash flow. So the contribution in the second quarter on free cash flow was negative due to that. We have made a small minority acquisition on remaining shares in Dornier from Daimler with about &#x20AC;110 million, &#x20AC;115 million. We contributed &#x20AC;300 million and this is also not included in the free cash flow of pension money. And on top of that, we had the &#x20AC;180 million dividends which were paid in the second quarter so that sums up to a, I would say, sizeable amount and explain or more than explain, I would say, the decrease of the cash position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the A350, as I said, it remains a very challenging program, but there is no change in the perspective of the program given by Fabrice Br&#xE9;gier</p>
          <p>at the Le Bourget, there is absolutely no change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hans, could I just perhaps follow up on the cash, how much of the orders from Le Bourget didn't come in the quarter? So how much was left behind, if you like for the second half of the year?</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Ben Fidler from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. Two questions, please. Firstly, coming back to another one on the American Airlines order, I wonder if you could share with us your plans to deal with moving on some of the financing risks that you're accepting on the A320 classics, how much of the back stock do you think you will actually end up holding in the mid to long term, and whether you can help us understand how conversations already are going with other people in the aircraft financing industry about moving some of that risk on?</p>
          <p>The second question that I had was just whether you can help us understand how the backlog looks today on the A350-800, after the migrations that we've seen to the 900 variant or whether there still is a viable business case for you to press ahead with the A350-800?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll take the first one probably Louis, if you agree? So back to the financing of American, actually it's operating lease commitments we have with American here, related to the standard aircraft not to the neo. We clearly have the intention as we usually do to sell this to lessors, the discussions are ongoing, so it's &#x2013; we have started those discussions already during the deal negotiations. We are confident we can sell down a very &#x2013; at least, if not 100%, a very significant part of it, particularly all the A321 leases which are a bit more interesting for the market than the A319.</p>
          <p>But all in all, we would expect that it is taken up by lessors and then the question remains how much is coming back from lessors' backlog and how much is probably, I would say, order intake on top of what we have seen. So that's I think what I can say to the American Airlines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the A350-800, the level of order at the end of H1 2011 is 135.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes we are in discussion with the airlines on the 800 because some of them could be interested towards the 900 before. And on the 1000, we are in discussion with them on the basis of the improvement of the airplane and which compensates in our view the deal for airlines improvement in range or in <mark type="ph" /> period (35:27).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At what level do you think the A350-800 backlog gets to before you may question the viability, the commercial viability of actually pressing ahead with that product and customers preferring a 900?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are not questioning the viability of any version. We think that the response from airlines is pushing us to maintain the three version products with different time schedule, you have seen that. We are giving the priority to the 900, but I think those three versions are responding to airlines needs and we continue on those three versions without any problem.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I've got two questions, please. First one is on the production delivery slots for &#x2013; particularly the A320, could you please tell me what the position is in terms of whether, '11, '12, '13 are all sold out, or do you still have some and I'm a little bit worried in case you've overbooked and you don't get the usual evaporation that you may be in the reverse problem of having to pay penalties on non-deliveries. So I just want to clear that up. And the second question is just on <mark type="ph" /> the set pricing (37:09), I felt the acquisition price of almost 14 times EBITDA seems very rich and I'm hoping that this will not become a trend going forward on your acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the EBITDA question, Zafar, good morning first. We are I would say in line &#x2013; more or less we are in line with the market, you might say it looks expensive, it's very close to a similar transaction by Boeing, some years ago with Aviall. So there is not a material difference and it's highly, we hope at least, it's a very synergetic deal. I mean we cannot talk about details at this point obviously, because we have just started the process. So, and so far I think we would not comment a lot more on this at this stage at least. And if we take the current year multiple, it's not actually as high as you say. So, it's below. So, we think it's reasonable. It's certainly &#x2013; the market is a market and we have to deal with that.</p>
          <p>And on the delivery slots, I think your question was whether or not we are running into trouble potentially with all booking which is there in 2013 and '14, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Normally we shouldn't get into trouble in '12 it's any way, extremely limited. It starts to become a bit more significant in '13 and '14. It's lower than the levels we have already seen, simply because as you rightly suspect, the market has changed. It's much more bullish and I would say that capacity to change lots is probably more limited due to that. But as you have seen, we have so far managed the 320 program with overbooking since 2007, I think, when we started.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> None of it was seven (39:23). And we have not paid any penalties up till today. So, it was possible to get that manage and for some time, the overbookings were higher than they are currently, because we have increased the production rate. This is one reason. The problem is that &#x2013; on top of what we see on overbooking there is still some frustrated demand which we would see in the market as of today, which will be difficult to satisfy in the timeframe we are discussing here. So there are more requests in '13, '14,'15. And in '13, '14, it will be difficult due to the overbooking..</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Coming back to the pricing question, A320neo, I think <mark type="ph" /> John (40:21), he said that he'd like for Airbus to keep about half of the present value of the potential fuel savings and additional pricing. Was that just an aspiration which is I now have to go by the buyers as Boeing's come up with their 737 RE? Or have you actually been able to achieve some genuine additional pricing on A320neo?</p>
          <p>And second question, is sort of slightly related, do you need to push build rates higher out beyond 15 &#x2013; beyond the 42 rate in order just to create some slots to sell? And again, going back to the point about having frustrated demand in '13, '14, '15, and so, are we going to see ourselves pushing up to the 50 sort of rates with whatever kind of risks that entails, but also potentially offering some earnings upside?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the neo pricing and the American deal, I think Louis made the comment on the American deal. If we look what has happened because of the American deal, I would think that the pricing should not be so much under pressure. Louis said that before because we tend to be in the same kind of duopoly as we had it before. So I think that's...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with very important backlogs on both sides. We have indeed a sharing of the pricing upside with the airline and obviously, we share that on the manufacturer side with the engine manufacturer because the significant improvement comes from the engine. So in so far, this is still what we see today and what we can get.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:17) rates of the A320, certainly a good solution could be to increase of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:17) rates. And Airbus is looking at that at least &#x2013; they are looking for 44 per month. But no decision has been taken because we have to be sure that supply chain is following us. And you know that we have partly the same supply chain as Boeing and it's been so that supply chain is under a very strong pressure.</p>
          <p>If you take, for example, the engine manufacturers, they are delivering engines to <mark type="ph" /> at least CFMI (42:56) to Airbus and to Boeing and they are the only supply chain which is under constraint, and that is the main issue. It's not an issue for the assembly lines, an issue for the supply chain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Sorry to be a bit short term. Just, not sure I'll be around 2015 and beyond. On A350, I know nothing has changed but at Le Bourget, we were just about to start testing of things like, I think the Iron Bird, and I'd love to know whether we have started that and how long that goes on for. And at what point we will know for sure that the <mark type="ph" /> major (43:47) sub-assemblies have or have not come together. So I mean, any sort of additional information on that would be very helpful, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the A350s, the new elements, what can I say? I could remind you our next milestones. The first flight of the airplane will be during &#x2013; at the end of summer. We are expecting, we are targeting to have the assembly line for the static airplane starting at the end of the year. We expect the first flight at the end of 2012 for certification in the second part of 2013 and we are targeting, as I said, the delivery of the first airplane at the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>Of course, what I can say is that we are progressing on the systems side. The design are frozen the testing is underway. All system can be tested on the Iron Bird 18 months before first flight which is far better than on other airplanes. High risk equipment is done. The cabin is frozen for the first customers. Engine is doing well, but we have to see the engine flying and you know that to fly is the most consistent test for a flying equipment like an engine. And it will be the same for the airplane.</p>
          <p>We need to freeze installation system and this is the system installation designs and electrical design, but the system seems to be robust and the electricity design is good enough. That's some indication I could give you on the status of the program. This program is permanently under review to be sure that we are informed earlier now for about all the difficulties which could happen.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of others ahead of us, and as I said, the most demanding hurdle is the flight test because we &#x2013; each time you discover things in the flight test and we have to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:28) easy one. And we will see but as I said, we are in the same time schedule and with the same level of risk as we were at Le Bourget when Fabrice Br&#xE9;gier explained to you the status of the A350.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. So I got two quick questions, if I could. One on production rates for Louis and then one for Hans Peter on our favorite subject of Airbus profitability.</p>
          <p>First on A320 production rates, I'm wondering, how significant is the risk when we hit that point that we'll be delivering A320neos and legacy A320s at the same time? And if you could talk just a little bit more about that transition plan?</p>
          <p>Then my second question is for Hans Peter, when I &#x2013; this is the second quarter in a row it seemed that Airbus profitability is trending a little bit better than many of us expected. Now in Q1, you said this was for the &#x2013; in regards to the phasing of some non-serious costs. So where do you think the beat came from this quarter and specifically, do you think we're at a point where we may be seeing net cost savings in the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the transition, you know that we will assemble the A320 and the A320neo in the same assembly line and we will adjust the production pace of A320 and A320neo. We keep a global view of the number of airplane we have to deliver. For the time being, we are targeting 42. It will be a mix during the transition build of A320 and A320neo. These transition periods should take around three years and we have to manage that but it's not an issue for the assembly line. The assembly line will be fitted to assemble two airplanes at the same time, same reason and with &#x2013; we could have on the assembly line one neo succeeding to one standard and behind the Neo a new standard, it will be an organized flow without difference between the neo and the A320 standard.</p>

          <p>Jason, good morning. For your second question, profitability of Airbus and that you think we are trading a bit better. Yes, probably. It's good operational performance which helped. You'll remember the phasing we discussed in Q1, this has to a large extent reversed in the second quarter already. So it was really driven by operational improvement and on the other side, driven also by higher R&amp;D in the first half than we had it in the first half in the year before. And on top of this obviously, you have the hedging impact which we mentioned before which in Airbus alone, 160 and for the group probably a bit more. So these are currently in the first half at least the drivers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but, Hans Peter, I'm just trying to understand where specifically it came from? So if the non-phasing &#x2013; non-serious cost phasing has already unwound, R&amp;D is a little bit higher. You should have had a good idea what volumes would be and what the pricing impact would be. You've guided a no improvement in A380. I'm just wondering where the better than expected operational improvement is coming from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. I could answer that question. I mean, it's somewhere &#x2013; the operational performance is in, I would say, totally somewhere north of &#x20AC;300 million and most of it is coming from the two elements, volume and price, and a little bit from the cost side, but most of it is coming from the two first items I have mentioned. So pricing is better, volumes contributed.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Celine Fornaro from Bank of America. Please go ahead ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. The first one, we focused a lot on Airbus. I'd like just to focus on the satellite and defense business, and if you could share a bit what the outlook is, not for the second half, but thinking more a bit further out. And also trying to understand why the satellite service coming down. I thought that was a good area to be in. And on Cassidian, you said the business is changing, and I'd like to understand a bit more why and civil is only 10% of that business, so what are we going to have going forward?</p>
          <p>And secondly is the thinking about the acquisitions. It's very clear to us, I think, on the areas where you want to make those deals, geographies and end-markets. I just would like you to remind us what are your financial metrics that you apply when you evaluate those deals? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first question and you answer the second one. It doesn't mean I am not interested in financial metrics, but it's your field, less competent. On satellite and satellite services are a bit suffering now. It's not because we are not interested in satellite services and we consider that it's a field for growth of the company and we are ready to invest in it.</p>
          <p>We have certainly &#x2013; we have on observation services, <mark type="ph" /> through faulty measures and input errors (53:28). The performance is a bit disappointing and we have to see exactly why we are expecting to launch a new satellite and we were expecting to get revenues from that, but this satellite has to be launched by Soyuz, and Soyuz is late and for that we <mark type="ph" /> have locked (53:51) revenues we were expecting in 2011. We will get them in 2012. On telecommunication satellites services, the performance is still good. I have to say that to explain perhaps a bit lower performance that the UK government is trying to reduce volume of military telecommunications to save some money and we have felt a slight reduction of the traffic on the telecommunication traffic through our Skynet device and &#x2013; but I think it's not putting fundamental questions on our strategy on services with two satellites, we consider it's a very good segment and we will continue to invest on it.</p>
          <p>On defense, on Cassidian, Cassidian is beginning to feel this budget constraint in Europe, on defense budget that's clear. And as everybody, Cassidian is shifting to export and for that it is adopting its organization to export with more focus on countries. It means that we are reorganizing Cassidian in a way which is giving more weight to country organization compared to business line, even if the profit and loss remain mainly in business lines. And you have seen that we have simplified the structure with removing one layer of the budget. It's clear that for the different forecast season, the competition of Eurofighter in India is very important because it's one of the biggest opportunities for export.</p>
          <p>And the next challenge will be certainly concerning domestic countries, the future of drones in Europe and in particular middle-altitude long endurance drones, MALE drones. And you know that there are different IDCS through Europe, and we are clearly pushing for European program on MALE drones.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'd say the most important one we usually look at is the cash flows for the cash conversion, and based on business plans and based on historic performance, as far as you can get it, for listed companies. There are limits, obviously. But for other transactions, there is a lot of discussion on the business plan. And usually we do not agree, not surprisingly, I would say, on what we get presented sometimes. So this is then, I would say, a discussion.</p>
          <p>Second it's obviously comparables, so comparable multiples with other transactions in the sector, and where the market is on EBITDA multiples and on EBIT multiples.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I would say probably the most important thing we look at is what is the level of synergies we can generate with an acquisition? I mean we made now a small acquisition in air traffic management, for example, in the US. And this is really complementing something where we are at the beginning, and we think we have to be, and where we want also to grow.</p>
          <p>And in so far, this is a highly-synergetic, I would say, transaction, which justifies sometimes &#x2013; not sometimes, but it has to justify and more than justify the price. Because obviously, some of the synergies you have to keep for yourself in order to generate value for the group.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, good morning. Just two questions. Firstly, when we think about Airbus, can you help us to understand whether in terms of the current sales campaigns underway, both the number of customers you're talking to and the number of potential aircraft sales, is it about the same as it was &#x2013; let's say a quarter or two ago? Is it going up? It is coming off a little bit with the global environment?</p>
          <p>And then the second question really relates to potentially higher line rates, particularly on narrow-body product. I suppose as we look forward in coming years toward the middle of the next decade, line rates are probably going to have to head into the upper 40s, maybe above 50. What kind of investment do you have to make in terms of facilities and tooling? And do you need new final assembly line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your turn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first for Airbus, what do we think about the momentum of sales, if I understand well? This momentum is good for the time being. I don't expect to have the second half of the year as good as the first half. It's clear. But &#x2013; for orders. But I'm sure that the market is &#x2013; the number of campaign is high.</p>
          <p>We see that the US market is now much more active than it was in the last five or to seven years. That is certainly because of the oil price preoccupation from airlines, American airlines, US airlines to modernize their fleets because they have the oldest fleet and they have to do something.</p>
          <p>We see this move on the opposite side. You know that there is the &#x2013; first some turbulences in some part of the world. It's clear that in North Africa or in some countries, it's more difficult to sell aircraft. But it's a limited part of the market.</p>
          <p>And second, the oil price is &#x2013; on one way, it's pushing airlines to modernize and to replace old airplanes, but on the other side, it's limiting the financing capacity. And it means that when the oil price is above certain level, it's not good for the market. Up to a certain level, it's pushing airlines to replace their airplanes. Above this level, it could be a handicap for some airlines to buy airplanes.</p>
          <p>But in a nutshell, the market for the time being is very active. We have a lot of campaigns. And I think you will see new orders for the two contenders in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>For the kind of investment we could do in the narrow body, I know that there are some rumors about new assembly lines in different countries, and particularly the United States. We are not at that level of decision or thinking. This is a speculation.</p>
          <p>For the time being, the bottleneck is not assembly line. The bottleneck for increasing production is clearly the supply chain, and also the fact that we have to be careful not to go too fast to have very high production rates. If we have to go down after that, up and down is never good for ourselves, and above all, for our supply chain. And we have to be careful with this increase of production rate. But Airbus is looking at that very carefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just clarify, Louis? Are you saying that if we were to go into the high 40s or let's say up to rate 50, we would not need a new final assembly line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have not said that. I said that for the time being, to go &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> the steady (1:03:25) for Airbus now is not 50, it's 44. And to go from 42 to 44, we have to be sure that the <mark type="ph" /> assembly (1:03:30) is following.</p>
          <p>For you, perhaps it looks very limited. But we are starting from 36. 36, 38, 42, 44. We have to be sure that we are not going on the other side of the reasonable limit. And even 44 is a question mark for our supply chain. To go to 50, perhaps it could trigger investment for EADS, certainly investment for EADS. But the main order will be the supply chain.</p>
          <p>We could create another supply chain to increase supply chain, but it's very difficult. It's a very long process, and for some items, it's not possible. Take the engines.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Antoine Boivin from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone. Antoine Boivin from Cheuvreux. I've got two quick question.</p>
          <p>First of all, you estimate 1,000 gross orders for the year. Are you not too shy in this number? Because you started with 2.7 &#x2013; which is a nice figure, by the way &#x2013; plus I calculated 310 MoUs, not yet confirmed &#x2013; 88 from China and 260 from American Airlines. So you end up with 1500 minimum by putting together all these numbers. So this is first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is actually on this production rate, obviously there is <mark type="ph" /> but unlike (1:05:26) but also is there any risk to have your <mark type="ph" /> for now (1:05:27) A320 customers wanting to swap for the neo? Meaning that your backlog of <mark type="ph" /> for now (1:05:34) the A320, it could diminish quickly, and therefore, your production level be too high, before the entry into service of the neo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Antoine, I could only say that we will be above 1,000, I think. I don't know exactly the figure at the end of the year, but will be above 1,000.</p>
          <p>For the A320 standard, for the time being, we don't see this movement, because we have such a backlog, even for the A320neo, that airlines which want to have airplanes earlier are sticking to the standard. Which is less expensive, I have to say, to buy, it's less expensive. There could be some advantage for the A320 standard.</p>
          <p>And the main advantage is that that is available earlier, and we don't see customers shifting to the neo. And we see customers ordering A320 standard. It was the case for American Airlines.</p>
          <p>And we are still selling A320 standards. And we said that from the beginning. <mark type="ph" /> Jean-Louis (1:06:56) was extremely outspoken on the topic. He said, you will see that we will sell at the same time A320 standard and A320neo. And <mark type="ph" /> he said (1:07:11) happening today.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. A few quick questions, please. I mean, first of all just in terms of A320neo and hedging. I'm just wondering if the success of the program will change your hedging strategy in any way.</p>
          <p>Second thing was just quickly on the 380. Presumably, higher deliveries but the same loss is progress.</p>
          <p>And then finally, just on Eurocopter, should we expect to see OE improvement in the second half of the year? Are build rates going to rise in the second half of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On hedging and A320neo, indeed, we will have to think strategically about the hedging policy going forward.</p>
          <p>The exposure on firm contracts is increasing and increasing currently. As you've seen, our hedge book has not moved a lot. So we were up from 70 to 71. We started to use some optionality, and I think, if we think &#x2013; have to think strategically about this issue, is it is a question of getting more natural hedge into our exposure. Which is a long-term topic, which would mean to buy even more in dollar and probably to do more in the dollar area.</p>
          <p>But we don't have a concrete plan as of today for you. But this is certainly something we have to think about as we are selling airplanes beyond 2015 now, and the timeframe is very long, and the question where the dollar is certainly more than an open question. So it's unpredictable.</p>
          <p>So far, yes, it is something we need to think about with the recent, I would say, success. And whenever there is something we can tell you &#x2013; I mean we have not changed the usual hedging strategy yet. We hedge ourselves roughly at the rate of the matured hedges, plus probably a little bit of options on top. But this addresses, I would say, the years until 2014, '15, and beyond. The hedge book is very limited, as you can see from the slide. And the hedge &#x2013; and the order book is growing in that timeframe beyond 2015. So it is indeed something which needs to be followed.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just, you talked about the A380 headwind being basically flat in Q2, but obviously you delivered more aircrafts. So I'm just wondering if that is progress at the source, or if there's no real change in terms of profitability of the program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the delivery schedule for 2011, we are still targeting to deliver 25 airplanes.</p>
          <p>The main challenge is linked to the availability of Rolls engines. Because you know that after the incident with Qantas, and after the earthquake in Japan, Rolls had some difficulties to fill the assembly line with engines, and we had to reorganize the delivery schedule for our airplanes in 2011. It will &#x2013; could have an impact up to beginning of 2012. We will see, but for the time being, we are still on 25 airplanes.</p>
          <p>And the impact on the financial of that is certainly, we are improving the gross margin per aircraft. But as we are delivering more airplanes, and as they are at loss, still at loss, it's clear that we don't see the impact on the global performance. We will see the impact in 2012 because the increase of the gross margin and the decrease of losses will be more significant than the increase of the number of airplane. We'll compensate &#x2013; more than compensate the increase of number of airplanes delivered.</p>
          <p>On Eurocopter, the market is still a bit weak, but we expect to have, in the second part of the year and at the end of the year, to see a recovery. We feel that the US market and perhaps also the Russian one have started first recovery, partly thanks to the oil and gas segment, and also on the light helicopters.</p>
          <p>We see also that the second-hand market has started to slowly decline since the beginning of the year with less than 1,200 worldwide used helicopter for sale at the end of June, which is an improvement. And also one indicator is the low level of cancellation we have. We are &#x2013; we had only seven cancellations in the first six months compared to 27 on the first six months of 2010.</p>
          <p>All these elements are leading us to be more optimistic for the recovery of the market at the end of 2012. But certainly, the crisis has been longer on helicopters than on airplanes, so that's clear.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Just one question on production rates going up.</p>
          <p>In the past &#x2013; I'm just trying to get my head around your assumptions for fleet growth and air traffic growth for the ramp up in production rates across Airbus. But in the past, we know strong demand in 2007 and 2008 &#x2013; you didn't address that the strong demand <mark type="ph" /> are (1:13:55) ramping up production rates. And that was basically what allowed you to get through the cycle very successfully.</p>
          <p>And now we're seeing strong demand on the one hand, but the traffic growth, at least <mark type="ph" /> the IR data (1:14:11) from yesterday, is not so strong. But still we see a significant ramp up. And question is are we not going to get to a situation where we'll be over-producing aircraft within a few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> New (1:14:24) aircraft? I could say that the demand is strong for different reason in the different part of the world.</p>
          <p>In Asia, the demand is strong certainly because the growth of the traffic is impressive, and airlines are believing that this growth will sustain in the next years, because it's a new population acceding to air flights. And it's clear that the demand in Asia is pulled by the potential growth of the traffic.</p>
          <p>In the United States, it's not the growth of the traffic which is triggering demand. It's the obligation of replacement of the oldest fleet in the world, because at the &#x2013; with the present oil price, the old fleets are no longer sustainable for airlines.</p>
          <p>And it's for that you see that Delta is moving after American Airlines. You see a lot of airlines which were not in the market in the past year coming to the market, not because of the increase of the traffic, but because they need to replace the airplanes. It means that the market now is much more diversified than in the past.</p>

          <p>The question comes from Christophe Menard from Kepler. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning. Two quick questions.</p>
          <p>First one on Eurocopter. I was surprised, the performance was relatively better than what I expected in H1 for Eurocopter. And I was wondering whether you could share with us how you were seeing the mix evolving in 2011 and 2012? You already partly answered the question. But some sort of, if you can talk more about the Tiger deliveries to Germany, for instance.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on security. I was wondering if the current budget constraints are changing your assumption on acquisitions in security at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Security is less impacted by budget constraints than defense. And I could say that security market is, for us, a very important one and we &#x2013; when we're looking at possible acquisitions, we are certainly looking at security. And you know that we have created a special business unit for the cyber security and we are prepared to invest in this new field, that's clear. On the mix for Eurocopter, it's a changing mix which is &#x2013; we have the Tiger and NH90 increasing their share in revenues of Eurocopter and they are not the most profitable product for the time being. It means that Eurocopter has to compensate that with cost-saving programs. And I have to say that they are managing SHAPE program is a very courageous way, very courageous way.</p>
          <p>And I have to say that the management of Eurocopter is doing a very good job for saving money, and certainly to improve the performance of the programs, Tiger and NH90 which will be very important in the revenues in the next years.</p>
          <p>But also you'll see that we have bought Vector. It means that nearly 50% of the turnover of Eurocopter will be the future on the services which is mitigating the risk we have on some products. And when you have to look &#x2013; when you are looking at the performance of Eurocopter, you have to take into account that now it's at 30%, 35% with Vector it will be 40%, 45%. It means nearly 50% will be in services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may, just a quick follow up on this. Is the chipsets of the services at Eurocopter increasing in the coming two years or three years? Do you see a trending in that direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look to the current plans of Eurocopter for next year, there will be not a lot of change yet, but we see then changes beyond 2012 again to &#x2013; levels are probably even above what we have seen in the past already. So it's improving over time and as, Louis said NH90 Tiger are still a little bit increasing without margin contribution, but the majority of the increase is coming from the <mark type="ph" /> series (1:19:33) commercial helicopters which are delivering quite good margins and on top of it we have the service business as Louis said.</p>
