        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here again with you <mark type="inaudible" /> about the 2008 results. The year was a very challenging year, because we started the year with the temperature of Rio de Janeiro and we finished the year with the Siberia temperature. But in an average, I think was a little &#x2013; was let's say, reasonable. I would like to give Fabio Barbosa the opportunity to make some comments. And then, I will join you again to make some comments about the future. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Roger. Our agenda today encompasses discussion of our 2008 results, how we see what we are doing to deal with the current challenges, and what we see beyond the current global financial crisis.</p>
          <p>First, it's fair to say that we had a very good performance in 2008, despite the major change that was observed in the fourth quarter. We achieved eight production records, eight shipment records, and we did have an outstanding financial performance, as you can see, by the several indicators in revenues, that we reached an all-time record of $38.5 billion. EBIT, almost $16 billion, the cumulative growth rate in the range of 40-46 and 50%, respectively.</p>
          <p>The record cash generation and net earnings of EBITDA and net earnings, as you can see, they're 19 and $13 billion, respectively. And the return to our shareholders that reached a record level announced in 2008, with $3.6 billion in total, involving also the share buyback that we performed during the year.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our investments reached a record level of $10.2 billion, out of which almost three-fourths was dedicated to growth, clearly stating our perspective about the future of the mining industry as a whole.</p>
          <p>And finally, it is important to mention that this growth that we managed to achieve over the several years helped us to achieve and consolidate our current position as the second largest mining company in the world, with a market cap as of last week of about $81 billion. So we came a long way. We transformed our company. We changed it for the better, and now, we are very well poised to explore the opportunities and also to face the challenges that the current situation presents.</p>
          <p>In fact, as you can see in the second section, of this presentation the global industrial production declined sharply the last quarter of '08. And is still suffering in the early months of 2009. This is a major change in economic environment and Vale has been extremely responsive to this environment, and reacts in very quick fashion. In fact we announced several production cuts to avoid inventory build-ups. Undesired enhancers because we actually took the opportunity that this environment represented to replenish our inventories at the forge in order to optimize our operation.</p>
          <p>At the same time we focused on cost minimization. We've managed to enhance operational flexibility in both production and CapEx execution management. And of course we have available to Vale the financial flexibility to pursue whatever course of action we feel appropriate considering our perspective about the industry. And as we go there, our long-term growth strategy remains unchanged because our views about the future haven't changed, considering that we do believe that the structural transformation that is taking place should continue. Although of course we'll have some adjustments in the short-term, but the long-term prospective is extremely positive in our view.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost control, the cost-cutting measures that we adopt to deal with the current situation, we shut down several higher-cost operating units as it would make no sense to keep them operating in this environment. We cut administrative costs. We are improving our efficiency in our corporate activities by reducing and improving the quality of its services and downsizing its structure. We are seeking flexibility in labor contract and we managed to negotiate several important initiatives to preserve the employment level in our company. We are working to reduce our working capital.</p>
          <p>Since July in terms of materials and parts, we reduced about $300 million in working capital besides other initiatives. We are renegotiating existing contracts with service providers in order to dis-inflate or in order to make them to reflect the current environment as the situation allows us to do so. And finally we are also working on the CapEx side, and we'll give out some little comments a little bit later on that, trying to review the costs and the timing of delivery of several equipments associated with our very important CapEx program that we have ahead of us. Well, as we put in chart 15, the initiatives to reduce costs &#x2013; they didn't show results yet, particularly in this case of the fourth quarter, associated with the lag of the long production cycle of the nickel business.</p>
          <p>So we still have some intermediate products that are costing us more today than they will cost in the future. So this lag in the reaction of the cost structure &#x2013; that is reflected in the bulk of the $66 million price change that you see there, but otherwise, of course we are benefiting from the devaluation of the currency &#x2013; the Brazilian currency, the Canadian (09.50) currency against the real, and our costs are down on a quarter-by-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of our long-term growth strategy, as we put there, it is unchanged because Vale is uniquely poised to explore all the growth options it has available. We are in a very good and sound financial position, and we can and we should pursue more growth moving forward. And we continue to develop our project pipeline, as I would like to ask Eduardo Bartolomeo to comment upon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Morning. I think, as Fabio mentioned, we are in a good position to gain &#x2013; we are not &#x2013; we're sticking to our project pipeline that I think is the first key message that we have to deliver. We're not opting out of that, but facing the reality today, we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Of course one of those is the currency devaluation, but the fact that we have the market turning into a buyer's market, so equipment is already facing some good news, metallic and structures also.</p>
          <p>Engineering's still under pressure, but as we can see in the long-term, or in the medium term, we will be able to deliver the same pipeline with much less pressure, with higher quality &#x2013; I think that's a very key issue too &#x2013; with low costs, with much lower costs, so I think at the end we are going to be able to benefit from this side of the &#x2013; not the good news about our market, but anyway from the project side, we're going to be able to deliver the pipeline at the lower cost with higher quality because we're going to have more time to engineer.</p>
          <p>So open up windows to engineer better because if we remember six months ago we were under pressure, so this lower pressure brings us huge opportunities on revising scope, revising standards. So at the end, my personal view is that we're going to be able to deliver the same pipelines much cheaper and with higher quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Well, so the message is that we kept and we keep our focus on growth and development of our very important project pipeline. With all the required caution of course we are trying to pursue cost reductions there, and we are already successful in some parts. And we also benefit from the effects of the devaluation of the exchange rate. So, this combined should lead to keeping the same indicated scope should represent a much lower disbursement at the end of the day of our cash position.</p>
          <p>We are, of course, a global leader in iron ore and a point I would like to make that is leadership was consolidated during the last down cycle at early 2000, 2001 when we acquired several assets. We've always had a very long-term perspective, and we're always well poised to explore opportunities that could arise from the financial distress that from time to time occur as we are in a cyclical world and a cyclical economy. And this is precisely the case now, and we are fortunate enough and we did the right thing of course to have a very strong balance sheet and the opportunity to explore these alternatives that's out there.</p>
          <p>So, we just bought an asset in Argentina and an asset in Canada related to the potash business, so we are entering more heavily in the fertilizers, in the fertilizer business as we do believe there's a great opportunity in the long-term considering that in our view the global, the current global recession does not change as we put the underlying fundamentals of the long-term growth of this market.</p>
          <p>And with this acquisition, Vale is in a privileged position to explore one of the potentially highest growth markets in the future that resides in South America. So, we are very happy that we're able to do that, and this transaction was already concluded and implemented last month. The other important acquisition was Corumb&#xE1;, a world class outfit. I would invite Martins to comment upon, and this is a very important asset strategically in terms of quality as well and Martins I would like to ask your perspective on that including on the lump price renewal that is associated with this. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>So good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to talk with you again. Relating to Corumb&#xE1; assets, the main is that this issue behind this acquisition is the production of lump. Lump ore is very important on the glass furnace charge. And lump production environment was going down year by year. And it's very important to have lump to compound the sales baskets for main customers, mainly in Europe. So this acquisition will bring a lot of strategic strength in our market position, mainly in Europe, but not that we needed it to Europe because we can ship it to other markets also.</p>
          <p>The product is the highest quality available in the world. We don't have a pellet of such quality that can be used and not blown in glass furnace but also . And uride production, sure there is a lot of challenges relating to Logistics, but this kind of land command a premium that is able to cover the additional cost of Logistics. So this acquisition will bring more strength to our strategic position, and looking long term of the iron ore markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Logistics does have opposition in Europe and also in the Middle East. But I believe you also have good news about the Chinese market, don't you, Roger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you noticed by the information we released, our last quarter in China was very weak. It was very interesting because China was the first market to feel the problems of the downturn in the world economy. And we lost a lot of our sales during the fourth quarter of 2008. But now things are coming back to the normal level and even better. And we surely we are going to deliver the highest number ever we sent in to China. It will be a number above 30 million tons in our quarter, which we never did in our history.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have a record shipment for 2009 first quarter of 2009 to China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we took advantage of the low freight costs that we have in this period. We are able to hire a lot of vessels at a very convenient price which put us in a very good condition to sell in China again. And also, we developed a lot of new customers. And we signed a lot of new agreements, commercial agreements with the new customers. And these agreements now is becoming new contracts. So we think that describes, we put us in a very strong position in China. Because in the past, we never have opportunities to say what would be our market share in China, because we never had enough iron ore to fill their need. But considering the slow down that we have in Europe and even in Brazil, we're having much more iron ore available, so we could be able to say how much we can grab of the China market share, and we are happily surprised with what we are getting, so things are developing very well. We start selling C&amp;F without sales, we send the ships without the customers, but now every ship that leaves our port in Brazil is already sold. So this was a big, I would say, point in our strategy for iron ore, because we are coping with the situation in our natural markets we deal with Europe and Brazil. These markets are very weak, so China is helping us to cover a lot of this weakness in our natural markets. So we are very happy to say that sales in China come back &#x2013; not only to the older level, but even bigger than the old level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good news. We are now to conclude our initial presentation. Some comments on what we see beyond the global financial crisis. So, of course we can not ignore that less than <mark type="inaudible" /> out there, and this applies to every single sector in the world economy, but also of course to the mining industry. So many mining projects have been cancelled and postponed by other companies. The supply of capital, it's much more restricted now. It's a given reality that we have to face. Again Vale is in a different position. We're considering what it did last year, but most other companies they face less open environment to get credit. Banks are in a less favorable position as you can appreciate and besides that there is diversion increase. So part of cap is expected to be much higher.</p>
          <p>And the summary is that there will be less possibilities of funding, future expansion in our industry and also other industries across the board. And the result, it's that as it happened in previous events, the global exploration investment, for instance, is likely to suffer a major decrease <mark type="inaudible" />. In the Asian crisis, after the peak of $5.2 billion, it decreased to almost one-third of this level by 2002 when things became more positive again. And it is also a risk that is this &#x2013; not this reduction in investment, would affect new investments in the mining business itself and expansion of capacity.</p>
          <p>So as you'll see, we are replicating our Credit Suisse estimate there that there will be a $200 billion shortfall in mine investment over the next five years. So the ones that are willing to pursue or that have the possibility to pursue growth could face in several years, in a few years down the road, a much more terrible environment. And as it happened in the last several years, to be able to capture more value for its shareholders we believe in the gains of Vale, so Vale is in a very good position to explore the growth options, of course, with all the caution that is required as its financial strength is clear in our balance sheet. We have as of December 31st, we had $12.6 billion in cash holding. We have almost $10 billion in long term credit facility. We have very low-cost long-lived assets. A very good track record in project delivery, 29 major projects concluded over the last six years is a remarkable achievement. And we have 23 major projects in our pipeline besides 134 mineral exploration projects across the globe to support our long-term growth. So it means that we have the view, we have the strength and we have the flexibility to pursue the growth options that we have available to us.</p>
          <p>And at this point, I would like to turn back the floor to Mr. Agnelli for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll talk about last year as we analyzed the full year. I think it was a very good year for Vale. We achieved several records. I think the company is doing well. We continuously work to reduce the cost. We prepare the company for this &#x2013; for the wintertime. Of course, the winter is much stronger than we predicted at the beginning of 2008.</p>
          <p>But anyhow, the company is in a very strong situation, financial situation. We have several projects that we can choose which one we will speed up, which one we will slow down. We have the opportunity to deal with our suppliers to reduce the cost. The currency is helping us to reduce costs also. We have strengthened, strength our position in Africa, in South America, in Asia. We are working to reduce the necessity of working capital. We are dealing with all our suppliers, contractors to change a little bit, to simplify the projects including the operational side. We had, and we have the ability to choose which mine we would like to see working at the maximum capacity and which mines we prefer to shut down. Even though can be momentarily or not, but we have already shut down more than seven mines in the iron ore business. We are reducing production in other areas. We have a lot of work to be done, and we are working we know exactly where we should put our focus on. Example is the nickel business that we needed to really to work hard to change a little bit the structure of the company. We needed to work to reduce the costs. But, if we compare ourselves with the other competitors, I think we are in a very, very good position because we have all the options open. There are some companies that they don't have options, and we have this deal where we still have all the options open for us to choose what is better for the company, for our shareholders. This is our focus, long term our philosophy is to develop all the potential that will have for our supporters and we are doing that. And we are doing that.</p>
          <p>The last quarter, I can assure you, everything that you see in the balance sheet is the reality of the company. The balance sheet is clean. It is really clean. We don't have anything to be accounting. We don't have anything that is not in the balance sheet. It is really very important. No surprises, at all.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about 2009. We start the year or end the year or begun the year with establishing the market and we are working very closely with our clients. We are understanding what they are facing. We are trying to help them, or to compromise or to support them to overcome these very difficult situations mainly there in Europe, which the situation is really is not really good. It's not good, in China. China seems like they are not getting worse. I think they achieved debacle last quarter. This first quarter as my information, we are positive that we are reach or we are beat the records in terms of volumes delivered to China, which is very good. Europe is not good, Japan is not good, Korea is not good, Brazil is not good. But this is the market and we don't want to precipitate any action that is not necessary.</p>
          <p>We are working with the university in Brazil to get time to adjust the company or to adjust the workforce. We don't want to fire people and then two, three months later we needed to hire them again. So we are carefully working or we are carefully navigating in this very tough environment that we are seeing. But anyhow we are making money. We are still making money. The company is in the first quartile in terms of costs and loan, areas that we are working in, the prices today is a sales price. So with the price is really very diverse in the aluminum business, in copper business, in nickel business, in almost everything. But iron ore and this is our strength.</p>
          <p>If we compare the price that iron ore achieved in the spot market in China you see that the group has basically grew until now is the shipping orders, because the price that we are dealing there in China is a good price. And we saw that we can't keep or we can't continue this work in this kind of philosophy. Long-term view we like to benchmark this is the stability for ourselves and this is a stability for our clients. And we are to stick to this kind of philosophy but who has to decide that? Our clients. And we are able to follow. We are able to do whatever is necessary to do. We have all the options to choose. So this is a situation that I can tell you. This is a freedom. We are free to do what is good for our shareholders. Again, long term, we don't want to precipitate any action that is not necessary or any action that we may &#x2013; we can we can regret it. So for iron ore market we feel that it is improving a little bit.</p>
          <p>Nickel business, everybody's cutting production, everybody's shut down production, we have already reduced our production. Maybe we need to go further. And we will go further if we feel that is necessary to do that. And the Chief is there in Canada right now. He is talking with our people and he is going to take any &#x2013; all the measures that are necessary to take &#x2013; in order to keep cash and to restructure the company if it is necessary to restructure. And we will act as soon as the market ask to do.</p>
          <p>In aluminum business, we are closing &#x2013; we are shutting down the Valesul here. We are adjusting the production there in <mark type="inaudible" />, but nobody's making money right now in the aluminum business, so this is not sustainable. It is very important to analyze or to realize that the current in some commodities is not sustainable. Why? Because nobody will produce if we are not making money. This is the reality.</p>
          <p>The aluminum business is the case. There is a problem that the price is so low, so low that nobody in the industry is able to produce at the current price in the market. So, of course we can expect that some or more production will be cut in this area. So, the price we will react. This is a reality.</p>
          <p>So, the world is still there. We have the <mark type="inaudible" /> here in Rio de Janeiro. We are working hard. We know what's necessary to do. We will not disappoint our shareholders. I think we have a very good track record in the companies that we are able to fulfill all the expectations that our shareholders have. We are working carefully. This is not the moment or this is not the time to do great actions. It's a time to take wise actions. And we feel that we are cleaning everything. We are not pressure &#x2013; we don't have pressure to act or to be in a hurry. So, I think we are going to see Vale in the end of 2009 much stronger than we are today.</p>
          <p>In terms of projects, everybody's is concerned about projects. Me, too. But there is one point that is in our favor. We have the projects. As a population, we have right now 23 projects that we are working on. The point is, the currency is helping, is reducing the cost of investment. The suppliers, they are able and they are willing to reduce price in order to keep orders. We are changing a little bit, or we are simplifying the projects. So, my expectation is that we will be able to develop all the projects that we have already announced with much less disbursement.</p>
          <p>If we said $14 billion, we can develop, let's say, less on the line today, we can develop the same number, the same projects with maybe around $11 billion without changing any scope. But to realize $11 billion it's just not easy. It's tough. It's very complicated to manage or to push the projects ahead. Why, because we need to have permits. And I can tell you nothing is changing that. It is still very hard to get permits on time. So we, it is important, to spend $11 billion in 2009 in all the projects that we are talking, is going to be really, a real challenge. It's going to be a real challenge. But we have the options, and we still have the projects, and the market sooner or later is going to recover.</p>
          <p>Another point that's very important. Again, some prices is not sustainable, is not sustainable. This is the reality. And another point that is very important is that some competitors will realize soon. The matter today, the problem today is not price. It is demand. The demand is still very weak, and if you or if we decline to reduce the price, it will not be enough to rebound the demand. The problem is demand. It's not price. So, soon everybody will realize that it is very important to reduce production, and we are able to do that when it's necessary. That's it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, everyone. So, I have two questions. The first one is regarding the iron ore sales that you're &#x2013; you just mentioned to China. I just wondered if you could comment a little bit on what kind of pricing are you doing on these sales. You said that you're doing it on a C&amp;F basis. Well, if you're having to give any discount to the prevailing contract prices, or if you're basing those sales on the spot market, on what kind of base rates are you also assuming?</p>
          <p>And also if Roger could mention a little bit on the M&amp;A side. We saw Vale buying the assets of Rio Tinto in Corumb&#xE1; and we are also seeing <mark type="inaudible" /> doing some negotiations to buy some other Rio Tinto's assets. And apparently the market believes that some of these assets are better in terms of quality than Corumba's. For example, the iron ore asset in Australia could be a good opportunity for Vale to make an acquisition there. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felipe, let me tell you the following. I think the past market behavior was very important to buy volumes, to buy size, to be in the market. So, we made several acquisitions, big ones, small ones, but right now, the time is to analyze quality. So, what we are looking for right now is some assets fair in price, at very good quality.</p>
          <p>The example is the project that we bought in Argentina is a very good one. I can tell you, it's a very good one. And is besides our project there in <mark type="inaudible" /> in Argentina. So, the two projects together we can really develop a very, very impressive potash mine. And saying that, maybe we'll be able to supply 70% of the Brazilian needs, which is very good. It is a captive market. The price is good. There is a lack of good assets in potash in the world today &#x2013; what an opportunity.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto is another example. Another one, Corumba. Corumba is a very nice asset. The quality is very good. Maybe the size of the mine has a limit. But we will be able to produce there more than 6 million tones a year, maybe 9 million tons of iron ore per year, together with our project &#x2013; our mine there in Corumba.</p>
          <p>The movements that we made toward Africa, we strengthened our position there a lot, a lot. The assets in Germany, in DRC, Namibia, another area <mark type="inaudible" /> there in Mozambique. In Mozambique,, we have developed several projects there and I think Mozambique is a country there that will give a lot of opportunities to Vale. The assets that we bought there in Columbia are very high quality thermal coal, and is going to be very good to supply our needs here in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So, this kind of movement or this kind of strategy, that is what we are following. We would like to strength our position in copper. We would like to strength our position in coal. We would like to be more present in the fertilizer business that I feel that the future is going to be very good. That's what we have been doing, marking different to that. And of course, iron ore is our major, major business. And if it's possible, we are continue to see -- analyze opportunities.</p>
          <p>So, we are not looking for bigger positions. We are not looking to change our strategy. I think we have today, I should say, huge, huge asset base to be developed, the best quality asset base in the mining business. So, we are very proud and we are very happy with what we have today. Rio Tinto, Xstrata, all the other companies that everybody's talking about, we have already talked with them. So, nothing else, nothing less. So, what we are looking for is to strength our position in some specific business, as I mentioned to you. You made a lot of &#x2013; another question about the iron ore price. I don't know &#x2013; do you know &#x2013; do you understand this discount concept? I think we don't work with this kind of product here, do we, Martins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>We don't like to do it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't like to do it. [laughter] But, Felipe, we are selling at the benchmark price, okay? And I will explain why. During this period that China was growing very fast, a lot of customers were willing to buy Vale's ore, but they are not able because we have no availability. Now we have the availability, so we are coming back to these customers, and there's a lot &#x2013; China has more than 100 steelmakers -- and we are glad to say that everybody wants to stick to a long-term contract with Vale. So, we are developing a completely new customer base in China, based in long-term contracts and benchmark price. And also, we are developing more and more of the options to sell C&amp;F basis. So, all of these new contracts give to us opportunity to sell C&amp;F based on a bulk freight price. So, I think that after &#x2013; it's not easy to &#x2013; what we faced in the last quarter. We took a lot of difficult decisions relating to production, and not only to production, but the decision to sell the hundreds of assets to China without the orders. And we did. And now we have a much more stronger position in China than we had below this crisis it start (43.17). So, we are selling benchmark, and we intended to keep the benchmark.</p>
          <p>I think it somehow has turned out that benchmarking was the best situation. It's very easy to notice. It's only to look the price of all commodities, and compare what's going on with iron ore. None of the commodities being oil, copper, nickel &#x2013; whatever you look, even agricultural commodities, all the commodities went down, but the iron ore price has kept in a very good level, even if you look at the spot. Even the spot is kept in a very good level, so I think this resiliency in iron ore price is one of our main strengths. And also I think it's a kind of asset that iron ore industry needs to keep. And we are doing our job to keep the benchmark system. We rely on our superior product of our ore.</p>
          <p>And I think what's going on in China, the numbers that we are going to deliver for China this quarter, will show clearly that benchmark is an asset, and the system is an asset for the industry. And it's also, not only for the producers, but also for the consumers, because the ones that have a large investment in blast furnace they needed to have a stable source of supply. And prices have to be good to keep it. Otherwise, there would be a lack of investment, and in the future you're going to have a lack of production. So, I think the system is very good and we are working to keep it. And what is going on this quarter show how important is the benchmark system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felipe, I would like to add one point that is very important. We saw in the last quarter &#x2013; excuse me, stocking process, very strong one. When the crisis really blew up, everybody become really scared about the size of the reduction in demand, the steam industry almost stopped to acquire iron ore. I'm not saying that this process is finished. But it is almost in the end, because we are finished, even there in Europe, some big clients are back to order for the second quarter. Even there in Asia, as Martins mentioned, our traditional clients that we always, who had supported us in China, they stopped to buy iron ore in the last quarter. But we developed new ones. So, the market is there. The market will be there. The point is let's be patient. We don't need to be in a hurry. We needed to manage the market. We needed to manage our position in the market. So, we are very responsible people that say, that is &#x2013; market price taker &#x2013; or is a price taker &#x2013; we feel that they will lose opportunity to be more disciplined and to be more realistic -- if that price is not helping the banks. This is a reality. We need to take our time, analyze, be very close to our clients, develop a very strong relationship in order to help them to overcome the situation. And they will help us to overcome this current situation.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Roger Downey from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. And I think you are quite right. If you think long term, this is certainly one of the biggest winners in the whole industry. All the assets you're endowed with make that pretty certain. But I think the focus today really is on the short term. We're navigating pretty rough seas right now and as you mentioned yourself there, Jos&#xE9;. So, I'll apologize and I will focus on the near term. Again on the markets, and I think, Martins, this one is for you. As you said, the first quarter you should post a lot bigger sales to China. I think in January, Brazilian shipments to China were about 60 or 70% of the total. In the past, shipments to China were about 30 to 35%. So first question, is that sustainable? I think you've got a new client base, which is good, but is it sustainable at these levels? And if so, is it enough to weather at least another quarter? Because I think if you read through the results presented by the European steelmakers, they're fearing a worse second quarter than people had anticipated. So, you guys will probably need China again in the second quarter as well.</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be again with respect to China, there's a whole bunch of news in the past couple of days regarding China putting a cap on steel production. For 2009, they're saying 460 million tons of steel production, and by 2011, 500 million tons of steel production. It's a worrying number, I think, and I would like to hear your comments, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Roger. The first thing -- I have ways to see it. If the customers buying. I don't question why the customer is buying. I normally, I question when the customer is not buying, okay? So if China is buying, I'm glad to sell, and I'll continue to sell, to new customers or to old customers. So with China now the old customers are coming back to buy from us at the benchmark price. Every day I get new orders from the old customers that stopped buying from us in the last quarter. So now the situation &#x2013; could increase our sales to China. But we also are concerned about freight costs, so we needed to keep an equilibrium, because if you sell to much iron ore from Brazil to China, this will increase the freight demand, because it takes two or three times to send ore from Brazil to China than to bring from India and also Australia.</p>
          <p>So we needed to take care of how much ore we send to China. But we are working with our logistic depot. And we are hiring vessels. We are signing new cores. We are buying vessels. We are ordering new vessels. So as time goes by we are going to get rid of this freight differential forever.</p>
          <p>So these are some steps that we are going to get out of our strategic agenda. And nobody will talk about the freight difference in the future. We are working very hard in this way. Nowadays our price &#x2013; the China FOB price benchmark is $16 below Australian benchmark price. And you know that we have a value that is higher. So if you put both together, even considering this very weak market, we think that we have today $20 more -- because the price of the ore than the Australians. So I think many customers that buy long term from Australia should probably come to us because it's much more convenient for them.</p>
          <p>So I cannot assure to you if it's sustainable or not, but as long as they want to buy, we have ore, and we'll sell to them. So that's -- related to China, it's what we have to say.</p>
          <p>Relating to Europe, everybody know what's going on in Europe. Steel industry is down more than 40% in Europe. And iron ore, they are buying probably less than 70% of the iron ore they need, because they are using their stock. But the stock is coming to an end. We follow up this week by week. And also Europeans are coming back to buy more ore because they need it even if their production is lower. Now they are reaching to a point that they needed to buy ore. You know our largest customer, ArcelorMittal, stopped buying from us since October. We didn't sell a ton of iron ore to ArcelorMittal from October to March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Even having long-term -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even based on a long-term contract. But for April, they are coming back asking for iron ore. I can tell you, it is a reasonable level. So I think that in Brazil and Europe, even if the steel production is much lower, they will start buying more than they used to buy in the last three or four months, because they need it to hold up their needs. China is doing well. And considering what is going on in this market, I think that for the next quarter we can deliver better figures for iron ore.</p>
          <p>You asked about what's going on in China, the scrap production. I think we need to look at China &#x2013; the whole economy of China -- what will be the impact of the export decrease in their economy. But you know they are keeping a lot of their infrastructure investments, and they need ore. They need steel to keep to this process. The level that we will remain, it's very difficult to say. China has used to deliver a lot of rules related to the steel industry. You know in the last three or four years, they delivered a lot of rules, a lot of controls, but in the reality, their production kept growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is another point, Martins, if I may. The fact that the current consumption of steel, the total consumption of steel in China is well below what you could consider a developed country level. So they are far from that &#x2013; from achieving that level. Using this reference, it's hard to understand why a growing economy &#x2013; this is something that we should keep in mind &#x2013; China may grow less, but it'll continue to grow at a very fast pace. So to imagine that all the effort required, investment, infrastructure, and development of urban areas, would be suddenly frozen at the current state, which is not a reasonable assumption, to say the least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And concluding my remarks, it's very difficult to talk about the future. Who had been able now to predict what will happen? Nobody was able. With all of this knowledge, nobody was able to predict that from September to October, we were going to have what we have.</p>
          <p>So from now on, what will be the outcome now? What will be the relationship of the all of these economies? How China will be impacted by the slowdown in the Western world? This is not clear. So in my view this is a fight that we need to fight everyday. So that's what we are doing. So I don't question it, why the customer is buying. My main question is why the customer is not buying. So that's what we are addressing more frequently today. So far so good. That's what I would like to tell you about what's going on.</p>
          <p>7&lt;Q &#x2013; Robert Downey&gt;: Thank you. That's very clear. I would like &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> about the steel market in the <mark type="inaudible" />. I think this is very important because the offer of freight is going to increase a lot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what we've seen here, as Martins said from the beginning, through the dip of the 10 that was when the freights got to nine was unreasonable &#x2013; cheap as Martins said, we took a lot of opportunities on that sense. We built a portfolio of freights variable in that sense. And then we saw in the last two or three months a higher increase already due to develop &#x2013; of everybody going to China.</p>
          <p>But when we see near-term or medium-term, what's going through the waters to flow, to have more or less 160 million tons of deadweight not going to sea. So we don't see any pressures that should be sustained in this freight. So again, as Martins said, we're managing very carefully our portfolio freight. We see our pipeline increasing. We are looking for old -- not old but used vessels that can be &#x2013; we actually did some very good contracts on 14 year old <mark type="inaudible" />. So when we see it &#x2013; the medium term to the long term I think this freight differential and we'll be able to have a portfolio that would bring us to a very nice competitive position.</p>
          <p>I think it's the time to position ourselves and we're doing that in three levels. One is buy lower than the Baltic coal <mark type="inaudible" /> that are reasonably cheap when they appear, we are doing that. And the used ships, as Martins already mentioned, and of course with our <mark type="inaudible" /> that longer-term strategy to have a higher percentage of our freights covered or secured in a very, very competitive position. That's what we can say about freight now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another point is that this crisis, I can tell you, is okay for us. It's really okay for us. All the rivers heads to the ocean. In reality we have the best asset. We have the lowest cost. And a lot of big guys that used to be big some months ago, they are disappearing. A lot of junior companies, a lot of new projects, a lot of dreams, is not there anymore. And we are not talking about dreams. We have the ability to supply iron ore, bauxite, aluminum, manganese, coal, nickel, for our clients. As I said, all the rivers goes to the ocean.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Just again following up on this China trend question, yes, I guess it's very material news that you are seeing this pick up back to 30 million tons for the first quarter in China. But I just wanted to understand that there are other regions that perhaps over-purchased iron ore in the fourth quarter, such as Japan, Italy and Korea, which we would also be expecting to slow down. So in a nutshell, can you give us concrete guidance for your total volumes sold for the first quarter versus the 55 you sold in the fourth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On average, Jorge, we tend to reach around 50 million tons for this quarter. And almost 70% of this is China, because as you probably know and I told you the situation in Europe and Brazil, which are our natural markets are very depressed, with signs of recovery, but in this quarter it's very depressed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly to clarify that you're selling cash and freight, and I'm aware that you did purchase some contracts for freighters back in the fourth quarter when prices were very depressed, are you throwing in the freight for free? In other words you're selling to the clients in China at 2008's contract price. But including free delivery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We are charging the freight based on the bulk freight price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then sorry, just lastly, in terms of unit cost, could you quantify in terms of the operation of the iron ore mines that are offline right now? Are they generating a fixed overhead charge that would be more diluted as you start to ramp up your output, say back to 75 or 80 million tons by the second half of '09 or would you say that your unit cost has more or less stabilized and already reflects the benefits of the lower currency impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that the lower currency impact will only add to the margin because, in a constant basis, we kept our cost in the same level even with the reduction in production because we shut down mines, which had a higher cost. We shut down mines that we have a higher logistic cost. So at the end of the day we reduced deeply our production, but we kept our unit cost on a constant basis. So the current devaluation will add to the results on these aspects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I thought maybe it's good to mention about logistics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, that it <mark type="inaudible" /> as much information, we were able to bring the cost &#x2013; I think that the limit where we were spending something, when we readapted the new level of production, we stopped loads, we stopped wagons in the ports and decided the best way to ship, actually we have lower cost than we had before. So I think that's the good news. Besides the devaluation that's another good news. So we're looking at the numbers from <mark type="inaudible" /> yesterday. They're much better than last year. So I think that has a good impact on this modelizing or blocks that we're more optimized now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jorge, if you remember the former &#x2013; the former conferences we've had, I've always told that we're operating a very high margin of cost because we're trying to extract the last stone from the mine. So now we're operating a different model. So we're letting the high cost ore in the mines. So we're taking only the lowest cost ore that we have. So as far as cost is concerned we are now in a much better situation if you're talking about the unit cost. And the current devaluation will be a bonus in the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very important point because since 2004 we have been working at a stress situation. All the systems were stressed. Right now we have some room to choose or to really conserve the cost, because until September, we were working to supply our clients' needs. Now we are working to have the lowest cost possible. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Raphael Biderman from Bradesco Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. My first question is regarding nickel costs. Do you believe production costs for nickel could go down? If you look at long-term prices of nickel, they have ranged in different trading ranges of $7,000 per ton even reaching lows of $3,000 per ton. Right now nickel prices are at 11 because the cost of the industry is around 10,000. Do you think it's possible that nickel prices goes down, nickel costs, nickel production costs go down in the future and therefore prices could follow suit as well?</p>
          <p>And another thing is regarding going back to the sales to China to new clients, just to see if I got it right, basically, you are obtaining these clients that used to buy on the spot market, if I understood what's in between, &#x2013; the concept was buying from Chinese and Indian mines. I'd like to check if that's correct?</p>
          <p>And what prices are you setting? Because we monitored the statistics from the Brazilian Trade Ministry <mark type="inaudible" /> and the average realized price of iron ore exports in January fell for the first time. There was a big increase in volumes. But it fell for the first time. It was around $70 per ton, very flat around $70 per ton, in January it was around 50. So I wondered if you guys are &#x2013; what are the price conditions to this kind of clients you are winning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, Raphael. First of all, the statistics that you get from the official agencies are reliable statistics, why not? Hence, consider one month to calculate the average price <mark type="inaudible" />. There are some mines here in Brazil, it's not surprising, but there some mines here in Brazil that they're selling at 7% of the benchmark price to adjust the new price later.</p>
          <p>So there are some contracts that, starting on January the 1st of the fiscal year, we don't have the benchmark price yet. So what is usual to do, not for Vale but for other mines, they start with 70 or 60 or 80, these are provisional price. So you have a pollution in the data that you get from the Ministry that you can't take it as a source of information because there are a lot of distortions in this kind of information.</p>
          <p>The second one, or the first question that you made about nickel, the nickel price I can tell you, all the costs will go down sharply or we'll not be able &#x2013; or nobody will be able to sell at this price. This is the reality. Today only two companies in the world is able to produce big volumes to supply the market. <mark type="inaudible" /> and Vale Inc period. We are managing the situation. Of course we have some mines that is high cost. And we are going to adjust those mines. We are concentrating production in the mines that the cost is very low.</p>
          <p>So certainly, for example, <mark type="inaudible" /> will stay working at maximum capacity, but Sudbury, I doubt if it's possible to sustain the current level of production. But okay, this is part of the game we needed to act as we feel that is the time to act. A lot of other competitors are cutting production, are shutting down mines, and we are calm. I can tell you we are calm because the market at this current price is not sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are in a very good position, Raphael, in the cost curve of the industry. We are in the first quartile in operations. So I'd like to remind you that in this quarter, the last quarter, there was several run-off events associated with nickel that affected nickel costs there. But other than that, if you look at our cost structure, we are very well poised in the cash cost curve of the industry. And besides, as Martins, as Jos&#xE9; mentioned, it's doing a very good job there in bringing down costs. And this will certainly be seen over the next few quarters.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only to add an additional point about the average price, first, we are selling much more in Asia than we're used to be. And benchmark in Asia is lower than in Europe. So there is more I would say, a statistical difference because the volumes are lower in Europe than we have now in Asia.</p>
          <p>Another point, I don't know how you are counting it, but sales of pellets almost disappeared. Many of our pellet plants are idle, and not only ours, but some <mark type="inaudible" />. So this could have an impact on average price that we are counting in our statistics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point is that the statistics in the Ministry or in the &#x2013; that you get in the official, is not reliable. If you are doing that, you are doing wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are going &#x2013; probably next quarter we're going to deliver our results and you can check what happened with price. What I can tell to you is that we are setting benchmark prices. And we are signing new contracts. We didn't sign all of them, but we have already agreements for additional of 50 million tons in China <mark type="inaudible" /> only for new customers. So it's completely new contracts based on benchmark price, for customers that never bought from us. Probably they are not buying in spot or not buying from Indians or from a -I don't know. But those are customers that want to buy from us. And I can tell, I don't ask why they want to buy from us as long as they buy. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Martins. And on nickel, is there any cost items that sales increased a lot in the first year that you believe could go down in import. Like for instance, steel industry, for instance, we know that coal prices for instance went up a lot and could go down. In nickel, in the specific &#x2013; a primary industry but is there any specific import that has pushed the cost curve up? Or it's just suppliers, third parties, that kind of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two elements there, Raphael, or three elements. First, by-products prices came down and this affected costs, okay? The other element is energy. And finally, we have the devaluation of the currency that also represents an impact on the final cash costs of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, please restrict your questions to two at a time. Our next question comes form Mr. Carlos de Alba from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking the question. First one is just if you can give us some guidance on production or sales? I know that it's difficult, but in the past you have been able to do so. Maybe rough numbers for the different business segments. That would be highly appreciated.</p>
          <p>And then second one is regarding the copper business. Actually, if you looked at the non-ferrous business, it had a negative EBITDA, even after subtracting the impact of preliminary pricing adjustments in copper. I tend to believe, based on your comments that nickel continues to be profitable. So it has to be &#x2013; and aluminum is profitable, so it has to be copper. Are there any plans for you to reuse your output of copper even more or shut it down completely for a period of time once the prices recover? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlos. As for your question, I think on the volumes I think what Martins already indicated, what we see for the first quarter, and this is a reference number of course, but based on what we achieved so far we are almost in the end of the second month of the quarter. So it's a very accurate figure of what &#x2013; reliable figure of what we believe would be the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Other than that, I would refrain from making additional comments. We are discussing with our clients. We are discussing in our several lines of business. But the feeling that we have, as Jos&#xE9; pointed out, is that there are very &#x2013; several signs of improvement across the board. And this should be reflected in our future shipments in iron ore and also in our ferrous businesses.</p>
          <p>If you look at the PMI, as we indicated in our report, the PMI stabilized and increased a little bit. We have some signs of life in industrial production in the U.S., India and China. So industrial production is a key variable in our business, and it's showing signs of early, very preliminary recovery. But those are good signs. So the volatility around the world has been sharply reduced. But still we are in unchartered waters in a way.</p>
          <p>And I would like to advance a little bit more in the year before making any additional comment. The good news is that China is back. And we are reaching record levels of shipments as we never reached those levels before. And this is extremely good news. And more important than that, we are reaching &#x2013; widening, broadening our client base in China, so reducing the risk associated with a single client or something like that.</p>
          <p>As far as copper, please keep in mind that we have a large adjustment &#x2013; price adjustment due to the provisional prices of the system &#x2013; of so called Nama month after &#x2013; the month of arrival/a rival pricing. And then this produced an adjustment of $300 million on the copper price. So if you take this out, if you take the one-off effects that we have in our business, as we indicated, we are in a very sound position in every single lines of business that we have in our portfolio.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Fabio Barbosa, at this time you may proceed with your closing statements, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'd just like to give the floor to Martins and Jos&#xE9; if they have additional comments that they would like to make at this stage. And I'd like to thank you all for attending. Martins, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, really strange that you don't asked any questions about the price negotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to tell you about that, Martins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I look to address this issue because we are now in the period of price negotiations. And a lot of &#x2013; we see a lot of news in the press. And I would like to put how things are going as far as Vale is concerned.</p>
          <p>We are now in a wait-and-see position. We used to be the price setter, but this year we decided to wait and see what will be seeked between Australians and Chinese because I think China is now the main sea-borne market. And the Australians are the biggest suppliers. And they are closer so.</p>
          <p>We tend to let to them to fix the price. Last year we did, and we know what happened. They didn't follow the benchmark. Customers accepted higher price, and we had all the problems that everybody knows.</p>
          <p>So this year our position is wait and see. There is no proposal from Vale on the table. And we are all waiting what will come. And if it's good, we'll follow. If it's now good, we'll do like they did last year. So we want to have our hands free to follow the price or not, according to our strategy, according to our needs.</p>
          <p>So on the other hand, we &#x2013; Vale is a price setter. It seems that we suffered a little bit more because tactfully speaking, many customers reduced their iron ore inventories in order to have some kind of bargaining power, to increase their bargaining power.</p>
          <p>So we face with many customers, big customers, traditional customers, much lower orders than they are used to put, even considering the production they are doing. It's easy to notice what happened with our traditional customer in China that stopped buying during all of these periods. Even ArcelorMittal is our largest customer, also stopped buying.</p>
          <p>So I think we suffered a little bit more than the others because we are used to be a price setter. But this year we decided to wait and see what is going on and to take our decisions later. So that's the message I would like to convey to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jos&#xE9;. Your final comments please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Adding to what Martins said, I think that maybe there are some companies that are working at maximum capacity, so they can't go further. We are not working at maximum capacity. We closed some very high cost mines, and it's good for us. But we can go further. We will go further.</p>
          <p>So we decided to, as Martins said, to have our hands free and to do whatever we feel that is good to do because we are the leaders in this market. It is our major business. And we care about the behavior in this, specifically, in iron ore.</p>
          <p>To finalize this conference, I think what I would like to convey to you is that we are not depressed at all. We are full of energy. We are having plans. The company is very, very well-positioned in the marketplace. Our footprint right now is a global footprint. And there are things that is going in our favor. And any other opportunity that may appear in the future we are able to take advantage on it.</p>
          <p>We are conservative guys in our approach in terms of debt and our approach in terms of investment, our approach in terms of acquisition. You can always consider that we are conservative.</p>
          <p>This is not the right time to be aggressive. This is the time to be humble, to do our homework, change what is necessary to change, face all the problem and solve the problems as soon as possible and try to simplify things.</p>
          <p>To make, or to consider, or to have all the very sophisticated strategy, for me in this specific moment is not a good idea. The best thing to have right now is to have the most simple or the most non-sophisticate thing and for me the most non-sophisticated thing is work. That's what we are doing, working hard.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
