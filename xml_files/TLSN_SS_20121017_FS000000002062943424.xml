          <p>Good morning and welcome to this press conference for our Third Quarter Results. I'm Cecilia Edstr&#xF6;m, Head of Group Communications. Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, our Head of IR will moderate this conference as usual but I'd like to go through some practicalities before we start because we have a lot of attention today. You're all very welcome, and we will try to cater to as many questions as possible.</p>
          <p>But in the interest of keeping the time, Lars Nyberg will start by analyzing the quarter and then Per-Arne Blomquist will follow with a run through of the numbers. There will be about half an hour after the presentation to put questions. And because there's such a huge interest, I will kindly ask you to limit your questions to one at a time. We will take questions both from here in the room and over the web.</p>
          <p>And when you do get a note from Andreas that you can put your question, please state your name and the organization that you are representing. After the press conference, we have scheduled a number of interviews, but because of the increase &#x2013; the intense demand for interviews, we will not be able to cater for anymore. We haven't put up their requests already. So we will take interviews for those who have scheduled them beforehand.</p>
          <p>With that, I would now like to hand over to Lars Nyberg for an analysis of the quarter. Can I kindly ask everybody to sit down or take pictures from the back so that we don't disturb the web conference. Welcome.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you and welcome. I'd like to deal straightaway with the issues that have generated considerably &#x2013; considerable media attention lately. The allegations directed at TeliaSonera about our operation in Uzbekistan are very serious. So let me state clearly. There is zero tolerance of corruption and bribery at TeliaSonera. This is extremely important to me personally and something we pay attention to every single day. I have said it before and I will repeat it, TeliaSonera did not bribe anyone. TeliaSonera did not participate in money laundering.</p>
          <p>Five years ago, we invested in a license in Uzbekistan to provide telecom services. Why did we do that? A key reason was to create growth and generate value for our shareholders, but not just that. At TeliaSonera, we believe that telecommunication is a force of good. Anyone who has watched the extraordinary developments during the Arab Spring must be aware of this. It's an undeniable fact that modern telecommunications speed up a country's long journey towards democracy. It's also undeniable that telecommunications help eradicate human rights' abuses. We believe that our presence in Central Asia contributes to the advancement of democracy and human rights in the long-term.</p>
          <p>Now I will not make any further comments or answer any questions regarding Uzbekistan. There are two ongoing investigations, one initiated by the board and another one by the prosecutor. We now have to wait for their conclusion, and in the meantime we will cooperate with them and answer all their questions.</p>
          <p>I would now like to talk about some other recent allegations in the Swedish media surrounding our operations in Nepal. I want to make it absolutely clear that the story on Veckans Aff&#xE4;rer last week was wrong, factually wrong. Veckans Aff&#xE4;rer claims that TeliaSonera acquired its operation in Nepal from Raj Bahadur Singh or a company controlled by him. We did not.</p>
          <p>Mr. Singh was a shareholder and Chairman of the Board of Spice Nepal until April 2006, at which time he sold the holding, left the board and departed the company. TeliaSonera acquired its controlling stake in Spice Nepal or Ncell, as we now call it, in October 2008. That is two years, two years after Mr. Singh left the company.</p>
          <p>Now that I've clarified this, I'd like to tell a completely different story, a much more important story. Nepal is a great example of what telecommunication can do to help a country to develop. I have been to Nepal six times in the last four years. When I go there, I have two objectives, to meet our employees and to meet the politicians. When we took the decision to invest in Nepal, we took a major risk politically. The country was in a period of major political change aiming to build a true democracy after a seven-year period of civil war. Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a population of about 30 million people. The country lacks basic infrastructure for electricity, leading to power cuts of up to 16 hours a day. At the same time, there is substantial potential in the country in form of hydroelectric power waiting to be utilized. In order to develop its resources, the country desperately needs expertise and foreign investment. This will not happen without a reliable telecommunications network. That's where we come in.</p>
          <p>Since TeliaSonera acquired Ncell, mobile coverage in Nepal has increased from 40% to 90% of the population. And don't forget it's a country with very big mountains. So technically it's difficult. At the same time, more than 60% of the Nepalese are now using a mobile phone every day. It also turned out to be a great investment for us, which generates an annual return on capital of 30%.</p>
          <p>But for us, it's not just about business. Every year, hundreds of thousands of Nepalese leave the country in pursuit of a better life elsewhere. Too many find themselves victim of human trafficking or appalling working conditions.</p>
          <p>TeliaSonera is creating opportunities for these people at home in Nepal. Ncell is now directly providing jobs for 1,500 people, creating job opportunities for tens of thousands more through sales channels, construction sites, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We are regarded as one of, if not, the most attractive employer in the country. Why? We allow collective bargaining in a country known for frequent strikes. I don't think we had strikes at Ncell for years. We provide extensive training to our employees, where basic schooling is insufficient.</p>
          <p>We have introduced our group-wide performance management system by setting targets, evaluating performance and identifying personal development needs, and plans for all employees in Nepal.</p>
          <p>In addition to developing our own business and staff, we also want to contribute to Nepal in a broader sense. Nearly half of the children have no access to primary schooling therefore we made education and supporting children a priority.</p>
          <p>We invest in projects that reconstruct primary and secondary schools and providing learning materials and access to Internet in remote and poor areas. This year, more than 11,000 children will be supported by Ncell. Similar examples can be found in every country where we invest. This is what it means when TeliaSonera invest in a poor country.</p>
          <p>I hope this helps you understand that the picture being painted at TeliaSonera in media today is not the company I lead and work for. It's a very different company that I work for and a company that I'm very proud of. Recent events have highlighted not only our largest shareholder but also our customers, employees and other shareholders have very high expectation of us. They are absolutely right to do so and we will meet their expectations.</p>
          <p>Now, I will spend some time on the reason why we are here, to talk about the third quarter. I think the third quarter came in roughly as we had expected, as the analysts had expected. We are flat revenue. We are down a bit on EBITDA, earnings per share is SEK1 or less than last year. No big surprise, I think.</p>
          <p>This is the issue. We have an issue of not enough growth. And this is not a TeliaSonera issue. This is an industry issue. We continue to see growth in Eurasia, what we call the growth engine of our company. Broadband continues to have declines, not bigger or smaller than before.</p>
          <p>The big change is mobility. This is not a surprise. This is something we have seen coming for a couple of quarters. This has to do with the fact that voice is declining, and the industry is not capable, so far, of monetizing on the extraordinary explosion of data traffic in our networks.</p>
          <p>So we have a changed situation in Mobility. Mobility has, for two decades, enjoyed annual impressive growth rates. My prediction, which I said already two quarters ago, is that those growth rates will disappear. We will see a flat kind of industry for at least a couple of years till we are able, in a better way, to monetize on the growth of the data traffic, because the demand is there. People love our services. And they use more and more and more, so that's not the issue. The issue is how quickly can we change the business model.</p>
          <p>This shows billed revenue, including and excluding Spain. Billed revenue is voice, SMS and data. That's our business. Selling phones, equipment is not our business. We don't make any money. Here's where we make the money.</p>
          <p>Again, monetizing on the explosion of the data traffic is the challenge for the industry. And I felt that TeliaSonera was not making enough progress both on the cost side and on this issue of changing the business model. And therefore I decide some time ago to change the leadership and put the best person I have worked with to see if he can help us change the picture.</p>
          <p>I have been critical of our customer service over the years. And I now see Malin, who is running the broadband business, being successful, making real progress in our customer support organization. This is a reduction of unwanted calls. Unwanted calls is a call that the customer has all the right to make, but if he would have done it correctly, he or she wouldn't have made the call.</p>
          <p>It's mainly driven by actually investing a lot of money in this organization initially. So we have increased the number of employees in the customer support organization in Sweden by 400 people. We have reduced the calls by 600,000. As we now get our processes better, I think, long term, we will even be able to save money in this customer organization. But the first priority is to have a better experience for our customers, and second is what does it cost us.</p>
          <p>Yes, Eurasia is our growth engine, 12% in the quarter. We have now surpassed 40 million subscribers in this part of the world.</p>
          <p>Cost, we did announce some measurement on the cost side. When the industry has no growth, and our industry seems to have no growth in the coming couple of years, and your costs go up by 3% a year, your salary cost goes up or whatever, you have to do something. You have to reduce cost. I think we have shown over the past five years skills in being able to manage cost.</p>
          <p>We have always looked at the relation between the growth on the top line and the growth on the cost side. And as you can see on this picture, the growth of sales has always been higher than the growth of the cost. Per-Arne will show you that in the third quarter we don't have that relationship in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We started already actually a couple of months ago, before the summer, thinking about, are we really doing the things in the right way in this company. We have changed a lot in the past five years. Where we have changed the least, actually, is in the network management, in the product management.</p>
          <p>In those areas, we have changed the least. And I think we need to really think through how big portfolios of products are we going to have, how complicated networks are we going to have, do we need to have all those things that we have today, is that important for the customer. I am convinced we are spending money that actually are not that important for the customer.</p>
          <p>So this is not a top down I want 2,000 people, that's not the issue. We have worked in eight work streams and we have identified a number of areas we think we can grow. And based on that, Per-Arne and I have said, we think over two years we can save SEK2 billion. That's the most important for me first.</p>
          <p>Now then, I knew you would ask me what does it mean, the number of employees. So instead of waiting for your question, we decided to give you an estimate. And this is an estimate across the whole group. This is not Sweden or Finland, this is the whole group. We have 29,000 people in the group, so it's about 7%.</p>
          <p>We don't know exactly where, we don't know exactly when, except that it has to happen during next year and the year after. And we are working since, as I said, a couple of months and we will continue to do that work. And as we know, we will get into the normal procedures with our labor unions and discussions and we will inform you in the appropriate timeframe.</p>
          <p>This is what I talked about, sorry, I missed that one. We have the same outlook as we had last quarter. I think I'll leave it there to Per-Arne.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. As Lars said, we had a weaker quarter in the third quarter as well <mark type="ph" /> the end of the (15:40) two previous quarters, flattish top line and also increased cost. However, if we look at the first nine months, we have a somewhat better balance. Top line is increasing with 1%. At the same time, costs are flattish.</p>
          <p>But given that we have had a margin compression, gross margin compression, our EBITDA margin is actually going down. You could see we are going down from 36% to 34.8%. That also hits our earnings per share somewhat down, but cash flow is strong. And also, if we take away the proceeds that we have got from MegaFon, we are actually increasing our cash flow. We don't think it's as strength in this environment right now.</p>
          <p>Lars highlighted the issues we have with the top line reduction, especially within mobility. Today, the group have what's a rather stable top line growth in Eurasia, with 12%, we're rather stable when it comes to broadband, minus 2%, 3%, but we have seen the decline within mobility. And as Lars said, this is an industry phenomena, and we have enjoyed a pretty good ride compared to the rest of the industry in Europe during the last quarters.</p>
          <p>But it's not all entities that are doing bad within mobility. We could see that Spain is growing, what we call the billed revenues, with 16%. Billed revenues include voice, messaging and data. Spain has also taken in more than 250,000 customers &#x2013; not customers, but subscribers rather to say, in the third quarter. Most of these are postpaid. And they're actually growing a bit. Sweden is still growing, and I will come back more to the details around their billed revenue.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, other revenues are going down with 8%. And given that we have <mark type="ph" /> a better (17:33) high growth on the data side, that means that we have a severely compression on the voice side. I would say that in some markets we are looking at 15% to 20% in downturn on voice.</p>
          <p>Sweden, that sort of sticks out in this more mature market, increased &#x2013; has increased the billed revenue with 1%. It doesn't mean that everything is turning upwards. We have now seen the loss recorded at the voice is going down with 3% to 4%. And it can't not be offset by the volume growth from data, especially increasing with 11% in Sweden, but that turns out to be 1% in billed revenue. And that is lower than the last quarter where we had an increase with 2%.</p>
          <p>We have also seen interconnection reductions, and it is more to come, I would say, in the first quarter next year. And that also hits &#x2013; the top-line <mark type="ph" /> profitability is more unusual (18:24) for the group.</p>
          <p>When it comes to broadband, we see that our IP-based services are actually increasing compared to the traditional side. 52% is today IP-based, and 48% is traditional. The downturn in PSTN, the old telephony, is more or less at the same pace as before; down with 30% compared to 12% in the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're actually adding new customers within VoIP, within TV, and also within the fixed broadband. And we have today, 560,000 TV customers in Sweden and around 1.3 million customers in our whole region.</p>
          <p>We also continue to roll out fiber which is a base for future IP-based services. And we have today 536 connected customers in Sweden. And I hope after the problems we have had with the rollout of fiber, that we have now a new setup that could also speed up the rollout of fiber, which is sort of the future &#x2013; or the carrier of a lot of the data.</p>
          <p>Eurasia, as Lars said, growing 12%. I think I'm satisfied with having sort of a better balance today, with &#x2013; where we have four different countries contributing to our growth. Ucell close to 60%, very much connected to the fact that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:00) has a problem, and we have taken over their customers. Ncell continue to grow in a good way and they have added on roughly 500,000 customers in the last quarter. Azercell and Ucell is also growing. And I think it's a good structure because, if you look here, the biggest entity, Kcell, is actually going down with 1% and still we are delivering growth on top line.</p>
          <p>Looking more at the different quarter result, we talked about gross margin before. We have seen a gross volume compression. It has stabilized in the third quarter, also similar to the second quarter. Pressure in mobility, given that we are taking along the billed revenue, it hits our gross margin severely. It's compensated by better gross margin in Eurasia, especially when it comes to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:53).</p>
          <p>The cost base that we have also talked about and touched upon is actually going upwards. We have been pretty good during the last years to take down the cost. We now see that the addressable cost base, the OpEx is going up slightly, and it's connected to, I would say, a bit unfortunate mix right now within the different business areas.</p>
          <p>Eurasia had decided to spend more on their cost side at the latter part of this year, which they have started to do. If you look at Eurasia from a nine-month perspective, they have a pretty good balance &#x2013; 12% growth top line, 8% cost, but the phasing is somewhat different.</p>
          <p>But given now that Broadband is not taking out cost as quick as they should have done, and also that Mobility services actually increasing cost, we need to do something around the cost side.</p>
          <p>And you could also see that on the margin development we are down to 35.8% in the quarter. And we see margin compression in actually all different business areas. Mobility is going down from 32.1% to 29.3%; Broadband from 34.1% to 33.3%; and Eurasia from 51% and off to 50.3%. So that is the reason why we now have announced a cost restructuring program, where we need to go, of course, to restore and defend our margins.</p>
          <p>Coming in to the analyst presentation, our associates companies are contributing more this quarter, SEK250 million more, based on better underlying business both in Turkcell and also in Russia. We have no negative one-offs from Turkcell this year, as we had last year.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the contribution from MegaFon is somewhat lower. First of all, we have sold out roughly 10% of the company. But they are also affected by higher leverage in the company, given the new structures that they have. But their contribution, all for the time being, lower. But overall, I think we should get satisfied with their sources.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share, rather flattish. The weaker operational performance in our own operations are partly compensated by associated companies. FX and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:13) transactions are <mark type="ph" /> compensated (23:15) by taxes and also minorities. And then, we have the bigger change which is in the working capital, which is on the next page, sorry. Come back to that later on.</p>
          <p>CapEx is in line with our sale last year, somewhat lower than last year, SEK200 million lower. We continue to have less of a spectrum this quarter, but we continue to round and try to cover more of the countries and also roll out the fiber. I said before that the fiber is important and we will continue to invest heavily here in Sweden.</p>
          <p>So now I'm back to the cash flow for the fourth quarter working capital. As you could see, cash flow is roughly at SEK4 billion which I think it's a stable cash flow. We had downturns on the EBITDA, as you saw at the beginning. But the main part here is the working capital. We had effects from Norway where we had to pay some of our vendors a bit early due to changes in the systems, and we have also have had to save those payments that has affected this.</p>
          <p>Stable cash flow also in this quarter. Finally, our net debt to EBITDA, lots of questions around this where we &#x2013; I've got question what do we do with the proceeds from IPO in both MegaFon and potentially also in Kcell. We have set up &#x2013; de-leveraging is the first priority to keep the net debt to EBITDA within our limit of 1.5 to 2. So that is the main targets we have right now.</p>
          <p>So finally, stable earnings per share in this quarter as we have revenues at the same level as last year. We need to restore the balance between sales and OpEx. We have had a strong subscriber intake both in Eurasia but also within Mobility Services. And we continue to work with our assets. MegaFon announced its intention to float a week ago and we're preparing also for the IPO within Kcell.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Per-Arne. I will also invite Lars back to the podium. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, Head of Investor Relation. I will guide you through this Q&amp;A session. A lot of people here, of course, and a record number of people dialing in over the phone or listening via the web, so we will try to answer all your question. If we don't have time with everyone, me and my team will stand by and answer your questions after the press conference. And the same thing goes for my colleagues in the press team.</p>
          <p>So we will start with a few questions here on the floor. And please state your name and where you're coming from. A familiar face in the first row, Andreas.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Andreas Joelsson from SEB Enskilda. Two questions. First, if you can share some thoughts on how to break this trend within Mobility Services and how to monetize on data.</p>
          <p>And secondly, for Per-Arne, on the net debt-to-EBITDA side, it's quite not easy to get hold of money these days, but the bond market is quite favorable. Can you elaborate a little bit on why you should be in the range 1.5 to 2 times EBITDA on the net debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start. I think it's a conceptual acceptance that I think we have some difficulties with inter-owned company. I mean, we've been for a 100 years, providing voice services. And voice services is the best thing since sliced bread. Actually, voice services is becoming cheaper and cheaper. And you could even go as far as go to a flat fee for voice services. I mean, that's exactly what's happening in the U.S. with Verizon and AT&amp;T.</p>
          <p>So then comes the issue. If you have an explosion of data traffic in your network, and we have come from flat fees, at least we don't have flat fees. But there's got to be a higher correlation between if you use double as much capacity on the network, you have to pay at least a little bit more. And I think the buckets are too big. I think there are too few buckets. I think the top-up function, the ability to buy more capacity is not ready. So there is a lot of things that have to happen. But I'm pretty sure that we're going to succeed. I think the whole industry will succeed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when it comes to the range 1.5 to 2, I think that one of the reasons why we have been able to access the market is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:47) at the very high rating. I mean, we have one of the highest ratings in the telecom industry. And, I mean, if you don't need the money easy to access the market, so I think that for us it has been a good thing to have this range, and we are one of the lowest leverage companies when it comes to telecom in Europe right now, so I think we'll keep it like this. Of course that will help us to get access to the bond market.</p>
          <p>Then it's also very true that you never know. I mean, now it's a very open market, but it could also close. I wasn't seeing sort of the bond market where it has been closed for a while. And we have decided not to prepare ourselves under pressure than the point in time when it comes to accessing the bond market.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Laurie Fitzjohn, Citigroup. One question just on the EBITDA guidance. And the guidance now implies similar margin in Q4 that you delivered in Q3, but historically Q4 has been a seasonally lower quarter. I just wanted to recheck, is there a reason for different seasonality, or are we even looking at more full-year margin just below the 35% guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we will probably be slightly below the 35%, but we have also said that this should be around 35% and whether it's 35.6% or 35 point &#x2013; or 34.6% or 34.7%, we will see. Eventually, we are talking a very, very small numbers on the whole-year basis when we're talking about <mark type="ph" /> SEK36 billion (29:29) in EBITDA. There's a difference between perhaps SEK100 million or SEK200 million.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. It's on Swedish mobile growth where we've just steadily declined over the last few quarters from 5% growth a couple of quarters ago to flat this quarter, some of it's in consumer competition, more recently it's been corporate. But given your comments on mobile on the call today and the significant outperformance of Swedish mobile over the last few years in a market that's not so different than others in Europe, should we expect a period of top-line declines in Swedish mobile over the next year or so? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start. Maybe you want to add something. I think it's the corporate segment that we are seeing the most headwind in, to start with. I think what we have seen in growth rates for the past five years in Swedish mobile has been exceptional. I have been saying many times that this cannot go on like this, and finally, I was right.</p>
          <p>Now, I think the growth coming in the future will be based on or dependent on our ability to change the business model as I've talked about a couple of minutes ago. I think the traffic today in our network probably like 90% of the traffic is data traffic and only 10% is voice. So our ability to monetize on that traffic growth &#x2013; you saw &#x2013; one of the picture I showed you was 89% growth of the traffic. Our ability as an industry to monetize on that growth is going to determine whether we get growth or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, yes, adding on to this, I mean, we have enjoyed sort of specific right here in Sweden where we had transition from the fixed voice into mobile voice for a while. And that has sort of supported the growth in Sweden where voice has been actually increasing given the loss of the <mark type="ph" /> consecutive (31:25) quarters. Today, it's actually declining. So what Lars is saying here that is, that means it gets more and more important, in fact to monetize the data phone to get after growth of that, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just as a quick follow-up. Sorry, Andreas. I mean, are you going to need to invest to try and capture the benefits of data in the Nordics and specifically Sweden? I mean, we had Telenor state that they're going to require a 15% CapEx for sales by 2015. Are we going to see you need to do that to change the model as you prefer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think &#x2013; I mean, if you look at the mobile business today, it's 10% and even below that in CapEx to sales. And in that, we actually have included the four-year rollout. So I think it's a question of being much more efficient and make sure we will take the right business decision on where you would like to invest rather than automatically going up to the 15%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Yes, Maurice from Barclays. On cost cutting, I'm sure it's too early to give hard details of your plans there. But you have said in the past that your cost cutting have been top-down and in the future will have to be more bottom-up in terms of driving costs with the cultural shift. Has that changed or how are you thinking about that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's my question. This has changed. As I've said initially, we started a couple of months ago analyzing how does the mobile technology organization work as those people who manage the whole mobile infrastructure and also the broadband infrastructure. There are thousands of people working there. We have gone through the prior portfolio. We have a history at TeliaSonera. I think it's true for other operators, too. We don't weed out our products quickly enough. We hang on to every product for years and maybe even 10 and 15 years. And every product that we have in our catalog drives costs, significant costs, whether it's platforms or people, whatever it is. So we started. We have hired some talented product managers about a year, a year-and-a-half ago. We expect these partners to get a better management of our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I'm saying, I don't think we have a product portfolio at TeliaSonera, that is as good as it should be. We are the biggest player in this market and many other markets. We should have a product portfolio second to none. And we don't, unfortunately. And we spent tons of money on it, and we still don't have it. So that is something that can be improved significantly.</p>
          <p>And if the business is going to be flat for three years or two years or whatever, and our cost goes up to 3% every year, we'll have to save money somewhere. And this time, it's not the top-down. This time, we're going to make some fundamental changes in how we run the business. As I said, we have made many fundamental change in this company.</p>
          <p>The areas where we have maybe &#x2013; have had a least success in changing is the core of the company. How do we manage the network? How do we invest in the networks? How do we maintain the networks? And how do we manage the portfolio? That is two of the areas of the eight that we talk about. And I feel convinced that we can change the way we operate and, therefore, reduce cost.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maurice. I see that we have a question here. We will return back shortly to the conference call. But in the meantime, a question from the gentleman on the second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hans <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:14). When will you know how many job that will be cut here in Sweden? And what parts of the Swedish organization are you looking at in this process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we look at the whole organization. And, of course, not only in Sweden, we look at the whole group. As soon as possible, Hans, is my answer, because I understand that when you announce something like this, you create uncertainty, and that's the last thing you want. But at the same time, we have to be transparent when we do this work. We have to tell the people because we are now involved in hundreds of people in these discussions on how we operate in this company. A couple of months is my guess it will take at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans. You can leave the microphone to <mark type="ph" /> Pia (36:01) next to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. This is <mark type="ph" /> Pia <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:04) from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:05). You said that TeliaSonera is spending money on the things that not necessarily asked by the customer. And can you be more specific? What will you don't &#x2013; not do in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me give an example, <mark type="ph" /> Pia (36:18). Let's assume we have a product that is eight years old and we have eight customers on it. Maybe we should think about, could we offer those eight customers another product so we could cut that whole platform and the whole development. And that's an example of what I'm talking about. And we haven't had that discussion.</p>
          <p>And I don't think it's unique to TeliaSonera. I think it is a typical telecom kind of thing, because we're all coming from the incumbent days. We have enjoyed growth for 20 years. I have worked in industries where we had no growth normally. And I can tell you it's a big difference to manage an organization with no growth compared to one with 8% growth. With 8% growth you can make lots of mistakes and you will see nothing of it. You make a mistake at 0% growth, every mistake will show up.</p>
          <p>So we need to change the way we do things here in Telia. Not because we are bad. Our industry is changing. Voice is not growing, and the industry has not, so far, been able to monetize the data explosion which is a fantastic thing. I would be much more worried if customers said, I don't want your service, Telia. I don't want to use your service. People love our services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then maybe we also need to redirect our investment to newer products and take away the old ones, taking out <mark type="ph" /> demand of that that goes down (37:38) on more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:41) products today without spending too much on the old, mature market, I will say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just a question on Finland. You've obviously put in a new management team in place there, so I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on how the turnaround is going with the business. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have Robert there now as the Head of Sonera. The problem is that we didn't have a Head of Sonera in Finland, and we have the same kind of setup as we have in Sweden, both a strong broadband and a mobility business. In most other countries we only have mobility. And it was apparent that we needed a leader in Finland for the Sonera organization.</p>
          <p>I think the reception has been extremely positive. We have even some facts that can prove that, convince ourselves that Robert has started very well. Of course, he has also the challenge that we have to reduce cost. Finland is not excluded from this activity. So Robert will have to both brake and put the pedal to the metal, because we have lost market share in Finland for a number of years now and they've got to stop.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much. My first question is on Swedish fixed. I understand in the third quarter you had unusually high cost because you worked through the <mark type="ph" /> FILO (39:26) backlog. I was wondering to what extent that is through now and to what extent really that relatively high implied margin in the fourth quarter that Laurie was talking about really is &#x2013; it may be explained by that or whether it's too small a fact to really see it.</p>
          <p>The other question I have is on Swedish mobile, again back to this issue of some more competition in the corporate segment. And then I was wondering, can you give us some indication of how the price levels in the corporate segment look relative to the consumer segment in Sweden at this point? Do you think there's sort of an unusually high price point there that might give Tele2 and 3 the opportunity to attack more aggressively there or is it just a different issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the second question. I think prices in the corporate segment has been under pressure for a number of quarters, particularly voice prices, but also data prices. And I think that's one reason. But the other reason is, I think, many of our corporate clients are concerned about their own business and are very careful. So it's a combination of high price competition on particularly voice but also data and I think a cautiousness in the segment to invest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then regarding the margin in Broadband, yes, we have worked down the backlog. That's correct. And I think that will help in the fourth quarter. We have also increased the cost for customer care, which I said, in the third quarter, might be slightly lower, but of course it's a challenge to keep up the <mark type="ph" /> more you have to need (41:03) to have in the fourth quarter, and we have initiated some initiatives to make sure that we could reach that. But it's not a walk in the park.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First one, Lars, you talked about network management and some efficiencies to potentially be gained here. Last year, at the Capital Markets Day, you outlined a plan for a move towards one common network management center. Just how far have you come in that process? And do you see some savings being realized here or efficiencies? And do you potentially see further network sharing across <mark type="ph" /> as you are &#x2013; (41:51) sort of in line with your comments on perhaps improving efficiencies in the network management side of the business?</p>
          <p>And the second quick question relating to Turkcell, please. We're awaiting the UK Privy Council court ruling. Our latest update was a decision is expected by December, January. Is that, as far as you know, still the time horizon we're looking at? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is, December, January. I think on the multi-market operation, I think it's going slower than I had hoped. And actually, it's going slower than we planned. That's also a reason why I made some changes in the mobility management, because we are getting under pressure and we have seen this coming for at least a year. And we need to speed up, both on cost in general but particularly on cost of goods sold, which is driven very much by our network, whether they are in Sweden or they are in other countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when it comes to the network sharing, in Denmark, we have already said that the first, shall we say, two years will not give us so much lower OpEx. It will be lower on the CapEx side, but it takes time to dismantle some of the networks. So that will be seen later.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Kari Lumikero. I work for MTV3 Finland as correspondent here in Stockholm. Now there has already been a furious reaction in Helsinki concerning your plans to get rid of people. And the question is, why do you have to, again, kick out people although the company is profitable?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you say something about the details concerning Finland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we cannot say or talk about details in any country. And you see, when you have an industry that is growing every year for two decades, life is pretty good. But if the industry stops growing, and the salary goes up 3% every year, you got to save that money elsewhere then. So I think it's not an issue of TeliaSonera. This is an industry challenge, that the industry doesn't see the growth coming in any longer for a couple of years, at least.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Mikel <mark type="indiscernible" />, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:29) Industry. Just to understand, when you're talking about getting more money from data, we can obviously not grow by getting more customers because sort of the &#x2013; everybody already has at least one SIM card. So &#x2013; but do you expect to grow market share, or do you expect to make growth from actually getting more money from each customer? And then how much approximately? So basically, how much more should we expect phone billing to increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your phone bill will go down or has been going down for years now. I expect actually the voice part, Mikel, on the bill will continue to go down. Actually, I think we will have a flat fee for voice like they have in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The issue is, how much do you pay for data. And if you next year use double the amount of data you use this year, are you going to pay anything more for that or is that for free? And the logic is you have to pay something extra if you use twice as much data next year compared to this year. That is what I mean when I say I have to monetize the growth in data. The growth is there, the demand is there. I've been saying so many times the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited and I believe it is. And the question is, as you use more, are you going to pay a bit more. I think we have to...</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two questions. Firstly, on Swedish Mobile, it seems that with iPhone 5 you have with your Halebop brand taking more or less a price leading position in the market. And I know your competitors and also the distributors are quite surprised by this. Could you explain a little bit what the strategy is? Is it temporary or will you revert back to a &#x2013; sort of a in line price position there later?</p>
          <p>Secondly, Kazakhstan, you had a very good net intake in Tele2 has had also very good net intake for a couple of quarters. It seems like penetration is going through the roof more or less, and is there a lot to multiple SIMs now in the market? What do you read into the market situation there? Will there be a backlash on subscriptions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first question, more of a principal statement. I'm not aware of price points in Halebop unfortunately. But Telia &#x2013; the brand Telia is the leader in this market, and therefore, we have a special responsibility. When we had a price war in the spring, we did not participate because we are the leader, and that's my principal position. I don't know if Andreas knows some more details about the iPhone Halebop price levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of speculations about price war and who is blaming who and leading that price war. I think that I did a screening a month ago or something, and the difference between the highest price and the lowest price on the fighting brands was about &#x20AC;1. So I don't think it's a major difference between the brands.</p>
          <p>On CapEx on &#x2013; and the subscription, Per-Arne, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think <mark type="ph" /> partly &#x2013; (47:39) I think you're probably right that we are now seeing, given sort of the new emphasis in the market that we are really go <mark type="ph" /> up in (47:47) penetration last year, and this is &#x2013; I will say that it's the fact that we have multi SIM cards in this market. Also, we are getting more and more data phones et cetera and so I think it definitely increased. But it's not giving us so much revenue actually, it's more that we are actually increasing the number of subscribers. So we will see how long this will last.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just have one question. I'm wondering a little bit, you're saying that your priorities to take down leverage when it comes to the cash that you're getting from MegaFon and Kcell. But if you just take that cash and add it on to your current net debt, you would be at 1.5 and that's before even having the Q4 cash flow and the cash flow you will get in Q1 before you start to pay out your dividends. So therefore, I'm sort of curious on why you can't say anything more on any potential extraordinary dividend or share buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll stick to what we have said. Let's see that we have the money in the bank account before we start to talk about this and then we will see. I think if you go back, Lena, and look at our previous track record, if we have excess cash, we have returned it to the shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Barry Zeitoune. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. It's Barry Zeitoune from Berenberg. I've just got a couple of questions. It's clear that you're trying to reinvigorate your EBITDA growth by cutting costs. I was wondering have you given any thought to reinvigorating your top-line growth and whether you would consider any external M&amp;A in doing that.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on Swedish mobile and the developments in the corporate segment. Yeah, my understanding is that the corporate segment makes up about half your Swedish mobile business. In Denmark, we've seen declines starting in the public sector then feeding through more into the private sector. So I was just wondering really on that curve where you are. Are you starting to see declines now in the public sector? And should we expect further declines in the private sector to follow or would you say you're quite far along that curve already? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's right that you see the same sign in Sweden sometime ago that the public sectors started declining and the price pressure is the highest in the public sector. But I don't think there is any other parallel with Denmark &#x2013; our position in Denmark is very different from our position in Sweden. We are the number three player. The only market we are not number one or number two. And here, we are clearly the number one player. So I think the parallel with Denmark is very dangerous to draw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would also say that we are seeing price pressure in the private sector as well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...not only the public. So I mean, it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it started in the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean, they spillover to the private sector as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the first question on the M&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can't grow your total only with M&amp;A. You have to do something with the price model. So I think that's what &#x2013; you won't be helped by M&amp;A activities. We need to do something with our models when it comes to data pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you not consider more of an emerging market exposure within your current mix? I mean, could you just clear that Eurasia is providing excellent growth while the European parts of the business are lacking? So are there ways that you would consider increasing your exposure further east to boost top-line growth on an underlying basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have said since I started here and, as late as yesterday, the board confirmed that Eurasia is a very important part of our business. In five years that I've been here, we made one decision to move into one country. It's not an easy task to get one &#x2013; find a market, find an opportunity and be convinced that you can do business there in an ethical, acceptable way. It's not easy. And I've been very open about one opportunity. And I want to underline &#x2013; now, using it as an example, I'm not about to announce that we're going to go into Burma or Myanmar, depending on which name you prefer.</p>
          <p>But it is an opportunity. It's a virgin country. The political situation has changed quite dramatic in the last 18 &#x2013; 12 to 18 months. Two years ago, it would have been impossible; today, maybe it's still impossible. But we are looking at it. It will take us a year to come to the conclusion and then it will take another two years of building up in that &#x2013; in a country like that. We went into Nepal four years ago and we have invested heavily over four years. And we've been extremely successful, much more successful than we had in our business case. And you can't assume that it goes that fast as it did in Nepal. To have a 30% return on capital after four years is nearly unbelievable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Barry. Was there a question from <mark type="ph" /> Koln (53:13)? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:16). Just Denmark is apparently still a struggle, and your EBITDA is falling despite cost cuts. Just curious to hear what your considerations are strategically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are many. No, but &#x2013; emotionally, Denmark's important to us. I mean, it's part of the whole market. On the other hand, the results are unbearable. So we've got to improve the results. Now, one way is to &#x2013; that's why we share the network with Telenor. It's the one way to get the cost down or at least to get the results to improve.</p>
          <p>I think we have to accept that we will never have the results in Denmark that we have in Sweden, particularly in Northern Sweden but also Northern Finland or in Norway. Can we live with that? Yes. But we can't live with these results because now we have no return. And that is unacceptable.</p>
          <p>Now, I know what your next question is going to be. And, yes, it is on the radar screen as a possibility. And it would be stupid to say you never think about it or what do you think about all the alternatives? But I'm not willing to give up yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it divestment or an acquisition or...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but then you can do different things. Then you can do different things, so you can either sell or buy or merge or whatever. There are different alternatives. And we will see. I'm not willing to give up yet.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="ph" /> Koln (54:47). We have two more questions on the conference call. And let's finish them off before closing here. So, operator, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:55). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Two questions on the cost savings, please. Firstly, the kind of initial or obvious savings measures that comes to mind generally reflect or relate to the legacy fixed line network, whereas the kind of structural revenue problem that you highlight is very much mobile <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:15). And, I mean, do you see any kind of problem with that, or how does this translate into markets where you currently have mobile operations?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you just shed a bit of light on your thinking of OpEx versus CapEx in terms of do you see an attractive offset of reducing operating expenditure by maybe spending a little bit more on investments in some part of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the first one. I think because of the market situation for broadband over the past three, four years, they have worked more on their cost side than mobility has. Mobility has enjoyed two decades of growth and taken out relatively little cost over the years I've been here. Both of them will have to participate in this because broadband has a much more complicated product portfolio and technical infrastructure, much more complicated than mobility. So therefore, broadband is an important contributor if we're going to be successful in reducing cost. But mobility hasn't historically reduced much cost. And therefore, they have also an important role to play to achieve these SEK2 billion over two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood your last question was whether we were prepared to redirect and reduce CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or more on the idea of would you be prepared to actually increase CapEx to achieve OpEx reductions as a consequence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sometimes you need to do that. But overall, we can't afford ourselves to go up very much on the CapEx. I mean, that's a cash flow issue. And I think it's more a question of giving the right priorities and redirect it into areas where we will benefit from the investments rather than we just pouring in money on old stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">

          <p>Your next question comes from Akhil Dattani. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning. It's Akhil Dattani from JPMorgan. Just two questions, please. Firstly, on Spain, I just wondered if you could maybe just provide a bit of color on how you're thinking about that business going forward, just in the context of your points earlier on the difficulty generating growth at the group level at the moment. And I guess, at the moment, Spain is performing pretty well. So how do you think about the merits of keeping that operation, continuing to trying to grow it versus potentially seeking a disposal next year?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, on working capital, I think the last quarter you were highlighting the attempts you are making to try and improve the capital &#x2013; working capital outflows that you've been incurring in the last couple of years. I appreciate Q3 has got some very specific one-off issues, but I just wondered if you could give a broad update on your thoughts on working capital going forward and how confident you are you can stabilize that number into next year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lars, start with Yoigo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I take Yoigo? Well, I thought it was pretty well known that we have the intention of divesting Yoigo. And they are performing reasonably well, yes. Good for them. Good for the buyer. We've made up our mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to working capital, yes, I'm pretty confident that we will work with it in much better way than we did before. But we also didn't even look at it. So now we know what it is and we know that it has an impact from certain price models. Of course, if you change prepaid to post that it will affect us, and also if you are <mark type="ph" /> funding phones (58:43) over 24 months and you're paying it in 30 days. So I think I feel pretty confident that we could steer that in a much better way than we have done before. And this time, we had sort of one-offs in Norway that I'm not very pleased with, but we know at least what it was.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just one quickly on the working capital. Can you just clarify the point you made? You said that you've changed some of the ways that you deal with <mark type="ph" /> the entity (59:08). I'm just trying to understand structurally why you would have sustainable negative working capital just so that I can understand what's changing and what's going to support the improvement into next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, to be very frank and we didn't even looked at it. And we have increased our working capital with SEK5 billion in the last four years and not really looking at why we have done it. But now we are looking at that as support of new pricing model spectrum, we look at the effects from a capital perspective, what's going into creating new pricing offerings. And it might not be that we will have no higher working capital, but at least we have controls in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:43), so we take obvious decision round it, rather than to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Akhil, call me later. We can talk an hour about working capital. In the meantime, we close this press conference. Thank you very much for coming. I have my colleague, Thomas J&#xF6;nsson there that will take care of the media. He's jumping up and down, and thank you very much for coming.</p>
