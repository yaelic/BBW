          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the presentation of the 2012 Third Quarter Results, hosted today by Mr. Enrico Cucchiani, Chief Executive Officer. My name is Marina, and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. At the end of the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Enrico Cucchiani. Sir, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, good morning or good evening, wherever you are. And thank you for joining us on this call to discuss Intesa Sanpaolo's result for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012. I am Enrico Cucchiani, and I'm joined by Carlo Messina, General Manager and CFO.</p>
          <p>I stated at the Q1 stage earlier this year that our strategy was focused on de-risking, balance sheet strengthening, liquidity, superior execution and performance. I updated you last for Q2 and now at the end of Q3, I'm happy to report that we have made further progress.</p>
          <p>Now, if we &#x2013; if you can please turn to slide one, we have the summary page. Let me recap the first nine months of 2012. Despite ongoing recession and the associated continued credit quality deterioration, we have made considerable progress. Our already solid balance sheet gets even stronger making our bank one of the very few ones in the world, already Basel 3 compliant in terms of liquidity and capital ratios.</p>
          <p>The capital position has improved with core Tier 1 ratio at 11.1%. Let me remind you that it was already at a respectable 10.1% at the end of 2011. The pro forma common equity ratio is at 10.5% and the EBA capital ratio is at 10.3% versus 9.2% at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>The leverage stands deliberately low at 18.6, significantly lower than the vast majority of our international peers. The liquidity position is strong with both LCR and NSFR well above 100%. We continue to deliver quality earnings and I would like to emphasize the word quality. We have &#x20AC;1.7 billion of net income for the period and &#x20AC;414 million in Q3.</p>
          <p>Operating income is up 6.9% at &#x20AC;13.4 billion and operating costs are down 2.3%, thanks to aggressive cost management. Operating margin is &#x20AC;6.8 billion, up 17.8% versus 2011. This, let me remind you, is the highest level since 2009. We continue to address the deteriorating credit environment through a rigorous and conservative, perhaps even redundant, provisioning policy. The activation of focused profit improvement levers is delivering an increasingly significant impact, approximately &#x20AC;1 billion before tax during the first nine months. On top of which, we have results from an effective liability management and LTRO usage. Finally, the transformation journey to reposition the bank for the new normal is firmly underway.</p>
          <p>After this introduction, let us turn to slide three to get into the details. The core Tier 1 ratio, as I said, is at 11.1%, 100 basis points above year-end 2011. It is worth noting that this core Tier 1 level is after pro quota dividends. As a reminder, last year cash dividends were at a respectable level of &#x20AC;822 million. And as of September 2012, &#x20AC;617 million have already been accrued and accounted for.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that last year, the cash dividend was the seventh highest among the top 17 European banks. In addition, the pro forma common equity ratio is at 10.5%, considering a fully phased-in Basel 3. Similarly, also the EBA capital ratio has increased by 110 basis points to 10.3% from the 2011 year-end level and stands, to the best of our knowledge, amongst the highest for the eurozone commercial banks.</p>
          <p>Let me make another very, very important point. Altogether, strong capital is the prerequisite for continued and sustainable dividend, and this bodes well regardless of a possible or potential continued recessionary mode.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to liquidity on slide four. The liquidity position of the bank continues to be very strong and has further improved in the last quarter. Unencumbered eligible assets with Central Banks net of haircuts have risen significantly to &#x20AC;61 billion in the quarter, with a 66% increase since the beginning of the year. Considering also October, we now stand at approximately &#x20AC;70 billion.</p>
          <p>Liquid assets remain stable at a very high level of &#x20AC;110 billion. The loan-to-deposit ratio is now below 100%, down over 5 percentage points year-to-date, reflecting &#x2013; and this is very important, an increase in deposits of 4.6% in the last nine months while loans have remained stable. The high liquidity level coupled with strong funding capability makes the bank already compliant with Basel 3 requirements for 2015 and 2018. Both LCR and Net Stable Funding Ratio are in fact well above 100%. I would actually say that they are in excess of 110%.</p>
          <p>The pro forma common equity ratio shown on the previous slide together with this liquidity ratios make the bank one of the few ones in the world that are already Basel 3 compliant both on required capital and liquidity. And quite frankly, having made the effort and being there doesn't make us happy when we see other players trying to take shortcut. Over 100% of our bonds maturing in 2012 has already been rolled over by the end of October. And most likely, we will start funding bonds maturing in 2013 during the remainder of this year.</p>
          <p>After this quick snapshot of the balance sheet, let us now turn to the income statement on slide five where we can demonstrate the quality of our earnings. The P&amp;L for the quarter shows an operating income in excess of &#x20AC;4.4 billion, up 17% versus the third quarter of 2011. This is the net result of a reduction in net interest income, minus 6.5%, driven by the reduction in Euribor; a slight increase in net fees and commissions; an increase in profits on trading, which benefits from &#x20AC;327 million capital gain from the July buyback. And finally, a very strong increase in insurance income for the third consecutive quarter, showing our marked improvement in this business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to costs, personnel expenses are down 2.2% year-on-year and administrative costs are down 5.5%. Operating margin stands at almost &#x20AC;2.3 billion, up an astounding 45% versus last year.</p>
          <p>Loan loss provisions are up 24 point &#x2013; sorry, 72.4%. This reflects the challenging market environment and confirms our prudent policy. It also reflect the fact that we can afford extremely prudent provisioning. Pre-tax income is about &#x20AC;960 million, four times higher than Q3 in 2011 when we impaired &#x20AC;600 million of Greek bonds.</p>
          <p>Net income for the quarter is a solid &#x20AC;414 million. It is worth mentioning that the difference that is minus 21.4% with last year relates to 2011 non-recurring items; a &#x20AC;1.1 billion tax benefit available in 2011 and a &#x20AC;471 million restructuring charges, always referred to 2011.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to slide six for an overview of the September year-to-date results. The nine-month waterfall analysis shows very sound fundamentals. Operating income is up 6.9% for the period at &#x20AC;13.4 billion. Apart from the strong contribution from trading and insurance, it is worth highlighting the stable net interest income despite a 122 basis points decline in Euribor.</p>
          <p>Personnel and admin costs are significantly down, reflecting, as I said before, aggressive cost reduction program. The resulting operating margin is equal to &#x20AC;6.8 billion, up a substantial 17.8% versus last year.</p>
          <p>Loan loss provisions are up 47.9%, leading to a pre-tax income of &#x20AC;3.2 billion, which is up 16.5% versus last year. Net income, which reflects extremely conservative provisioning at a very high tax rate, is still very solid at &#x20AC;1.7 billion for the nine months.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to slide seven to highlight the key differences between 2011 and 2012. The key points are higher trading profits of &#x20AC;753 million, related to clever usage of LTRO and effective liability and liquidity management; higher contribution from insurance, which shows a major improvement of &#x20AC;334 million. These additional revenues have allowed the banks to be extremely rigorous and conservative with provisioning, which increased 47.9% without impacting profitability in any significant way. Other variations as a result of non-operating elements in the first nine months of 2011.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, in 2012, we do not bear the impact of Greek bonds impairment which was &#x20AC;618 million as of September 2011. Likewise, we do not have restructuring charges which were, as I said before, &#x20AC;471 million in the first nine months of 2011. On the negative side, last year &#x2013; negative side to the extent we don't have it this year, last year, we enjoyed a tax benefit of &#x20AC;1.1 billion that was of course non-recurring.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to slide eight to analyze return on sales. Two quick points, first, we enjoy a 24% return on sales, 2 percentage points higher than the same period last year. This is remarkable considering that in 2012 we provisioned for loan losses 6 percentage points more than in 2011. This result is mainly driven by the more aggressive cost management as evidenced by the 49.4% cost/income which is down almost 5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, we analyze the contribution of the various business units. All businesses in our portfolio show positive results for the nine months. Italian Retail and corporate and investment banking results are strong despite the impact of conservative provisioning. On the international subsidiary business, we see that the main factor is Hungary which translates into a substantial decrease in contribution of the international department.</p>
          <p>Our wealth management business shows the most remarkable improvement, reaching over &#x20AC;1 billion of contribution across private banking, insurance, asset management and financial advisors. Wealth management is up 88% versus last year, a truly noteworthy and remarkable result.</p>
          <p>If we turn to slide 10, we can take a deep dive on costs. Operating costs are down 2.3% compared to the first nine months of 2011. In euro terms, this boils down to nominal &#x20AC;155 million. In real terms, however, that is net of inflation and contractual increases; the contraction is in excess of &#x20AC;385 million that is a decrease versus last year in real terms of 5.7%.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, you can see the accelerated pace of cost reduction through the course of the year as illustrated in the second box in the slide where you can see that in the third quarter, we have a 5.5% year-on-year shrinking in Q3 in terms of admin expenses.</p>
          <p>Along with our top-line growth, the strong pressure on costs leads us to a best-in-class 49.4% cost--income ratio, representing a reduction of almost, as I said, 5 percentage points compared to the first nine months of 2011. Let me tell you that the bank is firmly determined to continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in the European market.</p>
          <p>Can I now please ask you to turn to slide 11 to take a look at the development of Intesa's performance over the years? As you can see, the bank delivered the highest nine months operating margin since 2009, 15% higher than the average of the &#x2013; for the past three years. This is clearly encouraging and demonstrates our resilience against the challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>We now turn to the most delicate topic, which requires very careful analysis, that is I'm talking about asset quality. On slide 12, when one tries to make cross-border analysis and comparisons, it is easy to be misled and to be drawn to flawed conclusions, as there are important discrepancies in the definitions and criteria applied in different county. You can clearly see this when it comes to the NPL definition. If you look at aggregate banking data, it would appear that NPLs in Spanish banks are lower than NPLs in Italian banks, that is 8.5% versus 9.9%.</p>
          <p>Through our analysis, we see that in an apple-for-apple comparisons, the Spanish figures would triple and would be 2.5 times higher than the Italian ratio. On the right-hand side box, you can see another illuminating case, loan-to-value on residential mortgages, well, in France this loan-to-value is comprised between 80% and 85%; in Germany it is 70%, 75%; in Italy it is just 60% to 65%. And by the way, at our bank, at Intesa, the loan-to-value of our mortgage portfolio is approximately 50%.</p>
          <p>What are the implication of these different figures? Well, it means quite clearly and quite simply that the value of our collateral is much, much higher. There could be other examples. However, we could stop here as all together I think that this slide shows that Italian asset quality is significantly underappreciated. And we also see that there is a clear need for greater harmonization and transparency.</p>
          <p>On top of that, let me say that the risk of a real estate bubble and/or severe real estate depreciation in Italy is very remote, because Italian real estate is owned by &#x2013; for the most part, by families who live in the properties they own. So far, the decline in real estate prices has been negligible.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to slide 13 for some specific analysis on our credit portfolio. The credit environment, as you can see, is deteriorating. The inflow of substandard loans has increased by 37% and the inflow of doubtful loans by 26%. We have addressed this negative development very aggressively by increasing our provisions by almost 50%, which should give us a very comfortable safety margin going forward. The other side of the coin, of course, is that this provisioning approach has led us to a substantial increase in the cost of risk from 77 basis points to 116 basis point.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to slide 14. The increase in provisions translate in a coverage ratio improvement of 40 basis points, reaching a comfortable 45%, which is much higher than Italian sector average, which stands at 37%. Let me also remind you that our performing loans reserve has increased from 70 basis points to 80 basis points, a level which is much higher than our peers and gives us a &#x20AC;2.7 billion buffer to face further uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to slide 15 to factually prove how conservative our provisioning is. The proof of this conservative approach is that the recovery rate is almost 150%. And this shows that this provisioning is prudent and certainly more than adequate. And I would put the emphasis on the more.</p>
          <p>The increased focus on risk selection is highlighted by the next slide, which is slide 16. In a deteriorating credit environment, our NPL inflows from performing loans has decreased by 8% in just one quarter. Though this is too early to claim victory or to say that this signifies a trend reversal, we would like to believe that this reflects the initiatives taken and the processes and policies in place. And let me also say incidentally that this trend is confirmed by the figures that we see in October.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to slide 17 to compare Intesa asset quality to our Italian competitors. Here you can see that relative to local competitors, our bank's operations enjoy a best-in-class performance both in terms of NPL stock and NPL evolution. Intesa has the lowest NPL incidence among large Italian banks, some of which are almost double than us. Not only that, the increase in net non-performing loans over total loans is far less than any other bank in the first half of the year, that is, our competitive advantage is getting even larger.</p>
          <p>After the deep dive on asset quality, we now turn to the big picture and analyze Intesa's economic and financial KPIs versus our international competitors. We can start looking at that on slide 18. Notwithstanding the Italian recessionary environment, Intesa is performing better or in line with the European peers on several KPIs, notably the profitability of its asset base at 2.7% and the cost/income ratio, which stands at 49.4%.</p>
          <p>As you can see, loan loss provisions show the only red delta and limit our overall performance relative to peers. This reflects the Italian credit environment, stricter NPL criteria applied in Italy as we have seen in the previous slides. And last but not least, certainly a very prudent provisioning, further enhanced by high collateral values. On the other side, we consider our low leverage a key strength in the current economic environment despite the fact that these penalizes the pre-tax return on tangible equity. Notwithstanding the more conservative leverage, pre-tax return on tangible equity remains in line with European average.</p>
          <p>Let's now continue to slide 19 where we see &#x2013; we go on with our benchmarking exercise. To elaborate more on the leverage, we work &#x2013; we have to say that we work at a deliberately low level and decreasing level in this volatile environment. We believe this is a competitive advantage because it protects us from market deterioration and would allow us to re-lever if the environment turns positive. Compared to our peer group, we stand at a very conservative 8.6% (sic) [18.6%], down from 19.3% at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Slide number 20, looking at peer group performance on operating margin growth, we see that our bank reported the third highest increase year-on-year. That is at least so far. On page 21, we see that Intesa has a market-leading cost/income ratio. That is one of the only three banks below 50% and this shows also a very significant year-on-year improvement, reflecting our progress both on the numerator that is cost and the denominator that is income.</p>
          <p>Now, turn to slide 22. We normally look at the cost of risk in isolation. Within this framework, Italian banks fare rather poorly. However, one has to take into account that, as we have shown before, Italian asset quality is significantly underappreciated. And if we analyze the incidence of cost of risk in conjunction rather than in isolation, in conjunction with the cost income, we see that the picture changes significantly and Intesa emerges as one of the top four players in terms of profitability. This is important not only in terms of economic performance, but also because it shows the size of the buffer to support potential stress scenarios.</p>
          <p>Let us now move on to consider some of the short-term levers we implemented to update &#x2013; we implemented and to update you on our transformation journey. Let's move to page 24. As you remember, earlier this year, we committed to activate a set of levers to improve profitability and to develop a transformation program meant to reposition the bank to compete successfully in the new normal. In the first nine months, we have implemented a full set of high-impact profit improvement measures that have already delivered substantial results. The levers, of course, will continue to be activated also in the years to come. In addition, we have started a transformation journey which we will describe later.</p>
          <p>Just a second, if I may. On slide 25, on the left-hand side, we recap the &#x2013; "the promises." On the right-hand side, we see the delivery. We report a cumulative &#x20AC;500 million increase in net interest income from re-pricing. We have converted &#x20AC;800 million of capital that was previously generating negative EVA into value-creating capital.</p>
          <p>We now have a task force of 450 FTEs active on a non-performing loan portfolio of &#x20AC;19 billion with &#x20AC;225 million of provisions already released. We maintain a strong focus on aggressive cost cutting. As already said, we delivered a cost reduction of 4.4% in administrative expenses and 1.6% in personnel costs compared to the first nine months of 2011. This amounts to &#x20AC;155 million in nominal terms and &#x20AC;385 million in real terms, as I said.</p>
          <p>The net present value of our liquidity management program is now at &#x20AC;1.6 billion, driven by effective liability management, including buybacks, and smart LTRO usage to lower cost of funding. As you can see, the impact of this performance levers, which stood at &#x20AC;600 million after Q2, has further significantly improved in Q3.</p>
          <p>Now, turn to slide 26. We already talked about cost management and I would like to add that by year end the bank's head count will show a decrease of almost 4,000 FTEs. In addition, a highly &#x2013; in a highly rigid labor environment, our bank has negotiated a groundbreaking agreement with labor unions to improve customer service and satisfaction. Branches now open from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm will be open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and will be open on Saturdays as well. This, as I said, is an absolute first in Italy.</p>
          <p>Turn now to page 27 which illustrates the key elements of our liability management and the way we have used the LTRO. We have issued &#x20AC;7 billion of eurobonds in 2012, and the key highlights are that 77% of demand was by foreigners, and demand has &#x2013; was almost 3 times the target we had in mind.</p>
          <p>We have performed two successful buyback programs totaling &#x20AC;2.7 billion, &#x20AC;1.2 billion of Tier 1 subordinated notes in February and a &#x20AC;1.5 billion of senior and subordinated notes in July. These buybacks have generated &#x20AC;600 million in before-tax earnings. In addition, we exchanged &#x20AC;1.8 billion of subordinated for senior debt in November, and this &#x2013; we will report &#x20AC;120 pre-tax earnings in the Q4 results. In summary, great timing and excellent execution delivered a significant impact with an overall net present value of approximately &#x20AC;1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; now, we turn to slide 29 to remind you that we have developed eight workstreams to make Intesa more competitive and to reposition the bank for the new normal. These pervasive workstreams are revisiting the business model and the delivery system of the bank, and will affect our interaction with customers as well as operations. Seven of these workstreams are already underway.</p>
          <p>Let me now conclude with slide 29. Earlier in 2012, in a volatile environment, we made few but firm commitments on which we delivered. We promised that core Tier 1 and common equity in excess of 10% and EBA capital ratio above threshold. Now, we have an 11.1% core Tier 1 and a 10.5% common equity, and a 10.3% EBA capital ratio. We committed to de-risking and we have a deliberately low leverage of 18.6 times. We promised high liquidity in both LCR and Net Stable Funding Ratio well above 100%.</p>
          <p>We promised aggressive cost management and now the cost/income ratio is below 50%. We promised a sound performance and we report a &#x20AC;6.8 billion operating margin, up 17.8% versus 2011, and also &#x2013; which also means the highest performance level since 2009. And we also report &#x20AC;1.7 billion in net income.</p>
          <p>In addition, in November, we concluded the successful exchange between subordinated and senior debt, pocketing a pre-tax profit of some &#x20AC;120 million, which is not included in the nine months figure. Finally, we confirm a dividend at least equal to that of 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude reaffirming that we are more than ever committed to deliver best-in-class performance. We believe our management team makes the difference and we are quite confident that the team will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>I now want to thank you for your kind attention, and I turn over to you for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for the presentation. I haven't been asking this question to any banker for a few years actually, but if I look at your capital ratios under Basel 3, the leverage, the coverage and also the funding position, it looks to me like you are running almost on an excess capital at the moment and perhaps also some excess funding, at least, if I compare Intesa to the European peers. And therefore, I was wondering what would be the catalyst for you to decide to release the brakes and would you expect this to happen already at some point next year? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matteo, for your question, which is an important one and we are asking ourselves the same question. The fact is that in the current environment, we like to have some extra fat. And I would not be inclined to release any of this extra fat until we see the light at the end of the tunnel and until we are reassured that the light at the end of the tunnel is not a locomotive approaching at full steam. Having some extra capital, I think is very important because together with the rigorous if not abundant provisioning, I think is the best guarantee for sustainable dividends. And that is really the reason why we don't mind having some extra fat. The minute that we see a definitely stable and favorable environment, I would certainly say, as I said last year, that we will not see any need to have any excess capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello. First of all, thanks very much for the excellent disclosure on asset quality and on the inflow. It's extremely helpful. If you may, a little bit of commentary since the &#x2013; more of the new inflow is coming from Central Europe, if you can just tell us a little bit where that is coming from and what you're seeing there, given ultimately your exposure there is not that large.</p>
          <p>And also on the ground, the SME or retail seems stable, but the SME in corporate seems a little bit higher, again what do you see on the ground? Normally, the third quarter doesn't see an awful lot of happening. What should we expect for Q4? And a very specific question on risk-weighting, you've improved your risk-weighting in the quarter; it seems especially in your corporate division, can you tell us how? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Francesca, for your questions and your comments, and particularly on the disclosure. Actually, we make it a point to be as transparent as possible, that is we'd like to share with our analysts and our investors all the information we have internally, because it's a very good approach also for us because it keeps us on our toes.</p>
          <p>On the new inflow, we see some improvements. Again, I am not in the position to say whether this is related to the fact that we have tightened the bolts on our risk-selection criteria, which we've certainly done, or whether this is related to a more general improvement in the environment. As far as the inflows from our international banks, well, I mean, the key problem is Hungary, and that is indeed a problem. It is a market problem and we see &#x2013; I mean, relative to a few years ago, the situation certainly has deteriorated. We &#x2013; our policy is to acknowledge the problems as we see them. So, it's not that we're storing up bad surprises for the fourth quarter. Okay?</p>
          <p>So, what we &#x2013; what you see in the third quarter reflects the best of our assessment. I can only predict that in the fourth quarter, we will continue to have bad news from New Europe, and that is just a fact. As I said, in the fourth quarter, and I take this as an opportunity to clarify our policy, we will provision as we do during the first quarter. There's only one difference is that at the end of the year, we are in a better position than at the beginning of the year to assess the overall performance. And if we are satisfied with the performance, we will be more generous with the provisioning or, if you wish, more conservative.</p>
          <p>Again, the right reading of that, if that will be the case, is to be consistent with what I said before, answering Matteo on the capital issue. That is, we have two ways of protecting ourselves vis-&#xE0;-vis future scenarios. One is having some redundancy in capital, and frankly I do not want to officially use the word redundancy, but let's say particularly conservative provisioning.</p>
          <p>As far as your last question, I'll leave it up to Carlo Messina.</p>

          <p>Looking at the risk-weighted assets, the reduction in risk-weighted assets is mainly concentrated in action we made to have more collateral and more guarantees, and so is the part of the program that we launched in order to reduce the risk-weighted assets in all the different business units. Then we have some different kind of loans switching from current accounts to other more guaranteed forms and so that's the reason why we have a reduction in risk-weighted asset.</p>

          <p>Okay. And one last question, if I may. Again, thank you very much for your disclosure on net interest income impact of the hedges. I can see that with interest rates coming down still marginally positive, can you update us a little bit on where you are on the hedges in terms of the maturity, how they will be trending into next year? I guess, with interest rate stabilizing, the contribution incremental will probably be less if I am &#x2013; please, let me know if I'm right or wrong.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. This is Marta Bastoni from JPMorgan. I have a couple of questions. I would like &#x2013; if possible, if you can give us some detail on how much time deposit you have at the moment and what is the dynamic for the cost of the retail deposit funding?</p>
          <p>And on the strategic plan, in terms of the 4,000 head count reduction, how much has already been done and how much has been agreed with the unions? And lastly, do you have a minimum coverage level you feel comfortable with? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marta. Let me start with the &#x2013; your question on strategy relative to head count reduction. And let me say, you are well familiar with the Italian environment that is we have very severe constraints like nobody thought that after the labor market reforms, that we would be able to do a head count reduction &#x2013; a significant head count reduction this year. But indeed, we found a way of doing it. And that is quite, quite significant and I would say that in this respect, in Italy, we are leading the pack or we are the benchmark or we are setting the standards and the trends, and it's up to the other to play catch-up.</p>
          <p>Now, it is practically impossible to give you a strategic perspective with figures because, again, we are dealing in an environment which has severe constraints. So, if you have a constraint, I mean, you might &#x2013; whatever number you pick could &#x2013; would be completely irrelevant. What we can say is that &#x2013; and that you can really check &#x2013; easily check the accuracy of what I am saying if you look at our track record, is that I believe that we have the capabilities in place to outperform anyone in this respect. But I mean, we are not &#x2013; despite being a large and significant bank, we are not in the position of modifying the regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn &#x2013; which in one sense, this answer might leave you unsatisfied. On the other side, if you think about it, it should give you great comfort because in the end what is relevant is our relative ability to improve efficiency. If we can improve it better and more than our competitors, then we have a competitive advantage. And as you can see, I mean &#x2013; and you can check the figures of anyone, we have the lowest cost/income ratio, but we also have the highest improvement. And the figure that I really find pretty astonishing, I mean, even though, I mean, it's &#x2013; I shouldn't be astonished, but I mean, astonishing to the extent that it's very good is the fact that we have had a cost reduction in real terms in nine months of &#x20AC;385 million, minus 5.7%. And the very substantial part of that comes from a reduction in administrative cost.</p>
          <p>This is very important because it shows that we have great capabilities and great focus to really work on this essential dimension, because it's clear that in a stagnant market, to show an ability to increase top line at the same time to manage cost so effectively, I think it is a very comforting and very important point. And quite frankly, I believe in what I see much more than in any numbers that you might put on paper that in this environment would be a pie in the sky.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Carlo for your other questions.</p>

          <p>Sorry, just a follow-up from this question. If I remember correctly, it was &#x20AC;13 billion last quarter. So, this means a &#x20AC;2 billion increase. So, it is quite substantial. Do you see them going up further in the future?</p>

          <p>You have to consider that we are switching from retail loans to time deposits. So, we have shortened the maturities of our liabilities.

        <plist>
          <p>Marta, if I can come back to your question on head count, and we don't like to give figures ahead in this respect. Let me just get your attention to one point. We gave no figures last year, but we have a head count reduction of 4,000 FTEs. There are others in the industry, which have indicated in a figure in &#x2013; a significant figure of a few thousands. Well, that figure was reduced by basically 75% on a voluntary basis, and by year-end we don't know what will be left of that. So, we do not believe in the power of announcements. We believe in the power of delivery and you can count on our delivery in this and all other aspect in the years ahead, in the quarters and the years ahead. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Just a number of clarification actually on the numbers. On the NII, page 39, I see this other component which is around &#x20AC;70 million which is always an important swing factor for your NII. So I would just &#x2013; I would like to just understand what is it maybe, and also if you can give us a little bit of sense how the NII can move at the group level in Q4. You mentioned some re-pricing in the press release, if I'm not wrong.</p>
          <p>The second is on profit from insurance, which was very strong in the quarter, maybe there is any financial results that you want to comment. On fees as well, there's quite a jump in the contribution from current account. I was just wondering whether there is an amount from re-pricing and whether this is sustainable.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, another question, I probably already ask this question a couple of quarters ago, but I just want to understand in the context also of improvement that you see &#x2013; whether there is any change in appetite from non-performing loans, specialized operators that are looking at your portfolio and maybe some more non-performing loan disposal might come. Any comments on this would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you, Domenico. Carlo will take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, starting from net interest margin, so we can all &#x2013; have all the economic figures because the net interest margin &#x2013; the others components are related with some reduction in the portfolio of government bonds in corporate investment banking area because if you see the profit from tradings in this quarter and in last quarter, we have a very important result in profit for trading deriving from the dismissal of some government bonds portfolio, both in investment banking and in treasury department. So, you have to read these figures in connection with the profit from trading slide that is on page 42. On page 42, you have the result for the proprietary trading and treasury and for the capital market activities. And so, this figures is strictly related with the 42 pages.</p>
          <p>If you want to have some outlook on the net interest margin, we can elaborate on the different items because mark-down will have a reduction again. The Euribor in the last two months has fallen. So, we will have, again, a reduction in mark-down, but mark-up will increase due to the pricing. Hedging will increase again. And probably, this kind of activity of disposals of government bonds will be reduced and so the other components will be reduced.</p>
          <p>If we look at the profit from insurance, so the other question you had, the result is mainly related to realized profit from the government portfolio in the figures of the insurance company. It is something like 60% of the results. Then looking at fees, there is a re-pricing in the current account, so you have an increase due to the pricing. And the last question on non-performing loans, we have a &#x2013; there is demand for non-performing loans in this space in the market and we are looking to different possibilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it a &#x2013; sorry, just a follow-up on the last one which is probably more interesting, is there &#x2013; I mean, on your slide actually, appetite, of course, for a big operation or is it just disposal of a very small ticket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very small ticket is business as usual, because it is something that banks are doing in a continuing way. The point is that there could be some demand also for ticket that are on medium size.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. The first one is on the coverage of non-performing loans, which in the quarter was down from  62 to 60.5. I wonder if there is any reason behind this or it's just white noise of the quarterly results. The second question is on net interest income, just if you can give us your view on 2013 as &#x2013; if you believe that flattish net interest income is something achievable or absolutely not given the speed at which we are entering the 2013. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, starting from net interest margin. The real point is the ability to close the gap with the market that we have in mark-up because we are still maintaining 40 basis points gap compared with our peers in Italy. So, if we'll have the possibility to close the gap in a substantial part, it is possible to have also a flat net interest margin. Otherwise, mark-down will have a negative contribution and so can have a not relevant but a reduction in the net interest margin. But we have to see what will be the result of the last quarter in order to be in a position to make a right forecast.</p>
          <p>Looking at the coverage, the coverage ratio on non or doubtful loan, not on &#x2013; non-performing loans, but on doubtful loan, the reduction was the result of the recovery of a portion of doubtful loan that was &#x2013; with an higher coverage ratio than the one that entered from the substandard loans. So, it's normal routine.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, Mr. Cucchiani and everybody. My question &#x2013; my first question is on net interest income. Is it correct to say that given the three month of Euribor trend, which is unlikely to recover significantly anytime soon, net interest income is set to a low point in the fourth quarter? And if this is the case, what action are you planning on taking to support net interest income in 2013? You said before you will try to make some re-pricing, I was wondering on the financial portfolio.</p>
          <p>Maybe you already answered that for the fourth quarter you may be &#x2013; maybe you are going to reduce further the Italian government bonds exposure. But for 2013, what should we expect in terms of financial portfolio and loans portfolio? When we will see again a loans growth in 2013? And then on the hedge facility on deposits, can you give us the number on the deposits is &#x20AC;50 billion, &#x20AC;55 billion  deposits?</p>
          <p>The second question is on asset quality. I know that it's difficult to predict when doubtful loans will peak, but I see that you are saying that some improve &#x2013; we are looking at some improvement in third quarter and also the October figures confirm this trend. So, what should we expect in terms of loan loss provisions? And maybe also due to the &#x2013; to your countercyclical buffer on performing loans that is much higher than peers, should this be seen as a way of ensuring that provision are less volatile in the coming quarters apart from maybe the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And finally, could you give us your opinion on recent IMF criticism on the Italian banks for alleged low coverage of problematic loans? Do you think that Intesa Sanpaolo current coverage ratio including collateral is appropriate or there is still more to do? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Maybe I take part of your question and then I give &#x2013; and then Carlo will go on. When will asset quality deterioration peak, are we through or not? I don't think we can say we are through frankly speaking. I think we're seeing some improvements in our portfolio, okay? And if I have to make a bet, well, first of all &#x2013; and I reiterate &#x2013; I'd like to reiterate that I don't think we can draw any conclusion after one quarter in which we see an improvement in the first derivative. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I were to make a bet, I would rather tend to bet that it is because of our enhanced focus on risk selection rather than a market improvement. Now, from our analysis and I mean, you can see it better than we can, I mean, with your numbers. You see a clear correlation between the recession, okay, that is the decrease &#x2013; the contraction of GDP and the deterioration of the loan portfolio. There is a quite clear perfect correlation.</p>
          <p>Now, I presume that in Italy, which continues to be our largest market, we are not going to see growth in 2013. At least I think this has to be the working assumption. We are coming off a year of marked recession. And I think the best we can expect is that the decrease will smooth throughout 2013. And hopefully, we will see an improvement &#x2013; a marginal growth in the second part of 2013.</p>
          <p>But even if this happens, I mean, there is a lag factor in the credit cycle, in credit quality. So, let us say that we start seeing a small increase in GDP in the third and fourth quarter of 2013, which I would consider certainly not a pessimistic assumption, okay? Well, I don't see &#x2013; I don't think that we would see in the market an improvement, a credit improvement, for at least an additional six months simply because there is a lagging factor. If we see this improvement in our portfolio, and I stress this, it is not a conclusion, but it would be my assumption now. If I have &#x2013; if I'm forced to explicit &#x2013; make an hypothesis explicit, the hypothesis is that it is related to our bank's risk-selection effort.</p>
          <p>Second, on the opinion of the IMF low coverage and so on, I'll go back to the first slide on asset quality. The reason why we felt compelled to show that slide is that I believe that there are significant misperceptions about asset quality and particularly in the euro periphery. And there is not enough transparency about it. And in general, Italian definitions and criteria set by the Central Bank are most stringent than elsewhere.</p>
          <p>So, you have to be able to read through that, and in order to really understand it, you have to do some additional &#x2013; some deep-dive analysis. And frankly, I don't think that the IMF guys, despite of all their great knowledge and absolutely respectable analytical skills, have necessarily done their homework in sufficient depth. And that is what we also see when &#x2013; when &#x2013; in our meetings with them, but we have to understand. I mean, they are &#x2013; Italy is just one country out of the many that is on their radar screen, it's up to us to help them understand better and to gain more transparency.</p>
          <p>All together, all these conservative and rigorous criteria that are imposed upon the Italian banking system, on one side, are good because they are force &#x2013; they force us to be, let's say, more rigorous in the management of our banks. On the other side, they certainly do not help us in selling Italian banking internationally.</p>

          <p>So, the hedging facility, the total amount is &#x20AC;56 billion. So, looking at the minimum level of net interest margin, we think that we will reach at the end of this quarter. 2013 re-pricing, so mark-up will be the main lever to compensate mark-down. Then we have the possibility, but we will evaluate at the end of this quarter to shorten the maturities of the retail bonds that we have to place next year. So, there is another &#x2013; so, this is another lever in order to reduce the cost of funding next year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the financial portfolio, we think that we can have a contribution that could be in line with that one that we are having this year. So, no relevant changes in our net interest margin deriving from the financial portfolio.</p>

          <p>We have now one question from Carlo Digrandi from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Just one question on regulation, if I may. What's your view or if you've got any feelings about the risk-weighted asset amortization in Europe by talking with the authorities and central regulation, probably you'll have a much better visibility than us. It looks like the Italian banks continue to be penalized in terms of risk-weighted assets compared to the other European banks. Do we have any hints eventually that the situation might change in the course of 2013, or you think the regulation will continue to be much more strict for some countries compared to some others? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlo. If you look at face value, there is no question that the weights applied to the Italian banking system are stricter. However, I think it would be unfair to draw conclusions from that, that is you have to run a lot of regressions to understand the probability of default and the amounts involved. And unless you have full visibility on these numbers, you cannot really tell whether our weights are exaggerated or not.</p>
          <p>So, our approach in general &#x2013; and we &#x2013; you've seen it in &#x2013; also in our public statements is we don't spend time and don't waste energies criticizing the regulators and rules. I mean, we just take them as a constraint. We try to comply with them, not to debate about it and to be &#x2013; and to do as well as we can within that framework.</p>
          <p>Now, generally speaking, there is no question that if there is a bias by Italian regulators, the bias is to be more conservative than others. And again, generally speaking, I have to say that Italian banks have nothing to lose by banking union in terms of standards. And if anything, we stand to gain rather than to lose. So, that in a nutshell sums it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And do you have any expectations that some things might change in the course of 2013, or you probably would opt for a status quo? Tough question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; no, no, no. I mean, on RWAs and on regulations, frankly, consistently with what I said, I am agnostic. I mean &#x2013; and frankly if there are tough regulations as a bank we don't mind because if you're in a weak position, of course, you stand a lot to lose. There are a lot of banks in Italy and elsewhere that fight for a bad bank or change in standards or postponing Basel 3, et cetera, et cetera. We do not belong to that club, okay? We have &#x2013; we're on a club of our own perhaps to the extent that we rather stay focused on performance.</p>
          <p>And I &#x2013; whenever you see someone that is bitching too much about this, I mean, the first question I have, why do you do that? Of course, if we are asked for a technical opinion by the regulators, we will volunteer whatever our wisdom is worth, but again, I mean, we want to stay focused on performance and positively surprise our customers, our customers being our shareholders regardless of the regulatory environment. In the end, if we &#x2013; we live in a regulatory environment that is tough, Darwin's theories apply, the fittest survives and thrives, and the weakest perish. I mean, there was a market also for the stronger ones. That's the market we like to play in. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We have now one question from Alberto Cordara from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a few clarifications on some of the points that you made before. The first is related to this new labor contract that you have been able to achieve. This clearly gives you a first-mover advantage in Italy. So, I just wonder if you think you can quantify the impact in cost savings or new clients, if there is a way to &#x2013; for you tell us &#x2013; to give us an idea of the impact on the bottom line of this important agreement.</p>
          <p>The second point related to the funding for the year which, if I understand correctly, you already completed. So, are you planning to do some prefunding for next year? I think next year you have some higher maturity profile than what you had in 2012. So, if you can give us some clarity about that.</p>
          <p>The third point related to an issue that previously was mentioned by Mr. Messina in relation to the conditions on term deposits. If I understood correctly, you said that the average rate that you pay on the stock is 1% for term deposit below one year, and 1.5% for over one year, if I understood correctly. This seems to me to be well below the system. If you can give us an idea on why you're able to pay below the system, if I understood correctly?</p>
          <p>Just a very final question, so far you've been able to support your bottom line with a number of extraordinary transactions. You completed three <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:16:33) actions this year. You sold some participations in Prada, Findomestic and whatnot. Now, moving into 2013 and arguably, 2013 is going to be still a challenging year because the country is in a recession. Do you think that you have some more in store in terms of extraordinary transactions to push the bottom line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alberto, for your questions. Let me try to answer the first one. You rightly focus on the fact that in terms of labor, of this new agreement that we have reached that we have the first-mover advantage, and I agree with you. Let me &#x2013; I would just qualify it saying that we are consistently &#x2013; consistently have the first-mover advantage and we want to be sustainably the first mover.</p>
          <p>Second, I would rather refrain from quantifying something that in any case is rather elusive, but I would just stick again &#x2013; I don't like that much the &#x2013; as I said before, announcing numbers that will materialize in the more or less distant future. The numbers I really believe are the ones that I make and the difference that I see relative to the past. And I mean, one figure to me is very important is what we mentioned before, the fact that in nine months in real terms we have reduced our expenses by &#x20AC;385 million in nine months. That is minus 5.7% in real terms in nine months.</p>
          <p>Believe me, in a large organization, I have some experience with large organizations, it is not easy to achieve this sort of results. This to me, and you might well disagree with me on this point, but this to me is much more relevant to any figure that I could give you, and that in any case, I would be highly reluctant to give you, for many reasons, concerning the potential benefits of these renewals.</p>
          <p>Now, I leave the difficult questions to Carlo. Thank you, Alberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Enrico, very kind of you. So, the &#x2013; if you can go to page 49 looking at funding needs for our group, the real point is that in 2013 we will have &#x20AC;30 billion of retail bonds to be replaced. Retail bond for us, it is not a problem at all. As I told you, there could be the possibility us reaching a sum of these &#x20AC;30 billion into term deposit, shortening the maturity. So, the real point for next year will be to define what could be the amount of term deposits and retail bonds within this &#x20AC;30 billion of needs. &#x20AC;9 billion of wholesale funding for us, it is not a problem and we are in a position to make extra funding also this year. In any case, &#x20AC;40 billion is the amount of excess of medium-term funding that we have according to our Net Stable Funding Ratio. So, we have a lot of flexibility looking at these maturities for next year.</p>
          <p>Looking at term deposits or the amount of term deposit and the cost of term deposit, our cost is for sure lower than the cost of our competitors, but it is the same also for the state deposit and for corporate deposit. So, all our funding structure is below the cost of our competitors. It is related to our very strong power in the market and also the flight to quality that it is also happening in Italy.</p>

First one, would you expect any stress test exercise for Italian banks in the near term in order to improve the transparency at the sector level that you said you made a point of doing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we do not &#x2013; can you repeat, Muriel? Sorry, we &#x2013; the line was a bit disturbed, we do not understand your question. Sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, the question is, would you expect any stress test exercise for Italian banks in the near term in order to improve the transparency at the sector level, as you said that disclosure was an important point for your company?</p>
          <p>And the second question was on liability management exercise. As you said, you've cleverly used them. And I was wondering, given the changes that you've made to your tiers in the latest exchange, whether you would consider doing similar amendments to your Tier 1s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, I do not expect any additional stress test in the year to come. I don't think there was a sensitivity for that or that we were close to a need for that. And if there were one, we would feel quite comfortable about that. Second question, we leave it to Carlo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Very briefly, on LTRO, what are your thoughts in terms of potential repaying? I know that the timing for repaying for the LTRO one is going to start soon, especially in light of your liquidity positions? Or is it too early to talk about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it is not early to talk about because it is only a cost effective decision. So, the real point is the amount of cost that we can pay on commercial papers and other funding sources for the timing in which it is possible to repay the LTRO. At this moment, we &#x2013; it is absolutely our convenience to maintain the LTRO. As you know, LTRO for us is not a funding instrument, but it is only a cost-effective way of managing our liability side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Provided that actually short-term paper issuance or short-term paper remains more expensive, as is likely, you're going to keep it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are increasing our commercial paper and certificate of deposits with wholesale investors, but the total amount of cost at this moment it is already higher than the LTRO.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you. And so whether you'll be reducing, for example, your portfolio of sovereign paper, that will not have a direct impact on the LTRO per se?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reduction in the government bond portfolio could be the way in which we can repay the LTRO at the end of the period. Otherwise, we will decide according to our commercial papers funding.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just one quick follow-up on Carlo's question. How much of the risk-weighted asset premium of the risk-weight of Italian banks do you think could be due to the higher incidence of problematic loans versus European banks? And how much of that could be due to differences in reporting on what is a problematic loan?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say that your question, though, is quite valid and intriguing. The only thing is that, if I may make a suggestion, it would be to ask the Italian regulator which has the database and the model.

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Difficult to say because this could be related to provisions and to capital. So, it could be a mix, could be something 2 or 3 percentage points, but I have no scientific way to demonstrate. So, it is something that we have to check in the next &#x2013; future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. It's Azzurra from Citi. I just have a quick question on the deposit because I've seen an increase in the deposit number in this quarter. And I guess most of it is coming from the corporate division, if I look at the data correctly, mostly from repo and some current account. And I was wondering whether you can comment a bit on the deposit trend and the fact that maybe given the sovereign condition improving, there has been a return to Italian deposit. Could you elaborate a bit on this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, increase in this quarter is related to both retail and corporate division. Retail, it is mainly related to current accounts and term deposits. And with the corporate division, it's related to corporate deposits and to repos with institutional investors. So, it is something that we consider absolutely a point of strength for the group.</p>
