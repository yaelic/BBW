        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome to Priceline's fourth quarter conference call.  I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan and Matt Tynan, Senior Vice President of Finance.  I will make some opening remarks, Dan will give a detail financial review, and then I will sum up.  After the prepared portion, we will take questions.</p>
          <p>Priceline reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $2.3 billion, up 53% year over year.  Pro forma net income was $102 million, or $1.99 per share up $0.54 versus the prior year.  Fourth quarter results surpassed First Call consensus estimates of $1.68 per share and our guidance for the quarter.  Top line growth for the international businesses accelerated as we compared to weak results in last year's fourth quarter due to the global recession.  For the full year Priceline reported gross booking of $9.3 billion, up 26% from 2008, and pro forma net income per share of $8.52, a 43% increase over 2008.</p>
          <p>Growth rates for international business increased during the quarter, with 70% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis. Growth rates benefited from weak comps and stabilizing ADR trends and cancellation trends.  International gross bookings benefited from growth in new markets, growth in hotel supply and results from Agoda.  Booking.com's worldwide hotel supply platform is now approximately 78,000 hotels in 76 countries.  During 2009, we made substantial investments in distribution in our online channels while maintaining reasonable efficiencies.  Agoda also reported improving growth rates resulting in improved merchant growth rates on a consolidated basis.</p>
          <p>We have also continued to work on sharing supply, customers and best practices among our brands around the world.  For example, Booking.com supply has been the primary source of European hotels for Priceline.com customers for some time and we recently began to test showing Booking.com North American hotels to Priceline.com customers as well.  Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 21% in the fourth quarter, due primarily to growth in sales of opaque and retail hotel room night reservations, retail airline tickets and vacation packages.  Domestic merchant gross bookings, which include opaque services and retail merchant hotels, continued to grow at attractive rates despite year-over-year declines in opaque airline tickets and rental car days tied primarily to declining capacity.</p>
          <p>Opaque and retail hotel room night reservations growth continued at impressive rates, as our hotel partners continued to use promotional pricing to drive demand in retail channels and used our opaque services to bolster occupancy.  In summary, the business performed well in the fourth quarter and I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Joe. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010.  As we highlighted when we announced our third quarter results, the latter half of 2008 was significantly impacted by weakening global economic conditions.  And as a result, our comps were easier for the latter half of 2009.  These easier comps helped us deliver sequential increases in our quarterly growth rates in gross booking dollars and hotel room nights for each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009 as compared to the prior year.  The easier comp for fourth quarter 2009 resulted in strong unit growth rates, favorable FX impact and more moderate ADR decreases versus earlier periods of 2009.</p>
          <p>During our Q3 earnings call, we highlighted our assumption that the latter half of Q4 2009 would be more challenging since we'd seen a marked improvement in our business fundamentals during the latter half of Q4 2008, which would therefore result in a tougher comp.  Our performance in the latter half of 2009 exceeded our assumptions, propelled particularly by outstanding performance for our international business.  Hotel room nights booked grew by 60% in fourth quarter versus last year.</p>
          <p>Gross booking dollars grew by 53% for the fourth quarter after applying the negative impact of lower average prices and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates.  ADRs for our international hotel service were down by about 1% versus Q4 2008 and were down by about 7% for our domestic hotel service.  Although still a headwind, the ADR trends have improved from the decreases that were posted earlier in 2009.  FX rates were basically in line with the assumption used for guidance.  However, when comparing our results to the prior year, FX rates provided a favorable impact of the first time since Q3 2008.  The average exchange rates for the euro and the pound versus the dollar were up by 12% and 4%, respectively, in fourth quarter of 2009 versus fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In summary, room night growth and ADRs were favorable to the assumptions used for guidance, resulting in performance that exceeded the top end of our range of guidance in all key operating metrics from gross bookings to EPS.  Gross profit was $313 million and grew 53% as compared to prior year.  Our domestic business generated gross profit of $91 million, which represented a 16% growth versus prior year.</p>
          <p>Gross profit for our international operations amounted to $222 million and grew by 75% as compared to the prior year.  Total operating expenses were favorable to guidance, as expenses for personnel, G&amp;A and sales and marketing came in below our estimates.  The variances for personnel and G&amp;A relate mainly to the timing of hiring for our international business.  The variance in sales and marketing is the result of lower than assumed bad debt expense, driven by continued improvement in collection results for Booking.com.  On a year-over-year basis, we increased pro forma operating expenses by 32% as we continued to invest in marketing, people, and new offices to support the growth of our business.  We recorded below the line expenses in the quarter of about $2.5 million, which is in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>In summary, pro forma EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $133 million, which exceeded our forecast of 98 to $108 million and represents 75% growth versus prior year.  In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately 146 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2009, which represents an 82% increase versus prior year.  We spent about $5 million on CapEx in the quarter and repaid $75 million of convertible debt principal, bringing us to an outstanding debt balance $196 million at year end.  This leaves us at year end with cash and marketable securities of about $604 million in excess of our outstanding debt balance.  We also have our $175 million revolving credit facility that is undrawn and doesn't expire until September 2012.  We received conversion notices during first quarter 2010 for an additional $98 million of principal amount of convertible debt.  After processing these conversions in the first quarter of 2010, we will be left with outstanding convertible debt of about $98 million.</p>
          <p>As we've highlighted in the past, our fully diluted share count, particularly as it relates to equivalent shares outstanding for our convertible debt, tends to vary based upon on our average stock price.  We include equivalent shares in our fully diluted share count for the theoretical number of shares that would be issued if our outstanding convertible notes were actually converted.  Since our average stock price was substantially higher in the fourth quarter of 2009 than the same period in 2008, our diluted share count is also higher in Q4 2009 versus prior year.</p>
          <p>For first quarter 2010 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 42 to 48%, with domestic gross bookings growing by approximately 10 to 15%.  We expect international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 65 to 73% as compared to last year and to grow on a local currency basis by approximately 56 to 64%.</p>
          <p>We expect our bookings growth rate versus prior year to continue to be hampered by decreases in ADRs.  Our first quarter guidance is based on an assumption that the rate of decline in our ADRs will be flat to slightly improved versus the rates of decline that we saw in Q4.  Our forecast assumes that exchange rates remain at the same $1.38 per euro and $1.58 per British pound as yesterday's closing rates.  This would yield euro and pound average FX rates for the first quarter that are up by approximately 7% and 11% respectively as compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter net earnings from any deterioration in the euro or pound between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue and gross profit.  We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 23 to 27% and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 50%.  For Q1 operating expenses, we are targeting consolidated advertising expenses of approximately 118 to $121 million, with approximately 90% of that amount being spent for online advertising.</p>
          <p>We expect sales and marketing expense of between 22 and $25 million.  We expect personnel costs excluding stock based compensation to come in between 38 and $40 million.  We expect G&amp;A expenses of approximately 16 to $18 million.  We expect information technology costs of approximately six million and depreciation and amortization expense, excluding acquisition amortization, of approximately $4.5 million.  We expect total below the line negative impacts of approximately $0.5 million, which is comprised primarily of foreign exchange hedging expense and net interest expense.  Pro forma EBITDA is expected to range between 97 and $107 million, and we are targeting pro forma fully diluted EPS of approximately $1.54 to $1.64 per share, which represents 46% growth year-over-year at the midpoint.</p>
          <p>Our pro forma EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax of approximately 17 to $20 million, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax in the U.S.  Our pro forma EPS guidance is based upon a pro forma diluted share count of approximately 51 million shares, which is based on yesterday's closing stock price of $211.21 per share.  This is significantly higher than our share count of 47.2 million shares in Q1 2009 due to year-over-year increase in our primary outstanding share count resulting mainly from shares issued due to debt conversions over the past year and also due to the impact of higher share prices on fully diluted shares related to our convertible notes.  As a result of those early conversions, the difference between primary and fully diluted share count has been narrowing.  Given the reduction in our outstanding convertible debt balance I just discussed, our fully diluted share count will be less impacted by changes in our stock price going forward.</p>
          <p>As for expected GAAP results, we expect to report a GAAP EPS of $1.04 to $1.14 per share.  The difference between our GAAP and pro forma results is driven by pro forma adjustments to exclude stock-based compensation, acquisition related amortization, non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt discount, non-cash gains or losses related to debt conversions and certain income tax expenses, all of which are non-cash in nature, to arrive at pro forma earnings.  We also intend to adjust pro forma results to exclude charges or benefits, if any, related to hotel occupancy tax judgments, rulings or settlements.  Although we are not providing guidance beyond Q1 2010, I would like to highlight that the strong results and sequential unit growth we have achieved for the past several quarters is to some extent driven by the relatively easy comps caused by the impact of the global recession on the prior year periods.</p>
          <p>We believe that our comps become progressively more challenging throughout each quarter of 2010.  We have seen deceleration in unit growth rates thusfar in Q1 2010 as compared to Q4 both domestically and internationally and this deceleration is factored into the guidance we just gave.  More difficult comps in tandem with the sheer size of the business make it highly likely that we will return to a pattern of decelerating unit growth rates.  Our guidance assumes that macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular remain relatively unchanged.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back to over to Jeff for some closing comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dan.  We are pleased with the performance of our global business in 2009.  Despite a very difficult economic and competitive environment, we were able to make significant investments in building our business while delivering earnings growth to our shareholders.  Moreover, growth rates improved during the year as we began to comp against weak year ago results.  We enter 2010 with more stability in unit pricing, but with continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Economic growth has returned in many regions, but unemployment remains high and ballooning government deficits threaten to destabilize currencies and rekindle inflation.  We believe our growth rates and those of our industry will decelerate as the year proceeds and we begin to compare against improved 2009 results, particularly in the second half.  Our competition will also anniversary the conversion benefit of last year's fee cuts and the earnings benefit associated with cuts to their marketing spends as the year proceeds.  We believe our businesses are well positioned to continue building our brands and offerings and to compete effectively in our global markets.</p>
          <p>We will now take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you gentlemen.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question comes from Aaron Kessler of Kaufman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks guys. Good quarter.  A couple questions on, mainly on your advertising costs. Continue to see good leverage within the online advertising segment.  Are you still seeing more direct traffic on your Booking.com property as similar to Q3 and also do you continue to see a trend of maybe European hotels selecting maybe just one travel agency?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the first question we continue to see good levels of direct traffic to all of our websites around the world. And it's a very important part of our task to try to build our brands and promote that direct traffic.  With respect to hotels working with just one online agency, that's not something that we necessarily have promoted or is seen as a trend. And again, I think especially when economic conditions still remain relatively weak and occupancy rates are very much below their historical highs, that hotels will tend to work with multiple distribution channels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys.  Just two quick questions. The domestic bookings guidance seemed a little bit of a deceleration moreso than you've been experiencing of late. Is that just conservative or is there anything that's kind of one time-ish that's going on that is driving that deceleration? And then on the marketing guidance for 1Q, it assumes a pretty large step up from the 4Q run rate. Can you help us better understand where that incremental spend is going and is it, is that a sustainable uptick or is that just some front end loading of the marketing in the first half?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the perspective of domestic bookings guidance, I think that range is straight down the middle. It represents, I think, the kind of deceleration that you would expect to see given the size of the business and given the industry growth rates and at least what the one competitor who has reported has been saying. So, I think there's no one timer there. And I mentioned that growth rates are expected to decelerate going into the year, and so to me that's all fairly consistent.  With respect to the marketing spend, the step-up is essentially seasonal in nature.  The businesses tend to spend, particularly in online channels, in advance of the major booking upticks that you see in the spring and in the summer.  So that's really more seasonal than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a year-over-year basis, Ross, the total advertising spend is pretty much in line with prior year as a percentage of gross profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Jeff, it looks like you have a growing and accelerating lead in Europe right now based on your bookings numbers.  Are you thinking about any kind of investments as far as marketing or loyalty points to help kind of lock that in longer term?  And then secondly, are you seeing any volatility in Southern Europe related to some of the financial crisis issues down there?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to loyalty programs, as I mentioned earlier, our first task is to improve our product and our offerings and our functionality on the website to encourage people to come back and hopefully come back to us directly.  We don't have any intention of starting a loyalty or a points program or anything of that nature in Europe, although Agoda.com does have a loyalty program in Asia.  And I'm sorry, the second question?  Oh, so with respect to the recent volatility in currencies in Europe, I think that's really more reflective of a concern as to what would happen in the future if there was a default, a sovereign default by Greece or a disruption of that nature. It's not something that we at least have seen reflected in the numbers we've seen to date in terms of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Ingrid Chun of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon.  So we believe that you're the low cost operator in Europe.  How do you think about Booking.com's fee structure currently and have you seen any competitors pricing as aggressively to try to win share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's happened in the last year is that hotels have gotten less focused on margin and more focused on getting people into the hotel. Going back three or four years ago, margin and distribution cost was much more salient concern for the hotels because they had high levels of occupancy and yields were going up, but in the current environment that really hasn't been a front burner issue.  On the other hand, we have seen at least Expedia buying Venere and going out with an agency model that presumably could have some distribution cost efficiencies for some hotels, so that may be an example of trying to compete on the distribution cost side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jeff, I think you referred to Agoda as having improving growth rates. And just to be specific are you referring to Q4 year-over-year gross bookings growth rates for Agoda faster than what you've had in the prior quarter?  And could you also just comment upon how you think of the risk related to your access to hotel inventory with the eventual resurgence in corporate travel both in the U.S. and in Europe?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, you're right. That is what I said -- that gross booking growth rates improved for Agoda and I was referring to sequential improvement in their growth rates.  With respect to inventory concerns, and we've all said this a number of times, I think that our businesses have performed pretty well in times of high occupancy and increasing yields. And in fact increasing yields is a tailwind for gross bookings. Having said that, there's no question that promotional pricing helped to spur leisure travel last year, not just for us but for others in the space, and that the absence of promotional pricing could have an impact on fundamental demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks. Within Agoda, can you talk about what countries you're seeing the most strength in. And then second, would you be willing to share your thinking on how travel meta-search sites like Kayak impact OTAs and does this trend change your strategy at all as far as how you'll drive direct traffic? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess with respect to Agoda, we've consistently seen their business do well in Asian countries outside of China and India, in particular. That's been their focus. Thailand is a big market for Agoda.  With respect to meta-search, I think all we can say at this point in time is that for the hotel business, which is our principal business, meta-search is a growing but still a very, very small player in the space.  You have seen some portals like Bing on MSN start to look at meta-search as a way to try to address specific traffic searching for hotels and airline tickets.  We participate in those channels and we participate in other meta-search channels and we're advertisers on them. And our expectation is if those channels grow in their significance, that we will continue to participate, and I can't think of a reason why we should lose share to other competitors in that kind of environment versus the environment we're operating in today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Your next question comes from Imran Khan of JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi.  Thank you for taking my questions.  Two questions. One on the airline ticket side, it seems like unit growth rate decelerated from 30% to 16% and seems like the sequential drop was bigger than what we had last two years. Trying to better understand that. And secondly, in terms of as the hotels' occupancy increases or the corporate travel picks up, how aggressively do you think the international hotels, small hotels will compete for the keyword pricing and how should we think about the advertising cost as a percentage of your gross profit dollar?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, we're not doing a good job of one question a person, but it's no problem, Imran. Dan, why don't you take the first one and I'll do the second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Imran, airline ticket sales have decelerated from Q3 to Q4. I think that's reflective of a pretty weak overall travel environment out there for airline tickets.  And then we're probably seeing some impact also of the fee cuts by our competitors, which are maybe causing our growth rate to decelerate. But it's still strong performance in an overall environment where airline ticket sales are pretty soft.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would add in there, I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that opaque tickets were actually down year-over-year.  So that obviously is a headwind in terms of overall ticket growth.  With respect to international hotels getting more aggressive in competing for keywords, I would expect over time that hotels will get more involved in trying to directly market their properties over the internet. And that's something certainly that's happened in the United States and I would expect that to happen elsewhere. But for small, independent hotels that make up the majority of the international markets in which we do business, they just don't have the resources and the expertise to aggressively market in a lot of different channels. It's very hard for them to get distribution through affiliates. It's very hard for them to do search marketing in multiple languages.  So I think there's a very significant limit to how aggressive they can be in trying to market directly in online channels.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question.  Jeff, actually two questions. One is how do you compare and contrast Booking.com's results in Priceline.com, maybe in terms of click-through rate, conversion or percentage of gross bookings in U.S.?  And secondly, I will be curious to know about your views on private sale business. This is a new trend we are seeing and many of these private sale businesses are offering travel review services?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, with respect to the first question, we really don't get into disclosing details about things like click-through rates for any of our business or how one compares to the other because just it's too competitively sensitive.  With respect to the private sale businesses, we're certainly aware that a number of businesses are out there now with limited time private sales.  I think that those businesses are, they're good companies and they're good businesses, but they're really in a different space than we're in. And it's very hard to scale a business when you've got a limited time sale on four or five hotels. Even if you sold every single hotel and every hotel room in each of those hotels, it wouldn't represent a sizable business compared to the size of online travel agents or the size of the advertising businesses you see on TripAdvisor and some of the other sites.  So I think it is going to be, they'll be good businesses but they'll probably be relatively small in size compared to the kinds of businesses that we're operating here.</p>

          <p>You could probably say, Sandeep, also, that we've somewhat participated in that market through our Name Your Own Price business.  So we've got private sales going on. Maybe not private, but we've got sales going on every day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Could you tell us in Europe what your ADRs are in a same store basis or what's the change is on a same store basis and also what the ADRs &#x2013; how the ADRs of your new hotel connections compare with the existing models that you have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said per ADRs, Michael, was that for Q4 we saw a decrease year-over-year of about 1%. And for our Q1, we're projecting that that rate of decline will stay flat or maybe improve slightly.  We don't give an actual ADR rate, but given the size and breadth of the Booking.com business, it's pretty representative of what you'd see out there in the hotel market for Europe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Ron Josey calling in for Doug and thanks for taking our question.  Another question similar on ADRs, but on 1Q guidance, I believe the underlying assumption is some stability in ADRs per continued improvement, but still year-over-year decreases with 1Q be flat to slightly improved sequentially.  So I guess my question is what do you believe will be needed for ADRs to turn positive in 2010 given these improving trends and international ADRs, as you just mentioned, decreased just 1% and domestic improved sequentially, but still down 7%? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess to get back into the black, we're pretty close on the international business at down 1% and projecting flat to slight improvement. On the domestic side, we're probably going to need to see a rebound in corporate travel to help and just demand in general to help drive those ADRs positive.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot.  I will just ask one question.  I'm wondering in light of what I would characterize as somewhat limited stock repurchase activity over the last couple of years, 17 million in '09 and 4.5 million in the prior year.  I'm wondering how you're thinking about your excess cash position at this point, if buyback should be something that you're going to be more involved in or if maybe you could just give us a general sense of how you're thinking about cash in general?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our outlook and approach on that has been fairly consistent in the sense that we remain potential purchasers of our stock.  We've been opportunistic about it in the past and we have repurchased stock in size when we did our last couple of converts. And you're right that that was a while ago, but that remains an alternative for using our cash balances.  We also have been active over the years in the M&amp;A market and continue to evaluate those opportunities. And that's another potential use of cash.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>And then lastly, we've used cash over the last year and we're using some in this year to repay our debt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Just wondering about your taxes. It looks like your deficit is now down in the 450 million range. What can happen if you use up your deficit, what could that change your tax rate. Any long-term changes there?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it looks like you have accumulated deficit on the balance sheet or your NOL, either way?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay.  Well the accumulated deficit on the balance sheet is retained earnings, but our asset that we've classified on the balance sheet or our NOL represents the amount that we've given recognition to. There's another amount that we have not yet booked. We wouldn't book it until if and when we use it, but the amount that we have out there is still pretty sizable. It's 1.4 billion of total NOL that we have available to us.  So that's going to continue to shield our income here in the U.S. from having tax liability for the foreseeable future.</p>
