          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS H1 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Louis Gallois, our CEO and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about one hour and 15 minutes. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>It is also webcast to access on our homepage.  We've set of special banner for H1 2009 earnings. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was e-mailed to you this early morning with slides which we will now walk through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor Statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now to Louis Gallois.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Nathalie. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our H1 call. We enter the second half of 2009 with an economy that remains extremely tough. It is still too soon to say that we have reached the bottom of the current recession, despite some first signs of hope. Certain trends are of concern, most particularly the impact of rising fuel costs on our customers and the current trend of the weakening dollar. We will come back on that in the next minutes.</p>
          <p>If we measure ourselves against the goals we laid out for what we knew to be a difficult 2009, then EADS doing well. Our criteria for success are principally the protection of cash, stabilization of margins and then showing that the EADS is competitively positioned for the next quarter.  Our business is performing to deliver in these respects.</p>
          <p>Deliveries are holding up so far despite the downturn. Taking into account postponements and cancellations our backlog still sustains the current level operation rates. This relative strength combined with the performance from our maintenance institutional operations have delivered revenues of more than &#x20AC; 20 billion, although decreasing as expected our cash and operating profit have end up well largely thanks to our increasingly disciplined financial management</p>
          <p>Recent wins in the military and security areas, most probably our Saudi security contract &#x2013; most notably, sorry, our Saudi security contract show that organic growth can continue despite a difficult macroeconomic climate. The biggest question mark coming out of H1 of course is the A400M.  The most recent signs that governments will support the continuance of this program are encouraging, and I believe that all the participating governments want to ensure the success of these critical efforts.</p>
          <p>But it is important for me to stress one important point from an EADS perspective. The A400M can only be a success if we and our customers can agree to a rational and more balanced business model based on adequate funding, realistic milestones and a trustful and transparent cooperation. Statements from our customers are encouraging as I said, but the negotiation phase which is extended until the end of the year is expected to be tough.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our group highlights of H1 2009, but before we do please take a look at our Safe Harbor statement on Page 2.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Page 4.  I'll do the same. We continue to actively monitor our commercial aircraft deliveries. At Airbus, we continue to have overbooking for 2010 and beyond and the quality of our commercial aircraft backlog has improved in the short term as we manage the deferrals. But the alliance profitability and the ability to raise financing is a real concern.</p>
          <p>Delivery performance at both Airbus and Eurocopter was strong in the first half. At Airbus, the under proportional phasing effect on deliveries seen in the first quarter has been countered in the second quarter, with first half deliveries now exceeding those of a year ago. Deliveries of Eurocopter remain at high level but are experiencing some pressure on the civil side. Ariane 5 continues to mark commercial results with its 45th launch in July.</p>
          <p>Our non-Airbus businesses continued to deliver results.  The EBIT contribution for the first half of almost &#x20AC; 400 million provides stability to the Group against the downturn. These businesses continue the organic expansion. Hans Peter will share the financial performance of the Group with you in more detail shortly. However, I would like to highlight that our net cash position remains solid at &#x20AC; 1.1 billion.  Customer financing remains insignificant at the end of June.  In addition, please bear in mind the seasonality of our defense and institutional business, whose top, bottom line and cash performance tends to be back loaded.</p>
          <p>Let's talk a bit more about the A400M on Page 5. Firstly, a short update on the development phase of the aircraft which has made considerable progress in the last month from a contractual as well as a technical perspective. The first development aircraft is progressing toward first flight, currently being prepared for enginization, the second aircraft undergoing systems testing, while the third is now in the final assembly. The first version of the redesigned FADEC software was delivered by EPI at the end of June and testing has begun.</p>
          <p>The flight test bed for the engine is performing satisfactorily with 12 flights performed and around 35 hours of total flight time.  It has explored the full C-130 flight envelope because you know the flight test bed is a C-130, C-130 flight envelope without finding significant snags. As you are aware, the launch nation's defense ministers met on the 24th of July. We welcome the ministers' statement that the A400M is their preferred choice for future air transport and their agreement to enter into detailed negotiations up to the end of the year. We are fully committed to finding an agreement that is technically and contractually acceptable to both sides.  The absence of a major triggering event in the quarter to enhance visibility on either the industrial or commercial situation of the program means that the early stage accounting treatment under IFRS 11 is maintained.</p>
          <p>The negative net EBIT impact of &#x20AC; 191 million for the first half does not reflect a complete new estimate of the cost of completion which continues to constitute the single biggest financial exposure to the Group.  This chart represents an estimation of the overall costs deemed to be irrecoverable as revenues as well as the foreign exchange adjustment on future costs.</p>
          <p>Now Hans Peter will talk to you through the Group financial in more detail, Page 7.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louis, and good morning everybody and a very early good morning to the ones in the U.S. I will lead you through the H1 financials now.</p>
          <p>The first half results demonstrate a strong order book of &#x20AC; 391 billion that provides a level of stability through a period of commercial uncertainty.  The backlog has been reduced by &#x20AC; 4.3 billion coming from the revaluation impact at the closing rate of $141 versus euro at the end of June versus 139 at the end of December. Revenues remained in line with the first half 2008.</p>
          <p>The increase in revenues at Astrium and Eurocopter were partially offset by slightly lower revenues at Airbus. Revenues generated by defense activities has increased versus the first half 2008, which included the A400M Power On milestone</p>
          <p>Our defense order book remains stable. EBIT before one-off was lower versus the first half 2008. It mainly relates to Airbus. Higher volumes and Power 8 savings were more than offset by the degradation of the hedge rates, price deterioration on commercial deliveries and increasing business support, i.e. non-series activity costs.</p>
          <p>Order intake for the period was lower across all divisions except for Astrium, which booked the second batch PB of 35 Ariane 5 launchers worth more than &#x20AC; 4 billion. The first half 2008 included strong inflowing orders from Airbus, Eurocopter and the FSTA order intake.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to Slide 8, where we can look at the underlying performance of the business. The margin calculated using EBIT before one-off is 6.4% at Group level, adjusting for revenues for the recoverable part of the costs of the A400M program, which is approximately 300 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now consider the list of non-recurring items. We have explained the negative net impact to the EBIT of the continuation of early stage accounting. On this slide, we present the gross figure excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange of &#x20AC; 107 million that is contained here in the line revaluation of all LMCs.</p>
          <p>To mitigate the volatility of our earnings caused by short-term fluctuations from foreign exchange, we increased the preciseness this quarter in estimating the future FX impact associated with our LMC provisions.  This revised estimate of the rates takes into account historical rates of pre-delivery payments, cash in and costs incurred, as well as average U.S dollar and pound forward rates over the next five years to come and the average hedge rate secured in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Spot rate is still applied to remaining open exposure. Discount rates have been adjusted consistently. With this new estimate, the loss making contract provisions have been revalued at a compounded rate of $1.35 per euro.  This long-term estimate is revised at least once a year and should be less dependent on the fluctuation of spot rates. The resulting EBIT impact of this change in estimate is a negative one-time effect of &#x20AC; 26 million contained in the land revaluation of all LMCs.</p>
          <p>In H1 2009, the dollar mismatch impact coming from the reversal of pre-delivery payments that were cashed in at a historical rate and the balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our EBIT result of &#x20AC; 245 million.</p>
          <p>Now to Slide 9.  R&amp;D increased slightly versus last year driven predominantly by increases at Eurocopter. However, you should bear in mind that R&amp;D is expected to ramp up to around &#x20AC; 3 billion by the end of the year. The interest result is lower than last year.  The change comes from the decline in interest rates.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the other financial result improved by &#x20AC; 215 million.  This improvement is mainly due to revaluation of FX, so foreign exchange cash assets, partially offset by a negative valuation of the premium paid for the options. The reduction in earnings versus the first half 2008 has led to a lower tax expense. The tax rate is at 31% in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Now to Slide 10, where we see that due to the evolution in U.S. dollar rates the mark-to-market value of our hedge book is now up to &#x20AC; 1.3 billion compared to December 2008. As we already stated the volatility of the dollar and the risk pricing of financial institutions make hedging more difficult or unattractive with a number of banks. However despite that we have continued our hedging activity.</p>
          <p>While $7.9 billion of hedges matured, $9 billion of forward contracts were added in the first half at an average rate of $1.34 per euro. Since we began to restructure some of the 2011 euro call options, we added last summer the new forward contracts include $2.8 billion of options restructuring at more favorable rates. We sold back $1.9 billion of options.</p>
          <p>Our hedge book therefore decreased slightly from $68.1 billion at the end of December to $64.5 billion at the end of June. Going forward, we will continue with a combination of restructuring and implementing new forwards to cover our eligible exposure according to our strict internal procedures.</p>
          <p>Now to the free cash flow on Slide 11, where we see that free cash flow is in line with expectations for the first half 2009. The significant changes versus last year come from the working capital and gross cash flow from operations.  The gross cash flow from operations for the first half was &#x20AC; 1.4 billion. The change versus last year represents the lower EBIT before one-off for the first half and less favorable hedging volume.</p>
          <p>The deterioration in the working capital comes from a strong increase in inventory at Airbus, reflecting the ramp-up on the A380, but a low level of A380 deliveries to the end of June, in addition, to a mismatch between the single aisle and long range production rates and deliveries in the first half. This mismatch effect should reduce by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Pre-delivery payment inflows were robust in H1 2009. The level of advances received remained in line with the 2008 level, which benefited from higher commercial activity at Airbus and a strong level of advances for the tanker order intake.  The increase in advances in Astrium linked to the order intake in the first half was partially offset by the retention of advances received from OCCAR for the A400M.</p>
          <p>The A400M cash flow weighed on the first half by &#x20AC; 400 billion. Net customer financing remained insignificant in the first half at around &#x20AC; 200 million. The cash outflow for customer financing should be up to around &#x20AC; 1 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Investing activities consumed around &#x20AC; 600 million reflecting an increase in capital expenditure as investment ramp-up on the A350 program and a cash inflow from the disposal of our aerostructures activities at Filton. Capital expenditure is expected to reach around &#x20AC; 2.4 billion by year end.</p>
          <p>We will now dig into each division's performance, and Louis will start with Airbus.</p>

          <p>Thanks you, Hans Peter. Page 13.  The former Military Transport Aircraft division and the business unit EFW have been integrated into the Airbus segment with effect the 1st of January. The Airbus segment also contains the completed aerostructures reorganization, Aerolia and Premium AEROTECH, including the Augsburg activity transferred from DS. 2008 figures have been restated to reflect these changes except for Augsburg.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military is currently reported within the Airbus segment under its former perimeter MTAD, but as an interim measure only. As the integration progresses from an accounting standpoint, this presentation will be updated accordingly.</p>
          <p>Onto the performance in the quarter.  A lower level of commercial activities reflected the net order intake. However, 58 firm orders recorded in Le Bourget and the further 69 commitments shows that there is still some appetite from &#x2013; for commercial customers in spite of the current climate.</p>
          <p>We booked 90 gross orders, 68 net on commercial programs in the first half and 5 medium and light meter aircrafts. In the first half 2008 Airbus Military recorded strong order intake for FSTA in Saudi Arabia. Airbus achieved record number of deliveries for the first half.  254 commercial aircraft were delivered with an insignificant level of customer financing. All deliveries qualified for revenue recognition.</p>
          <p>We will look at the first half in more detail for the segment on Slide 14. Airbus commercial first half revenues were in line with the last year. The higher number of deliveries in the half were offset by lower A400M revenues, a negative impact from foreign exchange and price deterioration, notably from the A330 deliveries. In addition, our freighter conversion and OCCAR business have seen a significant deterioration in business activity.  The reduction in EBIT is also driven by the negative impact from foreign exchange effects, price deterioration, higher support activity costs and the charge booked against the A400M in program.  A380 costs are still higher than expected.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D costs are in line with last year, as a ramp up in A350 was offset by rundown in A380. The anticipated increase is expected to come in the later part of the year. Airbus continues its focus on internationalization. The first A320 aircraft assembled at the final assembly line in China was delivered on time in the quarter.  Airbus Military revenues from tanker and medium and light activity were higher than in the H1 2008, but they were more than offset by the lower revenues booked on the A400M program compared to last year.</p>
          <p>I remind you that we had a milestone on last year, on the first six months of 2008. The EBIT was weighted down by a weaker mix in the medium and light aircraft deliveries, as well as the absence of the Power On milestone booked in the 2008, as I was just saying. The FSTA continues to progress well, marked by the achievement of the critical design review this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now onto the Eurocopter slide, for Page 14, Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The trend of bookings over the first half has shown a significant slowdown with 138 net bookings registered versus 475 last year. Current booking are showing decreases of up to 70% across the civil product ranges versus the first half '08. The decline in civil market activity is confirmed by continuing cancellations, particularly on light helicopters. Until now, nearly all terminations have been successfully reallocated, however there is increasing pressure on this segment. Production levels are being closely monitored and adapted accordingly.</p>
          <p>Orders this quarter include several new military contracts, 24 EC635s for Iraq, six EC725s for Mexico and five for France. The order book stands at &#x20AC; 14 billion at the end of June. Eurocopter delivered lower volumes with 236 deliveries in the first half, slightly down from 2008 level of 254 helicopters.  However an increase in customer services activities and favorable mix in civil activities led to a revenue increase of 6%.</p>
          <p>EBIT fell by 5%, weighed down by higher R&amp;D due to strong efforts on innovation and technology upgrades and a negative foreign exchange impact which is in Eurocopter's case 12 million.  In addition, margin pressure on the NH90 program reflecting ongoing qualification and acceptance complexities weighed on the second quarter. Eurocopter reinforced its partnerships in China with the purchase of an additional 13% in the Chinese helicopter maintenance center, C-GAMEC, which is belonging to COHC General Aviation Maintenance and Engineering Company</p>
          <p>Following the investment in EuroHeli in the first quarter, international expansion in Japan continued to advance with the acquisition of 60% of All Nippon Airways helicopter maintenance activity.</p>
          <p>Up to Astrium, our space business on Slide 16.  Astrium reported &#x2013; recorded a strong increase in revenues in the first half with the main contribution coming from an increase in navigation and earth observation satellites, the consolidation of Spot Image and an increase in ballistic missile production.  The second quarter revenues included a non-operational positive one-time effect due to a revenue catch up for in orbit incentive schemes on commercial satellites with low margin recognition.</p>
          <p>The EBIT growth for the first half was driven by the growth in earth observation services from the consolidation of Spot Image, a ramp up in productivity on the M-51 program, partially offset by an unfavorable translation effect from the declining British pound to euro foreign exchange rate. Astrium booked another communication satellite, Atlantic Bird 7 for Eutelsat. The order book reached &#x20AC; 15.6 billion at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Astrium services achieved the Skynet 5 full operational service milestone in the second quarter on time and on quality. Paradigm is the first commercial operator in the world to deliver military communication services with its Skynet 5 system releasing all pre-delivery risks for the system.  The French DGA has accepted the Spirale space-based early warning system demonstrator including ground control and mission segments, paving the way for operational systems.</p>
          <p>Now onto the defense business on Page 17.  I would like to remind you here that the aerostructures activity is now consolidated in the Airbus segment. DS reported revenues were stable with the first half &#x2013; in the first half 2008. The revenue growth coming from a ramp up in Eurofighter activity and the consolidation of Plant CML offset the carve-out of aerostructures activity of approximately &#x20AC; 200 million.</p>
          <p>DS EBIT grew by 7% versus H1 2008. The better than expected performance in the second quarter is driven by the increase in volume for Eurofighter and integrated logistics systems, as well as margin improvements in core programs, partially offset by an increase in R&amp;D. This better then expected performance will continue during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The DS order book at the end of June stands at &#x20AC; 16.4 billion. New orders for the quarter were largely driven by export contracts in missiles and defense communication systems. In addition to the win of the national security program for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which is not yet recorded in the order intake, DCS won further secure network contracts.</p>
          <p>In June, DS completed the overall design of the Qatar National Security Shield, the first fully integrated security system in the world. DS highlighted its capabilities in advanced UAV with the conclusion of the risk reduction study delivering a proposal for both development and production to France, Germany and Spain.</p>
          <p>Up to Slide 18, other businesses. I would like to remind you that EFW, our freighter conversion business is now reported as part of the other segment and 2008 figures have been adjusted to reflect this change. In addition, 70% of Socata was sold to DAHER in January. The remaining 30% is consolidated at equity within other businesses.  The significant reduction in the order book since year end is explained by the change in consolidation of Socata, whose backlog is now removed from the other businesses division.</p>
          <p>Revenues were lower year-on-year due to the consolidation parameter changes that offset the successful ramp-up in LUH activity at EADS North America.  EBIT was also lower year-on-year.  The positive cost evolution at Sogerma was offset by negative foreign exchange effects, customer financing related costs at ATR and a weak mix at EADS North America. ATR deliveries were in line with a year ago.  Also customer financing remains difficult.</p>
          <p>12 orders were booked in the first half, the backlog now stands at 151 aircraft. Sogerma has booked another order this quarter with Alitalia for 472 new Solstice seats for Airbus long range aircraft. After the success of LUH program, EADS is reinforcing its presence in the U.S. teaming up with Lockheed to pursue the Army's ARH replacement program.</p>
          <p>And now Louis will comment on our guidance on Page 20.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The first half of 2009 confirms the trends identified at the beginning of the year. The Group's bottom-up analysis of the order book still shows overbooking for the coming years. Nevertheless, this is challenged by the deterioration of the macroeconomic and traffic indicators, even if the negative trend was stopped or slightly reversed recently.</p>
          <p>There is no clear sign of stabilization since traffic and yield deterioration, as well as funding conditions are challenging airlines' financials. Therefore EADS is cautiously monitoring the market, its customer base and its suppliers and continue to apply rolling plan concepts.  Besides the commercial order book, the Group's solid defense and institutional order book provides a certain level of protection and stability.</p>
          <p>EADS expects Airbus to capture up to 300 new gross order in 2009, even if that goal is challenging in the current market environment. Based on the healthy H1 delivery trend, deliveries of 2009 should be at least at the 2008 level, with an assumption of a U.S. dollar rates at US$1 &#x2013; &#x20AC; 1 for US$ 1.39.  EADS revenues should be roughly in line with the 2009 level &#x2013; 2008 level, sorry.</p>
          <p>Under these assumptions, EBIT before one off in the second half of 2009 should be positive, but lower compared for the first half of 2009. Compared to the first six months of the year, it will be negatively impacted mainly by increasing research and development expenses and significant hedge rate deterioration.  EADS R&amp;D expenses should amount to roughly &#x20AC; 3 billion for the full year. On the other side this degradation will be partly offset by lower price deterioration than in H1 and by favorable seasonable effects on part of the business.</p>
          <p>Concerning one off impacts affecting H2, the range and magnitude of the potential A400M program charge is wide.  Finally, A380 ramp-up is progressing and Airbus expect to deliver 14 A380 in 2009. A380 costs are still higher than expected. EADS will review the potential impact of them on the learning curve in H2.</p>
          <p>EADS is raising its free cash flow guidance. EADS is now expected to consume around &#x20AC; 1 billion of free cash flow after customer financing in 2009, not taking into account the A400M program.</p>

          <p>Hello to all of you. Winfried Becker from Oppenheim.  First question is on the Power 8 program.  Maybe Mr. Ring you could quantify the positive impact of all these cost savings coming from Power 8 in the first half EBIT figures? And the second question, accounting related from &#x2013; and related to the A400M, from today's point of view could you foresee when you might come back to the milestone accounting for this program? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Power 8 first, I will not provide you with a precise number, but clearly Power 8 has helped to compensate partially at least price deterioration, non-sale risk and cost deterioration and especially obviously the huge deterioration coming from the hedge rates. So clearly Power 8 delivers. I can give you probably something like the range we are seeing for the end of the year in terms of the delivery on the project. So we anticipate to be somewhere north of $1.8 billion achievement secured and committed until the end of this year. Euro, euro, sorry. Did I say dollar?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, a couple of questions please. Firstly, wondered if I could just ask one around the overbooking that you talk about for 2010 and your confidence around that. I'm not expecting you obviously to give me a delivery number, but can you help just to shape what that overbooking statement is based on? Would that be based on flat deliveries, would that be based on deliveries falling significantly, falling marginally? That's the first question, just to the background for that overbooking.</p>
          <p>Second question is just on the cash flow guidance for the full year 2009, you say it excludes A400M. Do you see actually there could be a significant near-term cash flow impact from A400M? I can see clearly there'll be a P&amp;L effect of contract charges, but can you help me understand why there may be a significant cash effect from A400M in 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first I can take the first question on the prospect for &#x2013; our expectation for deliveries in 2010. We are still overbooked on short range airplanes. You know that we have no overbooking on the A330. On A330, we are comforted with new orders and the delays of the 787. It means that even if we have not &#x2013; we are not overbooked, we have &#x2013; perspectives are not changing our current production rate for the A330 so far.</p>
          <p>On short range overbook, we are still overbooking. We never indicate the number of airplanes we have in overbooking. We are &#x2013; we stick to 34 airplanes per month. So far, you have seen that Boeing is also sticking to its production rate on the 737. A general remark, certainly we are fully aware of the growing difficulties some airlines could face because of traffic and the &#x2013; mostly yield deterioration. But on the other side, we have accepted to defer all of airplanes from 2010 to later years. And it's &#x2013; the consequence is that the portfolio of companies due to receive airplanes in 2010 was improving, and we have &#x2013; I could say that we have a more robust set of airlines due to receive our deliveries in 2010 than it was at the beginning of the year. For that we are not changing so far our expectation on production rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I should probably add, Louis, that the overbooking is geared towards the second half of next year already, which remains simply because we have to be sure, if we customize &#x2013; we start now customizing long range aircraft already that for the first half we can finally deliver an aircraft. So this is what we always call active management of the backlog. So as Louis said, I think it is referred to the current production rate.</p>
          <p>On A400M and the near-term cash flow impact, it is simply that we obviously full speed continue with the work. We are working into our inventories currently. And this was not in the last four months I would say covered by pre-delivery payments, simply because during the first two standstills we had a freeze of the pre-delivery payments. And that explains the roughly 400 million we have seen in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify on that last point, Hans Peter. The guidance for cash flow, you may well see an even lower outflow than a billion in the event of reaching a negotiated settlement on A400 because there'd be a catch up in pre-delivery payments on A400M. Is that correct? Is that what you're saying?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions if I may, the first one around pricing.  Louis, Hans Peter, you both talked about the fact that you expect less price degradation in the second half versus the first half of this year. Can you just give us a bit of an understanding as to what's driving this or what was the reason for the degradation in the first half of the year? And then perhaps just building from that, how is pricing looking on new orders right now? Are you seeing significant pressure there or is it holding up pretty well?</p>
          <p>And then second question is around customer financing. Clearly, you talked about it being insignificant for this year and it hasn't really materialized as perhaps we expected at the start of the year. Does that change your view at all for next year and what the requirements might be in light of what you said previously? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question I could say that it's not changing our expectation for next year. We are, I have to say that we said &#x2013; I said clearly that it was insignificant in the first six months. We don't know exactly what will happen in the second half of the year. And we are still sticking to our possible customer financing at the level of one billion this year.  For next year we have no changed our evaluation.</p>
          <p>On the pricing, it's not new what we said. You know that we are now delivering airplanes ordered two years or up to four years ago and we had a price degradation in orders between 2004 and 2006 or '07 and with an improvement from 2007 to now. And we are for the time being seeing the consequences of this evolution of price in deliveries. For the short range, we are at the bottom of the swimming pool. For the long range, we have been at the bottom of the swimming pool in the first half of the year. We will be with, as I said, less deterioration in the second half and we expect recovery in 2010 and '11. And for the time being, orders &#x2013; limited orders we are receiving are in the trend of improvement of prices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to go back to the situation with deferrals. And could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of deferral activity, in other words requests from airlines to discuss deferrals? Is this something that has stabilized, is it increasing, decreasing? That's my first question. Could you describe what the situation is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not giving numbers on deferrals. But I could say that it was active in the first half of the year. We are not seeing an increase of the rhythm of deferral demands for the time being. I could say &#x2013; I said that many times and I stick to that, there is no panic on the market. We are not in the situation of previous crisis where I have seen &#x2013; when I've &#x2013; where I have seen more panic. We are not in a panic situation so far, I don't know for the future. But the level of cancellation is very limited, 22 in the first half of the year. It's I could say for me almost surprisingly limited.  And the level of deferral is higher, but it's not destabilizing our backlog of orders. And we have been able so far to reorganize that and the work of Airbus and we don't see acceleration of that for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then two things on cost, on &#x2013; first a more minor point which is I was interested in how material, the ramp up in China would be in terms of affecting your costs knowing that it's a higher cost operation? And then second on the A380, you commented that costs are higher than expected and that may not be surprising with the slower ramp up that you're in, but could you talk about what has to happen on the A380 to get costs in line with your expectations and what you're looking at in terms of ramp up as we go out the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On China first, on the cost, your question was on cost in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In fact...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  It's a very complex because we have an agreement with Chinese, and we could say that airplanes we are assembling in China for the time being are not cheaper than airplanes we assemble in Hamburg or in Toulouse. That's clear that we're &#x2013; it's not a low cost assembly line, for the time being. We could expect to improve the situation in the future with more subcontractors around the assembly line. For the time being, a large part of components are coming from Europe and assembled in Europe &#x2013; preassembled in Europe.  And Airbus is working on of a set of an organization more focused on preassembling in a nearer assembly line and with more subcontractors around the facility or in the area of the facility. It could improve the cost of airplanes.  But I don't say on the other side, on the opposite side that it's more expensive than the Hamburg. I could say it's almost the same price as in Hamburg and Toulouse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On A380 cost, now we are delivering airplanes. We &#x2013; I am &#x2013; we are confident that we'll deliver the 14 airplanes in 2009, which is not very strong performance because we have delivered 13 airplanes last year. But it's linked to customer demands for deferral.  But we are &#x2013; they bring airplane at higher cost than expected. We are putting too much resources on each airplane. And it's a question mark for learning curve and Airbus has to look at that at &#x2013; during the second half of the year. We will see if we have consequences on the &#x2013; our forecast for cost of the airplane.  But there is a question mark on the cost we see on the airplane we deliver today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But nothing specific other than learning curve?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing specific. I could say that we will have to look at the learning curve, and to see how the learning curve could lead us to the cost expected for the average airplane in the life of the program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We say learning curve, it's obviously also related the lot of design query notes, as we call them, so small design changes partly trying to improve the robustness of the aircraft in service, so maturity.  And obviously this weighs also on the hours we spend currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's not back to specific issues around the digital mock up, its more &#x2013; it sounds like it is more general issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no.  Digital mock up is working. It's an improvement, and we have &#x2013; we see significant improvements. But on the other side, you know we have too many add aversions,  I could say.  The airplane has been heavily customized for each customer and it's making thing more complex.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. I have two questions, if I may. First is on the hedge book.  If I look at 2010 I appreciate that you are restructuring some of your options into forwards. If I look at the overall size of the hedge book 2010, I think it's come down by a couple of billion dollars since we last looked at the numbers in Q1. Could you just explain why that's happened please? And then my second question is basically customer financing, I appreciate you only did a limited amount in the first half. Was there any provision charge against the P&amp;L in the period relating to that? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one was very difficult to understand. The sound was very bad Avi. I'll try to answer it, I am not sure I got everything. So your question was on the hedging, which we turned in the first half compared to the second half, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was looking at the amount you had in 2010 for Q1 versus what we're seeing in the first half. So you have seen &#x2013; looks as though the amount of forward contracts which you have for 2010 remains unchanged, but you've lost $2 billion of options. If you'd just explain why we don't need those options anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; what we say is we restructured most of these options. It means that we wind down or wind up this option, recovering some of the option premium we had paid based on the current volatility of the market and normally at the same time enter into a forward hedge at much more favorable rates than the ones which we had under the options.  And the option protection was around a level of 155. So we thought it was reasonable at levels between 130, 135 to remove some of the options and turn them into forwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just a follow up quickly on this one. But then, if you did that presumably I should see the amount with forward contracts for 2010 increased by the same amount, but it looks as though that hasn't happened?</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. I have three quick question I think.  First one is on Q2 EBIT before one-off at EADS level, moving down from 1.3 billion in '08 to a 0.9 billion in '09. I'm just trying to square a little bit and to make the bridge and I have some difficulties to square it, except if support activities reach a high level. Could you confirm this &#x2013; the number I have got which is around &#x20AC; 400 million from support activities due to over Q2?</p>
          <p>My second question is linked to free cash flow.  You are raising your guidance for the year, 1 billion.  Is it only because you are reducing your customer financing estimate or because other issues may help?</p>
          <p>My third question is on staff departure at Airbus. Could you confirm the number which has been revealed recently or released recently of 4,500 departure at Airbus?

          <p>On the first two Antoine, the support number if we say support activities, it's including all kind of non-series activities.  It's not customer support only, not to be misunderstood here.  But your number -the number you mentioned was 400, is probably to be half so its more around 200 impact. So there is an impact, but it's lower than the one you had anticipated.</p>
          <p>For customer financing and the impact on the free cash flow, I think that was your second question? There I would see no change for the time being on the expectation on customer financing we might need for the full year. In other words, the improvement we are talking about is coming from the operations and not from customer financing at this point. And I think the third one is probably for you Louis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Two questions if I may? The first one is again coming back to your free cash flow guidance, if you just could give us a bit more color on your changing guidance and what is behind it.  You've said operational but if you just could explain a bit more? And the second question is on the PDPs and the quality and the inflows of the PDPs that you've seen in Q2 '09 versus Q1 and compared to last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first one, operations, where does it come from? If you carefully read the guidance, we are not saying up to 483 aircrafts. It's probably a little bit more, so we say at least 483. This is one thing.  And then it's, I would say more disciplined management on the cash side. And delivery on all kind of cash savings initiatives we have in the Group. So that's probably the majority of the improvement.</p>
          <p>PDP quality has not changed.  Probably a surprise &#x2013; a good surprise to a lot of you. There is no increase in overdues for the time being, so the inflow is intact, which points to the fact that the delivery situation at least for the next month seems to be stabilized.  I think that's good news.  So no change in quality and we have added pre-delivery payments to the stock we had at the end of last year, even within Airbus. So it shows that it's quite a strong contribution we see here.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First, Hans Peter, if you go back to your point about being able to do at least 483 airplanes for the year.  If one does the math for your delivery schedules, you actually come very close to 500. How do you feel about your being able to get very close to that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Add up the production capabilities, your math is probably not so bad. So I wouldn't exclude to come up to that number, but we do not commit on that point to a new number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then second, could you provide a little bit of an update on the A350 XWB? I mean given you competitors' problems we'd like to make sure that you don't encounter some of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to be modest in that field because we are dealing with new technologies and new materials with composites. For the time being, we are on track. We are fighting against weight as everybody in the business. We have still some technical challenges ahead of us, but we are on track.</p>
          <p>I am particularly satisfied with the program management which is a significant improvement compared to other programs and past programs. We know that the certification process will be complex and the lesson learned from our competitor, our topic of awareness I could say, because we see that certification authorities are also very cautious in front of new technologies and new materials and we will have to deal with that. But for the time being, we are on track.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I've got three questions please. The first one is just a clarification on next year's Airbus deliveries. Hans Peter, you're saying I think earlier on in answer to Ben's question that H1 is pretty much firmed up, is that correct thinking on my part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, completely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What I said is, it was related to overbooking. What I said is that for the first half, we don't have remaining overbooking because we are coming closer to the delivery position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Louis, people tell me that you're a betting man and you're a very good betting man.  So if you were taking a bet on number of deliveries next year for Airbus, what sort of number do you think you would be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am certainly a betting man. I discovered that through your question, but I have to say that I am not crazy enough to give you figures on deliveries for 2010. More seriously, we expect to increase our visibility on 2010 deliveries through the next six months before the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the time being as you said, we have a plus and minus. Minus are certainly the situation of airlines. They are suffering a lot with loss of revenues coming from traffic and yield. And they have still problem of financing and the other side as I said, we are more confident in airlines which are due to receive airplanes delivered in 2010.  And we don't see any panic on the market. And we see market is still alive. There are still campaigns.  And we will see more precisely in the second part of the year, but for the time being I am not able to bet on the number of deliveries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question was just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hans Peter seems to have more idea than me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Zafar I think we still have the same assessment. We see still kind of a mismatch for next year between the top down and the bottom up assessment. Top down Louis has mentioned the risks, and they are clearly related to our customers and their financial spending, and to the way they can finance the aircraft on order. So this is one important topic.</p>
          <p>While bottom up from the backlog perspective, it doesn't look that bad. And I mean for the first half of this year at least I think we surprised a lot of you guys with rather resilient deliveries based on the backlog, if we look back six months there were a lot of doubts. And the question is whether this is sustainable also for the next half and for the first half next year. So I think it's still exciting for the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we know, if I could be less optimistic than my friend Hans Peter, I could say we know that in crisis, the last years are more difficult than the first one. And even if traffic is recovering in 2010, we know that airlines are &#x2013; some airlines are weak, potentially weak and we will see certainly next year, if the crisis is &#x2013; we will appreciate the depth and the length of the crisis next year. We can't have a complete evaluation today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was on the employee numbers. And I've asked this before, but I do like looking at Page 10 of your release and you're showing the number of employees at the H1, end of H1, 117,661, which is down from 118,349. Now rough arithmetic tells me that's about 700 people down. Now this number seems to be a resilient, very high number. So what am I missing in terms of this Power 8, where are the reductions taking places?  Is that all your temporaries have gone now or is there is something else?  I'm missing out on something which I'd be grateful for some clarification on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you know that it's &#x2013; the figure you have in mind is a global one.  And in some division we are hiring people, a lot of people. We &#x2013; even Airbus we are hiring engineers, we are hiring engineers especially for example in Germany for A400M. We are not &#x2013; Power 8 is addressing overheads, and we are doing the reduction of headcounts included in the Power 8 on overheads. But in all the businesses we are &#x2013; in all the activities, we are hiring people for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The whole conference has been dedicated to Airbus. And I don't think anyone's asked a question on any of the other divisions. So I'm going to ask...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's working well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm going to ask you one, and I apologize, it's slightly negative.  But the non-Airbus businesses, if I look at the EBIT margins in most of those divisions, they're not really up to the sort of levels that are being reported by your competitors. Is this a structural issue or are we just stuck with these very low margins?  Even if I look at your Eurocopter business, which is a global leader and if I compare the margins, EBIT margins it makes against the other guys, they're very low margins. So what is the problem here?  Is there a problem, and what are doing to address this?  And that are the kind of stretch margins targets that you're asking the divisional heads for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, I understand perfectly your question. And I could share some of your arguments. And for defense, we are near 8%. It means we are more than the average. We are the leading companies in Europe for defense.</p>
          <p>For Eurocopter, as you said, performance is not at the level expected. But we have still the burden on some programs, which are costing money. I could quote NH90.  And I have to say also that compared to some European competitors, we are not receiving the level of support &#x2013; government support they are receiving. And you know that this question is on the desk of the commissioner in charge of competition at the European level.</p>
          <p>It means I could &#x2013; on space you have to understand that on part of our activities we are plan contractor. It means that we have &#x2013; the added value inside the company is limited and we have not the right to have high markup on the components made by our suppliers. We are controlled by public authorities on that topic and we have &#x2013; related to the revenues, our margins seem limited because we are only a prime contractor in these programs.</p>
          <p>It means -- I don't want to say that you are not right. I think we have room for improvement in our non-Airbus activities. We are doing that. It will be more difficult for Eurocopter next year because Eurocopter is impacted by the crisis and especially in commercial programs. And we &#x2013; and the success we have on military programs will not give the result in 2010, but probably in '11 or '12.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Next question comes from Harry Breach from Barclays Capital. Please, it's your turn now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, everyone. First, can I just clarify two points earlier? First, Hans Peter, did I hear you say the Power 8 savings that you target to achieve by the end of this year, is that 1.8 billion you said in response to an earlier question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>North of 1.8, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>North of 1.8...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not &#x2013; it does not mean it's impacting EBIT to the full extent this year. It is just the gross savings status we intend to achieve until the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much do you expect actually to impact EBIT this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was the question before, which I already did not answer because it's extremely difficult, Harry, to track it through inventories and through the systems. So we don't give a figure on half year, but we obviously will try hard to give you something for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You have to try. Second, the non-series costs, Hans Peter, did I hear you say that they were up by &#x20AC; 200 million year-on-year at Airbus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that just for the first half, Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was just first half, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's causing these? Is there a single driver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a number of drivers. It's &#x2013; what is included here is the customer support activities which are currently doing pretty well. What is also included is what you could call diversification programs. So we have a share in the Hawker business jet business, for example, which had a huge decline. So, these are &#x2013; these things are adding up across a number of smaller items. It is also, for example, internal projects we are running, so a number of topics which are flowing into that line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Guys, when you spoke earlier about the extra cost from the A380 units in production this year, are these still Wave 1 or is it also affecting Wave 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are now shifting from Wave 1 to Wave 2 and the &#x2013; we have still cost overruns on Wave 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's both this year still, Harry, because we have still Wave 1 and Wave 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This year is both, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; but at the moment &#x2013; but, Louis, at the moment there is no conclusion that the recurring costs on Wave 2 are higher than you have expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are still on the learning curve and part of the Wave 2 airplanes are on the learning curve, definitely. The question is the level of learning curve and we feel that the learning curve is too high for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And guys, Eurocopter, how much of the series production revenues at Eurocopter are defense compared with civil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is something we have to look up. I don't have it mind, Harry, we'll try hard to give it to you. But on the Eurocopter side of the business where we are currently hurt is on the low end of the production range on the commercial side, obviously. Overall, Eurocopter has a revenue split of roughly 50-50, a bit more on defense, a bit less on civil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you have to be aware that 35% of the revenues are in services, it means it's 50-50 in the remaining 65%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And guys, while we're at Eurocopter, NH90 I think you were mentioning more issues with customer acceptance here. That program overall, is it still booking at zero margin or are you starting to feel that we may have to recognize some incremental costs here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, on average the NH90 program is not at zero margin.  So it still has a positive margin, which is not insignificant insofar it is something which indeed is caused currently by difficulties in certification with some of the customers and acceptance which follows then the certification. And we have a number of customers where we are struggling with getting everything done. So, it's a quite complex &#x2013; more than expected complex process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Hans Peter, you wouldn't expect this to potentially remove the positive overall contract margin on NH90, it's not that big?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at this point, no.</p>

          <p>No, there have been streams of question I must say. So, thanks a lot for your interest, we will try to catch up with you anyway. And this closes our conference call.
