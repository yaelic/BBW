        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone and thank you very much for joining us in our First Half Results Webcast. Three years ago at the same meeting we laid out the quite radical RBS recovery plan and the financial targets that went with it.</p>
          <p>We said that it was a five-year recovery plan and that we had two key jobs. We had a huge clean-up and expensive repair job to put the bank's risk profile back to where it should be. And, at the same time, we had to restore our ongoing, our Core businesses to the point where they serve customers consistently well, offer stable and attractive risk profile and produce the returns that all of our shareholders need from us.</p>
          <p>Three years later, we've made a great deal of progress and I'm pleased to report on that today. It's also true that the difficulties are those that we forecast and are being compounded by tough economic conditions. We are making progress. We've got work left to do.</p>
          <p>I am, of course, conscious that there are many reputational issues that are difficult for our industry to deal with and that, in turn, have come out of the pre-crisis period and we will talk about those I'm sure a great deal in the months ahead just as we have been trying to identify them and change them from the past. But these slides today, of course, I will delve primarily on the shareholder aspects on our financial performance in half we are reporting on.</p>
          <p>In summary, the ongoing businesses of RBS have turned in a solid performance. Our Retail and Commercial businesses which constitute up from about 40% of the Group, 75% or 80% of our Group now form a resilient platform of performance, which as economies improve we believe we can improve significantly further.</p>
          <p>But even today excluding the losses still in our Irish business Ulster Bank we are more than covering our cost of capital in our Retail and Commercial businesses. And in key areas we needed to improve such as the performance in the US, improvements continue to be registered.</p>
          <p>Possibly the greatest restructuring that we've had to undertake is in our wholesale businesses in Markets and International Banking, which is some one-third of their original size in balance sheet terms. And we announced a further restructuring at the beginning of this year. That restructuring is going as we had planned and although there is more yet to do I'm pleased to report that in very difficult trading markets our businesses have performed broadly in line with that peers and have in the first half also produced returns that are around or above the cost of capital for shareholders at least in the case of our Markets business. It is a tough area of the industry, but we are, we believe, competing whilst restructuring in the way that we have planned.</p>
          <p>A milestone, we hope for the second half of the year is the planned divestment and IPO of Direct Line Group and we are pleased to report a good platform for that activity today in good and strong and resilient Direct Line recovery results.</p>
          <p>The safety and soundness agenda I mentioned, and of course it's been priority number one, central to what we have been doing, once again we're reporting very good progress. Strong capital ratios, 11.1% Core Tier 1 and even excluding APS, which I hope will be our milestone activity in this area, in the second half, over 10% Core Tier 1 ratio. And all the other dimensions of our balance sheet, reduction in Non-Core and the funding profile of the Bank continue to strengthen.</p>
          <p>Bruce will be going over with you the greater detail around our financial performance in the second half. Let me just dwell on a few highlights first. The operating profit from our ongoing businesses is &#xA3;3.2 billion for the half year, &#xA3;3.7 billion if we exclude our Ulster's losses. That produces a respectable return on equity, one we seek to do better on.</p>
          <p>Our net interest margin has stabilized; our impairments are still coming down gently in Core more accelerated overall in the Bank as a whole. And our Core businesses are very safely and solidly funded with only 92% loan-to-deposit ratio.</p>
          <p>The Group as a whole made operating profits broadly flat with the same period last year of &#xA3;1.8 billion, we talked about our Non-Core has come down, but we have recorded a significant loss overall and the biggest ingredient of that loss is the &#xA3;3 billion non-cash accounting charge for fair value of owned debt, which, of course, ironically reflects the fact that today, RBS is perceived as much safer than it was six months ago with debt spreads that are much narrower.</p>
          <p>We set out, as I mentioned, three years ago the financial targets that we were working against together with all of the other targets of the both the physical and cultural change at RBS. This sheet reports, as we regularly do, our progress and as you can see across most measures we are making very strong progress against where we thought we'd be by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>And, in fact, really the only areas where we are still falling short of our plans are in the returns in our Core business, which clearly will take longer than we expected to get back in common with the activity levels of our customers and the economic recovery around us. But we are making progress.</p>
          <p>A vital part of what we have to do, in fact, the starting point of what we have to do, is to support our customers well. And we do that across all our business lines and right across the world. But here in the UK, of course, we have a special duty to do that and there has been much commentary about the state of lending demand and the state of lending supply in the economy as a whole.</p>
          <p>RBS, despite the balance sheet restructuring, has increased net lending balances in our Retail and Corporate businesses taken together in UK by 4% since 2008, and increased them in the first half of this year also. And, in fact, within that, although mortgage lending and increased mortgage market share has been the place where we have been able to increase support for customers the most we do continue to be by far the largest lender to corporate UK, large and small. And the second quarter this year also showed a small uptick in net lending relative to repayments from corporates.</p>
          <p>The Bank of England announced an important scheme lately, the Funding for Lending Scheme. We're determined to do our best to support the economy in the spirit of that scheme and I believe we were the first bank to announce aggressive new programs in both mortgage lending and in our Corporate lending to pass on the price benefits of the Funding for Lending Scheme to our customers to the extent that if there is price elasticity of demand this will uncover it and we are determined to do our bit under this and indeed the other schemes.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to our business performance, Retail and Commercial, the biggest part of our business, as I mentioned, is performing solidly, and indeed underneath the covers, we are making good progress. Of course, our progress, as it should be, is linked to the health and the activity levels of our customers and we have a world economy that isn't growing very fast.</p>
          <p>You are familiar with that whether it will be low interest rates, whether it will be GDP and indeed the market lending statistics. Despite that, our impairments are going down. Our businesses in Retail and Commercial are very solidly funded, taking in deposits to support the loans we make. And the returns have been building despite the difficult economy up to about 10% including Ireland, 14% excluding Ireland.</p>
          <p>Our wholesale banking, the restructuring we announced, as I mentioned before, is going well. And you can see in the top right of this chart, our performance broadly in line with competitors in the first half of this year. As you can see in results terms that means down in difficult markets, but unlike the average of our competitors, are on sharply reducing resource allocation, especially balance sheet.</p>
          <p>You can see in the other charts on this page, the other ways in which our resources have been reducing in this business in order to align capacity with service to customers with returns for shareholders. The balance sheet in Markets and International Banking was once nearly &#xA3;900 billion, as I say it's now roughly one-third of that level. And our International Banking division is self funded from its own deposits despite the cross-border nature of its activities.</p>
          <p>There are, of course, as I mentioned earlier, important challenges in the conduct and reputational area for our industry and certainly for RBS within that. And let me touch on a few of them which feature in our results today. Of course, we had a regrettable technology outage at the end of June. We've made a provision for that in our results, which Bruce will talk about.</p>
          <p>We have, of course, recovered from it in technical terms. Our customers have been remarkably forgiving. We're very appreciative of that. And I think it reflects the huge efforts we made in order to overcome the deficiencies and trying to be flexible in our service to customers during the incident.</p>
          <p>The damage was probably greater in reputational and trust terms. We need to work hard to put that right to make sure that the resilience of our mainframes is improved. The independent review that we've conducted into it will be published in the autumn, but I think has really confirmed or seems to be set to confirm the analysis of this incident that we've already talked publicly about.</p>
          <p>A second area of important industry debate especially in the UK is SME swaps mis-selling review, which all the banks are undertaking. We've made a provision for that in these results. I would say that this review is still at a preliminary stage and it is not yet clear whether the independent reviewers will uphold the financial ombudsman line that have been taken in recent years or will establish different standards to those of the financial ombudsman. And, of course, it is also unclear how each of the banks' individual cases will compare to either of those standards.</p>
          <p>So we have a preliminary provision that relates to the structured elements of our derivatives activity in this area. The extent to which that will be sufficient or more will be needed and indeed the quantum will not be clear for sometime.</p>
          <p>LIBOR, of course, a huge blot on our industry's reputation and one that still got some chapters to be written. I'm very limited in what I can say about this, as people know, RBS is one of the banks in the frame under investigation in this area and people who have also reported on the traders that have left us in that regard.</p>
          <p>We have not made a specific provision for LIBOR in these results, because, at this stage, if you like, the final charge sheet for RBS, or what it might look like and where it might place us is not yet clear nor is the timing. Although rest assured that we're taking it very, very seriously and indeed the <mark type="ph" /> culture (13:16) and control aspects that surround the whole of the industry issue with equal seriousness.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the regulatory front, there is, of course, much change going on in conduct as well as financial regulation. The period has seen some more news, of course, in ring-fencing. We are already making big steps to adapting RBS to a ring-fenced world. We're making those steps in business terms, especially in the fundability of our balance sheet and the ability of our wholesale operations to fund themselves outside of ring-fence, which is one of the key drivers behind the restructuring of our wholesale business.</p>
          <p>We are also making some technical progress, especially in simplifying our legal structure and in collapsing of our Dutch bank legal entities from the ABN Amro days, which should facilitate the re-planning of our Group that will be needed once the precise details of ring-fencing are known.</p>
          <p>Let me, before turning over to Bruce, maybe just summarize by way of outlook. Clearly, we are set to have a significant further period of tough economic and market conditions and that, most importantly, in subduing the levels of customer activity that the banking industry faces off against <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:43) subdued revenues for the banking industry until economic recovery picks up.</p>
          <p>I do believe that across the world and in the UK, in particular, that the necessary ingredients for economic recovery are being put in place and that one-by-one the issues that underlay the financial crisis are being addressed.</p>
          <p>And, of course, although there are important uncertainties left in the regulatory field, the new regulatory landscape is being worked through. Banks are adjusting to it and piece by piece those issues are and adjustments are being put behind us.</p>
          <p>For RBS, specifically, our change in recovery plan is making good progress. We've done a lot. We have much left to do. The vital safety and soundness agenda continues to go well. And, as I mentioned, a big landmark for us in the second half we hope will be the exit from the Asset Protection Scheme subject to regulatory approval.</p>
          <p>Our Core businesses are resilient. They are gathering underlying strength. They are, of course, economy dependent. And priority number one is, has been and will remain dedicated service to our customers.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Bruce, perhaps you could take us through the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephen, and good day, everyone. Let me start off by looking at the numbers in a little more detail. So looking at the first half consolidated financial highlights, our first half operating profit was broadly consistent with a year ago, adjusting for a couple of one-off items in Q2.</p>
          <p>While income has shrunk, given our de-leveraging strategy and challenging markets, we've seen progress on expenses, claims and impairments provide offsets. The performance in Q2 ex the one-offs was about as expected. The sequential decline reflects seasonality in the Markets business.</p>
          <p>The so called below the line items increased in the half to &#xA3;3.3 billion, with &#xA3;3 billion of that a charge for own credit adjustment as our credit spreads have tightened markedly since year-end. Carrying that through to the bottom line gives an attributable loss of about &#xA3;2 billion. Without the own credit item we had an attributable profit though of around &#xA3;300 million in the half.</p>
          <p>The Group's funded balance sheet declined by a further &#xA3;50 billion during the half. Assets of &#xA3;929 billion are now down 24% from the peak. Our Core Tier 1 ratio strengthened to 11.1% and our TNEP per share improved slightly to 489 pence.</p>
          <p>Analyzing the below the line items, the first half of 2012 saw a total charge of &#xA3;3.5 billion, including the incident charge of &#xA3;700 million increase relative to the first half from a year ago. Own credit adjustment is clearly the biggest impact in this year's first half. However, ex OCA remaining items improved by about &#xA3;2 billion led by lower APS and PPI costs as well as a non-recurrence of the sovereign debt impairment.</p>
          <p>In Q2, we took a further top-up for PPI related cost of &#xA3;135 million. The cumulative provision for PPI now stands at &#xA3;1.3 billion, &#xA3;700 million of which has already been paid out. Restructuring costs were elevated in the half due to the M&amp;IB reorganization, Group property exits and Direct Line separation. We remain comfortable with our full year 2012 guidance for restructuring costs of &#xA3;1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, Core's first half operating profit was down versus the prior year as R&amp;C businesses battled top line pressure and the trading environment for Markets weakened somewhat relative to a year ago. The year-on-year Q2 performance was about flat adjusting for the one-off accruals. Core income was 8% lower in the half as the low rate environment continues to impact net interest income while fee and other income was hampered by low overall levels of client activity.</p>
          <p>First half expenses were tightly managed with underlying expenses, excluding the technology incident charge, down 3% on a year ago. Impairments fell relative to a year ago with improvements continuing in UK Retail and the US portfolios, in particular. Core RoE for the first half was 10%. If you exclude Ulster, this was 13%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the divisions in more detail, Retail and Commercial had a respectable first half performance considering the income headwinds. NIM has been stable, costs were held flat and impairments continue to improve in the half. Q2 was stronger than Q1 for R&amp;C with the improvement relatively broad based. International Banking, US R&amp;C and smaller losses in Ulster led the way for R&amp;C in the quarter.</p>
          <p>International Banking is pulling through their expense synergies while the US business is seeing favorable credit trends and good commercial loan growth, up 9% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our Markets business saw Q2 revenues decline 9% year-on-year and 39% quarter-on-quarter, which were inline with our peer group in spite of the decrease in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Rates and asset backed revenues in Q2 improved on a year ago while currencies and credit areas experienced weaker levels of customer activity. Markets compensation ratio for the half was 33% compared with 35% a year ago. First half RoE was a solid 14% compared with 17% in last year's first half.</p>
          <p>Direct Line Group saw first half profit improve by 6% relative to a year ago despite a &#xA3;40 million increase in weather claims in the second quarter. Of note, we grew our total in-force policies by 2% in the quarter with our motor-force policies stabilizing.</p>
          <p>Non-Core's made excellence progress this half as the bottom line loss declined 31% on the previous half to &#xA3;1.4 billion, and we continue to run ahead of our asset reduction targets. Pre-provision profit was &#xA3;780 million lower than a year ago as disposal gains and fair value adjustments flipped from positive to negative.</p>
          <p>However, this was offset by a sharp fall in impairments. First half impairments were down &#xA3;1.4 billion or nearly 60% versus last year, which is largely Ulster related. The development lending book there is now well provided and it's in long-term workout.</p>
          <p>We continue to maintain good progress in the run down of Non-Core. On this slide here you can see that first half funded assets were &#xA3;72 billion, a year-to-date decline of &#xA3;22 billion. In Q2, funded assets declined by &#xA3;11 billion, &#xA3;7 billion of disposals and &#xA3;4 billion of run-offs.</p>
          <p>We remain comfortable with our full year 2013 target of &#xA3;40 billion and our pipeline remains filled with many small transactions. Given where we are, we've revised our full year 2012 funded asset target &#xA3;5 billion lower to a &#xA3;60 billion to &#xA3;65 billion range.</p>
          <p>Next, impairments. The Group's Q2 impairment charge was broadly stable on the previous quarter. Core impairments fell by about &#xA3;100 million while Non-Core increased by slightly more than &#xA3;100 million. Core saw improvements in credit quality across UK Retail, International Banking and Ulster. And the Ulster improvement partly reflects non-repeat of Q1 charge to reflect falling house price indicators. Non-Core's second quarter impairment increase reflects a handful of corporate cases and a review of the property portfolio.</p>
          <p>REILs continued to trend down while loan impairment provisions increased further in the quarter to &#xA3;20 billion, giving REIL coverage of 51% versus 49% at the start of the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to prioritize our balance sheet strength and reinforcing our funding and liquidity metrics. In Q2, the Group loan-to-deposit ratio improved further to 104% while the Core loan-to-deposit ratio is now 92%, reflecting an &#xA3;8 billion increase in customer deposits in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>We continue to manage down our short-term wholesale funding need in the last quarter down a further &#xA3;18 billion to &#xA3;62 billion. The liquidity buffer remains at a highly prudent level, given Eurozone concern at &#xA3;156 billion or 2.5 times our short-term wholesale funding. We will look to gradually bring this down over time, which will boost NIM. The cash element of the buffer is now 115% of wholesale funding and the pool of assets eligible at the Bank of England Discount Window has continued to be increased. Note, there was no noticeable impact on the Group from the Moody's recent sector-wide rating action.</p>
          <p>On the capital front, we ended the half with a robust Core Tier 1 ratio of 11.1%. Net of APS relief, the Group's Core Tier 1 ratio is now 10.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. Our target is to maintain the Group's Core Tier 1 ratio above 10% at 2012 and 2013 yearends, including the impacts of the APS exit and various regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>Mitigating actions are in sharp focus, including RWA reduction from the Non-Core run-down, the Markets restructuring and future attributable profit generation. Note that we're currently estimating a fully loaded Basel III ratio of 9% to 9.5% at December 2013.</p>
          <p>We showed you this slide on our annual results meeting and we remain largely on track for meeting these deliverables this year. Our first half milestones were all met. We're working with the FSA to secure agreement on the exit from APS and at this advanced stage we are optimistic. We've made good progress in separating Direct Line Group and the business is performing well. So I call that one on track assuming the markets remain cooperative.</p>
          <p>The one that will slip a bit is the branch sale to Santander. This is proving to be a more complex undertaking than initially planned and we're taking great care to ensure a smooth transition for customers. We're developing our new planning timetable and we'll update you on that one a little bit down the road.</p>
          <p>Let me run through a few quick posting before I wrap up. The Aviation Capital transaction closed in the quarter, delivering a gain of &#xA3;197 million. This will be the last really big deal from Non-Core, lots of smaller stuff from here on out.</p>
          <p>Both Markets and International Banking are executing their restructuring plans well although we remain cautious on the operating environment. Our last big migration out of RBS NV into RBS Plc was postponed until early September due to the technology incident, but that remains well on track.</p>
          <p>Our peripheral exposure continues to be manageable. We've reduced our net sovereign bond holdings to zero while our lending portfolio, excluding Ireland, is now less than 2% of the Group's loans and advances.</p>
          <p>We've not taken any accrual at this point for any LIBOR fines, as Stephen mentioned, but we continue to cooperate with various investigations. Note that we do have meaningful securities gain position available to offset any impacts and to protect our capital targets.</p>
          <p>So, to sum up, our Core businesses have produced resilient performances against an increasingly difficult economic backdrop and our franchises are maintaining their strong market positions. We've continued to make good progress on the run-down of Non-Core and we revised our full year target to &#xA3;60 billion to &#xA3;65 billion. And we're on track with the restructuring of the Markets business.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet de-risking continues at a good pace as we track well to all of our targets. And our capital base remains robust with Core Tier 1 above 10%, excluding APS.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Stephen for a few final remarks.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Bruce. Of course, we look forward to answering your questions if not on this webcast at least in all the other opportunities for Analysts and Press Conference Call during the course of this morning. I thank you once again for joining us. RBS is progressing. We're changing. We are confident that the business we have are capable of being molded into a bank, which can serve everyone's needs well. It's going to be tough still in terms of the work ahead of us, in terms of the economic backdrop, but we will keep marching forward.</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining us.</p>
