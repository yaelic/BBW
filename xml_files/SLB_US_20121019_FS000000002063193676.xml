          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.</p>
          <p>Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.08. This is an increase of $0.03 sequentially and $0.12 compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, all prior period amounts have been restated as the distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sale of Wilson in the second quarter and the sale of our investment in CE Franklin during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Third quarter revenue of $10.6 billion increased 1.5% sequentially. This increase was driven by international revenue growth of 3.1%. The international growth was offset in part by a 2.3% decline in North America. Oilfield Services pre-tax income of $2.1 billion increased 2% sequentially while pre-tax operating margins were essentially flat.</p>
          <p>Sequential revenue and pre-tax margins highlights by product groups were as follows: Third quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.9 billion increased by 4.8 percentage points sequentially and margins improved 58 basis points to 28.8%. These increases were driven by improved vessel utilization at WesternGeco, following last quarter's transits and dry docks as well as a strong international performance in testing services.</p>
          <p>Drilling Group third quarter revenue of $4 billion increased 1.2% while margins declined slightly by 34 basis points to 18.1%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to drilling and measurement on robust activity in the Middle East and Asia. Third quarter Production Group revenue of $3.7 billion decreased 1.7% sequentially while pre-tax margin fell 148 basis points to 14.9%. These declines were largely attributable to our North America hydraulic fracturing business, as we continued to experience pricing pressure in U.S. land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower in the market. From a geographical perspective North America margins declined by 209 basis points to 18.6% while international margins improved 73 basis points to 21.5%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.6% in the third quarter, compared to 24% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $6.2 billion as compared to $6.7 billion at the end of Q2. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.1 billion of CapEx, $121 million of proceeds from the divestiture of our investment in CE Franklin, and $149 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average price of $68.19.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the quarter we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $1 billion of 1.25% of five-year notes due in 2017 and $1 billion of 2.40% 10-year note due in 2022. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012, as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011.</p>
          <p>And now I turn the conference over to Paal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continue to show steady improvement in both revenue and margin performance as seen in the overall pre-tax operating income which was up 2% sequentially and 11% compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>In the international markets, total revenue grew by 3% sequentially in line with the rig count, while margins were up by 73 basis points reaching a three-year high. Activity was solid driven by both key land and offshore markets. However, regional growth rates continue to vary driven by changes to activity mix and project schedules.</p>
          <p>Service capacity remained tight in our Seismic, Drilling &amp; Measurement and Wireline product lines and we also saw signs of capacity tightening in our well testing business. Pricing continued a steady upwards trend during the quarter driven by higher new technology sales, strong operational performance and further supported by proactive bidding on small to medium-sized contracts.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially while margins were down 113 basis points, driven by a shift in activity mix, operational delays and heavy mobilization costs linked to new contract start-ups.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, activity remained steady during the quarter, with continued focus on deepwater exploration, conventional offshore development and mature fields on land. We started operations in our first Schlumberger production management or SPM project covering the Carrizo field and we also began to mobilize for the SPM project covering the Panuco block.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, activity was also flat during the third quarter with growth on land being offset by less offshore drilling as rigs were redirected towards workover activities. Still, the growth outlook for Q4 is positive, with three additional deepwater rigs scheduled to start operations, together with higher forecasted stimulation vessel activity.</p>
          <p>Ecuador saw strong sequential growth as we completed the mobilization of the Shushufindi SPM project. The project is now fully operational and activity and results are progressing in line with our plans.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we experienced operational delays in Argentina and Colombia due to a range of local factors, but we are expecting to see solid sequential growth in these countries in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially while margins were up 126 basis points. During the quarter, Saudi Arabia again posted strong sequential performance driven by workover, development and exploration activity. These results were further supported by solid activity growth in Oman, the United Arab Emirates as well as Kuwait.</p>
          <p>In Iraq we completed our resource mobilization following the second quarter contract wins, effectively doubling our drilling activity in the country during the quarter. With this market share gain and our well established execution track record, we have over the past two years established our traditional international market position also in Iraq.</p>
          <p>In China, we continued to see strong sequential growth on land driven by higher drilling and stimulation activity as our Chinese customers embark on more complex conventional and unconventional projects.</p>
          <p>Still the deal market with the fastest sequential growth in the third quarter was Australia, where offshore activity increased and where our strong contract position in the Queensland unconventionals is starting to have an impact.</p>
          <p>Following a very strong second quarter, revenue in Europe CIS and Africa grew by 2% sequentially while margins were up by a further 138 basis points. In the North Sea, we saw strong activity for WesternGeco, which was offset by start-up delays on several smaller projects for other product lines as well as extended summer maintenance shutdowns in both Norway and Denmark.</p>
          <p>In North Africa, delays negatively impacted results in Algeria while issues related to the security situation slowed the activity ramp up in Libya. Activity in Sub-Sahara Africa remained strong during the third quarter, with significant sequential growth in East Africa.</p>
          <p>Russia and Central Asia also saw strong sequential performance driven by activity growth in Western Siberia while offshore activity remained flat for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In North America, sequential revenue was down 2%, and margins were down 209 basis points. In terms of activity, the results were negatively impacted by a slower than expected seasonal pick up in Canada, a 3% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count, as well as the activity shutdown in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico linked to Hurricane Isaac.</p>
          <p>The negative pricing impact on our hydraulic fracturing business in U.S. land continued in the third quarter as the new pricing levels further penetrated our contract base. Furthermore, in U.S. land, you also saw the first signs of pricing weakness in our coiled tubing business towards the back end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, excluding the Hurricane Isaac impact, deepwater activity grew in line with our earlier outlook and the number of deepwater drilling rigs is set to reach pre-Macondo levels by the end of the year. We continue to show strong operational performance and our Gulf of Mexico business is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American margins. In WesternGeco we operated one dual coil fleet in the Central Gulf while multi-client sales were flat with the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group we opened the Schlumberger China Petroleum Institute in Beijing. The institute houses more than 100 of our petro technical experts which together with domain experts from all Schlumberger product lines offer a full range of reservoir services to the various players in the China oil gas industry. To further strengthen our position in the emerging shale in China, we also signed a joint venture with the Chongqing Institute of Geology &amp; Mineral Resources to provide basin studies, subsurface data integration and optimized well and completion planning for the new players coming into the Chinese shale market.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere we continue to expand our presence and capacity for core and fluid analysis with the opening of our latest lab in Houston which joins our network of over 25 labs around the world. We are also continuing with our strategy of combining our downhole fluid and core sampling technologies with our lab capabilities to provide a seamless integrated service.</p>
          <p>In the Drilling Group we continue to execute our strategy focused on creating the next step change in drilling performance through total system integration and we are progressing well with this work as can be seen by the improvement in the Drilling Group financial results over the past two years.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone where Smith Bits, for the first time in their history, captured the number one market share spot according to the latest Spears Survey. This achievement is another testament to what the Smith segments can achieve through their unique technology and as part of Schlumberger both with respect to the overall drilling workflow and our global infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Another very interesting drilling technology being introduced by geo service is the advanced cuttings characterization. Here we perform continuous petro physical measurements of the cuttings as they come off the shakers and through novel data processing we can establish the reservoir quality of the rock and also tie it back to the specific well depth. This will offer a very effective way of optimizing well placement and completion intervals, for instance, in horizontal shale wells.</p>
          <p>In the production group, we performed close to 2100 stages with HiWAY during the quarter which represents record activity and a sequential growth of around 60%. In addition to the established HiWAY markets in North America such as the Eagle Ford we saw meaningful penetration into several other basins including the Bakken and in Canada. HiWAY's production results and completion cost savings have been the main driver for its penetration into these basins. We also completed a study of public production data covering the Eagle Ford that showed average production from the HiWAY wells was 65% higher than non- HiWAY completed wells. In the international market, HiWAY saw continued growth with a near doubling in the stage count versus the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's then turn to the macro environment where both the U.S. and European central banks announced interventions to support growth in their respective economies. China continued to show signs of slowing growth but so far the slowdown appears to be actively managed and for the time being kept under control. Altogether these developments have left the GDP growth outlook for 2012 and 2013 more or less unchanged from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the supply and demand balance of the oil market remains tight, with continued production challenges in the non-OPEC countries with OPEC spare capacity staying close to a five-year low. Based on this environment we continue to see Brent crude prices supported around current levels, although there could still be periods of volatility.</p>
          <p>In the international market we have seen no material change to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during the quarter, and we still expect our activity to grow in excess of 10% this year. In North America, the activity sentiments are currently more negative, both in Canada and U.S. land, with liquids activity no longer able to offset the drop in dry gas drilling. This coupled with ongoing pricing pressure in hydraulic fracturing as well as early signs of pricing weakness in coiled tubing in U.S. land indicates no immediate change to the North American headwinds.</p>
          <p>As we continue to navigate the overall macro uncertainty, manage the North American headwinds and capitalize on the steady international growth, we maintain relentless focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution. This execution capability, together with our balanced technology portfolio and unmatched international strength, will allow us to deliver double digit growth in earnings per share in 2012 as well as solid margin progress in what remains quite a challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>This position and these capabilities also puts us in the driver's seat for continued outperformance in 2013, which remains the collective ambition of the entire Schlumberger team.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning, Paal. The international performance particularly out of the Eastern Hemisphere is very impressive this quarter, particularly how it's progressed over the last year or so. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the drivers behind that; how much of this would you attribute to execution, activity levels, pricing? I guess what I'm really trying to understand is how of much this momentum do you see continuing into 2013? In other words, is it sustainable now and do we continue to build from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First start with Q3 performance, I'll say I'm overall pleased with the progress. We are keeping very strong focus on execution, as we've been talking about in earlier quarters, and we also are doing quite well when it comes to cost and resource management.</p>
          <p>We also continue to work on our internal improvement programs, which, by the way, is included in our normal operating costs. So in terms of margins, we saw further progression in Q3 and we had very good incrementals and as I said in my prepared remarks, our international margin is now at a three-year high. Some of the drivers behind this is slow but steady pricing increase driven by new technology sales, as well as strong operational performance.</p>
          <p>But I would also say that the quality of service is still the market share driver for us. The D&amp;M Q3 replacement ratio was again 34 to 3 so we're maintaining this 10 to 1 ratio, and this is actually starting to become meaningful for D&amp;M now which showed significant improvement in financial performance during this year.</p>
          <p>So if you then take that performance and try to look forward we maintain our positive view on international markets and also our performance there. We have a very strong international contract portfolio and this portfolio has solid upside when it comes to both technology and performance.</p>
          <p>And the other thing I would like to highlight as well is that we continue to expand the international presence of our smaller product lines. If you look at operations internationally today, we operate in over 80 countries, and we have 17 product lines. But in 50% of these countries we only have 50% of our product lines present. So I would say that we still have a lot of runway in terms of growth as for market penetration.</p>
          <p>So in terms of margins going forward I would just say we would continue to leverage the size and the infrastructure and the execution capabilities to drive both the top line and further margin expansion. So as overall, our view on the international market remains positive, and I'm pleased with the progress in terms of how we were executing, and I would expect us to continue to improve going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paal, a more specific question on Saudi if you don't mind. How do you see the Saudi market developing over the next several years, and how much of that growth is going to come from gas? I know we're not going to see a massive ramp up we saw last cycle but we're hearing more and more talk about gas being one of their focuses up there. I'm just curious how much of gas do you see as a contributor there, and can you give us a sense as to how much that gas market in Saudi has grown over the last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the breakdown of the rig increases that we've seen over the past year, right? But Saudi today is on track to reach the 134 rigs by year end which they more or less indicated. In terms of the outlook beyond year-end, we don't expect a dramatic increase in rig count that would send the first half of next year. But rig-less activity remains strong and is also a key growth driver for us in Saudi.</p>
          <p>But like you said, gas is important. Saudi Aramco recently announced a gas discovery in the Red Sea. There's no firm plans beyond this but with the gas discovery I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be more exploration activity around that. And there's also a lot of gas-related activity in the northwest linked to both tight gas and shale. So you're right to point out that gas is important. And I would say that gas in terms of future growth in Saudi is probably going to be one of the key drivers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Paal, I was just wondering if you might be able to provide us some perspective on you guys put out some very strong performance here relative to your peer group over the last couple of quarters. Maybe provide some perspective on how you plan on maintaining that performance differential going forward?</p>
          <p>And then in addition, in some of your &#x2013; some commentary we've recently heard from some land drillers and from some of your competitors are calling for an uptick in activity in the U.S. market, U.S. land drilling market going out into 2013. If you can give us some perspective on the outlook there, that would be helpful. Appreciate that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first part of your question was related to North America as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just globally, really. Looks like your performance overall for revenue growth, margin performance, etcetera, has been exceeding your peers over the last couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if you go back to the first question I answered, I think a lot of elements of our international performance I covered there. Maybe I'll just focus in a little bit more on North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look at Q3, overall, again, solid performance for us in Q3. I'm pleased with the progress. Since we restructured our business about two years ago, we now have a very lean and focused North American organization. We have invested quite strongly in infrastructure over the past couple of years. So we're now able to leverage that. And we also, after the Smith merger, we now have a very broad technology and workflow offering in the North America land marketplace which we're also able to leverage.</p>
          <p>Finally what I would say on the means we have to succeed, we probably have one of the best supply chain organizations in the North American market as well. They have done a really great job, in particular, together with our pressure pumping organization this year.</p>
          <p>So further on performance in North America, if you look at how we've been addressing the fracturing market, more or less from the beginning of this year, we have kept focus on what we call minimum effective margins. This is basically the product of our bid price times the utilization. So if these effective margins go below a certain level we are prepared to lay down crews. So we laid down crews in Q2. We also laid down crews in Q3. And this is how we're also able to protect better I would say the margins in our pressure pumping business.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the other product lines on land, we continue to have solid performance both from drilling and wireline. And obviously the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for us, and was in Q3 highly accretive again even with the Hurricane Isaac impact. This is with flat seismic sales quarter on quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at the North America market going forward, from our standpoint on the plus side we expect to see continued strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico from us, both when it comes to drilling activities as well as seismic and we also see Canada having a positive impact for us in Q4 and Q1, although not to the same level it had in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Now, on the negative side, fracturing margins are going to come down further in Q4 and likely also in Q1, as the new pricing levels work its way through our contract volume. And as I also mentioned we also some margin pressure in coiled tubing.</p>
          <p>Now, what's going to happen beyond Q4 or Q1, I would say there's really three main questions in my mind. Firstly will there be a Q1 recovery in liquids rig count after Q4 as this is key to maintain the current land pricing overall both for fracking as well as for the other product lines?</p>
          <p>The second question is will there be a share plays in the frac market and a new pricing floor given the fact that there are significant excess capacity in the market and also when <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:15) comes, is this going to be another source of market share plays?</p>
          <p>And the third question in my mind is in terms of how North America overall is going to perform, what are really the normalized frac margins? The way I see it, or we see it, the frac market in North America today is largely a commodity market with a very low barrier to entry, where capacity is really driving the pricing, and we peaked around 30% margins, and the trough is now in low single digits. And I would say in my mind that the normalized margins are more in the middle of this. They're certainly not toward the upside.</p>
          <p>So I think these three elements obviously are going to be important to sort of guide us in how the North America market is going to continue to evolve. But I would say I'm very optimistic, though, in terms of our ability to outperform on a relative basis in North America.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paal, as we think about 2013, I want to dig in a little more on Dave's earlier question. Given the large number of startups and staging for contracts that's underway now, which I guess first off makes your margins look even more impressive, but there's a lot of work that's been awarded to yourself and the industry that's getting underway now that should lead to significant growth in 2013. I'm talking more on the international side, of course. Do you see international growth in 2013 consistent with 2012 or could it be above or below?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of the activity outlook for international, it's still a little bit early to kind of pin it down in detail, right? We are just entering our planning process and our customers are doing the same thing here. So I would just say that we maintain a positive view of the international market. We see growth in 2013. I think the rate of growth, I think, is going to be much clearer by year end. But again we have not seen any major shift in customer sentiments over the past quarter. So unless there's a dramatic change in their view of the market and their spend as they come out of the planning cycle, you know, we are optimistic that it's going to be more of the same for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then on seismic, which has been an area of strength this year, it seems like the fourth quarter is mostly or close to sold out at this point on the marine side, and that would set up for a good 2013. Are you continuing to see good pricing gains on the seismic side and am I correct that the fourth quarter is mostly sold out that that should lead to a very strong 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's correct. Q4 is more or less booked as you say, largely driven by South Atlantic activity, both West Africa and for us, Uruguay. So our view hasn't changed. We were indicating that we didn't think Q4 would see the normal seasonal lull and that's actually transpiring. So going forward we continue to test pricing for 2013 work. We already awarded some work for the next North Sea season and the pricing is even up from what we have bid earlier. We are now pushing about 15% upward versus the 10% we talked about earlier. Overall we maintain quite a positive view on the seismic market.</p>

          <p>Simon, a question for you on initial CapEx thoughts for 2013. Baker has come out and guided for a big 25% reduction, Halliburton was out earlier guiding for a decline as well. Are you anticipating a reduction in spending levels next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paal just mentioned that we're going through the planning cycle. And I'm going to turn it over to Paal to tell you what are the initial numbers that are coming. But we are going through a planning cycle as we speak. And there is a bit of shift between activity places that might require additional CapEx. But Paal have input now at the early stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly, 2012 CapEx spend is going to be about $4.5 billion, as we said, which is in line with the plan that we previously communicated. The main shift we've seen during this year going back to what we were planning at the beginning of the year is that we have significant reduced NAM CapEx and this has been offset by higher international CapEx.</p>
          <p>So, as Simon was saying, the 2013 CapEx spend outlook it's still early days. We are just starting in the planning cycle now. But I would say as a general view at this stage I would say CapEx would be likely flat to slightly down. The main drivers or the main focus for us in 2013 is going to be the international market and it's going to be a traditional high capital service segments like WesternGeco, Wireline, Drilling &amp; Measurements and well testing.</p>
          <p>Now, while we continue to inject capital into these businesses, we also continue to drive efficiency and utilization for all of them to make sure that we can be as lean as possible with how we spend our cash.</p>
          <p>The other key thing for us next year in terms of CapEx is that we are also continuing to invest further in infrastructure, in particular in Sub-Sahara Africa, and also in the Far East, in particular in China.</p>
          <p>And the last part as well as I mentioned we are looking to further expand our smaller product lines into the international market and there's some associated CapEx with that. But overall I would say at this stage CapEx is likely to be flat or slightly down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I stood back and think about the broader environment, thinking not just about 2013 but into 2014, are we entering a period of declining capital intensity now that the big spend on U.S. pumping is over? I realize there's still roof-line investment going on abroad. It sounds like that's going to be flattish, maybe down, relative to this year. And it looks like, too, that the big spend on international shale operations is still a few years off. So if we look at CapEx relative to sales or cash flow, do you anticipate potentially a few years of declining capital intensity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't stretch it further than 2013 and the comments that I made. But I think your commentary around investment into pressure pumping capacity, I think those are fair. We have enough pressure pumping capacity at this stage to go around for a while, and I think so does the overall market. And you also are right in saying that the volume of international and conventional activity is not likely to skyrocket very &#x2013; anytime soon.</p>
          <p>With that said, though, the investment into our high end service lines such as WesternGeco, wireline and drilling &amp; measurement, in particular for deepwater and exploration type of activities there's a lot of activities that go along with these activities and the returns both on the capital and the return on sales is obviously very good to that. If the market is there, we will happily invest into those businesses as long as we get the right returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the investment in seismic is primarily technology, not vessel spend right now, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have two vessels under construction which will be delivered in 2014 where a significant part of the CapEx associated with those vessels will be taken in 2013. Also as we continue to ramp up the coverage of isometrics on our seismic vessels, that will also be a significant CapEx spend. Seismic over the next few years will be a significant CapEx spend for us provided that the market continues to head in the direction we see now.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Paal. Back to the international outlook for a second and recognizing the fact that, as you mentioned, the outlook for 2013 should begin to crystallize much better towards year end. But it doesn't &#x2013; it's not all that obvious to me that the IOCs even with very generous oil prices are generating significantly abundant cash flows, surplus cash flows, which leads to the same rate of growth that we saw this past year. I'm curious as to how just conceptually how growth rates in 2013 could match 2012 if the cash flow generation is going to be less generous and then I mean is a swing factor the NOCs, greater sense of urgency on the part of Petrobras, more catharsis in West Africa, greater uplift in Saudi, how do we match those growth rates year over year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I'm not saying that we will match the growth rates. I'm just saying we maintain a positive outlook on the international market and we see growth in 2013 as well, right? So it is still &#x2013; typically we don't even talk a lot about the coming year in the &#x2013; after Q3. We typically leave that to January, but like I said we maintain a positive view on next year.</p>
          <p>I think it's probably better to look at maybe you can switch from activity and revenue to earnings, right? And I would just say that we obviously continue our focus on growing total earnings and that's through the top line and margins and I would say that assuming no major negative change in the global economy and no further setbacks and a second leg down in North America, we are at this stage aiming for double digit EPS growth in 2013, and that would be a combination of top line growth as well as margin improvement. So I think it's too early to kind of break it down to look at what the IOCs and the independents and NOCs are going to spend next year because we really don't have the data. But we are aiming for double digit EPS growth in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. Secondly, with regard to sort of coming back to the near term here, you mentioned you're not going to witness the same seasonality with regard to the contract business thanks to good bookings and the South Atlantic margin. Do you have a window into the outlook for year-end multi-client sales at this stage in the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really, other than that there is a lease round in November in the Western Gulf and there is another one in March in the Central Gulf. Typically the way the fourth quarter goes when it comes to multi-client sale, it's down to the last week of December when we finalize the last major sales.</p>
          <p>So it's difficult to say what it's going to end up on, but I would just say in North America or in Gulf of Mexico there's a lot of positive sentiments around the outlook for the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling rigs continue to rise. We will be at pre-Macondo levels the end of the year. The lease rounds that are announced I think is a positive. So we maintain a positive view on the business there overall. So I would expect there would be a good multi-client sales in Gulf of Mexico in Q4, but it's going to come down to the last week of December.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about Canada, longer term here. By our math, it's probably still north of 10% of your North American revenue stream, and we found there's been some conjecture whether or not this lower rig count has been more transitory as opposed to something structural changing within the Canadian market. As we look out to next year, I know you mentioned earlier that you're aggressive in right sizing your North American operations but as you see Canada going forward here, do you feel like you're properly right sized for how you see the longer term activity there in that market or do you think the industry as a whole is frankly probably overcommitted to that market at this time?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we were a bit surprised when we looked at, when we saw the recovery in the rig count over the past quarter. We were expecting it to be pretty much in line with last year. Now, this is a combination of high gas storage levels as well as weather and soft road conditions. So like I said before, we're expecting growth again for Q4 and Q1, but the activity levels are going to be well below last year.</p>
          <p>With that said, I think overall Canada, they have a lot of resources, both unconventional gas liquids as well as heavy oil. So there will be a lot of activity I think in Canada going forward. We have in my mind a good setup there. And we will continue to invest into it as the market evolves. Where we probably have more opportunity going forward is in the heavy oil which I think we are less represented than we are, for instance, in the shales and in Eastern Canada. But overall we maintain a positive view on Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So as you see it going forward, you're right sized properly for that, for the activity levels you forecast and actually be looking to put some incremental services in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, my follow-up would be just as we think about international just near term, is there anything, Paal, that would alter the view of kind of what we saw in 4Q as we think about the seasonal uptick that you typically get in your business from year end product sales and the like that fourth quarter revenue growth internationally should be pretty strong here as we look to 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see anything largely different than what we would expect in previous years. It's typically a uptick in fourth quarter sales both linked to software, say hardware completion sales as well as multi-client. So there's always some variation and uncertainty what happens with respect to those sales, but overall we expect that to occur again this year, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because as I look at fourth quarter 2011 you were up high single digits in eastern hemisphere third to fourth quarter. That's probably not unreasonable to think about for 4Q this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't looked at the numbers but I would say that a similar type of uptick as we saw last year is not unreasonable to expect.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paal, I wanted to follow up on some comments that you made back at the last analyst meeting in Boston with respect to the supply chain and procurement initiatives. Can you give us a progress update as to how far along you are vis-&#xE0;-vis those targets and perhaps some indication of the impact that's had on the P&amp;L thus far? I know it's a big part of the execution program, but focusing more on the cost side of the equation as opposed to execution in the field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So I think if you split it into quality and efficiency, I would say the quality part we have worked on now since 2008, 2009. And it's starting to have a meaningful impact in terms of the overall reliability of our services. And you see that in particular in a segment like Drilling and Measurements. So that is part of why I believe we are superior when it comes to execution strength from a quality standpoint.</p>
          <p>Now, the other parts that I referred to over the last quarter was more linked to the efficiency side. And this has much more to do with internal things like asset utilization, transportation, shared services and these types of things. I would say we are in a much earlier stage of capitalizing on those benefits. You always get some low-hanging fruit as you start focusing in on things. But these programs are multi-year. And you know we will see gradually fruits of them coming forth in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you remind us of what the targets are for that program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have targets, but I haven't shared the targets and I don't intend to share them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other question I had was with respect to the shale workflow. You know, as we're moving from a horsepower-driven market, everybody's trying to differentiate themselves and one of the common terms that we've heard just in the last few months has been around the notion of workflow. Can you address the competitive advantages you think that Schlumberger has with respect to workflow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've been talking about workflow now for a couple of years. I find it interesting to see that the broader industry is now taking up the concept and also want to take part in it, right.</p>
          <p>So the advantages we have is starting off with reservoir characterization and our ability to basically establish three dimensional models that can predict variation in shale quality similar to what we can do in conventional reservoirs. Now when you have that capability you can firstly place your wells in the right position aerially.</p>
          <p>And secondly, when you evaluate the quality of the rock in the horizontal section, you can also complete the parts of the horizontal section, which is most likely to be actual flow. Today there's a significant part of the horizontal sections that are fracked that never actual flows anything, which means the frac itself was probably a waste.</p>
          <p>The then last part also has to do with how you frac these wells. Today we create a very deep fracture network and we only are able to prop a small part of it, which means that all the horsepower and the water that you use to create the deeper fracture is also a waste.</p>
          <p>So I would say that we have a very clear view on where the waste in the current process is, and we have technologies and workflows that can help our customers address these. We see a further uptake of these technologies and these workflows in North America and for the projects that we are involved in internationally, which are more exploration or appraisal-focused, we always use these workflows overseas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you had to sort of gauge growth internationally versus, say, penetration of workflow domestically, which would grow faster, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to say. I would say in the international market, the two markets that I would say would have the most meaningful activity growth in the coming couple of years would be Argentina and China. And it's interesting to see that YPF seems to be quite eager to pursue the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina. So there's a fair bit of rig activity moving into the Vaca Muerta and I think in that sense we are a lot more optimistic on the activity outlook for Argentina at this stage than maybe what we were one quarter ago.</p>
          <p>And you also have seen some of the moves we have been making in China recently and that's again at the back end of our view that China also will see a good growth in both tight gas and shale gas going forward. So to what extent that is going to generate growth versus the penetration in North America I think is it's a bit of a toss-up, but I would say more and more customers in North America are interested in the shale workflow and the associated technology that we have to go with it.</p>

          <p>Paal, you recently made some very positive comments regarding the clearly attractive subsidy market and certainly I understand you may be in the early stages of looking at opportunities. But two questions. Would potentially a JV or an alliance with a subsea production company make sense around the now wholly-owned Framo business?</p>
          <p>And two, given that you do now own Framo outright, would you consider bidding directly on subsea separation opportunities in the offshore markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>When it comes to generally how we, what we will do in the subsea market going forward, that's something that we're still evaluating. So I wouldn't provide any specific comments or any plans that we may or may not have in terms of how we address the market going forward.</p>
          <p>What I wanted to do when I put subsea on the agenda earlier this quarter was just to indicate our view on what the opportunity in subsea is, and a lot of the opportunity evolves around the fact that the recovery rates are an average half for subsea developments compared to what conventional top side developments are. If you look at the capabilities we have in terms of subsurface understanding, modeling and prediction, the ESPs, the intelligent well completions and Framo, as you rightly point out, we have a lot of the ingredients that can help drive recovery from these type of developments.</p>
          <p>So would we bid directly or independently on processing projects? We would have to look at how big they were and how we potentially could align ourselves with other players that have some of the capabilities and some of the, I would say, technologies that also needs to go into that project. But we are undertaking a number of significant projects with Framo already. Some of them we highlight in the press releases that we send out every quarter. And I would just say that Framo as it is today is one of our fastest growing product lines and they're at the cutting edge of technology. So as it is today we are very pleased with how it's performing.</p>

          <p>Fair enough. Great business. And then as a follow-up, or a separate question, thoughts on Mexico and Russia for 2013? Both appear they could be a bit stronger with new opportunities specifically in Mexico and what type of opportunities do you see next year in both areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start with Mexico, I would say we have quite a positive activity outlook on Mexico driven by both land and offshore and offshore both shallow water and deepwater. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity for Pemex continues. We have a significant presence on that. There is also continued focus on mature fields in Mexico and the potential for more SPM activity. And there's also now more focus again on the shales in the north region as well from the Pemex side. So I would say that the overall view on Mexico is quite positive for us going into 2013.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Russia, quite similar. Also positive. We expect to see again continued growth in Western Siberia, where we have a very strong position through our local presence there. And then you'll have continued exploration activity, for instance, in the Baltic and Barents Sea and we see activity for Sakhalin and the Caspian region.</p>
          <p>So you're right to point out Mexico and Russia as positives going into 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, maybe you can speak a little bit, guys, to SPM. You just touched on it with Mexico, I know. But can you give us a sense perhaps the run rate in the third quarter how that compares to where it was a year ago or a couple of years ago on the top line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't disclose those details, other than we have, if you look at the number of projects that we have won and are in the process of taking on at this stage, we are, I would say, significantly up in terms of overall activity and also overall the number of barrels that we actually manage. So a lot of the contract wins that we've had have been in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The Shushufindi project is probably the biggest project we've ever taken on. And the ramp up has now been completed. We're operating five rigs in this project and we are pretty much on track for the work program and for the production profile that we laid out to achieve.</p>
          <p>The other project is in the Carrizo project in Mexico, where again, we are just in the process of mobilizing now or are more or less finished. And we are starting to mobilize for Panuco.</p>
          <p>So overall I can't give you the exact number for revenue or for production, but we split SPM out from IPM about a year ago and we did that to put a lot more focus onto these production incentive contracts because it is a differentiated growth opportunity for us given the capabilities we have here and also the margins for this type of business is highly creative to the overall margins of the company, and that's why we are continuing to pursue them.</p>
          <p>Now, the overall sales process for these type of projects is quite long. There's a lot of due diligence work needed to go in. And I would say that we're not accepting every opportunity. If we're not satisfied with certain elements of how these contracts are set up, we will turn them down. And we have turned down contracts even recently that we decided were not good enough for us. So this is all about portfolio management and risk management, and we will take our time in terms of how we grow the business but there's a lot of opportunities out there. And we will continue to pursue them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that color. You anticipated a couple of follow-on questions anyway, but I'll sneak in another one in the same area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you can give us some sense of the degree to which, as it sits today, with what you've won, there's a performance kicker tied to SPM or how integral is that to your selling process? Do all of them have performance bonuses presumably based on production increases and the like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the SPM projects are performance-based. If it's only turn-key drilling or normal contracts, we don't classify them under the SPM product line. So this is where we are typically paid on a fee per barrel. So we will invest the value of our products and services. We will agree a decline curve with our customer, and the production that we will generate through our investment on top of that decline curve, we will get a certain fee for barrel for. And that's overall how we're paid. And that's why generally this will generate cash for our customers, and there are ways &#x2013; this is a way for them to unlock maybe aging assets that is not really a priority for them to spend their cash on. And that's why this is quite a good business model.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of how this will be a growth avenue for us going forward, it's still a relatively small part of our business, but again we continue to focus on it and we will continue to grow it in, I would say, in a somewhat conservative way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Do you think it's relatively less or more capital intensive than the balance of your business? Simon, have you looked at it specifically that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capital associated with SPM projects is not more than our regular business. What is more than our regular business is sometimes you have investments up front. And this is part of the overall evaluation of the project and how we will -- how much is the cash flow required up front and the investment, and the investment is not in CapEx, the investment in services that are spent ahead of time in anticipation of the uptick in the production and therefore the additional revenue that will generate. We are very conservative on how we will account for these projects. And there is a regular evaluation of the potential of the additional revenue and additional production that will basically compensate for the initial investment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paal, I think in your remarks you talked about new wireline tool introductions in the quarter, and your largest competitor also talked about that this morning and theirs was focused very much on the deepwater and in return they mentioned the Gulf of Mexico. Can you talk a little bit about what your new wireline tools are that you're introducing and what market they're earmarked for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the two latest that we've introduced it's the Dielectric Scanner and the Litho Scanner, it's all part of the scanner family. The Dielectric Scanner is focused in on formation evaluation in carbonates and heavy oil and mixed salinity. So these are special types of measurements with relatively broad applications, as you can see. The Litho Scanner is again a formation evaluation measurement linked to shale, which gives you shale composition and also total organic content. So what we're trying to do on the formation evaluation side in wireline at this stage is to focus in on these, I would say, complex reservoirs or unconventional reservoirs in terms of formation evaluation both in terms of the fluid determination as well as the composition of the rock. So those are the two, I would say, latest main introductions that we've done recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a follow on, if the domestic rig count, domestic meaning U.S. land rig count, were to fall by another 10%, would you consider wireline or LWD prices to be at risk of going down under that scenario?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if the overall North America land rig count was to drop by 10%, I think I would be concerned about the ability to hold pricing on the other services on land, that being Drilling or Wireline. Like I said, we already are seeing some early signs of weakness in coiled tubing, whether that's going to continue or it's more of a Q3, Q4 effect which will bounce back next year, it's too early to say. But it's really the first product line that we've seen pressure in so far. The other ones are holding. But you're right to point out that if the rig count was to go down overall further, then I think there might start to be pressure on the others. We haven't seen anything yet. But that is something that I would probably worry about.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We have time for one final question from the line of Jud Bailey with ISI Group. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about a couple of markets. Paal, you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the work you're doing in China. And I was wondering if you could give us a little more color just on that market, how we should think about it in terms of growth opportunity and what kind of product lines you're utilizing the most?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what's happened in the China market recently is that there's a lot of drive I think from the government to develop the unconventionals, both the tight gas as well as the shale gas. They're importing LNG at very high prices, and they have a significant unconventional gas resource in the country which they're very keen to develop.</p>
          <p>So tight gas remains the main focus of the three main Chinese national oil companies, but shale gas, the government has classified, not as a hydrocarbon, but as a mineral. And when it's classified as a mineral, it is basically open for any other company to bid for licenses and actually go ahead and do work. So there's a lot of interest from other type of companies, whether it's utility, coal companies or just private equity companies, to come in and take licenses in shale and to start developing them.</p>
          <p>Now, very few of these have any capabilities when it comes to reservoir evaluation or actual well site execution when it comes to these things. They don't have their own service companies, which the three main Chinese companies have. So that's the opportunity for us to have significantly more penetration of the shale market in China as it evolves going forward.</p>
          <p>And this is again why we have made some of these moves in terms of joint ventures. So the joint venture with Chongqing is linked at the reservoir evaluation standpoint while the joint venture we signed this quarter with Anton Oil is more focused on IPM activities around well construction and fracking of these shale gas wells. So there's a reservoir aspect to it and there's the full portfolio of drilling and production-related activities that goes with it as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's interesting. And would you say the better opportunity is market penetration or just the growth of the overall market itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's actually both. In the past, we've had limited penetration because the state oil companies have their own service arms. We do some of the high end activities for them. We help them out with certain things, but there's a lot more opportunity in the shale now for these other players to do a much more significant part of the work. So I think that's where the opportunity lies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My last question is just on Brazil. They've taken delivery &#x2013; Petrobras has taken delivery of a lot of deepwater rigs the last year so. They're going to get more active in some of their presalt development. But another initiative of Petrobras is trying to stem some of the production declines in the Campos. I was curious to get your view on that market and the opportunities for growth and to what extent you may be talking to Petrobras on some of their production issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say just in general we maintain a positive view on Brazil. There has been delays in terms of rig start-ups, rig arrivals during this year and also when Petrobras turned some of their deepwater capacity towards production that obviously impacts our drilling-related lines as well. They're putting priority on, like you say, stemming the decline and getting production back up again, so that makes sense, and we will work with them in whatever capacity we need to to help them out with that. But overall Brazil is going to show good growth going forward. There are probably going to be some bumps along the way, but we are there. We have a very strong presence. We have a very good relationship with Petrobras, and we'll work with them the way they want us to.</p>
