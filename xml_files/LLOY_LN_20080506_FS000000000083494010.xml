          <p>Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lloyds TSB Interim Management Statement May 2008 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 6, 2008. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Tookey. Please go ahead, Mr. Tookey.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning everyone, and thank you also for joining the call. Perhaps I can start by highlighting some of the key points of this morning's announcement, and then open the call to questions. As you all know, over the last few years the Group has established a high quality, more sustainable stream of relationship based earnings. Our focus has clearly been on building strong customer relations, whilst improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. And I'm pleased to confirm we've continued this trend over the last few months, building on our strong performance last year with an excellent performance in UK Retail Banking, and continued progress in Insurance and Investments.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale and International Banking too our relationship banking businesses have continued to make substantial progress. The impact of market disruption has continued to be a feature but, as was the case in the second half of last year, the impact within our Wholesale and International division has been relatively limited, about 380 million. And this further demonstrates the relatively prudent business model that we have put in place throughout the Group over the last few years.</p>
          <p>I would also point out there have been some benefits to the Group as a result of the recent turmoil in financial markets as we have benefited from a strong uplift in many of our savings, mortgage, and corporate businesses. Excluding the impact of this market dislocation and insurance-related volatility, we remain firmly on track to deliver a good performance in the first half of 2008 despite the more challenging economic environment in which we're operating. On this basis, each division, and the Group delivered positive  duals and double-digit profit before tax growth in the first quarter of 2008, and this has been done against the backdrop of a slowing economy and falling consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>And it's perhaps worth pausing for a moment to reflect on our current view of the economic outlook, although this has not changed fundamentally in the three months since we announced our 2007 results last February. Many of the recent trends evident in UK and global macroeconomic data remained in line with our previous thoughts. A weaker US economy, and in the UK, lower consumer and business confidence; some falls in house prices, and the continuance of the liquidity squeeze despite high levels of employment. Overall, our lead indicators continue to point to a marked economic slowdown in 2008 rather than recession, followed by a rise in GDP growth in 2009. So against this background, our progress so far this year is particularly pleasing, and a further endorsement of the quality of the Group's business model.</p>
          <p>Just touching briefly on our liquidity position, throughout the recent liquidity crisis we've continued to fund well, and at market-leading rates. Essentially, we've been funding on a business-as-usual basis with our overnight funding continuing comfortably at sub-LIBOR rates. The liquidity crisis has been another situation in which our relationship model has proved itself. One of the key reasons for our strong funding profile is our high and growing customer funding base. We have substantial customer deposits, the majority of which are sticky relationship deposits. This includes some &#xA3;50 billion of current account balances. As a result of the strength of our customer funding base, our overall wholesale funding requirement is significantly lower than many of our peers.</p>
          <p>Net-net, all this translates into a funding advantage for the Bank, such that throughout the recent period of market turbulence we have been in a very strong competitive position and this has enabled us to continue growing our balance sheet in both the retail and corporate businesses. Having not aggressively leveraged our balance sheet in recent years, we've been able to maintain consistent balance sheet growth, continuing to support our customer franchise.</p>
          <p>Overall sales growth remains strong in the first quarter of 2008, and we continue to keep a tight focus on costs, improving productivity and efficiency, as well as investing for future growth. As you've come to expect, revenue growth remains well ahead of cost growth, resulting in a further improvement in the Group's underlying cost income ratio. In addition, our productivity program remains on track to deliver net benefits to the Group of approximately &#xA3;250 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving now to briefly review each of the divisions: the UK Retail Bank continues to make excellent progress with further increases in product sales and continued strong revenue growth. We've continued to make good progress in the acquisition of new current accounts, and our savings products continue to perform well, particularly bank savings and cash ISAs. Our Wealth Management business has also seen a significant up-tick in new business flows.</p>
          <p>In our Mortgage business, by continuing to achieve good levels of growth in a slowing market, we significantly improved our market share of net new mortgage lending in the first quarter of 2008, whilst continuing to maintain prudent new business loan to value ratios. Recent levels of mortgage allocations continue to be strong and new business net interest margins have improved considerably over the last year as we benefit from both a market-wide increase in interest spreads, and our relative funding advantages.</p>
          <p>In terms of retail credit quality, our arrears and delinquency trends in both the secured and unsecured lending portfolios have remained satisfactory. As a result, we are reiterating our guidance that we do not expect the 2008 first-half retail impairment charge to be significantly different from that in the first half of last year, notwithstanding that lower house prices will lead to higher formulaic provisions in the mortgage business. So we're continuing to make excellent progress in the Retail Bank, and, encouragingly, this process continues to be income led.</p>
          <p>In Insurance and Investments, we've continued to achieve growth in the bancassurance channel, although trends slowed slightly during the first quarter of 2008 as a result of a switch away from equity-based products towards cash-based products. In the IFA channel, sales of individual pensions were robust. However, a significant reduction in the sales of savings and investment products, largely as a result of the uncertainty caused by proposed changes to the Capital Gains Tax regime, led to an overall reduction in new business sales. Scottish Widows continues to make improvements in service and operational efficiencies, and this has led to another excellent cost performance.</p>
          <p>In Wholesale, we have continued to make substantial progress in our relationship banking businesses, although the overall divisional performance has clearly been affected by the recent market dislocation. Our Commercial business continues to go from strength to strength with strong growth in business volumes and improved efficiency. In addition, we've made further good progress in developing our corporate relationship banking franchise supported by a strong cross-selling performance.</p>
          <p>Corporate and small business asset quality has remained strong. The underlying level of new corporate provisions, excluding the impact of market dislocation, is expected to remain at a relatively low level during the first half of 2008, albeit higher than in the first half of last year. In terms of market dislocation, clearly no bank can be immune from what has been going on, however, our limited exposures in the key areas of concern mean that we are relatively well positioned compared to many of our global banking peers.</p>
          <p>In our statement this morning, we provided a breakdown of the impact on our profit and loss accounts in the first quarter of the year, together with an update on our key asset exposures as at the end of March. We've now written down our SIV capital notes by around two-thirds, and have a residual exposure of only &#xA3;35 million. Our back-up liquidity exposures have also reduced since the end of last year.</p>
          <p>The largest area of impact on our profit and loss account was in the mark-to-market fall of &#xA3;278 million on our credit trading book, which reflects the market-wide repricing of liquidity, and to a lesser extent, credit. We remain confident in the underlying quality of these assets, which mainly relate to European and US non-sub-prime ABS, as well as corporate loans, and expect a recovery in values when the market returns to a more normal state. Cancara, our conduit, is performing well. Over 99% of the ABS bonds in Cancara are AAA rated, and since its inception in 2002, there's never been a default on an asset within Cancara. Cancara continues to fund well in its own name, at market-leading rates, and without having to utilize the Group's liquidity backstop facility.</p>
          <p>The Group's capital position remains in good shape, and the rate of risk-weighted asset growth in 2008 is expected to be consistent with our previously indicated high single-digit, low double-digit range. As you know, our strong transition to Basel II at the beginning of the year means that the Group maintains robust core Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios.</p>
          <p>In summary then, we have continued to grow our relationship businesses by enhancing our long-term customer franchises. The momentum established in our core businesses over the last few periods has continued with double-digit underlying profit before tax growth in each of our divisions in the first quarter of the year. Overall, the market dislocation impact has been limited, and reflects our more prudent business model. We have a strong liquidity position and robust capital ratios. We continue to fund at market-leading rates, which gives us a clear competitive advantage, and we remain firmly on track to deliver a good trading performance for the first half of the year, notwithstanding the slowing UK economic environment, which we have been preparing for over the last few years, and we remain confident in our earnings growth prospects.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mike Oliver and I are happy now to take any questions that you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Lee Goodwin of Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Tim. Good morning, everybody. Just a question, please, on credit, i.e. I was just trying to maybe read a little bit more into your comments today as to the trends. I noticed that you're saying that the, in Wholesale for example, that you'll be at a higher level than the first half of last year. There was actually a tick-up in the second half of last year, leaving aside market dislocation issues, and I wonder if you could just confirm whether the charge is going to be higher than the second half of last year, or give us a better of sense of the trend therefore. And similarly, on just in terms of the retail charge, I wonder if you could confirm whether when you say that the charge will not be significantly different from the first half you mean in absolute terms or is as percentage of the book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lee. Let's deal firstly with the question on corporate. The comment that we're giving really is not a change of previous guidance on corporate credit. We've been saying for some time now that we've been enjoying relatively benign corporate impairment conditions for the last few years, and at the moment we really don't see much evidence of that changing. Notwithstanding that comment, we do see there being a higher charge in the first half of this year than we saw in the first half of last year. But at the moment we're not giving any particular guidance on the full year. Your second point was on credit, and the answer is absolute rather than relative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a good question. Is that all right, Lee?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. That's helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mike Trippitt of Oriel Securities. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Just a couple of questions actually. One on the mortgage market, I don't know if I can just pin you down a bit more on the scale of net lending you're achieving at the moment, because you had a deliberately fairly low, fairly subdued second half last year, I think about 3.5% share of net, but with a pick up in the fourth quarter. I just wondered if you could give a sort of a comparison compared either the second half last year or first half of last year? I've got a follow-up just on credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mike, what we have seen in the first few months of this year is an increasing level of applications for mortgages. The way we've responded to this is to make sure that we maintain our very high standards around credit criteria, around income multiples of affordability, and our loan to value ratios. Notwithstanding that, we've been able to do both on the gross as well as the net, a significantly higher proportion of new business, and that's leading us to comment that both our market share, as absolute balances, will grow quite significantly in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So I think we're really making the comparison against last year as a whole, and comparing the first quarter against last year as a whole, and do expect to see a significant increase in our market share. But I think the important thing here is that we're doing this at the same sort of relative, well, not relative, the same prudent levels of affordability with our customers. So the quality of the book and the business that we're writing will remain strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm just trying to piece together the commentary on ABS and ABS CDOs. I understand what you're saying about some fall in the value of protection by about 58 million, but there is a comment that you're leaving a reliance on the CDOs protection totaling 187 million after the underlying fall in assets, and I'm just trying to see if there is a comparable figure that you showed in the disclosure last -- in 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mike, the comparable figure for last year was 155.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Against 187?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The 187 at the end of March compared to the 155 million of reliance at the end of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Peter Toeman of HSBC. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Just coming back on to the issue of credit, I was wondering whether you're confident about the Retail Bank's credit charge not exceeding the first half last year, reflected the fact that there may be some deterioration on the secured book higher mortgage arrears but there may be some scope for unsecured credit losses to come down.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the Wholesale book, you talked about credit charges rising, albeit from a low level, and you said that none of your indicators gave serious causes for concern, but I just wondered what the experience currently was as regards commercial property, and how the acute falls in commercial property might be impacting your portfolio and your assessment of credit risk on -- in the commercial property space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mike, let's -- shall we pick up on, first, the credit point? The guidance that we gave at the year-end, which we're reiterating today, is that we don't expect the first half retail impairment charge to be significantly different from that of the first half of last year. I think in your comments though you were talking about not higher than last year, and our guidance is actually slightly different from that, it's not significantly different. But I'm not changing the guidance from that which we gave in February.</p>
          <p>You then went on to talk about the difference between unsecured and secured trends, and you are right in your assessment there in that we are seeing a slight reduction in unsecured, and it is, to a degree, being offset by the perhaps slightly formulaic increases that are necessary in the Mortgage business, largely driven by HPI. But, overall, the book is a good quality book, the trends are right, we're very happy with the level of credit quality on new business, and we're happy with the guidance that we gave at year-end, and are confirming it again today.</p>
          <p>You then went on to talk about Wholesale, Peter, and in terms of indicators there, we -- there's almost a risk here that we've been saying for too long that we see no signs of corporate provisions returning to what we have described as a more sort of normalized level, but it is true that, at the moment, we don't see any major change in the indicators that would cause us to be more concerned. In particular, with regard to commercial property, I think it's important there just to remember the Group's strategy here. We take a relatively conservative approach to this. We write virtually no speculative development exposures, and therefore, our loan to values really are holding up very well in terms of the risk of impairment against the slight reduction that we've seen in commercial property values over the last, what, six or nine months. So it's not an area of the book where at the moment we feel especially concerned.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Tim Sykes of Execution. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Tim Sykes from Execution. Good morning. I've got a few questions here. The first one is on your deposit performance, well done. I just wondered how significant you thought customers' perception of your capital position was in winning those deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Tim, thanks for recognizing the positive statement that we put in the IMS on the growth in deposits. It's nice to hear -- to see people reading the good stuff as well as alongside all the other comments. In terms of how customers perceive us, clearly there has been a flight to quality, and it's difficult to read exactly in customers' minds what it is that they receive -- they see as being quality about the Lloyds' name, but let's remember that our Corporate Bank has just won, for the fourth year running, the CPI award for corporate bank of the year, and the Retail Bank, seven years running, won the award for being most trusted bank.</p>
          <p>So there's a combination here of what we're doing with the brand, what we're doing about our improving customer service, what we're doing about providing multiple channels in which -- which gives customers different ways in which they can contact us and do business with us, and our focus on sort of UK-based call centers, easy access through the Internet. There's a whole combination of things in there which is making customers really enjoy a high level of confidence in the way Lloyds TSB is servicing them, and I'm drawing out comments there from both Retail and Corporate because we regard each as critically important to showing ourselves as being very customer-friendly, and it's clearly working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you think those deposits are going from HBOS or the building societies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're going to be coming from a variety of sources, and one of the key things here is, of course, we're not attracting that money with necessarily what I would call hot money rates. We're not looking to have the interest rate or the deposit rate that is going to attract money today that then flies away tomorrow when we're beaten by 5 or 10 bps by another market-leading rate. This is all around growing the customer franchise, and making sure that we grow the types of customers that we want that we can then cross-sell into and extend our propositions to them to earn a greater share of their wallets and purses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This isn't just a liquidity market pressures phenomenon, Tim. We've been working on it, in fact, we flagged two years ago that we were going to increase our focus on the liability side by actually building those long-term more sustainable revenue streams coming through, and it's in the Bank's savings, it's in the Wealth Management where we've seen significant up-tick of business in the first quarter of the year. So this is an extension of what we've been doing over the last four or five reporting periods. Now, clearly we've had a step up over the last nine months or so as we've benefited from that flight to quality, but it's from our existing customers as well as from new customers coming in to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what proportion is new money; do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still a significant proportion of what's coming in, particularly over the last six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And the second question's really about the GDP assumption. You mentioned that you thought that we would see, was it a marked slowdown this year and then an improvement next year? Can you put some figures around that for us, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Our GDP assumption for the current year is for growth of 1.5%, and then we would expect to see a slight tick-up in that in the following year towards 2%, but probably not quite getting there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And any prediction on the house prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, actually, our views on house prices are fairly similar to our competitors in that we probably see about a 10% reduction over two years. Over this year and next year. 10% in aggregate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. Thank you. And just on your comments, I think, to the press, Tim, you made some comments about M&amp;A, can you just clarify what Lloyd's position is on M&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Tim. The comments that have been quoted this morning are really saying that there's no change in our position here. If there are more opportunities out there in the market today then that's not changing Lloyd's position in being very comfortable that we are in Phase II of our strategy, and knowing that we have a significant headroom for growth within our existing markets and franchises. I think we are clearly focused on an organic growth strategy, and it would be wrong for anyone to read any more into it.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. I have a couple of questions, please. One on capital, and one to follow up on credit again. On the capital position, if I take your current run rate of profitability, and I factor in the hits from treasury and the insurance volatility, and then put this double-digit risk-weighted asset growth on top of that, I end up with somewhere around 40 to 50 basis points of Tier 1 consumption during the course of this year, so my question's what is the floor you would look at for your Tier 1 ratio at the moment? And, all else being equal in terms of profitability growth, would you continue to be happy to grow your risk-weighted assets at a double-digit rate into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Manus, let's see if I can capture all those points. In terms of risk-weighted asset growth, I think it's -- because that's a common theme to a couple of the points you're making there. It's important to remember that when we moved on to Basel II, the absolute level of RWAs in the business fell quite significantly, and therefore the same level of pound growth that was described as high single-digit under Basel I actually equates to high single or low double-digit under Basel II. So our appetite for risk-weighted asset growth hasn't actually changed over recent reporting periods.</p>
          <p>In terms of the impacts on our capital base, let's just look at where we were at the start of the year. We had a very strong total ratio at 11%, we had a 9.5% Tier 1 ratio, and a 7.4% core Tier 1 ratio. So we have a very strong set of ratios that we've come into the current year with. Now, how those ratios perform, I think it's important to recognize you're talking about the treasury items there. If you're referring to the items that get their mark-to-market adjustments through reserves --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It was just the P&amp;L hits that I was referring to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the P&amp;L hits? Okay. Well, let's remember that we've got some very strong trading performance going on here, and the &#xA3;378 million of P&amp;L write-downs in the first quarter are relatively modest. We're not at all complacent about them, don't get me wrong, but in the context of the size of the Bank and our robust capital positions the impact of these is relatively modest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But just confirm, you would anticipate that, at that rate of risk-weighted asset growth, your Tier 1 ratios will be lower by the end of '08, and you're happy, given current conditions, to use capital at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are -- we're certainly comfortable at the moment that our capital positions are robust, and let's just remember that in the first quarter here we saw a couple of interesting and not too bad months in January and February. Everybody who's reporting on Q1 has noted that March was a particular bad month with many of the mark-to-market adjustments moving quite some way against them, but, in April, people are seeing some of those marks come back. And running in parallel with that, we've got good strong trading performance in the Retail Bank, which is a big generator of earnings, and good solid performances in the other divisions as well. So against the context of double-digit profit before tax growth in the Group in the first quarter, I'm not trying to say that the marks are affordable and, therefore, don't concern us, but they don't cause us to change our appetite for risk-weighted asset growth.</p>
          <p>As long as we're growing assets of the right quality, and with the right relentless focus on making sure that we're growing where we want to grow, we're within franchise customers, we're not lowering our credit criteria to, if you like, take the wrong type of advantage of the high level of opportunities that are coming our way as people seek to do business with a bank that is clearly benefiting from its lower risk strategy. So our appetite is unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just a very quick follow-up on the various questions on Corporate asset quality, you mentioned in the text that Retail arrears trends were broadly stable but you didn't actually mention arrears trends within the Wholesale business. Should we assume that we're going to see a number which is flat on the year-end rate of about 114 basis points, or will that continue to rise as it did in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the guidance that we're giving today on Corporate trends is that we expect to see the charge slightly higher than the first half of last year. I haven't got that at my finger tips converted into bps for the halves I'm afraid, Manus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just the actual arrears trend underlying the impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arrears, I beg your pardon. Well, the arrears trends aren't causing us any concern on the Corporate side. We can generally speak, on the Corporate side, look forward quite a good few months because we have a very strong set of relationship management tools that we use to keep in very close contacts with our corporate customers, and that gives us a relatively early warning of any particular issues or problems with our corporate customers.</p>
          <p>And we have to remember that we've got a very, very strong business support unit. In fact, it's recently won an award for providing assistance and support to businesses that are getting into difficulties. So we do tend to have a very good early -- set of early warning indicators and ways of handling corporate customers. There's no major trend changes in there.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Jonathan Pierce of Credit Suisse. Please ask you question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Two questions, one on capital, one on impairment charges again. On capital, can I just try and draw you on what you think is an appropriate level of equity Tier 1, or give us a range on equity Tier 1 you're comfortable, particularly in the context of the big embedded value contribution? And maybe as a follow on to that question if I could invite you to comment on your dividend plans for 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, hi, Jonathan. We don't have a target for any individual ratio. Moreover the way I look at capital is to look at the different ratios that we have and consider how they are appropriate or relevant to our strategy and the earnings profile that we have. Now, if we look at our ratios of 11, 9.5 and you were focusing there on core Tier 1, which was 7.4 at the end of last year on a Basel II basis.</p>
          <p>Then across that combination you've got some pretty robust ratios. We don't have targets for any individual one ratio but what we do know is that those ratios stand us in pretty good stead, especially when you consider the relatively low risk profile that the assets on our balance sheet give us and the good level of sustainable earnings that the strategy is feeding through into the income statement. So the combination of all that together leaves me comfortable to describe everything really as pretty robust. You then, Jonathan, commented on dividend, I --- we're really sort of today talking about a trading statement, so in our position on dividends isn't really changed today. Decisions are taken on dividends as each dividend comes up to be due and that positioning really hasn't changed over the last few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the reintroduction of a progressive dividend policy last year is, from what you're saying, effectively in place this year as well. We should expect everything else equal, the dividend to continue moving up for be it at a very modest level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can regard our dividend as affordable when we take a view on earnings and the &#x2013; our ability to generate earnings in the current year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right thank you. The second question on the impairment charge again. Sorry to be so negative, but it intrigues me important. Can I just draw you on what you deem to be significant and not significant? So if the impairment charge in the retail bank is, I don't know, less than 10% up on H1 '07, would that be consistent with your comments here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it probably would be consistent with my comments, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally on the mortgage impairment comment, you're obviously talking about a 10% reduction outside for the next two years and IFRS precludes you from looking too far forwards. Can I just check that the increase in the mortgage impairment number that you are forecasting for the first half of this year is predominantly driven by any house price declines we'll see in the first half of this year, so it's not forward-looking as to what could occur in H2 or 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. Let's talk about retail and impairment, let's look at the mortgage impact on that. Your right to say that the impact on impairment has actually been driven by HPI and it's reasonably formulaic in the way that the IFRS provisions require what one's treats that. In actual fact if you look at our trends level then the level of our mortgage arrears is actually slightly lower than it was a year ago. So we're pretty comfortable with where that is as a whole. In terms of the word significant I think there's a danger here that we attach too much significance to a particular point. If you're going to put a number up and I'm going to comment on it there is a danger here we play chicken and egg until you end up with exactly the right answer.</p>
          <p>But as the number you were quoting you'd be looking at something there that would be pretty significant wouldn't you. Because I think you've got to look at it in the context of how the book is growing. And what we are guiding here is, look we're not expecting to see a significant difference year-on-year. And I think probably the kind of number you were talking about I think that would be outside my comfort zone.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning. I have a question on net interest margin. You mentioned that your new lending margin for retail &#x2013; for mortgages has improved. But can you give us some color on the retail division as a whole, also on the wholesale division and for the Group as a whole as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mamoun, good morning. Yes, we have said on mortgages that we have seen a significant increase in the margin. I think we described it as improved considerably over the last year. Let's remember that margins last year were actually quite tight in the first quarter. But the comment in the IMS today would be true quarter-on-quarter as well as looking at last year as a whole. In terms of how that rolls through into the overall retail book then rather sort of bizarrely growing the mortgage book could actually end up diluting overall the retail net interest margin because of the mix effect. So I think generally speaking we're seeing product margins in retail benefiting but the mix effect could be slightly adverse in the retail book. In wholesale, again, we are seeing benefits to product margins, particularly being helped by slightly better than stable deposits. But again the mix effect here may work slightly against us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning Tim. Back on capital I'm afraid. You talked about the various ratios that you looked at. Could you tell us how the debate is evolving in your mind, and with the rating agencies and the regulators, with reference to tangible common equity, either as a proportion of risk weighted assets or as a proportion of regulatory capital? Obviously at the year end there was something like a 2 billion gap between the core equity ratio number that you reported and your tangible common equity if we add in the extra available for sale write-downs that you have taken today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Ian that's an interesting question. I think that there's a risk with just focusing on one measure that you are talking about there as in tangible common equity. As I think I answered to somebody earlier, I tend to look at the ratios in a basket and then get myself comfortable over them all. And part of getting comfortable, I like to look at the risk profile of the business and the strategy that we are following. And, of course, Lloyds' strategy has got it to the strong position it is in today and there's no change to that strategy. So looking at any one individual ratio isn't something that we particularly do. But I know that, Mike, you do some of this with S&amp;P recently, do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you look at the rating agency part of what you're talking there Ian, the rating agencies have for some time now looked at the modified adjusted common equity, adjusted total equity. So they've already done a lot of this work getting back to what you might call tangible. And if you look at where we stand with all of the rating agencies and we're in pretty good shape, we maintain some of the strongest ratings of any bank in the world out there, still AAA rated by Moody's and still very strong credit ratings from both Fitch, Standard &amp; Poor's and DBRS. So looking at all of the measures, whether it goes from total capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, equity Tier 1, tangible common equity, or indeed any of the other adjusted modified ACE and ATE ratios. You combine them all and we're still in a pretty robust capital position.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike. And as some of your competitors re-capitalize around you, does that give you any sense of how your relative competitor advantage changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we look at where our relative advantage is right now it's on the high street. The core businesses are performing very well. As Tim just mentioned, we're in a situation where we're funding all of our current organic growth plans and we are in good shape. So we're out there, we've touched on the continuing ability to deliver that high single digit, low double digit risk weighted asset growth. And that's where our real advantage lies right now. We're bringing in good quality business across the piece.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Sorry it is a follow up on capital, but it sort of slightly follows on from Ian's question. Clearly your core equity position is stronger than most and we've had two banks that have had to sort of re-set their core equity targets. And your core equity is driving a very strong credit rating, as you say, and you're getting the deposit inflows. So I just wondered if you have a sense of what the sort of trigger point is, that if you went below the 7% level at the end of this year would that, even if you are not going to sort of say it explicitly, would that be a point at which you think credit rating agencies may take a different view? I am trying to sort of get a sense of what &#x2013; where you would see the floor, I suppose, in the current markets in terms of core equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, when it comes to the credit rating agencies they look at a whole combination of things. I don't think there is any one particular trigger. You look at where Moody's are in terms of their bank financial strength rating methodology. That looks at a whole range of things. And don't forget it's not just about capital it's about earnings generation, it's about strength and quality of your earnings, it's about the returns that you're generating, it's about the franchise growth; it's about building those long term customer relationship businesses and the quality of the balance sheet. And I would contend that we're very strong in all of those areas. So there is no one issue that these guys look at in isolation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A follow up really on the credit &#x2013; well a few questions if I can? I think arrears in the corporate book went up 80% year-over-year last year. I hear what you're saying about sort of no real leading indicators but could you give us a sense on what percentage change your seeing in your past due performance in Q1 versus Q4 of last year? So that's the first question. Second question is on the 387 million of write-downs through the P&amp;L. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of that is credit i.e. not going to come back and how much of its liquidity and therefore you'd expect to come back? And then in the retail bank, I was wondering if you could just tell us what the revenue and cost growth there, or thereabouts you're seeing at the moment and what growth you are seeing in mortgages and in deposits versus the year end? And if you could just clarify what percentage of your book is buy-to-let? And I've got a couple more, but if you could answer them that would be brilliant.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll deal with the first 14 then we'll come back for the other ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, excellent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of corporate, I think in terms of arrears trends you're probably looking at some of the disclosures that were put in place under the new IFRS-7 in our year end accounts, which have some slightly sort of difference in unusual classifications that one has to follow in classifying the debt. I think we look at the book in a much more granular way when we're actually managing the portfolio. And it's really at that more granular level that we are saying that we're not really seeing any particular changes in trends that would cause us undue concern on the corporate book. But notwithstanding that, we have several reporting periods now, enjoyed lower levels of corporate impairments that we would consider to represent a normalized level.</p>
          <p>You then asked about the PL write downs. I think what you were trying to understand there was the difference split between what might be regarded as liquidity issues versus credit. I think it's quite difficult to call. I think probably at the clearly credit end you would have the write-downs on our opposite capital notes. And at the liquidity end you would have probably the majority of the adjustments in the trading portfolio. But it's very hard to know quite where some of these marks are going to come or where they are going to end up at. We have seen an improvement in some of these positions in April, as we said. But, of course, if we were to try and close out these positions say, then we could actually risk turning what otherwise would be liquidity marks into actual credit marks and therefore losses and that's not our intention. So I can't give you a percentage split between the two. But I would say that it would be unlikely for the SIV capital notes item, for example, to come back.</p>
          <p>I think your third area of questions were then on retail. Retail, like all the divisions, has enjoyed a positive draws in the first quarter and, therefore, we can continue to see that being driven by strong revenue performance and a very tight control on costs. But I'm &#x2013; you know today is just a trading update and we'll go through the detail in how income and costs are performing when we get to the half year. I know you asked me a question on buy-to-let, and buy-to-let is about 7% of the overall mortgage portfolio. But the key thing to remember here is that that buy-to-let business level is very much focused on our existing customers, where we have a high degree of insight into the affordability of what they're doing and their overall financial position. So it's a very focused portfolio rather than one that's being built from any enquiries from buy-to-let landlords. Have I covered everything you asked Michael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Almost, very good. Just in terms of the growth in deposits and mortgages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh right sorry yes you did ask about that one. We have seen a good level of deposit growth; savings have been very strong in the banking group. And there's actually been a very, very successful cash IFA season as well. And I think that's, as we alluded to in the statement, has been probably to the slight detriment of the exposed -- equity exposed investments in Widows. But what is nice to see there is the way in which the Bank's assurance strategy that the Group follows by having a variety of products available through a variety of channels, means that customers can find products that suit their needs almost irrespective of what type of product their after. So the strategy is playing well there. In terms of mortgage growth, yes we are seeing growth in balances. The growth in market share is not just because we're doing similar volumes in a falling market. We're actually seeing higher levels of gross lending, as well as lower levels of redemption activity in mortgages. So the mortgage growth in net lending really is quite strong.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But no guide in terms of what percentage changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talk about a significant increase can't we. So a significant increase over the net flow share that we wrote for last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think, as you say, you didn't really do much first quarter last year, so just trying to get a gauge, because the market has shrunk a hell of a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, you can read that significant increase as over our gross position right now. So our outstanding stock position which is around -- between 8.5% and 9%, it's a significant increase over that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I'm just intrigued in the insurance and investments where you talk about double digit profit growth. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit more color, because as you say, the sales performance there has been sort of hit by just industry trends. So cost control seems to be quite good. But I was just wondering if you could give us a bit more color in terms of what's driving the overall profitability there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I'm happy to do that Michael, I'm glad you picked up on that point. I think two things come into play here, one is the cost control, as you say, really has been fantastic in the insurance investments division. We're very proud of the way that group has managed its costs. In addition the adjective that we use in the IMS around profit growth is notable in the sense of what we're trying to get across here is a flavor that it is notable, but after the comma it says this is largely driven by -- excuse me, its largely driven by an expected absence of last years unusually high weather related claims. In the first half of last year we had about 50 million -- 45 million, 50 million of additional insurance claims due to the floods in the North of England. And obviously, so far this year, touch wood, we haven't seen a repeat of those types of incidences. So that's one of the things that's driving the profit growth in I&amp;I.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, but that was in the -- as you say that was in the second half, and you made the comment in the first half as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael we had floods in around, sort of the Sheffield area in the first half of the year, into June time. And then the floods around Tewkesbury and Cheltenham had came through in July. So there was about the same level of abnormal provisioning in each of the first and second halves last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry I didn't mean second half I meant second quarter. I think -- and the comment you mean, you're talking about double digit growth in the first quarter and the floods were in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes in the first quarter last year it was a smaller number, didn't get much headline, but there was about 10 million or 12 million of flood claims in January. I think it was around Folkestone or somewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't remember where that was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was weather related claims in Kent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But -- look without trying to get too much into the detail of life and pensions accounting, I think it's important to remember here that the difference in accounting between life products and investment products. And if one sells less life products then you actually see a reduction in your income because you're accounting for something on an embedded value basis. In our IFRS results our OIC products get accounted for on a modified cash basis. So ironically, a slight reduction -- or a reduction in sales of those types of products actually mitigates the first year strain. And therefore year-on-year you can get a trend that looks slightly unobvious. And then you get a benefit to income trends if you sell less of your investment products. But by the time you look at everything on a full EEV basis, which is where our present value of new business premium statistics are calculated and therefore new business sales, then you do get to see an overall reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. So on an EEV basis your profits are down but on an IFRS basis they're up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the OIC products, yes, that's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And, sorry, just one last thing from me and it's -- you mentioned about the formulaic driver of mortgage provisions. I was wondering if you could give us some sensitivity for, say, if house prices did fall 10% this year what would that just naturally drive looking at your base of arrears in terms of basis points charge through in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you have that hypothetical situation you'd be looking at a few tens of millions of pounds on the retail impairment charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much for that. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Sandy Chen of Panmure Gordon. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning Tim, morning Mike. Just a couple of questions, the -- I probably missed this over the past couple of months, but given the recent ruling on overdraft charges, what's your outlook for fees and are you -- do you intend to treat many provisions below the line? And how much of that current account fee base would you see at risk and when, given the, what, I think 693 million in UK current account fees last year and 1.2 billion in other UK fees and commissions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Sandy thanks for the question. There's been quite a lot of going on over this in the last few weeks. I think the &#x2013; we were very pleased with the Court ruling, particularly that the judge agreed with the banks position on this that these items related to a provision of a service rather than any form of a penalty. The &#x2013; there is an awful long way to go still and we are looking forward really to getting this resolved for the benefit of our customers as quickly as possible and we'll work with the court as quickly as we can to get this fully resolved. But the position, as far as ourselves and levels of provision is concerned, but we won't actually be making any form of provision at all at the moment. We really do need to see how this plays out. And we would fully expect to see the continuing court rulings go in our favor. We recognized in this that the judge was actually very complimentary and singled our Lloyds as having a very good plain and intelligible terms and conditions with our customers, and that's clearly an important point we will be taking into account in the future court processes. So in that context we're not in an uncomfortable position on this. We really want to work -- to continue to work really with the other banks and the Courts just to get this completed as soon as possible so we can get clarity to customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then we're to consider the guidance today is not including any provisioning set aside for any potential overdraft kind of fee paybacks and all that kind of stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's right Sandy, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just on &#x2013; a bit of -- I know that 10% of UK house prices expectation, it's probably trying to put too much precision onto it, but on a year-on-year basis house prices have obviously just begun to peak down. Is that 10% on that kind of year-on-year base, or is it looking back to the point that it started to fall a couple of months ago?</p>
