        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for Grupo M&#xE9;xico second quarter earnings conference call. I am joined in this conference by Enrique Nava, Chief Financial Officer of Ferromex-Ferrosur; Genaro Guerrero, Chief Financial Officer of Southern Copper; and Jorge Pulido, our Head of Investor Relations. We're also joined by other executives of the Company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, we will first briefly comment on copper prices, to next highlight Grupo financial results, specifically addressing the main issues impacting the Company's profitability. Then we will comment on the Mining division's most relevant results, continue with the financial results of our Transportation division, and to finally give you an update on the Asarco situation and other matters.</p>
          <p>The London metals 2009 second quarter average copper price was $2.12 per pound, 45% lower than the $3.83 per pound average for the same quarter of 2008, but 36% higher quarter-over-quarter. This quarter we saw the continuation of the price recovery trend for most commodities, including increases in prices of 26% in zinc, 9% in silver, and 4% in molybdenum on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Copper was the best performer in the metals complex, with an average price increase of 36% from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>China's consumption has continued to be the main driver for copper. But the general perception has shifted from a temporary restocking and strategic stockpiling into a more sustainable real demand recovery based on the country's increasing momentum growth.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the improved risk appetite and the weaker dollar triggered a significant inflow of speculative investment into commodities, second only in magnitude to the one we saw in the second quarter of 2008. Copper has and will continue to benefit from this trend. And it is one of the commodities with the strongest fundamental outlook.</p>
          <p>We are starting to see some signs of tightness building up in the copper market once again. Inventories at LME [London Metal Exchange] and COMEX warehouses are currently at 1.1 weeks of demand. While we anticipate a significant restocking boost for industrial production, not for loss, in several countries.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the supply pipeline will continue to look stretched because of tight credit conditions, in addition to a structurally tighter scrap market. Under these circumstances, the Company feels increasingly positive that copper prices will hold over $2 for the rest of the year, maintaining its strong upward price momentum in the following years.</p>
          <p>With respect to molybdenum, we expect the price appreciation to continue, although at a more discreet pace, until a wider spread recovery is realized in the auto and airplane industries. The average price for this quarter was $9.10 per pound, lower 72% year-over-year and 4% higher quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Grupo M&#xE9;xico's financial highlights. We can report that the second quarter 2009, our total consolidated revenues was 1.1 billion, a decrease of 40% year-over-year and 29% higher than the first quarter '09. Net sales for the first half of the year were nearly 1.9 billion, a decrease of 46% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>As I briefly mentioned, this reduction is mainly attributable to lower metal price. And in the Railroad business, we saw a drop in revenues in dollar terms, due to a slowdown in the industrial activity and the peso depreciation. Enrique will explain in more detail the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the second quarter was 581 million, a decrease of 22% on a year-over-year basis and 12% lower from the first quarter 2009. Cost of sales in the first half was 1.1 billion, a decrease of 22% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The accumulated cost reduction of 317 million is mainly explained by lower prices in several of our key inputs. Fuel cost decreased 24%, electricity cost went down 39%, and spare parts and maintenance materials decreased 12%.</p>
          <p>Even if copper prices improve, the Company will continue its effort to reduce costs, improve productivity and maintain consumption and expense discipline, with the objectives of strengthening our position as one of the world's leading low-cost producers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the second quarter was 443 million with an EBITDA margin of 42%. This figure represents a decrease of 53% year-over-year. However, it is significant improvement from the first quarter '09, that's 61% improvement.</p>
          <p>Net income in the second quarter was 238 million, a decrease of 47% year-over-year, but an increase of nearly 13-times when you look at it quarter-over-quarter. In the second quarter 2009, total CapEx amounted to 184 million. Of this, 146 was spent in the mining division and 38 was spent in our transportation division. This represents an increase of 12 million year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The increase is explained mainly by investments related to the construction T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a SX/EW plant in Peru. As we've commented, this plant will produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes per year and we're expecting this to be ready by 2011. That's first semester of 2011. And we're also expanding our capacity at Toquepala, that will be an expansion of 100,000 tons.</p>
          <p>In the transportation division, our investments were made mainly for the modification and replacement of various tracks and to improve operating safety.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash, our total cash and debt, total consolidated debt at the end of June 2009 was a little south of 1.7 billion with a cash balance of 1.4 billion, which results in net debt of 254 million. Grupo M&#xE9;xico maintains a low debt level and healthy long-term debt amortization schedule. The first significant amortization is 200 million due in 2015. Between 2009 and 2014, the average debt amortizations will be 83 million per year. This cash position will support our operational needs and our capital expenditures program.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, on May 11 we paid our first quarter stock dividend of one share for every 100 Grupo M&#xE9;xico shares outstanding, which was roughly equivalent to 65 million. For the second quarter 2009, the Company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend payment in kind of one share for every 75 shares outstanding, which will be paid in August 19, 2009.</p>
          <p>And at current share prices, this dividend represents a disbursement of approximately 120 million.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the main developments of Southern Copper, but we'll try to keep this brief, as Southern Copper had its conference call yesterday.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter 2009, Southern Copper net sales were 825 million compared to nearly $1.5 billion for the second quarter 2008 and 622 million for the first quarter 2009. Cost of sales was 419 million, a reduction of 24% year-over-year, but 12% higher quarter-over-quarter. EBITDA was 318 million with an EBITDA margin of 46%. Net income was 175 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper's operation has been performing soundly and above our production budget. This quarter copper production was 120,000 metric tons, 2% higher than the second quarter 2008. It is important to note that excluding the 3,000 tons of Cananea production from the second quarter 2008, all other Southern Copper operating units have increased their production this quarter. La Caridad and our underground copper production increased by 9% and 5%, respectively. The Peruvian operations of Cuajone and Toquepala increased copper production by 3%.</p>
          <p>Smelter production was 2% higher this quarter than in the second quarter '08, and it is worth mentioning that during the second quarter '09, the Ilo smelter copper concentrate throughput was a little south of 300,000 tons. The highest smelter production obtained historically by Southern Copper. This is the result of the modernization of our plant that we've been commenting on in the past.</p>
          <p>The Company's second quarter 2009 cash cost per pound of copper, before byproducts, was $1.50 per pound, 35% lower than the $1.85 per pound for the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>Operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct was $0.51 per pound in the second quarter of 2009. This is $0.13 lower than the $0.64 registered at the first quarter '09. The very competitive cash cost achieved during second quarter '09 is a result of higher byproduct credits, particularly molybdenum, and higher production and prices, as well as operating efficiencies.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call on to Enrique Nava, who will discuss the main financial highlights of the railroad and infrastructure division.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much, Daniel. Good morning, everybody. I will now turn to the main results for the second quarter of 2009 of the Transportation division, represented by the subsidiary Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico, ITM: whose main subsidiaries are Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, GFM; owner of Ferrocarril Mexicano, Ferromex, and Ferrosur.</p>
          <p>Load volumes transported during the second quarter of this year measured in net tons/kilometer amounted to 10.26 billion and compares to the 10.79 billion of the second quarter of 2008. This is a year-over-year decrease of 5% as a result of a slowdown in the industrial activity in Mexico and reduced international trade with the United States of America.</p>
          <p>Load volumes in the first half reached 18.9 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. For the whole of 2009, we continue to estimate load volumes of 13.1 billion net ton/kilometer, which will represent a 5% decrease over last year figure.</p>
          <p>Second quarter 2009 net sales amounted to 232 million, a 20% annual decrease. Net sales in the first half reached 431 million, a 19% annual decrease mainly due to lower load volumes and the impact of the Mexican peso depreciation on sales denominated in pesos. However, net sales increased 17% over first quarter '09.</p>
          <p>The cost of sales was 155 million in the second quarter, a 13% decrease on yearly basis. The cost of sales in the first half reached 290 million, an 11% annual reduction. Including a reduction due to exchange variants of U.S. 88 million favorable, the main increases in costs were labor due to salary increase of about U.S. five million, diesel increase due to a 29% increase in the price per liter, net of an improvement in the ratio of diesel use per ton count a kilometer for a net of U.S. 17 million. Accident and cargo stalling U.S. nine million. As a consequence of the above, operating income was 47 million in the second quarter '09, a 39% decrease year-over-year representing an operating margin of 20%.</p>
          <p>EBITDA during the second quarter of 2009 was nearly 71 million, a 32% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 30% on net sales. EBITDA was 27% higher than one the first quarter '09.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the first half reached 126 million, a 32% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 29% of net sales. The net income during the second quarter of 2009 reached 40 million compared with 57 million, 30% lower year-over-year. Net income was 105% higher than first quarter '09.</p>
          <p>Net income in the first half reached 60 million, 32% lower than a year ago. Total capital expenditures in the first half '09 amounted 56 million compared with nearly 72 million, a fall of 23% year-over-year as no new locomotives have been acquired during 2009.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, CapEx spending have been mainly for the rehabilitation of rail tracks, enlargement, and new sidings, and the acquisition of railroad machinery, which have improved operating safety and produced savings in diesel consumption. For 2009, we continue to estimate capital expenditures of around 100 million, 43% lower than the 2008 figure.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss the result of our other important subsidiary Ferrosur, which currently does not consolidate into ITM. In the second quarter 2009, Ferrosur's total revenues were nearly 57 million, a decrease of 18% on annual basis. This decrease is mainly attributable to the negative impact of the currency devaluation in peso-denominated sales, despite the fact that load volumes transported were flat during this period measured in net tons/kilometers for a total of 1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Ferrosur's operating income was nine million in the second quarter '09, a decrease of 36% year-over-year. EBITDA during the second quarter of 2009 was 15 million, a 29% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 26% of net sales. EBITDA in the first half reached nearly 30 million, an 18% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 28% of net sales. Net income during the second quarter '09 was nearly seven million, a 43% decrease year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures in the first half '09 amounted to six million compared with 13 million, a drop of 53% year-over-year. For 2009, we estimate capital expenditures to be 23 million, representing an 11% annual decrease.</p>
          <p>On January 30, 2009, the Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Competencia, CFC &#x2013; Federal Competition Bureau &#x2013; issued its resolution to GM&#xE9;xico, ITM and some of its subsidiaries, stating that these companies were responsible of monopolistic practices and imposed fines related to the concentration of Ferrosur amounting to about 19 million. On June 9, 2009, the CFC confirmed its resolution and the fines imposed. We believe this ruling to be unlawful, so we will challenge it before the court.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Enrique. Thank you. Just to conclude, I will give you a brief update on the Asarco situation. I'm sure that you follow it most closely. As all of you know, the reorganization plans were submitted on the Corpus Christi court for the consideration of creditors. Our creditors will issue their vote before August 1 of this year. Creditors will be given the choice of selecting one or more plans and to indicate their particular preference. A series of hearings will be held thereafter, that is after August 10, and that will be for the judge to decide which reorg plan will prevail.</p>
          <p>We believe the plan presented by our subsidiary, Americas Mining Corporation, is the best alternative for creditors. Our plan offers greater cash recovery on the approval date with an immediate payment of up to 97% of the claims approved by the judge. While the Sterlite plan only provides approximately 75% immediate cash recovery and Harbinger plan only 65%.</p>
          <p>We will pay up to 100% of the claims with the amount recovered from the litigation against Sterlite. Our plan considers, in addition, 50 million in working and in cash for working capital and an additional 200 million line of credit to Asarco. It also guarantees the funding of this plan and we've established an escrow with the Bank of New York for this purpose.</p>
          <p>Finally, we offer greater certainty of credit with the highest recovery in cash, large payments offered under the other plans were dependent on the assignment of legal materials rights against Grupo M&#xE9;xico, which may never materialize. For all these reasons, we are optimistic about the possibilities of recovering Asarco and eliminating the contingencies related to the Transvaal litigation.</p>
          <p>Just briefly on the Cananea strike, as we commented on the last conference call, the Mexican Labor Board approved the termination of Cananea's labor relationships with individual and unionized employees as well as the termination of its collective bargaining agreement. And this ruling has been challenged has been challenged before the federal tribunals and it is expected that in August, next month, such litigations will be definitely resolved.</p>
          <p>The Company and the State of Sonora and the Federal Government are still working to restore the necessary legal and safety conditions to resume operations in Cananea. That is where we are, and we had our Southern Copper union counsel yesterday in Southern Copper call just to kind of give more details on this, but this is the current situation.</p>
          <p>With this we conclude our remarks for this quarter. And we'll be happy to answer any questions you might have. Operator, we'd like to open out the forum, please, for questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. Good morning, Daniel. I wonder if you could give us some more detail on Asarco, what could happen or what could you do in the case that Grupo M&#xE9;xico's plan is not chosen by the creditors? What would happen specifically in the case with the Brownsville litigation? Do you have any way to appeal on that? Or how do you see the risk of you losing the almost 30% stake that you have in Southern Copper? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe. Good morning. Well, first of all we feel very strongly as I just point out that our plan is a lot better, if you will, than the other two plans. But if for some reason, our plan is not favorable with the creditors and the judge ultimately, definitely there is a possibility to appeal and we will definitely exercise that option.</p>
          <p>Well, regarding Brownsville, as you know the judgment was entered last year. We've already appealed. And we feel very strongly that we have grounds for that appeal, I mean to win that appeal on itself. So basically that's the two routes we will follow if our plan is not the winner plan, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Daniel, could you please also help me understand, so also if the creditors choose the different plan, you can also appeal on that decision, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. That is correct. I mean -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But can you increase the offer or what can you do is just appeal in the court from the decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, the ballots have been sent out already. We're expecting &#x2013; I mean the dates, the way we look at it, I mean, there's a voting deadline for the 5th of August. So that is when the all the votes are going to be casted, and the judge will have the confirmation hearing, as it is technically referred to, where all the parties involved will discuss the three plans and ultimately make a decision.</p>
          <p>So after he makes a decision, and once the judge decides and once we hear through the appeal, I mean it's a matter of appealing. And we definitely have the right to appeal at that point, if our plan is not the prevailing plan, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alejandro Luciano with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my call. I just have one quick question. I'm trying to understand what the difference is between your plan and Sterlite's plan for bondholders of Asarco? Looking at the sort of recovery value that they've received, the difference between both. It's my understanding that bondholders will be reinstated and receive post-petition interest, is that true or is there a difference between a bondholder of Asarco will be treated under both plans? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, basically when you refer to post-petition interest, the difference is that our plan is not currently contemplating that and that we believe we can make them whole, if you will, up to 100% of their claims with the litigation rights that Asarco has against Sterlite. That is where we'll get them to 100%. I hope that answers the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So they basically will be paid 100%, but they will not be paid accrued interest, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, under the current plan that is the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then what's the difference between the Sterlite's plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main difference is that the Sterlite's plan has the litigation rights against Grupo M&#xE9;xico and that is the main difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I understand now. Thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rodolfo Angele with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel, good morning. Good morning everyone. I have one question still on the Asarco issue. Can Asarco in the meantime &#x2013; and we know that the reorganization process is going on &#x2013; can they in the meantime sell the shares of PCU that are under the escrow account? And if so, can you do anything to avoid that happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Rodolfo, that is a good question to clarify what's going on with that judgment. I mean the judgment was entered last year, as I said, and then we appealed. In the U.S., when you appeal in order to obtain a stay &#x2013; which is kind of like to freeze the effects of a judgment &#x2013; you have to post a bond, a supersedeas bond. Because of the size of the bond, I mean this bond was required, not for the part of the shares, but for the part of the dividends that were due to those shares, if you will. So that was, if you look at the order it's around $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>And that what we asked the judge was not to put a bond but to guarantee and obtain the stay with an escrow and we put in shares of Southern Copper instead of a supersedeas bond. I mean that was to us very positive.</p>
          <p>So that kind of freezes the effects. So, no, Asarco cannot sell Southern Copper shares at this moment, until the judgment is fully decided at the appeal level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-on here, so they cannot sell all the shares that they -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They cannot sell any shares. I mean, at this point, one way to see it is, at this point it is a first instance judgment, we've appealed that and the effects on the judgment are frozen until the appeal is decided. The way we will obtain that is by putting shares in escrow to guarantee that appeal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On that almost 1.4 billion, do you have a deadline to put cash or a bond in place instead of the shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the judge has asked that if our plan does not prevail, we will have to substitute those shares for bond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that is kind of like nitty-gritty stuff. So if you're looking for a deadline, what he has asked in the order is November 5. But obviously, looking at the schedule and timetable of the Asarco bankruptcy situation, it will be resolved much, I mean, much sooner than November 5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And then my next question was exactly that on timing. Can you just give us your best estimates for timing and key deadlines for the reorg process to get to an end, and we know exactly what's the end story for Asarco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Rodolfo, absolutely. As I said, I mean, now the ballots are out, the creditors are voting on the three different alternatives that they currently have. And August 5 is the voting deadline &#x2013; I mean for ballots to be submitted. After that there is a confirmation hearing from &#x2013; that starts August 10. And that is basically a trial, if you will, where the judge will evaluate that and will hear the parties, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And we estimate that approximately between the 10th and the 20th of August the judge will decide and confirm a plan, that is the 'term of art.' After the plan is confirmed, there is a 30-day period for appeals and other kinds of arts. And let's say if our plan is confirmed, we expect that then, after those 30 days, we need to put it in place and fund it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I'm sorry to insist, and maybe it's a silly question, but just to make sure I understand the process here. So the creditors are voting and they will &#x2013; the deadline for their votes to come back to the judge again is the fifth, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The hearings after that. What exactly are the hearings? Who is going to be -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, there is a confirmation hearing. And that is in any Chapter 11, that's when the judge decides. He might use some days to hear again and have questions regarding the particular plans, the votes or what have you, but that is just a hearing to confirm one of the plans. That's where he decides which plan prevails.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's not final; that the vote that creditors are putting in place is not the final. The final decision on the plan is really from the judge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the votes are an important part of the judge's decision. But if the question is whether the judge will decide at the end? Yes, that is correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Good morning. I would like to go back more to the business side of the Company. I remember that your total EBITDA guidance was between 1.3 and $1.5 billion. You're saying an estimate of copper price is 1.75. However, now the price has proven to be higher and you have just mentioned at the beginning of the call that you expect it to remain above two for the remaining of the year. Would that mean that you are revising upwards your EBITDA estimate, and if so, what's the new number, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. And, yes, we were using the projection of $1.75. I mean, probably the average announced was 1.86 that is higher, that is the average today. I mean, just to give you an idea, if the prices were $2.30 per pound, that will give you an average of $2.08 for the year. That's way above the guidance we've given. I mean just to give you that as an idea, that would give yields like 1.46 or $1.5 billion nearly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, could you please repeat that figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, $1.4 billion. Actually it's $1,464 billion (sic) [$1,464 million] in our current cash projections. I mean this is not &#x2013; I'm looking at the analysis table that I have in front of me. I mean that was the guidance we given, that's the budget we are working on. And obviously the prices have increased dramatically from 1.75, if you will. We're looking at a very strong pace of prices, as I just commented at the beginning of the conversation. But that is what we could anticipate if prices stay around 2.30 for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically you're not changing the guidance, I mean it's still between 1.3 and 1.5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is, if you're looking at Grupo M&#xE9;xico. Yeah, I was referring to Southern Copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I was wondering about Grupo M&#xE9;xico as a whole.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we estimate that our Railroad division &#x2013; and Enrique is here with me, I mean we've estimated about $300 million in EBITDA, but Enrique would you like to add what you expect for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our EBITDA number is becoming lower than budgeted, but we are still in the neighborhood of 240, 250 EBITDA for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So &#x2013; thank you. So we would be looking at a total of about 1.7 for Grupo M&#xE9;xico consolidated, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. I mean, as I just said, this is very dependent on the copper prices, of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, I'm just thinking looking at where things are right now.</p>

          <p>This would be the new guidance. Just a ballpark figure, right?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Victoria Santaella with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen, I have a couple of questions. The first one is, if you can give us some guidance in terms of CapEx at the Grupo M&#xE9;xico level; if there has been any changes? The second is, if you can comment on the increase in interest gains during the quarter; it's not clear for me. And last but not least, is there any possibility that no matter what the ruling of the judge in August or September, whenever that occurs, that the party that loses is going to appeal and we continue this endless battle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Thank you, Victoria. Well, for the first question, our guidance for the year has been 428 million. That was the budget approved by our Board of Directors at the beginning of the year. And that's still the same. That is $328 million for Southern Copper and $100 million for the Railroad division. So that's still the same guidance we've given since the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>The last question is whether parties can appeal the bankruptcy. And it's important to bear in mind for those of you that don't follow us very closely, the bankruptcy is very different that the Brownsville litigation. Whether parties can appeal the Brownsville litigation after the plan is confirmed? The answer is yes. In order to appeal, well, first of all you need to have grounds to appeal. And second you need to post, again, a bond in order to obtain a stay of that. As I explained in the Brownsville litigation, just as will be for the bankruptcy court.</p>
          <p>Whether this will carry on forever? As you point out, Victoria, we don't think so. I mean, we think that this is the end of the Chapter 11 precedings, and that any appeals would be resolved very soon, if there are any?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well absolutely. I mean, that will &#x2013; first of all, our cash position increased 8%; if you look at it quarter-over-quarter; that was one. Second was the foreign exchange variances. And third was that some minor investments we made in financial instruments at the very bottom part of a crisis, if you will. They reported an increase in mark-to-market.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I would like to go a little bit with Ferromex figures. The last thing that I heard about this division is that the Company was expected to reduce 7% in volume sales. I would like to know if this figure is still in your budget or is higher?</p>
          <p>And the other one is already answered, that is the EBITDA guide for this year. And regarding Asarco, I don't know if you already answered this question, I am sorry, I got into the conference call a little bit later. I would like to know if &#x2013; how much is the risk that the judge approved this request from Asarco regarding that the company sell the rights of the other trial Asarco versus AMC?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rodrigo. On the element of volume for GFM, Ferromex, we mentioned, and that is the situation as of June, the first half of the year, we are lower 5.5% decrease over year-over-year. And for the remaining of &#x2013; for the second semester of 2009, we expect a decline similar to what we have experienced. So for the end of the year, we are expecting 5.1% decrease. So the decrease is expected to be slightly lower in the second half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Prices are &#x2013; we are not contemplating any significant increases in the second half, because we think that the consumer has &#x2013; our clients have have enough with the elements of increases in the diesel surcharge, fuel surcharge. We have increased that fuel surcharge to compensate for the diesel price increases that we have had in the local economy. It's very different from what has occurred in the international market in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Well, recently the price of fuel has increased international markets. But for the last 12 months, the increases in Mexico have been nearly 30%. So, we have increased the diesel surcharge to our customers, and we are not expecting significant price increases to them on the tariffs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. Just a quick follow-up on the COFECO situation with the infrastructure division. If I recall correctly, the potential fine is actually quite small. I mean it's a percentage of the whole of Grupo M&#xE9;xico's EBITDA, it's really negligible. But could it at any point get any worse than that, meaning do you believe it is at all possible that you could be forced to sell the business or a portion of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Claudia, the company continues believing that we have the reason on the transaction that we are not eliminating any competition on the transaction since the other railroad has access to the main point, which is Veracruz. Having said that, the trial continues, the commission went to the limit &#x2013; it would ask the strongest fines possible, and they want &#x2013; they not only fine Grupo M&#xE9;xico and some of its subsidiaries, but also the to Grupo Carso and other of the sellers.</p>
          <p>We are a &#x2013; we have a good &#x2013; our actions &#x2013; legal actions against those fines are more important against the Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Competencia position to overrule the transaction and for ask to be the owner of those shares. We are not contemplating at this moment a plan to find a buyer for the shares. We continue operating the Ferrosur operation, which is then is becoming also up to the standard of Ferromex and we continue improving in many areas and indices of the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just to clarify this. COFECO sometimes proposes sort of remedy measures whenever they issue a point of view, a ruling or what have you, an opinion. So what kind of remedy measures have the COFECO proposed to you? Are those more in the line of price capping or are those in the line of divesting the business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In your second thinking, Claudia, they have gone to the opinion of what they think best not to approve the transaction. So, we have gone to the authorities and presented what are the relevant markets, explained why we are not jeopardizing the customer, et cetera. But now their view is that we should not go ahead with the transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then when should we expect a final decision regarding this point, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would like to have it solved soon, but unfortunately, the trial commission feels strongly on this and we will &#x2013; at this moment, we continue presenting all the legal actions to prevent that from happening. So, it may take some time, but we do not know the timing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A final question. What we saw in the last report is that the FX is &#x2013; has a negative effect on the results of Ferromex. Do you or are you thinking to do something with derivatives or some kind of hedge in order that this issue doesn't affect your numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify, Rodrigo, the effect has been in the translation of our local numbers, our peso numbers into U.S. and into U.S. GAAP. But there is no effect on any of the derivatives that we have and or that nature. So, we are not planning, we are not contemplating any derivatives for covering the translation, the translation of the peso sales into U.S. dollars. I don't know if that is clear. The only, let's say, the only natural hedge is the fact that we have about 30% of our revenues on U.S. dollars. But no, we are not planning to hedge the other sales, but just stressing that we do not have any negative effect on derivatives at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But you have a significant part of your cost in U.S. dollars, and you have also a significant part of your sales in pesos. So could be some kind of pressure in margins regarding the FX effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>We are about balanced, being the percentage of U.S. dollar denominated elements of course about 30, 34% of the costs. But on the other hand we have about 30% of our revenues in U.S. dollars. So, we are balanced and we are not expecting a higher effects with more volatility in the peso-U.S. dollar situation.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Rodolfo Angele with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a quick follow-up. First on the ruling on the fraudulent conveyance case. What are you challenging? Is it the return for the stake, the penalty or both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are challenging the whole decision. We don't agree with the decision. If you recall, I mean, not to get into very details and I am not the general counsel of this company. But we're challenging &#x2013; I mean the judge agreed that we paid a reasonable equivalent value for the shares. However, in 200 pages of the decision, he goes through the reasons why he believes the transaction should be rescinded. So, we are appealing that decision.</p>
          <p>There are not &#x2013; I mean the monetary portion of that is a consequence of rescinding the transaction and giving back the shares. Therefore, you're giving back. But he orders it, Asarco gives it back the consideration we paid for the shares and we give them back the dividends attributable to those shares. So it is a rescission, if you will, trying to unwind what happened when we entered into the transaction. But what we are appealing is that finding, if you will, that decision to unwind the transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And does the two competing reorganization plans, are they counting on this? I guess my question is, could the outcome of your challenge on that ruling affect the final decision of which of the three reorganization plans should win?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just try to paraphrase that and see if I understand the question. Were you saying if the decision on the appeal on Brownsville, will that affect the decision of the court bankruptcy in Corpus Christi, is that the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, the answer is pretty much has to do with timing and it's no because as I said, the confirmation hearing, the hearing or the decision is going to be made around August the 10 in the Bankruptcy Court in Corpus Christi and the appeal is still pending. Our lawyers believe that in order to be decided is going to take probably between 12 to 15 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And just a final question on another issue. On the bond, if you have to replace the shares of this issue, the 1.4 billion, with a bond or with cash, how do you plan to finance that? Do you have a plan there or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, yes. I mean, we believe &#x2013; first, we do have a plan, we believe that, first, if a plan is confirmed on August the 10, as we believe it should be, we believe it is clearly a better plan, because of the reasons that I explained, then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...the whole Brownsville litigation disappears, if you will. But if worse comes worst, yes, we are planning on appealing and we are working on obtaining a supersedeas bond to obtain a stay if needed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I think you've just answered my question actually. But just to clarify. If your plan is approved and you win control of Asarco, then the whole of the fraudulent conveyance case will be dropped, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. That's fine, thanks.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Tyler Gentry with 40/86 Advisors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Going back to the financing, I know that PCU, or Southern Copper, is currently on watch negative at both agencies. Do you plan to finance that at that entity or at your entity at Grupo M&#xE9;xico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we definitely plan to finance that at Americas Mining Corporation level. That is the holding company for Southern Copper and Asarco. I mean, we believe, and we are working with the rating agencies, we believe that the &#x2013; I mean what they are saying is that financing might create some stress in order to pay out dividends to Americas Mining Corporation. And that's what we are working on. And we're working on the financing structure at this moment to mitigate that. But we believe, we should not be downgraded, at least Southern Copper should not be downgraded, if you will. But we will definitely finance that at the AMC level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And that goes for if you win the Asarco back as well, financing the purchase of Asarco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. That's what I was referring to. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about the bond, is that the same for the bond then as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be the same. Those will be at AMC level. I mean, Southern Copper is not part of a litigation and it has nothing to do with the Asarco transaction other than the shareholders are debating about the transfer of the shares at an upper level, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. I just saw the agencies had a long downgrade watch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that's pretty what they believe as we might create some stress in terms of dividends being 80% owners of Southern Copper. We believe that should not be the case and we are working with them to &#x2013; I mean as you remember, the Southern Copper's debt amortization schedule pretty much has in 2015 $200 million amortization, and $1 billion 2035. So we believe the debt amortization schedule is very convenient for Southern Copper at this moment. And that creates the correct atmosphere in order to having a financing on AMC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you intend to basically protect your investment grade rating at Southern Copper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
