          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the News Corp. first quarter 2011 earnings release. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" />. I'll now turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer and David DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer. Rupert Murdoch will not be joining us today as he's been traveling overseas. First we will give some prepared markets on the most recent quarter, then we'll be happy to take your questions, first from the financial community and then from the press.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy, actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2010 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.</p>
          <p>Additionally this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you will have seen in today's earnings release we are very pleased with our start to fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter segment operating income increased 8% over year ago levels led by the continuing strong growth at our Cable Programming, Television and Publishing segments that more than offset a difficult comparison at Filmed Entertainment.  Net income in the quarter was $775 million, a 36% increase over the year ago results. Earnings per share also increased 36% to $0.30 this year from $0.22 reported a year ago. This strong earnings growth was driven by the higher segment operating income as well as improved earnings from affiliates primarily at BSkyB led by a gain from the sale of their Easynet business.</p>
          <p>Also included in this year's first quarter results is a tax benefit of approximately $90 million or $0.03 per share related to the resolution of various tax items. You'll note that effective this quarter we've combined the previously recorded book publishing, integrated marketing services and newspaper and information service segments into a publishing segment. This reporting change recognizes both the way we group these businesses and the smaller percentage of total earnings that these businesses now represent.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks which is our largest profit generator and accounted for over 57% of News Corporation's total segment operating income this quarter. This segment continues to drive overall company results with first quarter segment operating income contribution of $659 million; this is up 28% from last year and reflects double-digit growth at the majority of our channels.  This growth continues to be top-line driven with segment revenues up 17%. Advertising revenues at the cable networks increased 20% over year ago levels and affiliate fees grew 14% reflecting particular strength at the Regional Sports Network, FOX News and our international channels.</p>
          <p>The strength of our cable network franchise continues to grow. At FOX News in October, we drew more viewers than all of our news competitors combined. FX recently ranked as the number seven most popular cable channel among adults 18-49, ratings at the Big 10 Network have been setting records and our fastest earnings grower, the international channels, including the STAR, FOX, and National Geographic branded channels continue to expand and capitalize on particularly strong advertising markets, especially in India.</p>
          <p>At our film segment, first quarter operating income was $280 million, a good result but as expected, well below the $391 million we reported a year ago. As we mentioned, on the last quarter's earnings call this anticipated decline reflects the very successful worldwide theatrical release of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in the prior year's result.</p>
          <p>Contributions from our television production businesses were up year-over-year primarily reflecting the initial syndication release of two major shows, How I Met your Mother and American Dad.  At our television segment, operating income in the quarter of $105 million increased by 67 million.</p>
          <p>This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television stations partially offset by modestly higher losses at the broadcast network from program cancellation costs. Station advertising revenues were up 22% on the quarter compared to a year ago reflecting improved local advertising trends, particularly in the automotive, telecom and financial categories. Political revenues of $26 million were strong in the quarter and stayed healthy through yesterday's election.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sky Italia revenues increased 2% in local currency terms as compared to the prior year's quarter primarily driven by subscriber upgrade tickets and advertising for the World Cup coverage. Sky Italia generated segment operating income of $82 million which is down from last year's $128 million result. This result reflects rights -- primarily reflects rights costs associated with full coverage of the World Cup and increased subscriber acquisition costs related to the combination of both higher gross additions and the higher take-up of our full installation offer.</p>
          <p>As mentioned on our last earnings conference call, Sky Italia's consumer offering was reorganized in July, more than doubling a subscriber's programming package choices. These new offerings also make the High Def PVR standard service to our subscribers. Results to date indicate that this increased consumer choice is stimulating subscriber growth giving us increased confidence that we will hit our profit growth and subscriber targets this year.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, higher gross additions totaling 193,000 and lower churn netted Sky Italia 58,000 additional subscribers. This compares to no subscriber growth in the first quarter a year ago. Sky ended the quarter with 4.8 million subscribers. The penetration of additional subscriber services such as High Def PVRs and second boxes which helped reduce churn, doubled over the last year with approximately 70% of our subscriber base taking at least one of those services.</p>
          <p>Monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged 42 euros as compared to 42 euros last year.</p>
          <p>In our newly defined publishing segment, segment operating income of $178 million increased over 50% from the $118 million in the last year's first quarter. This improvement is primarily due to increased advertising revenues in all three of our major market newspapers, also note that this improvement is despite the absence of Dow Jones Index business which was sold last March. Year ago results included about $14 million in segment operating profit from the Index business.</p>
          <p>And in our other segment we reported a first quarter segment loss of $156 million; this is $30 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $70 million in lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011 and as a reminder, just as we did at year end we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2010, the $500 million Valassis litigation charge resulting in a base of 4.46 billion of segment operating income for comparative purposes.</p>
          <p>In early August we gave guidance anticipating our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range above the 4.46 billion fiscal 2010 adjusted result. Since that time the U.S. dollar has weakened more than we expected thereby increasing our foreign source earnings, on the other hand, the results of MySpace have been below plan. We've had to absorb the cost of cable carriage negotiations and our new film releases were somewhat below our original expectations.</p>
          <p>As a result, taking all these items into account and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to a growth rate range in the low double digits above the fiscal 2010 adjusted results.</p>
          <p>And with all that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. As David summarized the financials pretty well for you I thought I'd spend a few minutes adding a bit of color commentary to the results. While we feel good about our performance we feel even better about the strides we're making to strengthen our business and position them for long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Clearly, as Dave said, our network business, both broadcast and cable, is the lead segment empowering this growth. It's an understatement to say there's been a lot of focus on our retransmission agreements in the last few weeks. These deals are critical to driving the FOX Network's financial success to reflect its real value.</p>
          <p>Today we have agreements in place with four of the largest distributors and have now set the market for our broadcast business. Over the next couple of years as we continue to close new agreements we will be taking this business to a whole new level of profitability. However, the growth of our network business is equally driven by a great and growing set of cable channels, from the incredible strength of FOX News to FX original series like, Sons of Anarchy and The League to National Geographic event programing like Great Migrations to emerging sports networks like FOX Soccer and FUEL, our U.S. channels business continues to grow. The success of these channels has enabled us to continue to add subscribers, to earn fees that reflect the increased importance of our networks to customers and to drive great advertising growth.</p>
          <p>Our networks business outside the U.S. is an even more dynamic growth story as we take advantage of our leadership position in the emerging and growing international pay TV market. This growth story continues to be big and broad. For example, a geographic region like Asia which had previously not been as significant a contributor as others has really stepped up in the last quarter plus.</p>
          <p>On a local level our TV stations continue to do a great job about taking market share and driving efficiencies. And all our local, national and international TV businesses are continuing to benefit from a very strong advertising market. Our stations are looking at 20% year-on-year growth in the December quarter while network scatter continues to be priced at double-digit increases to the upfront. Though the broader economy still faces great uncertainty there are no signs today that these anxieties are impacting the ad market as we begin to look beyond January 1. Nonetheless, we remain cautious and alert for the risks.</p>
          <p>While our networks business is our biggest, we have key initiatives under way across the company. In Italy, we've begun to recapture some of the growth that we had before the challenges with Berlusconi during the past 12 months plus. Our short-term priority has been top line growth, particularly subscribers and we've begun to achieve those objectives through new pricing and packaging, technology leadership, and reenergized marketing. We're certainly not declaring victory; but I believe we're making the right moves and making headway.</p>
          <p>Germany is even more of a work in progress, however, there again I believe our management team is making the right moves and beginning to get things going in the right direction. We clearly have challenges ahead but the market opportunity is unique and we have a real combination of content and technology leadership to build on.</p>
          <p>In our content businesses, FOX Film has had a disappointing few quarters without breakout hits but it is important to note we equally have avoided any big loss films in an industry noted for them. We continue to be led by a management team that is second to none and one that knows how to manage this complicated business. We feel great about our big holiday releases and into next year. In addition, we're strengthening our business for the long-term by reaching agreements with Jim Cameron for the next two Avatar films and concluding an extension to our film financing structure.</p>
          <p>Our TV production business continues to prove its strength with series like Modern Family which is well on its way to the highest first cycle per episode syndication cable revenues ever.  From a FOX Network perspective, the new season has been a bit of a disappointment and we would have liked to have a game six in the World Series, but the strength of the NFL and the ad market has enabled us to largely offset those shortfalls. More importantly we're very excited about the new energy at American Idol and the continued progress on X Factor for next fall with the potential to build real year-round tent poles.</p>
          <p>In our publishing business we continue to build on our leadership position in traditional print with papers like The Wall Street Journal continuing to grow while others decline. At the same time we're building a digital business for our news content that has a healthy and exciting future. These digital businesses will take time to emerge and the explosion of tablets the next few years will be a real driving force. We feel very good about the launch of our digital subscription product in the U.K. and believe it provides a great foundation to build on.</p>
          <p>The final business I want to touch on is MySpace. We've been clear that MySpace is a problem. We recognize that we had to redefine and largely rebuild this business. We believe the foundation was there to warrant this effort and it has been our focus this year. We've made adjustments in the cost structure most recently by consolidating ad sales and most importantly in the last few weeks, we have relaunched MySpace with a focus on social entertainment.</p>
          <p>We feel really good about this relaunched product and it has been generally well received by the opinion makers in the business but we recognize the critical issue is building interest with consumers. We also recognize the challenges we face in doing so. The current losses are not acceptable or sustainable. Our current management did not create these losses but they know we have to address them. I give them great credit for pouring their hearts and sweat into creating a great new MySpace space experience that has potential to be an exciting business for us. We equally know we need to make real headway in the coming quarters to get this business to a sustainable level.</p>
          <p>Overall, when you have as many businesses in as many regions as we do it's unlikely that they will all be operating at an optimum level on short-term basis although we strive to make sure most are. I believe our core job is to make sure we have great management teams running these businesses, that we take advantage of opportunities, aggressively address problems and have plans in place to build long-term value in our increasingly complicated digital world. We believe we're achieving these goals.</p>
          <p>Thanks, I'll turn it back to Dave and Reed and we're happy to take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. I have one for Chase on MySpace. You mentioned the relaunch. I wondered how much time needs to pass before you judge whether or not it's successful and how do you judge whether or not it's successful? What are you looking for? And if it doesn't work, what happens next? So that's what I'm looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to put a specific date, these are fluid businesses, but I think this is something we look to judge in quarters, not in years. And  I think our goal is to get to a place  essentially probably that is -- that has got a revenue that's top line, that is going in the right direction and a clear path to profitability and I think those are the goals we set for that business and I think the product we launched, we feel really good about. We recognize, we have to &#x2013; we have to build an audience, we've got an audience, we've still got great reach that gives us the foundation to bring an audience to that product. But our traffic numbers are still not going in the right direction and we have to stabilize that and have a predictable path forward and make sure we've got the right cost structure and again a clear path to be a profitable business.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just one question for Chase. Had a question around your philosophy around making FOX TV studio content available on digital platforms. It seems as though to me you've been a bit more liberal in terms of the FOX content that's available on Hulu, FOX.com, you mentioned Modern Family in your opening comments and I guess you've licensed the digital rights to ABC because you can watch the most recent episode of Modern Family on ABC.com so I just wonder how that strategy is going if you can give us an update on your thoughts there and if you plan to continue along a more open path in terms of FOX content online? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First I'd just clarify that in things like Modern Family they're probably more ABC decisions based on the way rights are licensed, I'll talk more about our shows, but probably the decisions you're citing on things like Modern Family are more determined by ABC, as the network that licenses the network rights.</p>
          <p>I guess what I'd say about -- as a broad based statement is, I think this digital arena is clearly still evolving. I think it is important that we -- we're very focused on essentially how do you manage these rights and really there are sort of a handful of key issues  what are the windows  what's the ad load, and  what's the pricing to the degree you're dealing with some form of payment structure. Obviously, it's what's the product and what goes in it. I think all those things are things we're evaluating.</p>
          <p>Obviously in places like Hulu, we've talked about a subscription service to go with the pay service. I think as we go forward with our traditional distribution partners, it's important we deal with these issues constructively. We think the digital arena is a very important one. I think particularly the mobile platforms; I do think the iPad brings a whole new dimension of opportunities to the digital arena.</p>
          <p>But look, scarcity of our product is of tremendous value. I think we need to make sure we manage that product, we manage its availability intelligently and I think that's very much a work in progress and I certainly wouldn't say today we've got a set of rules in place that we're looking to as long-term rules, I think we learn as we go and I think those practices will continue to evolve. And I do think it's important that the dual revenue, the digital platforms continue to develop dual revenue stream options, I mean, I do think in a fragmenting world it's difficult to rely solely on the advertising supported platforms and I do think dual revenue streams are critical and those &#x2013; those options in the digital world clearly are at an even earlier stage than others so I think this arena will evolve. I think you'll see how we manage content in that &#x2013; in that context continue to evolve as the various business models evolve.</p>

          <p>Thanks, guys. Kind of a follow-up on the first question on the MySpace side, thank you for the color. But there are a lot of other operations in there within other, and I was wondering if you could give us some more color in terms of whether or not you saw room for operating improvement and what the order of magnitude could be for things like mobile or the FOX ad network or kind of maybe a refresher on what's in there, what's working what could be working better and what the order of magnitude of improvement could be in the intermediate term?

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And IGN, related to MySpace, I would say there's not substantial room for growth within those businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi, Standard &amp; Poor's, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. So, my question is on Avatar. You decided to go with two more installments of that and it seems like you said you just put together the financing on that. Just trying to get a sense of how you kind of frame the upside from this franchise and it seems like you have a three-disc set out this November. And I believe you had a modestly successful rerelease of the title so as you think about this franchise going forward, can you help us perhaps understand how the potential upside, as you see it; I know you spend a significant amount on the marketing for the first installment which August was paid off. I'm trying to &#x2013; if we were to look out next two, three years how would &#x2013; how can we kind of think about this &#x2013; this franchise and the potential strategy which you intend to use to monetize that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, if you &#x2013; with the sequel it's a whole different level. Sequels to the most successful film ever by I don't know practically a factor of two. If you're talking I guess two sequels you can look at that. So, there are a couple years &#x2013; they're a few years down the road but those are obviously enormous events. I think that is a film without comparison or rival, an incredibly successful film and obviously an incredibly important franchise for us. It really is more than a film, in many ways this is a franchise for us to develop and I think one of the great opportunities you get with these sequels is with the lead time and knowing the product you've got it enables you to develop a lot more things around it whether it's merchandise, licensing, games, a whole experience that sort of leads into this now that you'll have the anticipation coming towards it.</p>
          <p>So it is, you really do need to think about it as a franchise that &#x2013; it's hard, those two sequel moves coming. In the short-term they're certainly important; we're excited about the home video product we've got at Christmas. We still haven't exploited really the 3-D home entertainment experience because the 3-D market is still in its infancy so that opportunity's down the road but this really is, I mean, this is a franchise without comparison that, we need to continue to make sure we in every way possible and I do think the digital world opens up an array of these.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up, Chase, without going into more details on the deal with Jim Cameron, would you say the terms are roughly better, worse or the same for the coming installments?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Hi, two questions, one on retransmission consent. Cablevision put out a press release when the signal got restored the other day basically saying that they had actually gotten better terms by basically removing programming for a couple weeks or losing access to programming for a couple of weeks and was just curious if &#x2013; how do you react to that? And two, if that were actually true, does that mean we're going to see a lot more of these protracted battles with lost programming because there actually is a benefit to the distributor by going to that level?</p>
          <p>And then two, could you just update us on the BSkyB transaction? I saw that you filed today, and just was wondering what you're expecting now versus kind of the original timeframe that you laid out back when the original deal was announced and what you're thinking in terms of best case/worst case for an approval process? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I didn't see &#x2013; the stuff I saw from Cablevision was more sort of essentially complaining that the government didn't get involved. I mean, I guess I'm not sure, hey, look, we &#x2013; we were pretty clear with what we were trying to get and I'm not going to sort of go through what were private negotiations in public but we feel good about where we were, I think they were pretty clear about what they were trying to do was &#x2013; drag the government into it. We didn't think the government needed to be into it.</p>
          <p>In reality, I think it would have been valuable if the government said up front they weren't. They made a few noises that probably made the process more difficult, made it more extracted, more protracted, I think if the government had been clear up front they were going to stay out of it, it was a private matter between private parties, it may not have gone off the air at all, but I think that's what they were trying to do, pretty clear all along is drag the government in. I think it became clear that the government while there were array of parties putting out releases that this was a matter to be dealt with between private parties and we got &#x2013; we reached an agreement that we feel very good about.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Chase, last year your cable network margins increased about 500 basis points over the prior-year. This first quarter they're up another 4 to 500 basis points, is this first quarter margin of 35.2% something that could be representative for the year? And how long can you &#x2013; I realize your margins are lower than a lot of your competitors but how long can you keep growing the margins at this kind of a rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we clearly believe we have room on an array of fronts to continue to drive these &#x2013; a number of our channels, I guess in many ways, there are channels that aren't fully distributed that we are continuing to add distribution, obviously when we add subscribers to add subscribers to the channel it pretty much is pure bottom line.</p>
          <p>A number of the recent deals even including on big channels, expanded that distribution, the quality of the channels, you get something like FOX News as it continues to drive forward in the next year plus, we'll be into a new round of renewals on FOX News. So, again it's sort of the upfront comments it's really three things that really all improve those margins sort of, again, additional -- talking domestic now -- additional subscribers getting affiliate rates that reflect the value of the channels, and the audience that comes with it in terms of advertising. Probably even more so internationally, because internationally you've got channels that expand that reach and you've got things like subscriber growth at an even faster rate when you look at places like Latin America and the rate of growth there.</p>
          <p>So I think we clearly have real room to grow and as we've said competitively when you look at our channels against those we compete with, they are much less mature channels, they've not been around as long and therefore the positive ends up being they've got a disproportionately more growth ahead of them. And I think those channels continue to really operate well and, again, whether it's News or FX and its originals, channels that really perform well. So we feel very good about the ability to continue to drive those businesses forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a follow-on, the industry showed in the second quarter down domestic, down multichannel homes. Are you seeing that in any of your &#x2013; the fees you're generating from any of your fully distributed channels, are you seeing fewer subs than a prior quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact, I think we'd be looking at actually subs going up. But look I -- I think an awful lot was read into that, getting at this cord cutting issue I just don't see it. I mean, realistically, I mean, second or third quarter, mature market, we're probably little tougher quarters, but cable down a little bit, satellite and telco still up, I feel it's a fundamental service that for American households is a fundamental part of what they -- what they do with their time and what they value in their life and I think it's a service without comparison. But no, we would not be seeing that.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. This is a question for Chase on the international channels; it looks to be a very strong result in that division. Can you just break out a little bit more specifically where that growth is coming from, is it ad market, affiliate fee or new channel launches and how much is the weak U.S. dollar benefiting that division?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The dollar helps some but that's not the driving force. I used the phrase big and broad I think in the opening comments and that's what it is, it is multiregional, it's multichannel. There's Latin America, Europe, I cited Asia, Asia I'm actually excluding India, so it's not talking about STAR which equally has been good, but it's a good story. The ad dollars are equally, I mean, the ad dollars I think in &#x2013; we're in the mid-20s year-on-year increases but those channels, they continue to &#x2013; and it's good and strengthening channels I think you got to have the quality to deliver. But it is a broad regional story and a multichannel story that has both affiliate and the dollar strength behind it.</p>

I do think it's not just saying it's the market, I think they're doing a really good job executing and creating quality channels that stand out and have a real value. When you look at the market share of our channels combined in some of these places, Latin America, Europe it's extraordinary and I think we have a real position of leadership that we can really build on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. Chase, I wanted to go back to the network, you talked about retransmission revenue which clearly News Corp. has led the charge on and gone to the mat for. But I was wondering on the cost side as you look at the network and particularly sports, how you're thinking about this business over the long-term. I think FOX, I believe, probably spends more on sports programming than any other network. You've got in addition to the NFL, baseball, NASCAR. Is that something you think needs to change over the long-term, do you think the retrans revenue stream fixes, fixes the business given how much sports costs or do you want to see that move more and more to your cable properties where you've built a Regional Sports Network business that's very attractive? And then I have one follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, I guess on the last point, I really think about our broadcast network  more and more should be thought of in the same vein as cable network, therefore I don't know that you're differentiating one from the other. They've got to become dual revenue businesses that receive revenues that are reflective of their strength and that's what we're driving the FOX Network to be is a business that looks essentially much more like our cable networks.</p>
          <p>I guess on the sports &#x2013; the sports programming is always a double-edged sword; it has great strength, great value. Look at the NFL right now in a world of fragmentation it continues to set records. As I said, we would have liked another World Series game or two and that's the variation in it but it's still great content in baseball.</p>
          <p>The programming has great appeal. It is &#x2013; sports has a unique strength in a world of DVRs and all the like, there isn't anything like it. There isn't a second World Series or second Super Bowl or second AFC championship game and it has unique value in the marketplace. The issue with it is they come with big price tags but it's been a great part of building FOX, we'd like it to continue to be a part of building FOX but we've got to negotiate rates that enable us to believe it makes sense I think our goal, we think it has been important, it's been valuable to us, we'd like it to continue to be a part of our story but we've got to make sure it's on terms that make sense.</p>
          <p>Obviously, retransmission does help I think if you had been an ad supported only business, an ad supported only business, I think over time you wouldn't find any of these sports on any of the networks on that business model. I think as they build a business model that enables them to compete on a more-level playing field and have profitable businesses with exciting long-term futures then it enables you to compete for rights. But as with any rights, you've got to be disciplined and at some point rights get too expensive, so the rights, we'd clearly like to have and I'd certainly put sports rights in that category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up to some of the earlier calls on digital distribution TV everywhere and authentication is starting to come to fruition a little bit in the market but you've made some waves around Google TV. I think someone from Google was quoted in the press as saying the broadcasters don't get it and one question I'm wondering if you would address is are you thinking about different devices or different screens as a way to window this content which is a little bit of a nuance versus how we typically think about windowing which is just the calendar. In other words, would you make content available on a mobile platform or on a PC but disable it on the television screen? How are you thinking about that piece of the story?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the house the difference between screens is going to continue to diminish, between PC and TV, as you get more Internet ready TVs and the like. I do think mobile is probably a more discrete platform that is obviously different because it really is the get it anywhere. And I do think iPad, the iPad or the tablet devices are really going to redefine that whole mobile experience so it's very early stages and I think what will be the truth I think the apps will grow fast, the next couple years you'll really start to have a big enough universe out there to meaningfully determine how do you develop -- how do we build on that opportunity. It is a real opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure if you went into the home, distinguished the screens the way longer term I think in the short-term it can exist but I do think those screens are going to blend and it's -- I think it does come back to figuring out probably more what are the business models for our content and what are the right terms and I think we need to -- you're not -- our content is tremendously valuable. We need to manage it; we need to make sure as we make it available and we're making it available on the right terms as much as like the movie business has done historically creating a series of windows that went from theatrical to video to pay to free now it's talking about a VOD window that may be ahead of the DVD window that you continue to figure out how do you create the right windows on the right business terms.</p>
          <p>I do think one of the things that I always get puzzled about as people talk about broadcasters versus cable and, again, I think that distinction is sort of ill founded. I mean, in essence if you're creating great original programming on a cable channel why is that one set of rules versus great original programming on a network? It's great original programming, you ought to manage it accordingly and figure out how do you exploit that programming. I think it's a good thing for us to enable our customers to access that programming in new and exciting and interesting ways.  I think that's a great opportunity for us to do that. But we need to do it in ways that have us fairly compensated for the value of our content. Look, our content is incredibly valuable. We can't just throw it out to everybody; we've got to make sure we're putting it out there on terms that get us fairly compensated for the content we create.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's tough to &#x2013; shows are different shows. It's a bit apples and oranges to sort of compare one to the other. Certainly, I think the cable market as a buying market is, continues to be a very strong market. I think you've seen in this industry segment, sort of the prices of things like half hour  really move to -- and we, obviously, are a beneficiary as Modern Family moved to whole new levels just in the last in the last year plus. That market's there and I think the broadcast business certainly has come out of its -- the hole it was in a couple years ago. Got a stronger ad market there. So I think that market certainly seems to have stabilized but it's tough to make those year-on-year comparisons because it's going to be title driven.</p>

          <p>Thanks, just two quick questions. The first for Chase, recognizing that you guys are still involved in the BSkyB transaction but was wondering if you could speak to News Corp.'s appetite for acquisitions at this stage. There's been some chatter about perhaps some interest in Yahoo! with the help of outside financing, for example.</p>
          <p>And secondly perhaps for Dave, I know you said that the TV stations are running up about 20% in ad revenues, up quarter to date. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how the pacings are looking post the elections for the rest of the quarter. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think certain things like Yahoo! are the press needing to have things to write about. I think it's &#x2013; we don't need it. We are right now &#x2013; certainly do not need to make any acquisitions. I think we've got a great portfolio of businesses that we can grow aggressively, that have a good diversification amongst them. And I think what we want to be is make sure we're smart about things and look at things that are out there and if there's something there, then we should consider it. But we're going to do so in a very disciplined way. I mean, we say we looked at a cable channel, we looked at travel channel a year ago, we kicked the tires on something overseas recently and ultimately they were people were looking for values that didn't make sense to us.</p>
          <p>And our general preference is to build businesses, not buy businesses. It's the way we built the great businesses in News Corp; it's what we &#x2013; where our focus will continue to remain. But if we see something that we think we could acquire at a very attractive price that fits I think we'd want to take a look at it; but we're going to do so in a very disciplined way. We're certainly not out shopping for anything. And, again, I think our priority and focus and our preference is to build businesses, and I think we've got real opportunities to do that.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much, just snuck it in. So Chase, more on cable networks, or I guess, Dave and Chase; I just want to make sure there's no unusual items driving the growth in cable networks like acquisitions. And then Chase, you talked on this call about building rather than buying and you talked about the young channels that are driving such strong growth there. Today's young channels were yesterday's new launches. I was curious, when you look at the strategic outlook from cable networks is there a focus on or a need to continue to stoke the fire with more new cable network launches or is this the stable of channels that we should be thinking about for the foreseeable feature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the opportunity to build new channels is probably few and far between. They've got a lot of them out there. I won't say there won't be one. But I think right now you've got a pretty big group of channels. We've got a lot of growth there. We have channels that &#x2013; FX and Nat Geo which we're still adding subscribers in a significant way that are not -- that we have room to continue to grow even what are our big channels. So it's not just the little channels where we can add to and obviously overseas it's a whole different case; overseas clearly there are businesses that are at a much earlier stage.</p>
          <p>The U.S. business, I think the places you'd add a channel would be fewer and farer between. I think internationally it's a different case. I think domestically the opportunities are really to take channels and take them to whole new levels. Again, I'll use the examples that I used before, make Nat Geo, Discovery, or make FX ,U.S.A. and that's &#x2013; that opportunity  would be those &#x2013; increasing our profit and cash flow by multiples not percentages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what's driving the business; you're getting great franchise cable channels with great revenue growth driving great margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you fully monetized your domestic channels by launching them on your international pay TV platforms? Have you pushed those out as aggressively as you think you should?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Have we monetized our domestic channels internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, have you taken your domestic channels through your pay TV platforms internationally as much as you think you should?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've taken them very broadly. I guess our platforms &#x2013; which I guess would be more specifically the European platforms or India, we certainly have done some, but the international channels are really in territories across the world. We certainly have done it in things like that. Some are more exportable than others, like Nat Geo's certainly are content and entertainment we've used to drive entertainment channels. Sports is probably a place that's a bit more local in its content. News again, while we do some it's probably a bit more local.</p>
          <p>But certainly a big part of the international story is how to take advantage of the economies and the efficiencies of using product that travels around the world. We have a lot of product that travels around the world, movies, TVs, documentaries and the like. Some of it is a bit more local but we have got an awful lot that travels around the world and that is what we look to take advantage of.</p>
          <p>And I guess in the cable channels, the other dimension of growth as we go forward is really the digital arena. How do you take this product and do people down the road want to get FOX News on an iPad so they can watch it when they're not home. And how do you take forward and develop opportunities like that. And I think those are just &#x2013; I think there are an array of ways that we can continue to build and add to in ways that are exciting for customers and attractive for us to build these franchises, build the content we launch in these franchises, original product.</p>
          <p>I think FX has done as good a job as anybody in the business in terms of launching great unique original programming. How do we exploit it? How do we develop digital platforms and digital experiences for it that are compatible with FX? I think we have to make sure we do it in a way that's compatible with our core distributors and that makes sense and is additive to our business. I think those opportunities are all there for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chase, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, very well. You talked about wanting broadcast to look more like cable. Beyond growing the dual revenue stream are there any other ways that broadcast can look like cable?</p>
          <p>And then I have a second question: how far off do you see a premium video window?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At its heart, that's what I'm really talking about, a dual revenue stream business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is really &#x2013; there are other nuances you can debate sort of and I sort of talked to the broadcast business, you take &#x2013; create 25 pilots to find five shows. The cable business is more selective, about making good with something for 13 episodes and putting it on. So I think there are other aspects of &#x2013; if those businesses can learn from each other. At its core, what you're really saying is you've got a cable business that it's a dual revenue business, that is a very healthy, strong business.</p>
          <p>You've got a broadcast business trying to compete with one arm behind its back, without a dual revenue stream and it needs to have a dual revenue &#x2013; strongest programming, and it has audiences that are multiples of any cable channel out there and it ought to be fairly valued. And we've approached this realistically with a spirit of fairness. We could be asking &#x2013; if you're looking at it on a competitive basis we should be looking for a lot more than we are and I think we've tried to be constructive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the premium video?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The premium, you mean the window?</p>

        <plist>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to expand a little bit further on the film windowing strategy. There's been some talk that studios could benefit by further delaying DVD delivery to Netflix and Red Box and the like. And I just wanted to see what your stance on that was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we have the 28-day window; I think that's been a good thing for us. We haven't been there that long; I think we probably want to -- I do think it's something we'll continue to evaluate so I think directionally that's been a good thing. I think we've got to get a bit better handle and a bit more data around it to determine where and what is the right sequencing. I think as VOD continues to grow, this -- you are going to continue to have change in the windowing strategy between DVDs and electronic and when people talk about premiums and the like that this is -- these things will continue to evolve. But, again, what I'd say today is we feel the windowing we've done has been good for us and we'll evaluate where we go from here as we go forward.</p>

          <p>Hi. I was wondering what your vision is for the U.K., European market sort of post-Sky obviously, if you win Sky. And further on would you consider buying U.K. European productions? There's going to be some that will come up for sale, like Endemol, for example.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our focus, we've got three big businesses, two that are really in early growth stage, one in very early growth stage in Germany; Italy with a lot of growth left ahead of it. And I think our focus is to build those businesses. We've got the channel business across Europe which has continued to grow and I think there are some markets that we're not &#x2013; that I think are opportunities for us today to expand our channels. Again, back on sort of the build versus buy theme, I think our focus today is really to build the platforms in Italy and Germany, to build the channels we have across Europe. And I think as I said before, I think we'll be opportunistic and see what's there if there's something that made sense, I think we'd look at it, but our honest focus is we're not out on a hunting or shopping spree. I think our focus is on building those businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you look at future synergies between BSkyB, SKY Italia, Deutschland, do you think or, I don't know, maybe cost saving opportunities like buying productions together or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we said before the Sky transaction's not based on synergies. We &#x2013; we're going to &#x2013; the businesses we run today, we're focused on building them to their potential.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We know a lot about TV production, I guess I'd rather be building than buying. If there was something uniquely interesting we'd look at it but I think our focus is to build those things. We do run a pretty big TV production business today so it's certainly something we know about and we know well and that will continue to be our focus, to build on those opportunities. We produce programming in a lot of countries today. We produce programming in Italy, we produce programming in India, we produce programming in places around the world. We certainly have a lot of TV production going on  you know, most of it in the U.S. but in an array of countries around the world and, again, our focus will be to continue to build those things.</p>

          <p>Hi there, I saw the announcement you guys made about the numbers of digital sales coming from The Times of London paywall, just wondering, there's been a lot of discussion about how &#x2013; how successful or not that initiative has been, would like to hear from you if you think those numbers are &#x2013; I mean, is that a pretty good idea of what you're going to see from this or do you see that as just kind of the tip of what you can do in terms of digital sales and also with all these reports that News Corp. is developing an iPad native newspaper for the U.S, are those the kinds of numbers that you have in mind for digital &#x2013; a new digital business that you'd be doing?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>I mean, in terms of the digital product in Europe, I mean, in the U.K. we feel very good about it and &#x2013; and realistically, it's very early. Digital as a whole  some of these platforms like tablets are just emerging, this this is not something that is sort of a one or two-quarter game, I mean, this is something that's going to continue to build over years. And I think we feel this is a great start, a great foundation. And we really look forward to continuing to build on this. And the whole digital arena is continuing to evolve and build. And we've got a lot on the broader topic  I think we are looking at an array of digital opportunities, when we get to a place where there's something we're going to do, we'll announce it.</p>
