          <p>Good morning, everyone. And very welcome to this press conference and analyst meeting for our Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2008. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, the new Head of Investor Relation. With me today, I have our President and CEO, Mr. Lars Nyberg and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Per-Arne Blomquist.</p>
          <p>We will start here with a presentation by Lars, followed by a review of the financial by Per-Arne. We will then open up for questions, both here from the floor and for you listening in over the phone.</p>
          <p>Without any further delay, I leave the floor to Lars. Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andreas. And good morning, everyone. It's nice to have Andreas on this side of this room. I am very happy about that. Our business is strong despite the worsening economic climate around us. We did actually report record high earnings both for the quarter and for the year, driven by growing sales and a strong EBITDA. The organic growth was 4.5%, which is higher than in 2007, and continues to be driven by Mobility and our business in Eurasia.</p>
          <p>Our geographical footprint, now stands on 20 countries with 135 million subscriptions, just over 43 million in our majority owned companies and 91 million in our associated companies MegaFon and Turkcell.</p>
          <p>In Mobility Service sales grew in almost all markets and was primarily driven by new subscriptions and the exploding usage of mobile broadband. The customer base in Spain doubled last year and we have now passed the target of one million subscriptions.</p>
          <p>It's also encouraging that we improved our margins in Mobility Service, despite intensive competition and regulatory intervention in the form of lower interconnect and roaming fees. The main improvements came from improved profitability in Denmark and lower losses in Spain. However, the losses in Spain are still higher than original plan as we forecasted in the third quarter discussion.</p>
          <p>Organic growth in business area Broadband Services was essentially flat in the quarter. The trend of falling volumes in the Swedish market leveled off towards the end of the year. This development is encouraging and is a result of higher equipment sales and increased number of paying IPTV customers and a smaller decline in fixed voice sales than the year before.</p>
          <p>Our international carrier operation continued to grow substantially but margins are lower, which leads to a considerable change in the underlying product mix. Despite the development of sales in Broadband and the continued cost efficiency measures, margins in Broadband continues to decline. Therefore, an even higher focus on efficiency measures as well as sales of value added services are of utmost importance to safeguard our long-term profitability in Broadband Services.</p>
          <p>Eurasia, our growth engine continued to show strong organic revenue growth and grew by 18% in the quarter. The largest contributions came from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and sales actually doubled in Uzbekistan. We also added two new markets to our footprint, namely Nepal and Cambodia with substantial future growth prospects.</p>
          <p>MegaFon and Turkcell, both continue to develop favorably in the quarter with increasing customer basis, improved sales and profitability. The rolling EBITDA margin for Mobility Service improved quarter-by-quarter in 2008. And the EBITDA margin for Eurasia was stable on an high level.</p>
          <p>For Broadband Services however, the full year EBITDA was SEK900 million or 15% lower than in 2007, despite flat sales. This leads to a considerable margin drop in the fourth quarter and a full year EBITDA margin of 26.5%, almost 2.5% lower than the year before. This is a big disappointment and improving the profitability of Broadband Services is our biggest challenge in 2009.</p>
          <p>To conclude the development for 2008, we had a good year, a record year and we met our outlook with stable and profitable growth although we didn't quite reach our ambition of maintaining the EBITDA margin. We missed it by four-tenth of a point, 31.8 versus the 32.2.</p>
          <p>When I joined TeliaSonera some &#x2013; it's about 18 months now. I identified five focus areas, which actually later became six. I added quality in our networks as this is a basic and fundamental ingredient for being a top player in the industry. I also realized that we had to change the company culture and our behavior particularly in Sweden and Finland, in order to act as one company and succeed in one of the world's most competitive industries.</p>
          <p>During 2008, we strengthened the leadership team of this company. And introduced a more stringent what we call performance and consequence management attitude. As a result, I see a change in our behavior, although I realize we have long way to go.</p>
          <p>Another focus area is world class customer service. Therefore I am encouraged by the strength of our market position and how customers rate our performance. In 2008, we made significant progress across our Nordic and Baltic markets in what is called the European Performance Satisfaction Index. To reach a level in this index of 65 is good, if you compare for the telecom industry. We reached an average of 68, which is an improvement compared to 2007. And all markets were above or just close to 65.</p>
          <p>The Baltic countries scored about 70 and there were also significant improvements in Sweden and Finland. In Eurasia, we strengthened our market position, became the biggest player in Tajikistan and in Georgia, in addition to Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan where we already are the leading supplier.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to focus on one of our key challenges, cost efficiency. Long-term, and I said this many, many times, long-term TeliaSonera cannot have structurally high cost than our competitors. In this context, our main focus has been head office and common functions as well as broadband services where margins have been declining for a number of years despite continuous cost reduction efforts.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of last year, we identified a need to make gross savings of SEK5 billion. And this would result in redundancy of some 2,900 employees, about 2,000 in Sweden, 900 in Finland.</p>
          <p>For 2009, our ambition is to keep OpEx flat compared to 2008 despite increasing sales. The timing of cost reduction will depend on how quickly we can conclude negotiations with the Swedish labor unions. If they continue to delay the process, we may lose one or two quarters in this process. But we will reduce the cost.</p>
          <p>The macroeconomic environment has really become much more severe as the year 2008 progressed. And the global economy was exceptionally weak I believe in the fourth quarter. Despite the negative market sentiment, we experienced no material effect on our business through changing customer behavior or uses of our services.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of this year the trend continues in the Nordic countries. And in the Baltic countries we have seen lower terminal sales as a trend, which also already started last year, we talked about in the third quarter. Lower terminal sales has no material impact on our results.</p>
          <p>In some of the Eurasian markets, we experienced a somewhat slower growth rate in January than we had expected. But it's way too early to draw any conclusions from this.</p>
          <p>The FX, the foreign exchange market has been very volatile and our kroner has depreciated against almost all currencies. At the beginning of this year, Kazakhstan devalued its currency and we expect the volatility in the foreign exchange markets to continue this year.</p>
          <p>Our business, the TeliaSonera business is sort of naturally hedged as both our sales and costs are primarily in local currency. However, our equity position and dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are of course subject to translation effects.</p>
          <p>TeliaSonera is a financially balanced company with a unique position in the Nordic and the Baltic countries and we are very well positioned in several emerging markets with high growth potential.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for 2009 is that organic growth will be positive. We will maintain the EBITDA margin. We also expect that CapEx as a percentage of sale will be somewhat lower than in 2008. We will continue to improve the efficiency of our operation and invest for future growth both in high quality networks, services and new growth markets.</p>
          <p>Now over to Per for the details. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Let me get this right. As we have said and also as you have seen the whole year was a strong year. And we have reached close to 104 billion in net sales, close to 33 billion in EBITDA, and also an increase in EPS up to 4.23. All in all, we are growing roughly six, 7% on all lines. Even though we take out the currency effects, which is done something between one to 2%, we could see a growth. And I think that the organic growth here on 4% on net I see is a very strong sign.</p>
          <p>If you look at the EPS as such, it is affected this time by a lower tax rate, about close to 19%. And that was sort of a revaluation of our tax assets done in the fourth quarter given that we got the new corporate tax rate coming down from 28% to 26.3. Looking forward, I would say that the normal tax rate should be roughly at 22%.</p>
          <p>Looking at trends, we continue also this quarter to grow, as we have done since the first quarter in '07. This is one of the best quarters. And we are now well above the 100 billion, as we talked about previously as a stretched target.</p>
          <p>However, what I think perhaps is more important is also the change to the EBITDA and also EBITDA margin trend. EBITDA in the beginning of 2007 had an annual pace of 32, we've been down to 31 in &#x2013; at the end '07 and now up to 33. We have also been able to flatten out sort of the decreased margins. We are now operating on the level of 31.8% since the last three or four quarters.</p>
          <p>But of course, as also Lars said we are a bit disappoint on this side that we didn't reach the 32.2, and basically you could see here we have that explained by the Broadband Services where we have a margin of 26.5% compared to close to 29 last year. That also means that where we're now going forward we're talking about the addressable cost and this is the one way also to leave sort of the gross saving theme that have been discussed before. We will now focus on keeping the OpEx cost on a flat level. And that means that we will have different patterns in Group going forward. It's not so that everyone should save in all corners.</p>
          <p>Broadband and Other, Other stands for headquarters and also the common function should go down. Meanwhile we are awaiting a rather flattish rate on the Mobility side and also an increase in the cost in Eurasia. It also means that to reach this we need to take down the number of employees. We are close to 32,200 employees today and we expect this to be at 31,200 or below that at the end of this year. And this is the new way for us to measure this and talk about sort of net effect instead of having gross effects.</p>
          <p>We are a strong company today. We have a net debt ratio of 36.5%. We have a return on equity of more than 70%. I know that you might not be that interested in this industry about the return on equity. For me it's still important. And you should also know that when you look at the return on equity we have had some translation effects that has increased our equity with the roughly 13 billion and that shows that we have sort of a healthy development also when it comes to the returns.</p>
          <p>When we look at the cash flow, which is in focus in most areas today, we reached close to 5 billion in the last quarter which is 3 billion better than last year, the same quarter last year. Partly we had a delay in dividend from Turkcell but even if you take that away we show a good improvement on the cash flow. Basically, given that we have improved the EBITDA with more than 1.1 billion and also the lower tax rate.</p>
          <p>If you look at the debt market, which is in focus for many companies right now, I think I could claim that we have a rather strong position. We could access the market. We could get in money when we need it. If you look at the <mark type="inaudible" /> we had roughly 2.5 billion to refinance. We did that with own means basically but we also raised some SEK500 million to decent pricing, roughly 5% five years money, which means that we've sort of filling up the 2014 bucket in order to get the more even out. And we continue to raise money in the market at decent prices. And I think it's &#x2013; for us it's a strength to do that without any pressure, which also helps us to keep also the prices on the lower side.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have also proposed a ordinary dividend of SEK1.8 per share. This is the same level as last year and it gives us a payout ratio of 43%, which is in line with the payout or the dividend policy that we have set up, which should be about 40%. We've also or we will ask the ADM for a mandate, an authorization to repurchase shares, up to 10% of outstanding shares, not because we have any plans to exercise this right now, but as a company we need to have this tool in a tool box for working with a capital base. I will stop there and we go for Q&amp;As.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Lars. Thank you Per-Arne. We are now ready to take your questions and we will start with some question from Stockholm. Yes, Michael [Evli Bank]?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulation on very good results. You're guiding for some growth in 2009, which is organic growth, which is very strong I would say, TeliaSonera is staying flat. I won't ask you to compare, but where do you see the highest risk of not meeting the growth target? Is it still of a decline in the Nordic fixed line for instance or should we pay an attention to the little comment you made about Eurasia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I am &#x2013; I worry about a lot of things. I think the thing I'm &#x2013; the comment I made about January. I mean it's just one month so doesn't mean much and I need to see February I should need to see much March. And then I can maybe draw some conclusions. But if the economy would get worse in those countries, I think that could affect our growth rate. We will grow, there is no question about, will we grow as much as we have planned? That's the question mark. I don't think the fixed voice in Sweden is the issue, that's a structural issue, a profitability structural issue. I think actually, I am speculating now.</p>
          <p>And we spend a lot of time in the management team talking about this, but I think if we get people without work, not people who are told they might lose their job, but people actually losing their job, I would expect that maybe to use the phone a little bit different than they are doing today. Maybe we will have one subscription less or maybe they will surf a little bit less or whatever. These are the ideas we're toying with and we are watching every sign, every week basically to see if we can see anything. And we can't -- we couldn't see anything last year, nothing. And now we have seen nothing in the rest of the organization except one or two countries in Eurasia for one month. It doesn't mean too much to me. So long answer on a fairly short question, but the question is complicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the shorter one on CapEx, in the light of some other international operators that seems to be over bidding how much they will cut CapEx. Your CapEx guidance almost seems aggressive. Is that set now for the year or is it something that you might review.......</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have a plan, we can change the plan. These are decisions you take as you progress the year. And I think investing is very important. I mean, yes, this is a time where the economy is weak and a lot of our competitors are actually not as strong as we are financially. And we should take the advantage and invest. I think we can gain market share right now. But I still think, we will have somewhat lower CapEx as a percentage of sales this year than last year, because we did invest quite a bit last year too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now, we'll take the next question from Lena [Enskilda Securities] in the corner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Lena &#xD6;sterberg from Enskilda Securities. A few questions if I may. Finland broadband I think was a bit disappointing in the quarter. The quarter-on-quarter margin trend was significantly worsened than last year. So I was wondering if you could maybe shed some light on that. Also you saw from Tele2 yesterday that the Baltic countries keep sort of &#x2013; are a bit volatile in the results and some of you are also doing well and I think one is less so, so maybe you could comment a little bit on what you are seeing in the Baltics as well. And then a question also on CapEx to add on, I keep asking this, I hope you can give some answer this time. A little bit on maybe what you spent CapEx on last year split and you don't have to maybe give exact numbers but majority of where did it go and how does that change into 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the Baltics. I think we see the same thing, all operators, that the sale of terminals is lower, the offer of buying us the SIM card and use your old phone is picking up. I think that's what the other guy said too. So we see the same trends. But we don't see any effects on traffic yet at least. And then on the broadband issue, yes, maybe we have a bit of a challenge in Finland in broadband, but let me tell you the broadband challenge in Sweden is way bigger than the one in Finland. You really have to take the efficiency measures in Sweden in broadband and we have to do it fast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to CapEx you could see &#x2013; if you try to simplify it, one-third of the CapEx is sort of split into the different business areas. And of course if you look at Eurasia is more sort of building out the network when it comes to Mobility is the question of capacity more and it differs from countries to countries. And in Mobility, I mean it's a question of maintaining the old network...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Broadband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In broadband is &#x2013; maintaining the old network and also some kind of conversations. But one-third you could say to simplify it in each business area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which means of course that as a percentage we are much more aggressive in Eurasia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I maybe just get some more light on Finland, what was sort of the underlying effect of the margin change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can see Lena that the margin is actually flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It was 17% for the last year. There is a significant drop in the fourth quarter, you're correct about that. What's included in the Finnish broadband business is also our electronics chain, Veikon Kone that is dragging on the earnings this quarter. So that's part of the explanation for the quarter-on-quarter drop.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Mr. Damien Maltarp [Credit Suisse]. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much, Damien Maltarp, Credit Suisse. Three questions. In the event that the economy does have an impact or further impact on people's or consumer's activity, how do you yourself see you reacting? Do you pull back a bit and protect your margins? Do you see this as an opportunity maybe to push ahead and steal market share away from your weaker players perhaps? Maybe you could just expand a bit on that. Second question is just on gearing. What do you think is a right level of gearing for the business? And the third question, just on pensions, you've got a pension gap of about SEK5 billion, could you just clarify what your obligations are in terms of closing that gap? Do you yet need to make any top-up contributions over the coming years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. Let me start with your first question. If the market would go down significantly, obviously we will take our cost down, and I think we also have ideas how we could do that. At the same time, as I just said a couple of minutes ago, if the market is not going down but because of the financial situation some of our competitors will have less resources this year, we should make use of our balance sheet and try to take market share. So it's a delicate balance between really watching for signs in the market. If the whole markets will go down, we will have to reduce our costs. If the market is not really going down, but our competitors are saving because of their balance sheet, we should take advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the pension obligations I was talking about, we have, I think, a 5 billion gap, and this is done according to IFRS, and it's &#x2013; we don't need to pay anything in. This is the accounting. The reason also for us to having a higher obligation today is that we have also decreased the discount rates, and that is one of the major issues we have right now, because discount rates differs extremely much now in Europe. We have &#x2013; we do not have a corporate bond as a discount rate in Sweden as you have in other countries. So it could be if we have 4%, some countries might have 7%. So that is &#x2013; that's a big difference. But the important thing here is we know we don't &#x2013; do not need to pay in anything to the trust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the gearing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gearing. I think that the gearing we have today I think is decent and I don't see any major changes right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Good morning gentlemen. I'm &#x2013; the release says that the Spanish operation is still under review for different options. And that is the same language that you used at the third quarter. Could you give us an update as to how your review is progressing? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Nothing has changed. You're right about that. I think we came in with the numbers that we expected. We have now reached one million subscribers. The losses were bigger than the billion and roughly in line with what we thought it would be when we talked the third quarter. Nothing has changed. We are looking at alternatives and there are some discussions. I will not go into the details. And I said last quarter here, I will not be pushed for time to do something. I will do something if it makes sense to our shareholders and my basic position has not changed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Stefan Billing, HQ Bank. I was just curious about the Finnish and the Norwegian mobile markets. There seems to have been quite aggressive price initiatives from some of your competitors during Q4. Still you have probably not follow that path and still you have maintained your customer base. My question is what do you foresee in those markets? How long will you not follow those price initiatives and are you worried about new price wars like in Finland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are more &#x2013; I think if you look at Mobility for 2009, I think, the first challenge and the biggest challenge is the changes in the regulatory environment, the interconnect fees. We start with a significant lower result apples-on-apples because of that and our plan is to compensate for that. I think that's Kenneth Karlberg, who runs Mobility's biggest challenge. There are always price wars. I mean this is a highly competitive industry and I think we are pretty good in managing or playing those wars within the markets and I have a high degree of confidence in the local management both in Finland and in Norway that they will do the right thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think if I recall this correctly I think was it was a limited to February. So it was a very short sort of a price war you can say that we had in Finland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We in Finland specifically we took an active decision not to take part in those surprise initiatives that came from our competitor. You should remember that those are during a limited time and expires in February. So it doesn't necessarily mean that they will be extended into the first full quarter. Should we take Lars.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lars S&#xF6;derfjell, Kaupthing. Just curious about the comments you made on Eurasia, I mean you said you're actually the first operator to admit that you're seeing some kind of an impact. Exactly what are you seeing? Is it net adds usage, could you give some more color on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I did say, I did say that the growth rates in a couple of Eurasian markets were somewhat lower than we had expected. That's what I said and that's exactly the truth. And we've chose to say this because we knew we would be bombarded with questions do we see any signs. And we want to be very transparent here. We see no signs in the fourth quarter, we've seen no signs in January except one or two countries where we typically would expect a 10% growth became five or something. That's the kind of thing and I'm saying January is one month. I need to see a couple of more months before I make any conclusions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Andersson, Evli Bank again. Swedish broadband very weak in the quarter and you are saying you are taking even more measures at the same time Tele2 raised their margins in Q4, where do you see these margins getting? Are we speaking longer-term low 20s EBITDA for fixed broadband for instance in Sweden here or do you actually think that we could get up again to 30s maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The ambition is clearly not have low 20s. That is unacceptable. I don't think there is any reason for us to have that, but we have structurally higher cost. I mean this is heritage you could say and it's natural that we have higher cost there. And we also have a shift in technology in this business, you got to realize that it's a huge shift in technology over &#x2013; not over one year but over several years. And we have changed management in Broadband Services. I have a lot of confidence in H&#xE5;kan Dahlstr&#xF6;m who runs this. He has a huge challenge both to manage the transition from the old technology, the copper technology over to the fiber. And this will take many years. Manage the customer base, because our biggest asset is our customer base. And we need to start selling even more value-added services to this customer base. So the triple play or maybe with the quadruple play. And at the same time we need to take down the cost. We need to take down the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the customer base, you are more &#x2013; you feel fairly certain of that being no major drop in that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean actually we saw a leveling off of the decline of the fixed voice which is the foundation for the customer base. And I am absolutely convinced that fixed line, some fixed line will be there forever, because it won't be mobility all because when &#x2013; if you want to have HDTV in two places in your home and you want to do broadband and telephony and everything, you can't do that in any other way than with some sort of cable and it's going to be a fiber cable. We have probably &#x2013; we'll have a slightly different strategy depending on the market, but we're talking Sweden now. In Sweden, we must absolutely have the ambition to maintain our position and migrate with our customer base into something very different from what we used to, which is voice over copper to the triple play and all the new services. And at the same time reduce cost, that's a big challenge.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; well in the year, I don't know, but when you say strategically will you be in the low 20s or the high 20s or the 30s, that's not the question of this year that's a question of what's the kind of business you go in. And I'm saying if we succeed with both those things, we should certainly not be in the low 20s, whether it is going to be 29 or 33, I don't know. We'll see.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Finnish Business Daily. The situation in Sweden, you mentioned that the negotiations with the unions are pretty tough. And you said that there is a risk of losing a couple of quarters. What do you exactly mean by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's my perception now &#x2013; first of all, we are following the Swedish system called MBL and LAS. So those rules apply to us now since September of last year. And it's my perception that particularly when union has chosen a strategy to deal with this cost reduction strategy of delay. Make it more difficult, which I regret, because it hurts the company but worse actually, it keeps 1,200 &#x2013; we are going to lose 1,200 people in Sweden you know that. So it keeps people in uncertainty, unnecessarily longer than we could have done better I think and faster. So two concerns, it hurts the company if we delay this by form, by tactics and I'm really concerned that people will have to live in uncertainty for one or two quarters more. But let me also be clear, there is no discussion that the savings will occur, they will occur.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Peter Kurt Nielsen, Cheuvreux in London. Couple of question please. Firstly, you are talking about strong demand for the iPhone as well as the other sort of mobile broadband devices. Could you talk a bit about what this is doing to your acquisition costs in the various markets? And I apologize if you talked on this subject already but can you give us any guidance for your rollout sort of spend, what do you expect to spend in CapEx in your new markets in Nepal and Cambodia in the coming years? And I'd also be interested in how you see the competitive and pricing environment? You were alluding to it a bit in the report but in Sweden and Norway mobile, please. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the CapEx. We don't give any guidance more than we have given out so far so it's we are not specific on Cambodia or Nepal if that was the question.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the iPhone, I am very positive about the iPhone launch that we did last year. I think the iPhone as a terminal is a watershed in our industry. It will change the behavior and the usage of our networks, which I'm very positive towards. And of course there will be other suppliers of products like the iPhone than only Apple. I don't think our acquisition costs are an issue here. What I think is an issue is that it's a watershed and we see an explosion of mobile broadband. And as Kenneth Karlberg talked about in the end of last year, we are looking at how we're going to differentiate the pricing for mobile broadband in some way because we can't just have a flat fee because the usage is so different between some customers compared to other customers. And it's not fair that everybody should pay the same thing when somebody uses it hundred times more, a thousand times more than another customer. We haven't finalized those discussions yet internally but I expect we will come with some sort of differentiated price scheme for mobile broadband.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Maurice here. A couple of questions, first of all can you talk a bit about your ability to repatriate cash from the Fintur operations and MegaFon, something I think could be a focus this year? And the second thing is just to do with the free mobile broadband offers you were offering last year and when we should start seeing that free six months expiring and therefore seeing a revenue uplift coming from mobile broadband? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question regarding I suppose it was dividends from different countries. I mean we don't see any problem right now to take out dividends from the companies. We have done that before, so that has not changed. And as you also know that we haven't received any dividend from MegaFon so far. So but that is not the question of we can't get it out from a country such as Norway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on this free six months I mean that's a common offer in many markets. I think it will continue those kinds of offers from time to time and I don't see any problems that we did it now and some of those are coming to the end. If you take the IPTV in Sweden, the same thing. We were pretty happy with the number of people actually starting paying, using the service. So it's nothing special. It's just normal line of business for most telecom operators I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Yeah. We see some SIM-only in Baltic States, not so much in Sweden, but is an interesting offer. It might also be something that could be attractive also when the economy is good, because I don't know, I am speculating, but I'm not sure that everybody wants to buy a phone every time they want to have an extension of their subscription.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah, Soomit at New Street Research. Can I ask quick question about MegaFon and the contribution to the P&amp;L in Q4. I think it's an estimate which is &#x2013; the number which goes into the P&amp;L but that estimate in ruble terms seems to have stepped down a bit versus Q3. Is that just a product of some kind of anomalies below the sort of EBITDA line from MegaFon or does it reflect perhaps a more cautious outlook on that business for Q4 and perhaps for 2009? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think it's &#x2013; I think it's more a reflection that we also had some kind of currency difference between the Swedish kronor and the ruble even though they've been following each other pretty closely compared to other currencies. Andreas, would you like to add to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; sorry, just to be clear, there's no sort of &#x2013; within that estimate there's no sort of extra caution built in because of perhaps the macro environment in Russia and the impact that might have had on the business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The follow-up on the sort of union dispute and cost cutting in Sweden, is this lying &#x2013; is it enough to sort of jeopardize the 31.8% trend that you've been seeing rolling 12 months? And then a second question, if you maybe could give some light on IPTV in Sweden and what the EBITDA impact is in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is a threat to the 31.8. I wouldn't have said it here otherwise. I actually think the whole discussion about the cost structure in Broadband is more of a strategic issue. It's a structural issue and it's a strategic issue and if that comes one quarter later, so it comes one quarter later, but it has to come. It has to come because we talked about what's the margin going to be. If you don't get the cost out then you're not going to be like high 20s and therefore I am very determined that this will not be executed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Thanks very much. I just got a follow-up on SIM-only, if I can. It really relates to whether or not you feel that SIM-only runs the risk of a pick-up in churn over time, obviously profitable in the near term but do you give away quite a lot in terms of pricing and risk of churn? And secondly just on your strategic position within the associates, at Turkcell are you still supportive of their strategic expansion plans and again I guess at MegaFon do you see any scope for increasing your exposure or increasing your level of influence at MegaFon?</p>

          <p>On the SIM-only question, I actually think SIM-only is attractive to us, yes, maybe there is a bit of churn risk. But our big cost is the subsidy of the terminal and if you sell a SIM card only we don't have to do a subsidy. I think that's a very positive thing. On Turkcell, we are in general terms very supportive of the Turkcell business. I don't want to discuss the different international expansion plans they have. Some, they discussed that in the Board and we are sometimes supportive and sometimes less supportive depending on the situation. But in general terms we are very supportive and happy with Turkcell. In MegaFon I think we have a good dialogue with our co-owners in MegaFon. I think the biggest challenge for MegaFon is what is happening in the Russian market today, but I would also say I believe that MegaFon is in a very strong, good position in relationship to their competitors.</p>
