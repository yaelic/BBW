      <speaker id="1">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. It is once again my great pleasure to join Philippe, Tom, and the rest of the team to discuss Viacom's quarterly results and our exciting future.</p>
          <p>The media business is evolving at an accelerating rate, and Viacom is not only adapting to the changes. but in fact. we are leading the way. Our investment in new programming that drives multiple screens is the driving force behind our extraordinary ability to create television shows, blockbuster movies with worldwide appeal. In fact, Viacom content is now being distributed in innovative ways that were inconceivable only a few years ago.</p>
          <p>Our management team continues to deliver on Viacom's commitment to continuously improve, relentlessly innovate and steadily return capital to shareholders. I have unwavering confidence in my good friend Philippe and his leadership of Viacom's executive and creative teams. Together, we will continue to build Viacom's core business and drive even greater value.</p>
          <p>And now it's my pleasure to turn this call over to the man who is actually the wisest man I have ever met in my life, my good friend, Philippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sumner, my friend, and good morning, everyone. Glad you could join us today to discuss the first quarter of Viacom's 2013 fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As expected, our results for the December quarter were impacted by short-term challenges. Most notably, fewer home-entertainment releases and a less-favorable mix of theatrical releases from our film entertainment segment, and the lingering effect of ratings softness at rapidly improving Nickelodeon, which masked a solid performance by our media networks overall.</p>
          <p>We're achieving sequential ratings improvement in most of our key brands, and excluding our Nickelodeon group, our network's return to positive ad-revenue growth in the quarter. The size of ratings momentum we saw during the quarter confirm our view that our significant and sustained investment in fresh, original content is working and will continue to drive future ratings growth and revenue improvement.</p>
          <p>And we continue to be excited about the rich and diverse slate that Paramount Pictures brings to theaters this year, including the just released Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters and the upcoming GI Joe: Retaliation and Star Trek: Into Darkness.</p>
          <p>As always, we'll move our content and build our brands across markets and screens around the world. As we do, we'll continue to deliver significant value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Tom and Wade will go into greater detail in a moment, but let me quickly recap Viacom's financial results for the December quarter. Revenues declined 16% to $3.31 billion. Operating income decreased 22% to $797 million, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom declined to $461 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.91 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>We continue to generate significant free cash flow, which we used to repurchase $700 million in stock in the quarter, under our $10 billion share repurchase program. We expect to repurchase an additional $700 million in stock in this quarter.</p>
          <p>In our media network segment, advertising revenue was down 6% due entirely to the shortfall at the Nickelodeon group. Excluding the Nickelodeon networks, our domestic networks returned to positive ad-sales growth in the quarter, and Nickelodeon's ratings improvement will help us significantly improve our overall ad-sales performance going forward.</p>
          <p>Affiliate revenue grew 3% in the first fiscal quarter. While our core domestic affiliate revenue grew in the low double-digit range, the overall affiliate line was moderated by the timing of content availability for digital distribution partners in the quarter. For the full year, we expect 10% total domestic affiliate growth. We continue to see strong demand for our branded content from traditional and digital distribution partners alike.</p>
          <p>Our focus remains on investing to bring more and more new, original content to air. Although our network portfolio courts a more varied cross-section of demos than any other, the consistent refrain we hear from our audiences is that they want new shows and new episodes in faster cycle. And so we're delivering at all of our networks, accelerating development timelines and production to accelerate our ratings turnaround.</p>
          <p>Today I'm going to focus on two key networks and go a little deeper in our strategic thinking and the vast amount of production activity under way as well as touch on some important activity at several other networks.</p>
          <p>MTV, to start, began to answer the question what's next after Jersey Shore? Catfish: The TV Show was the number one new cable series of 2012 with MTV's core 12-to-34 demo, and the virality of the show has been remarkable, even before the phenomenon of catfishing went mainstream in recent headlines.</p>
          <p>The over-arching mission of MTV remains unchanged. We're focused on being the cultural home of the millennial generation. But within that content, we're rolling out more and more new, original programs that tap into creative themes we see popping up in youth culture. Among those are the complexities of modern relationships for young people. With Catfish, we've tapped a rich generational theme and have a number of pilots in development that will explore the new ways millennials navigate relationships.</p>
          <p>MTV also continues to reinvent reality with diverse young voices ranging from Washington Heights to BUCKWILD, which attracted a series high 2.7 million viewers last Thursday. We're also expanding on the strong female-comedy franchise we have in Awkward, which returns next quarter, with new shows like our topical-comedy series Nikki &amp; Sara Live, which debuted this week.</p>
          <p>The underpinnings of this creative breadth is a scheduling strategy that uses our existing hits as a launchpad for the influx of new originals and creates a more-balanced weekly schedule for audiences and advertisers.</p>
          <p>Jersey Shore was a game-changing hit for MTV, and it also precipitated an overemphasis on one night. We're now successfully building out additional nights, whether it's the Teen Mom and Catfish reality block on Mondays or female comedies like Snooki and JWoww, Nikki and Sara Live, or Awkward on Tuesday nights. Currently four of MTV's five original series on air rank number-one in their time period across all television in the network's core demo. We're also working to eventize our weekend programming, where we see marathons of library programming like True Life and Jackass perform well.</p>
          <p>On last quarter's call, we mentioned that MTV has scored a coup by hiring proven hit-maker Susanne Daniels as its new president of programming. Susanne has hit the ground running, already having completed a review of our production partners and accelerated our pilot process. She's also building out her team, most recently bringing aboard a new head of scripted development to develop the hit Pretty Little Liars. We're really excited about the momentum at MTV and the creative direction and strategic thinking behind it.</p>
          <p>Nickelodeon continued its resurgence in the December quarter, posting three consecutive months of sequential ratings improvement. A lot of that strength was driven by greater emphasis on event programming. We've seen specials, stunts and new episodes do really well with young audiences, so we packed the quarter with events from strong franchises like SpongeBob and Fairly OddParents, and new ones like Peter Rabbit.</p>
          <p>In the short term, Nickelodeon's focused on three priorities. Reclaim and retain its Saturday morning leadership, strengthen its weekday afternoon block, and strengthen its preschool viewership to feed long-term viewership of its big-kid audiences.</p>
          <p>That last point is particularly critical as the network hits the generational reset button. Nickelodeon's long-term strategy is to refine its programming filter for an audience that is purely post-millennial, a position that the network will detail for advertisers as the Kids Upfront kicks off next month.</p>
          <p>Fueled by an unprecedented investment in content, the development pipeline at Nickelodeon is flowing strong. Through September, Nickelodeon is debuting six new animated series, including Monsters Versus Aliens, which is based on the hit DreamWorks film, and we're seeing ongoing strength from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, both on air and at retail, where sell-through rates of most products approached 100% in the quarter. The Turtles return with all new episodes this Saturday. In addition, in an important new initiative, Nickelodeon will be introducing a new live afternoon block in about a month.</p>
          <p>Much of our success in getting new programming to screens faster can be tied back to Nickelodeon's move to centralize and reorganize its creative leadership in Los Angeles under Russell Hicks. Our television, movie and short-form live-action and animation teams are working  in a more-coordinated fashion, sharing best practices and writers, and have taken steps to accelerate development and production. We have especially focused on enhancing our animation efforts, and we've attracted significant new talent in that area.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Nickelodeon continues to build out a strong, multi-platform offering to complement its on-air programming and will debut an innovative standalone app in the months to come. Through this year and beyond, the Nickelodeon story will continue to get better.</p>
          <p>Comedy Central has ramped up original production significantly. This first half of calendar 2013 features six new series from young comedians coming to air, including the Kroll Show, which has already been picked up for a second season. This represents a great payoff from the network's development strategy through which it identifies young, distinct comic voices, incubates them through our stand-up specials, exposure in our road series and our record label and DTL platforms, and gives the best and most promising a shot with their own series. In the current quarter, Comedy Central also has several hit series returning with new episodes, including Tosh.0, The Burn and Workaholics.</p>
          <p>Spike brought Bellator MMA to air this month. Bellator is a great long-term growth opportunity for us, given that we own a large majority of the MMA enterprise, unlike our previous association with UFC. In the near term, Bellator enables Spike to establish a Thursday night block focused on live fights, leverage its expertise in marketing MMA, and capitalize on high advertiser demand for the sport.</p>
          <p>At the same time, Spike continues to build on new, original programming with broader appeal on every other night of the week, including new seasons of series such as Bar Rescue and Auction Hunters that expand the network's audience base in prime and repeat well throughout the schedule.</p>
          <p>At BET, the network launched two big new hits this month in the Real Husbands of Hollywood and Second Generation Wayans.</p>
          <p>Real Husbands attracted 4.1 million viewers in its debut and is a great example of how we're being fast and flexible in bringing new programming to air. The series went into development after Kevin Hart's sketches on the BET Awards in July with initial plans to launch in the spring. However, BET decided to push up the launch of Real Husbands to early January to respond to the shifting competitive landscape. The move required a quick and Herculean effort by the BET programming, marketing and PR machine, which clearly paid off, giving the network a very solid platform for the return of its hits The Game and Let's Stay Together in March. This is a great example of how we're pushing harder to be thoughtful, nimble and aggressive in programming across our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So that's a quick look at some of the ways we're investing in content and bringing more new programming to air to engage our audiences and capitalize on positive ratings momentum. And of course, we are laser-focused on the number-one theme that echoes across our industry, alleviating current limitations on cross-platform measurements. We are working aggressively, both internally and with partners, to address the situation and find a path to measurement and monitorization of multi-platform viewing, which will be a particular boost for us. We hope to have more to share with you on that front in the near future.</p>
          <p>Internationally, Viacom International Media Networks continues to feel the impact of the economic conditions in Europe, but we also see real gains in our long-term strategy to grow our results-focused business. In the December quarter, our comedy channels posted ratings gains of 14% internationally, and the Paramount Channel in Spain posted steady ratings increases as well, as we prepare to launch in several additional countries this year.</p>
          <p>We also continue to optimize our approach market to market, establishing strong partnerships in some while assuming full ownership of our media properties in others. Colors, our general entertainment channel joint venture in India, saw strong ratings gains early in the first quarter. Our partnership with SBS in Korea has yielded ratings, revenue and distribution increases for MTV and Nickelodeon in that market since it began in 2011. And in Italy, we recently took direct control of our Comedy Central and Nickelodeon brands, ending a joint venture with a local partner. We expect our international networks group to return to ad-sales growth in this second fiscal quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's move to our film entertainment segment. Revenue was down 37% because of a very different mix of film and the timing of theatrical releases in the quarter. In the comparable quarter of fiscal 2012, we had significant revenue from Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and the DreamWorks animation feature Puss In Boots.</p>
          <p>The Tom Cruise action of Jack Reacher posted a solid performance at the box office, particularly internationally, which is encouraging as we increase our focus on developing pictures with expansive global appeal. Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, for example, opened at number-one last weekend in the US and in all but one of the 19 global markets in which it launched.</p>
          <p>The Paramount slate kicks into high gear in March with GI Joe: Retaliation and continues through the year with Michael Bay's Pain and Gain, Star Trek Into Darkness, World War Z, the fifth installment of Paranormal Activity, the Anchorman sequel, and the Tom Clancy reboot Jack Ryan all due in theaters before the end of the calendar year.</p>
          <p>To conclude, we're working to accelerate our ratings momentum by investing in content and bringing new programming to air quickly as we move the company back to ad-sales growth. And we have a strong succession of promising films hitting theaters through the end of the year. We're very excited about the creative energy throughout the company, the content we're delivering to audiences, and the value we will continue to deliver for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to introduce Wade Davis, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Wade has been with us for some time and has a strong financial background and a very strategic view of our businesses. He is a great addition to our senior executive team. Congratulations, Wade, and welcome.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Philippe. I'm excited to be here and look forward to working with the team in the capacity of CFO.</p>
          <p>Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentations summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our media networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 2% compared with the prior year, with domestic revenues down 2% and international revenues down 5%. Foreign exchange losses had a 1 percentage point impact on international revenues.</p>
          <p>The decline in revenues in the quarter was driven by lower advertising revenues, which were partially offset by growth in affiliate revenues. Page 10 of our web-deck provides a breakdown of our media networks' revenue performance.</p>
          <p>Domestic advertising revenues were down 6% in the quarter, and international advertising revenues declined 10%. The declines in international advertising were driven by lower revenues from production and promotional events as well as softness in Europe. Foreign exchange losses impacted the international growth rate by one percentage point.</p>
          <p>In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 4% while international revenues were up 1%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under digital-distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew low double-digits. International was up due to new channel launches as well as rate and subscriber introduces, partially offset by lower digital-distribution revenue due to the timing of product availability.</p>
          <p>Expenses increased 3% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 8% while SG&amp;A expense was flat. SG&amp;A expense benefited from lower incentive-based compensation.</p>
          <p>Media networks' adjusted operating income was down 9%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 43%, down approximately 300 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin decline was principally due to lower advertising revenues as well as increased programming expense.</p>
          <p>Moving to filmed entertainment, revenues declined 30% in the quarter due to lower theatrical, home entertainment, and TV license fee revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of filmed entertainment revenues.</p>
          <p>Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 42% due to the difficult comparisons to last year's release of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol as well as lower revenues from the current quarter's Rise of the Guardians as compared to Puss In Boots, which was released in the December quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 43%, reflecting fewer home entertainment releases in the quarter, as we released one title this year compared to four titles in the December quarter of last year. The decline in home entertainment revenue also was impacted by lower carryover revenues as the December quarter of last year benefited from Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The decrease in TV license fees of 24% in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in the pay-TV marketplace.</p>
          <p>Filmed entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $139 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $31 million last year. The lower results principally reflected lower home-entertainment profits as well as the timing and performance of our theatrical releases.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Wade, and welcome.</p>
          <p>I'm going to discuss our cash flow and debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we generated $549 million in operating free cash flow, compared to $602 million last year. We continue to maximize our free-cash-flow efficiency, converting nearly 70% of operating income into free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Page 5 of the web-deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to lower operating income and higher tax cashes, partially offset by lower working-capital utilization. The favorable working-capital variance was impacted by lower theatrical receivable balances as well as improved collections of advertising revenues in the December quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.7%. This past quarter, we continued to take advantage of the favorable rate environment by issuing $250 million of new 30-year debentures with a very attractive coupon of 4.375%. We also executed an exchange offer for our 6.875% debentures due 2036 and our 6.75% debentures due 2037.</p>
          <p>In total, $844 million in principal amounts of these higher-coupon debentures were tendered and exchanged for additional 4.375% debentures. These transactions, together with our other actions over the past year, have lowered the average cost of our fixed-rate debt by 80 basis points since December 31, 2011.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also amended our evolving credit facility, which increased its size from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the maturity two years to November of 2017, providing us with significant financial flexibility for the next five years. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable-rate borrowings outstanding at quarter-end.</p>
          <p>In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding, and $671 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at quarter-end was 2.2 times. At December 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the December quarter. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $977 million of capital back to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter, which means that in the first six months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>When we began our buyback program a little over two years ago, we had more than $600 million shares outstanding. As of December 31, we had less than 500 million shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to some of the factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year. For 2013, we see affiliate-revenue growth of 10%. However, quarterly affiliate-revenue growth will fluctuate, given that revenue recognition on some of our digital agreements is tied to product availability. In the March quarter, we expect that the reported affiliate-revenue growth rate will be in low single digits, which is a combination of lower digital revenues and double-digit growth in traditional revenues.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we continue to expect a high-single-digit growth rate for media networks programming expense. Given the timing of shows coming on air, growth will be weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout our organizations in order to preserve or enhance our margins for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>At filmed entertainment, we are excited about our upcoming tent-pole releases, including GI Joe, Star Trek, and World War Z. We expect the growth in profit to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year as the studio benefits from the availability of titles in the TV and home-entertainment marketplaces.</p>
          <p>For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. As for our stock buyback program, we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for fiscal 2013.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continue to invest in our brands. At media networks, we are growing the level of original programming and are encouraged by the ratings progress we are starting to see at several of our flagship networks. And at Paramount, we are developing new franchises to enhance our pipeline of films into the future.</p>
          <p>We continue to be opportunistic in the capital markets, taking advantage of the current attractive rate environment to lower our average cost of debt, while at the same time, extending our average maturity. And we continue to use the capacity from our balance sheet and our free cash flow to aggressively return capital to our shareholders by both shrinking our equity base and providing a dividend.</p>
          <p>Now, operator, we'll turn the call over to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have one for Philippe and one for Tom.</p>
          <p>If I heard correctly, you are going to launch a new Nickelodeon app this year, and I wondered is that going to be authenticated and part of an affiliate-fee relationship? Or do you expect to go out and try incremental payments and rights from your distributors for that app? So how is that going to roll out and what's the monetization model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Nickelodeon announce all the features of the app, which is going to be launched in the very near future. It's quite innovative. It will be authenticated. But it will allow us to really grow in the future. And you'll see it's very different from anything you will have seen in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is this model &#x2013; is it part of your existing relationships with distributors?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Tom, can you talk a bit about- I don't know if you know this number off the top of your head, but if you look at your programming spending over the past year, let's say, what percentage of the content you're paying for is actually acquired content? And how has it changed? And how will it change? So give a sense of, as the mix shift continues, how much is left that's acquired of what you spent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Acquired programming still represents a pretty significant amount of money. It's a little over half of what we are spending. But that number has decreased significantly and will decrease significantly into the future.</p>
          <p>So we think acquired programming does have a place on a lot of our networks, certainly the ones like TV Land and Nick At Night that require and live on more of that. But into the future, as you know on both of those networks, we've started to put original programming to begin to replace that &#x2013; original programming that is new and exclusive to us where we own all the rights. And we think that is going to be critical as you move into the future, where this program lives across the platforms and around the world.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Megan Durkin in for Doug. So you talked about attacking the preschool audience at Nick, but competition in that category has increased with Disney now aggressively programming Disney Junior. So can you tell us more about your plans there? Do you think you can go after girls, boys? And also I wanted to see how you think about balancing the preschool programming between Nick and Nick Jr.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're focused very much on improving the Nickelodeon rating situation. We probably, last year, put a little too much programming on Nick Jr. from Nickelodeon, and we've reversed direction in part there, and we're seeing part of those results.</p>
          <p>In terms of how we're going to do it, it's really an intense focus on new animation content. As I mentioned, we're launching a number of series. We have Peter Rabbit, which we launched as a special event in the last quarter, which will be a regular series. And we have a number of additional animated efforts.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in my remarks, we have &#x2013; we organized how we're developing. We've added more animators and more animation talent. We've speeded up the development process. And importantly we are also speeding up the production process. So we'll be able to turn around and turn in these new series much more quickly.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we're sticking with what works. And you'll see some exciting developments in some existing franchises like Dora, you'll see. And again, Nickelodeon will lay it out at Upfront, but our existing franchises will be at least partially reinvented to be more exciting to girls and boys alike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a very quick follow-up. Is the Nick Jr. sponsorship ads that you added this year, is that having any impact on your advertising dollars at Nick group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we offer our advertisers a multiplatform opportunity, really reaching our audiences, whether it's Nickelodeon kids or MTV on teenagers, that's the direction the world is moving in. We work very closely with our advertisers to reach our audiences wherever they are.</p>
          <p>And that's why we really look forward to having better measurement systems. We're experimenting very actively in that regard, and we expect once we get to that point to be a real driver of growth for us in advertising. Because we over index &#x2013; our audiences over index in utilization of non-television platforms.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you just comment a bit on the tone of the advertising market? How scatter is trending? Any notable cancellation activities for the June quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexia, no notable cancellation activities. The scatter market is strong. In fact, it appears to be picking up strength in this quarter. Pricing continues to be up in the teens over the up-fronts. It's up mid-single digits, scatter to scatter. And we're seeing demand from categories like food, QSR, wireless, electronics, automotive.</p>
          <p>And we're also looking forward to getting into those categories so important to us. So we have more film product that is appealing to younger audiences. Towards the end of last quarter, we had a lot of various adult oriented films, and obviously we prefer the big franchise as well as family films, and there are a lot of them coming out as the year unfolds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on your comments toward the shift toward the focus on the younger demographic at Nick, is that sort of a notable shift sort of away from the tweens demo, or is it more in addition to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to serve all the demos, but we have a generational shift. And so we want to capture that preschool audience so they grow with us in Nickelodeon family. That's what we've always done. We need to reinforce that. And we are going to program toward all age groups.</p>
          <p>What we're going to do is increase the amount and range of programming that we have. That's why we've increased our investment in programming in Nickelodeon. That allows us to make more animated shows, more shows for the older kids and continue to make more shows for tweens. So it's really increasing and accelerating the programming addressed to all kids. But the special focus on the young ones is to capture the new kids so that they grow into childhood-long aficionados of Nickelodeon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Just following up to Alexia's question, I wanted to get your sense on how you see volumes in the marketplace? And more specifically, did you see any impact from macroeconomic conditions in any way holding back volumes that were showing up on the MTV and networks?</p>
          <p>And then a second question. We've been looking at set-top-box data, and it's obviously very different than the Nielsen data. But what we see is really heavy concentration of SpongeBob on Nick, in terms of the viewing hours. And on the other hand, it also shows viewing going up. Is that kind of concentration, in your view, a good thing? Is it causing the rates to go up? Or would you rather see a broader base of viewing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on your first question, on general demand volume in the marketplace and macroeconomic conditions &#x2013; certainly speaking broadly, towards the end of last quarter, there was a lot of concern as we were having these fiscal-cliff discussions and the like, from a macro standpoint, on the part of a lot of companies around. Did that have a modest impact in general in the industry? Probably. But I think that's really gone away.</p>
          <p>I think we see from a macro standpoint, increasing confidence in the marketplace. While European conditions continue to be weak, I think there's more stability there. So we think that GDP growth this year will improve over last year. And that's good for us. And as I said in response to the earlier question, demand is good right now.</p>
          <p>As far as SpongeBob is concerned, some have raised doubts in the past about SpongeBob's vitality. He is one of the great, enduring characters, not just for us, but in the entertainment universe generally. We are continuing to build that franchise. I recently visited the production facilities for the SpongeBob film that Paramount will be releasing at the end of next year, and it will be spectacular.</p>
          <p>So SpongeBob is great for us not just on air and driving ratings, but also is a driver of our consumer-products business, which allows us to launch other franchises. So that's &#x2013; it's good inherently, and it helps us launch new programming on-air, and new franchises and consumer-products business.</p>
          <p>So yes, we continue with SpongeBob. And yes, we are also building diversity in programming and more programming and consumer-products opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, as Philippe said, we use it strategically to launch other new franchises, which Nickelodeon has been launching recently. And it is a very successful launch vehicle to get new programming established on the air. So it's a workhorse for us, and one we are very, very happy to have, and hope to have long into the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Nick is clearly getting better, based on what everyone talked about during the call. But I think investor fear has shifted a bit to MTV. And was wondering how do you react to the post-Jersey fear about MTV's health? And how do you make sure you don't have a problem to MTV akin to what happened in the past year at Nick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you're seeing the vitality of MTV right now. And you're seeing the post-Jersey-Shore environment.</p>
          <p>We had great development, even before Susanne came on board. And Catfish and BUCKWILD are both new shows &#x2013; have really strong ratings that have been growing. I like it more to have several hits like that than to rely on one show. So I think it will be healthy. And our continuing shows like Teen Mom and Snooki and JWoww, our Jersey Shore offshoots, are also doing well.</p>
          <p>So I feel very comfortable with MTV, and on top of that, we have about a good a development pipe line as I've seen here. And we have really great, strong programming talent. The new hire we just announced will only make the programming group at MTV stronger.</p>
          <p>So I'm feeling very good about the MTV franchise. Very good about the Nickelodeon franchise. Very good about the Comedy Central and BET franchises, and all the others that we have around the house.</p>
          <p>As I said in my remarks, we have focused intensely &#x2013;  our company's all about content, it's all about programming. We're focusing intently &#x2013; all of our groups are focusing intently on developing more new, compelling programming.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have two quick questions.</p>
          <p>The first one is, is there any way you can give us an order of magnitude expectation for sequential improvement in ad revenues, assuming audience deliveries for Nick remain pretty consistent in the current quarter versus the prior?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just going back to the Nick app issue &#x2013; or the opportunity, I should say &#x2013; are you going to try and sell that inventory in connection with this year's Upfront? And how will you tackle the cross-platform measurement issues, such that an impression on one platform is equivalent to another? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, thank you. As far as the ad sales, in this quarter &#x2013; and again, I don't like to get too far ahead of myself &#x2013; but we are going to be very close to being flat year on year in ad sales. And going forward, after that, we are going to grow our ad sales. So that's the trajectory that we're on, based on what we see out there today.</p>
          <p>As far as just on the specifics of the Nick app, I really do want to leave it, because there's a lot to it, for Nickelodeon to launch it.</p>
          <p>But more broadly on the cross-platform issue and ad sales, we are testing putting an ad load on VOD, where we can have the ads that we have on-air also appear on VOD and have that platform measured as part of the package. We will &#x2013; again, on a multiplatform basis, working with Nielsen but also with others to see how we can capture viewership.</p>
          <p>If we can capture the viewership and the ratings on our commercials, we will expand distribution of our content across platforms with major distributors. We've already entered into agreements &#x2013; so-called TV Everywhere agreements &#x2013; with several major distributors. Their ability to distribute our networks outside of the home on other devices will be based on measurement. Once we do that, because our audiences will overindex on that kind of viewership, it will expand our audience and expand our share of ad dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we're aggressively selling advertising now, across all platforms, and we offer that option to advertisers. And as Philippe mentioned, on a linear basis, we're using the traditional sample based methodology for billing and revenue generation. And in the digital world, you can use AdServe so you really have very accurate estimate of delivery.</p>
          <p>So it's a brave new world that includes the ability of consumers to watch commercials and television shows when they want, where they want to watch them. And we have the ability to insert commercial &#x2013; and we will have the ability in the not-too-distant future to insert commercials whenever they consume them. That would be more appropriate for either delivery of that commercial or more appropriate for the specific targeting of that consumer.</p>
          <p>So it's a really exciting time in the world of advertising as it relates to multiplatform consumption of content, and I think we're a leader in that regard, as our content is voraciously consumed across those platforms.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. A couple questions, Philippe, congratulations on the success with BUCKWILD and Washington Heights. Can you confirm whether or not the network has ordered a second season or a second season block at all of any of those series?</p>
          <p>And then also it's been awhile since you've talked about animation division, which I guess you started almost two years ago. Could you just talk about like what the next release is? When it's going to be? What the average negative cost per film is going to be? Any sort of quick thumb profile you want to give on the animation division going forward that would be very helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As far as Washington Heights and BUCKWILD, I don't believe that MTV has announced yet whether it is ordering second seasons. I'll leave it to the programming department to time those announcements.</p>
          <p>As far as the animation division, it's progressing very well. We have a number of projects in development. A SpongeBob production &#x2013; as I mentioned I visited the production facility &#x2013; is very much on target for our release in 2014.</p>
          <p>We are shortly going to greenlight our second feature &#x2013; again, I will leave it to Paramount to announce it &#x2013; which will be released in 2015. It will be based on original IP. It will be toy-etic, so will have consumer products possibilities. And then we have a number of other projects in the pipeline behind those. So we are very much on track to begin with one release a year, and someday perhaps building to a faster pace.</p>
          <p>The budgets on those features are all designed to be under $100 million, and in some cases significantly below $100 million. That's our objective, and we feel we can deliver a great look on the screen for that amount with the way we are making those movies and the partners we are using to make them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Tom, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on margins and expenses in the year. I wanted to ask you how much discretion do you have over programming cost increases? Because correct me if I'm wrong, but I think last year, you ended up growing costs less than you expected in the beginning of the year. So if the ratings are softer than we expect now, would you be able to still maintain the margin at the networks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, given the way we made commitments, I think our programming visibility for this fiscal year is pretty much locked-in. There's not a lot of variability because we're either in production with those shows or completed production and awaiting airing them. So I think our visibility there is pretty tight.</p>
          <p>Our flexibility in the cost structure is where we attack SG&amp;A expenses and work to modify the way we do business on a year-in year-out basis to drive efficiencies there. And that has been and will continue to be the driver of margin improvement for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, guys. A couple questions. First, a clarification on the ad pacings you discussed. You said trends were positive excluding Nick. Was that in the December quarter as well as in the coming quarter or would you still have been negative domestically ex-Nick in the December quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the point that was made on the December quarter is that the shortfall &#x2013; that the decline in ad sales year on year was entirely due to the Nickelodeon group. So if you leave out the Nickelodeon networks, the rest of our networks in the aggregate grew their ad sales year on year in the December quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So then given the importance of Nickelodeon to the kids ecosystem in general in television, I'm curious your thoughts on where those dollars are going? Are they staying in television and going elsewhere? Are they sitting on the shelf, so to speak? Or are your partners increasingly looking for other media that they want to put that money to work in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the following as far as that goes. And remember that the December quarter is a big quarter in the kids marketplace, which is why it had such a significant impact on our ad sales.</p>
          <p>Nickelodeon is doing a very good job in maintaining share. There was some issues in the quarter in the marketplace in general, in the toy category and the fact that there were fewer kids' releases in that quarter than there usually are. So you had the DreamWorks animation film. You didn't have much else in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So there was some less demand. But that really &#x2013; we left some non-endemic money on the table because of the rating issues that we had. So that's not really the cause for such a shortfall that we had in that quarter. But it also means that we weren't losing a lot of business to our competitors in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Nick worked very closely with a lot of its key strategic advertisers. Obviously, the December quarter is a critical quarter for our advertisers to get their messages out, and we worked &#x2013; to the extent we were under-delivering relative to the up fronts, to deliver as many impressions as we could to satisfy what we had promised those people. And that was one of the reasons, that becomes less of an issue as we roll forward from here. So that gives us renewed optimism.</p>
          <p>And as Philippe said, some of the categories were off a bit. And one of the bigger categories was film releases. And we see that shaping up in a different way as we roll forward from here for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. If you don't mind if I can squeeze in one more quickly. Your on-demand platforms that you're partnering with &#x2013; so we talk about Netflix and I'm thinking about your cable telco distribution partners that you provide with content. Can you talk a little bit at this point what you're seeing in the trend of consumption on those video-on-demand platforms? Are you seeing more &#x2013; help me with maybe the pace of growth in consumption of your content on the on-demand platforms? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well, the consumption of our content &#x2013; we see the &#x2013; we have content on platforms like Netflix and Hulu. The growth of streams of our content far outpaces the growth of subscribers that they have. Because we do receive data.</p>
          <p>So our content does very well there. And that includes content that's been up there for quite a while, the non-refreshed content. So again, I think that bodes well for our revenue opportunities on both the advertising front as well as the distribution revenue front in these new distribution platforms.</p>

          <p>And as the consumer interface on on-demand and VOD within cable and telco distributors improves, we continue to see our product &#x2013; which has always been one of the top products that was time-shifted, if you will &#x2013; continue to be very aggressively consumed across the ecosystem, and growing.</p>

          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just two questions. Just following up on the discussion about improved cross-platform measurement and the experiments you're doing there, any sense as to how much the revenue impact would be across all your platforms, if everything that you were testing got rolled out kind of as you expected? Is this a low-single-digit number? Mid-single-digits? And kind of what you envision the actual timing of the actual improvements being.</p>
          <p>And then second, your networks appeal to younger demographics, which may be somewhat more resistant to the pay-TV bundle. So  are there any other ways of going to market with your content which you think could be material to your business model going forward? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's way too early to start quantifying what the results of cross-platform measurement. We know it will be good, and we're going to view it as part of our overall ad sales effort, but it's way premature to get into that. I'll leave all the analysts to do that.</p>
          <p>As far as the pay-TV marketplace and how channels distribute it, it's a very &#x2013; continues to be a very compelling consumer proposition. It's always been the case that you need young people to move into their own apartments and houses before they subscribe. We continue to see the multichannel universe expanding &#x2013; very slowly right now, but as the economy picks up, I expect that will continue.</p>
          <p>Now the way in which the television is distributed is evolving. Obviously, in addition to the satellite and telco and cable providers, you have the beginnings &#x2013; and a number of companies &#x2013; who are exploring other products &#x2013; so-called over-the-top delivery. And those will also be multichannel packages, and we're in conversations with many of those.</p>
          <p>As to when that will become significant, it's hard to tell, but there's certainly a lot of investments right behind it. And that will be good for us. That will be another form of distribution, and we'll be able to add a number of exciting features to the programming that will increase its appeal to our audience.</p>
