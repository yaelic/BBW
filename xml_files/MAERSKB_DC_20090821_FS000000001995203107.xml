          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Interim Report 2009. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to your host, A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Group CEO, Nils S. Anderson. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So welcome also from me. And glad you're listening in this early in the morning, and I'm sure you've all seen the upload on the net, so we can go straight into it. If we start by the forward-looking statement, and maybe, while you read that, I'll just give you my take on the situation.</p>
          <p>We're, needless to say, not pleased to be presenting a loss for the first half, but Q2 was in line with our expectations, probably even a little bit better, this when you take into account the impairments and confirms that, actually, that our actions and what we're doing do give results.</p>
          <p>On the top line, looking at it from really &#x2013; on a very high level before we dive into the details, the top line is down by USD 7.7 billion at broadly unchanged economic level of activity. A few containers less, a few lifts less in the terminals but broadly speaking, the same level of physical activity.</p>
          <p>And when we correct for effects on taxes and correct for currency exchange rates, falling bunker prices and so on, we can actually very roughly calculate that the effects of the actions we've taken internally in the Company, gives us an improved underlying situation or cost picture, compared to the same period last year of somewhere between one and USD1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And we feel quite satisfied with that, and really looking into the future, these are the actions that will strengthen our position long-term, when the markets do turn. Also, looking across the Group, here initially, it's &#x2013; of course, we need to improve generally throughout the Group, but actually, most of our businesses are already doing quite well, and the only real problem areas we have at the moment are, of course first and foremost, the container rates and secondly, the tanker rates.</p>
          <p>So we feel that even if it's been a tough first half year and the prediction for the full year still is not very rosy, it's a crisis of historic dimensions and we feel that we have the situation well under control.</p>
          <p>But having said that, and if you read the forward-looking statement, then I'll go through the next slide, which are the highlights. Of course, the global economic crisis has had a very negative impact on the activities of the Group, and at the moment where most of our businesses have found their feet and the world is becoming a little bit easier to look through or analyze, the situation is that especially the Container Shipping and Tankers business is hard hit.</p>
          <p>Of course also, in the first half, our result was negatively impacted by the fact that the oil price was only $52 a barrel compared to the first half of 2008. That is approximately half. We are now heading into a more positive territory in the oil prices, and the level which we have today you can't say is really bad oil prices.</p>
          <p>The oil and gas production was 8% above the first half of 2008. We'll come back to that under the oil part. But this, of course, also driven by the fact that we are compensated for cost in Qatar, so when oil prices are low, volumes will be higher. Our result before impairment and write-downs of USD 200 million was a breakeven result in Q2, which is, as I said before, probably slightly better than what we expected at the end of first quarter. We continue to work hard on cost saving initiatives. The results we've seen in the first quarter, we find, are satisfactory, but of course we'll have to continue to work on that.</p>
          <p>Before I go to the next page, just please note that we've changed the way we report business segments result. As from January 1, we've introduced the word segment result, after tax. It's basically a NOPAT result. The idea is to help you with your analysis because, given the tax situation is very different in our various segments, we feel this is a more relevant way to publish.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, in the past, when we've given net results, we've also had some, you can say to a certain degree, random allocation of equity among the companies, and we feel this is a more &#x2013; an easier way to get an overview of the Group activities.</p>
          <p>So turning to the next page, the Consolidated Financial Information, as I said before, a very, very significant drop in revenue driven by &#x2013; mainly by lower container freight rates; to a certain extent, of course, also container volumes, but really freight rates and lower oil price have been the key driver of that.</p>
          <p>And going down to line three, depreciation, amortization and impairments, we have main impairments of USD 223 million, mainly in the segment &#x2013; or in the segment Other Shipping, and that's, of course, affecting this line, as is also the fact that we have a strong investment program still running in 2009, and that, of course, means that we're taking more assets into use, also pushing investments or depreciations up.</p>
          <p>Sales gains are practically non-existent in the first half this year, which, of course, also is part of the reason why our result is significantly worse than last year. The reason for that is that there is no real market for tonnage. If you want to sell, it's at very distressed prices, and basically the sellers are being forced into the market. So if we don't see a need for being &#x2013; selling at distressed prices, we've had no transactions.</p>
          <p>The net profit is negative and basically driven by deterioration in the container shipping and tanker activities. Of course, the shipyards are also negative, but it's a small activity. So it's mainly driven by the Container business. Apart from Container Shipping and Tankers, all other activities are in positive results for the first half.</p>
          <p>So turning to the next page, just coming back to the selected items on the first half, we had minor sales gains, sold a few tanker vessels, and that's the most important points here. In the Container Shipping, we continued the restructuring program. I'll come onto the affects of that in our personnel count in a minute; spending 70 million on that.</p>
          <p>And then we had some write-downs and impairments in the Tankers, Offshore and Other Shipping. Integration cost of Brostr&#xF6;m of USD 17 million was actually lower than expected, and I'll come back to the integration in a little while. It's gone quite well. Some contract impairments, and then impairments on tanker vessels and drilling rig and a few other specific items where we felt that was necessary.</p>
          <p>Going to the next page, just giving you an overview, and this is very roughly. I'm sure there's some things that we've done that is not on here, but just giving you a very broad overview of what has happened in terms of restructuring in the Group, or cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>In Container Shipping, we took out, in the first half, 1,500 positions on top of the 4,500 we reduced in 2008. Of course, since Container business is still under a lot of pressure, and it's necessary for us to further improve our competitiveness, these are programs that will continue to roll, and I think the Container organization have come into a good rhythm where, as soon as processes are working better, that we actually take out the administrative staff related to it.</p>
          <p>In APM Terminals, we've trimmed the organization also here, making sure that there's a more direct line of contact between the headquarter and the individual terminals, trying to ensure that nothing gets delayed, positions are taken fast, and APM Terminals have actually had a very good second quarter.</p>
          <p>Tankers, Offshore and Other Shipping, here we're, of course, talking about organizations that are not very administratively heavy, but nevertheless, by doing the integration of Maersk Tankers and Brostr&#xF6;m, we did manage to reduce the white collar staff by 144 positions, and that means that the integration is basically over and has been successful, very fast, and the team has done a very good job.</p>
          <p>In terms of Oil and Gas activities, of course, with the falling oil prices, the oil industry is now in a deflationary environment, which is good provided you act, and we've worked very hard on reducing operational expenses and negotiating re-grades and so on. Plus, we've also delayed some marginal investments to make sure that our cash generation follows the plans.</p>
          <p>Retail, Dansk Supermarked had gone through a cost reduction program as well, and they're actually also back on track. We'll come back to that in a minute, but the retail markets seem also to be going towards slightly better times.</p>
          <p>In the other segments which is mainly the shipyards, we've announced that we will stop our shipbuilding activities at Lind&#xF8; when we deliver the ships that are presently under construction in 2012. The Project One, we've closed. We've identified savings in excess of USD 1 billion, as we announced. And these are, of course, parts of the -- you can say the underlying business improvement that we've seen in the first half, and we will continue to make sure that the planned deliveries for the second half are also coming in addition to looking for new opportunities to cut cost. Just to give you a flavor of what kind of costs these are, it's -- this would be like cutting travel cost. It would be education expenses. It will be termination of office premises and moving to lower cost addresses. It will be taking a close look at reducing IT expenditures, reducing the number of projects we undertake and so on. So quite a strong effort has been made, and it's been well spread out through the Group. People have backed it up with a lot of enthusiasm, so we're very pleased with the effect across all the businesses.</p>
          <p>Coming to the financial information and cash flow, the operational cash flow was down 42% compared to the first half of 2008. It is lower cash flow from the Container and the Oil and Gas activities. The cash flow from Tankers, offshore, and so on, are stable, which also, of course, is reflecting the fact that part of the deterioration in the result in this area is because of impairments and more depreciations, which will not have a direct effect on the cash flow. We do see a positive effect from the working capital improvement. This is -- there's some real improvement, but it is mainly reflecting lower activities. When turnover drops, outstanding debtors, and oil and tanks, and so on, of course should drop and has dropped in line with that.</p>
          <p>The investment cash flow has continued at a very high level. We did put the brakes on around summer last time, or last year. But of course, due to the long delivery time, we just have to accept that it was a high investment level we came off of. It's Qatar production development. It's rigs, and it's vessel in the offshore development, or in segments. It's the acquisition of Brostr&#xF6;m and delivery of the containers. There's also a new building program still going on at Maersk Line, but actually the deliveries this year have been quite modest.</p>
          <p>Looking into the future, we are guiding that the investment levels for 2009 will be below 2008, and that means that we will see a tailing off of investments in the second half of 2009 and going into 2010.</p>
          <p>And then I'll suggest we go to the next page and talk about Container Shipping and related activities. The key message here is really that actually now volumes are starting to stabilize. Where we see volumes being down in the first half of 7%, the second quarter, in our case, was just down 3%. And that is reflecting that the global economy is starting to pick up a little bit.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the rates are very much down in the first half. It's 30% down, and even the second quarter has been worse than the first quarter. We assumed, when we started the second &#x2013; at the start of the second quarter that April would be the worst month, but actually, rates continued down.</p>
          <p>And only in the latter part of July and in August, we have seen increases coming through which means that when we look at the full year, we expect on average the rates in second half to be more or less in line with the first half, in spite of higher bunker prices. But it's basically reflected that the turnaround came later and from a lower level than we had hoped.</p>
          <p>Continued focus on cost savings; reduction of 1,500 positions; efforts that will continue. Unit cost, if we exclude the fuel price, or the fuel cost, where we've been helped by both consumption and price, but excluding that, we have unit cost down 5% in Maersk Line and Safmarine, and there's still more to do in this.</p>
          <p>We have only 2% of the fleet taken out of service. We've scrapped, or are planning to scrap, another 2%. So we are, in terms of the global size of the fleet, we're relatively well-positioned and as we've talked about the previous times, we also have a very reasonable order book compared to the average in the industry.</p>
          <p>Going to the next page; talking about APM Terminals, here we've given you a breakdown also on quarters. APM Terminals, of course, has been hit by the crisis, both in terms of volumes, with a decline of 8%. It's better than the market average, but it's still a decline, and of course, much less positive development than we've seen in previous years. There's also been pressure on rates and, therefore, in APM Terminals, there's been a very strong focus on getting costs down, canceling or postponing investments as much as possible, and we've also exited a couple of minor existing terminal arrangements. But the situation, overall, in APM Terminals is good, excluding sales gains. The result for the first half is in line with last year and the second quarter was actually better than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>The relations to customers are good. We're seeing the non-Maersk Line business growing. We'll continue to work on that, but we're, of course, also grateful to have a strong supportive customer doing a big part of our business.</p>
          <p>Going to the next slide, Tankers, Offshore, and other Shipping, here, what is positive in the oil business being reasonable level of oil prices now. Unfortunately, it's not a result of demand, but a result of quota cuts and reduced output, and that means, of course, that our oil tanker business has been affected. There's simply less to sail with and, therefore, rates are going down quite significantly.</p>
          <p>Also, Svitzer is affected by this. There are fewer oil tankers, oil and G ships, or just normal freight to be pulled around by our tugboats there.</p>
          <p>The offshore activities are protected for 2009, and actually also into the coming years, by a relatively high coverage. In addition to that, of course, as long as the oil prices are high, exploration efforts can be expected to be on a reasonable level. So actually the supply ships and the drilling business is sitting in quite a nice corner of the global economy at the moment.</p>
          <p>At Tankers, the integration of Brostr&#xF6;m is progressing as planned, basically, with a few minor things to do, closed. In this connection, we have done some impairments, but it's &#x2013; the Brostr&#xF6;m takeover, apart from timing that can be discussed, has been a good success.</p>
          <p>We've taken delivery of a number of ships, and most of these ships are being put to very good use. In the oil segment, somewhat delayed has been the case, but now coming more or less according to plan.</p>
          <p>Looking at the quarterly result here, there's less of an upswing to be seen, but positive results after tax and selected items. Not significantly below the levels we had last year, which were impacted by sales gains, as well. So this business segment is doing relatively well, and the negative part of it is really the tanker rates.</p>
          <p>So going to the next page, the Oil and Gas activities, here, of course, in the first half, the big issue has been the very low oil price being less than half of what it was at the same period last year. We're coming back now, and that, of course, makes us a little bit more optimistic for the future. But the negative effect we will have in the second half is that we will see a smaller share of oil production, simply following the fact that when oil prices goes up, we'll get less production share in Qatar, and the mature fields in the North Sea are dropping. And even if we work hard, that will be the trend going forward, as well. The Qatar Field Development is approximately 80% completed, and we will, for all major factors, be through at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>We have, as we've previously published, made oil and gas discoveries in the U.S., in the U.K. and Angola. It will take quite significant time to get them assessed, but we hope, of course, that some of them will turn into interesting oil production opportunities.</p>
          <p>So going to the next page, which are other segments, here we start with retail, and the retail business is, of course, impacted by the reluctance of the consumers to spend. The effect in the last half of last year and also beginning of this year has been, of course, mainly an impact on the full assortment supermarkets and hypermarkets where categories, non-food categories, have been strongly impacted.</p>
          <p>We see a slight change in that trend. At least, it's been less pronounced in the latter part of the second quarter. So actually, F&#xF8;tex and Bilka are now also seeing, hopefully, some kind of bottom. The shipyards and the interest in Danske Bank is contributing with a negative result in the first half of 2009. This is mainly &#x2013; or this is the shipyard result. Danske Bank, of course, is a separate issue. It's not up to me to comment on that here, but the banking sector in general seems to be in the &#x2013; developing towards a more positive situation, even if Danske Bank had a negative performance in the second quarter due to write-downs.</p>
          <p>Coming to the funding situation on the next slide, we've added this slide on numerous requests, so build it out a little bit. And the situation as we have now in terms of outstanding commitments going into the coming years is USD 9 billion and where we have &#x2013; where we're committed to invest, USD 6 billion are related to new building programs for ships and rigs, quite a lot of Korean container ships in this equation. And then we have commitments for approximately USD 3 billion in Terminals and Oil and Gas activities.</p>
          <p>The debt profile is, we feel, quite healthy. We have an average maturity of our loan facilities which is above five years. We have no covenants, and we view our liquidity situation, which are the bank balances and securities and undrawn facilities, as satisfactory for our ongoing business and financing program we have. We have no major financing due before the mid of 2012. And you can say that the new building program is almost fully financed, so &#x2013; and the rest of the loan facilities will cover whatever shortfall there may be.</p>
          <p>So we feel we've &#x2013; or this documentation, hopefully, will help the people interested in analyzing our funding position, and having said that, we are of course aware that our situation is a bit unusual. We are basing ourselves mainly on ship financing and export credit in addition to traditional bank facilities. Looking into the long-term, we don't know how the financial crisis will impact the banking facilities and the availability for the period of our long-term refinancing needs, so we're, of course, looking at alternatives, but there's no issue short term.</p>
          <p>Looking at the outlook for 2009, we are basically expecting a result in line with the first half. We are of the opinion that the global world economy is moving into a better situation. We're expecting growth going forward and the worst to be behind us. Given the delivery situation, in particular in Container Shipping, but also to a certain extent in Tankers, it's likely that the shipping cycle will be somewhat slower in improving, but we're still quite optimistic that the things we're doing into the long-term are the right things.</p>
          <p>So we feel relatively optimistic for the group's perspective for the long-term, but for the second half this year, given the fact that tanker rates are low, historic low, and given the fact that container rates bottomed out later than expected, and the rate increases, even though they're sticking, are not sufficient to bring rates significantly above the levels in the first quarter &#x2013; or first half, we forecast a result on same level as last year. Of course, it's still very uncertain, but looking back to the last couple of quarters, you can say that the level of uncertainty is definitely less than we had at earlier times this year.</p>
          <p>And that basically concludes the presentation, and we'll be happy to take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> While we're waiting for the first question, let me remind you that the PowerPoint presentation is available for download on maersk.com. Henrik Lund from Carnegie is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for the new information given on ROIC, and more transparency on even the minor activities. I have four questions. I would like to start out with the significant drop in rates that we have seen from Maersk Line. Do you see this as a function of the decentralization, the decentralized decision-making in Maersk Line? Are the front line people in the decentralized organization, have they simply been too nice towards the clients and given away too big a discounts too quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, once you change decision-making procedures, there is, of course, always a risk that things can go wrong, and we'll monitor that very careful. But it's not our feeling that we've priced out of range with competition; quite to the contrary.</p>
          <p>I think the whole industry has reacted to this crisis in a rather immature way, and we have taken the decision to follow the rate cuts, making sure that we did not lose market share. But I think the, I'm not saying that mistakes have not been made, because it's a huge Company, and many quotes are made each day. But we are, of course, working, now we have decentralized, we're working to get the mistakes eliminated, and so far we're pleased with the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question number two is regarding your guidance. You are saying that the second half, being equally as bad as first half, is based on flat rates. Isn't that a bit conservative? And I would also like to know what kind of oil price assumptions you are using. I can see that it's expected to be higher, but can you indicate a level in terms of dollars per barrels, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The oil price levels that we are forecasting is basically the forward curve as it was a week or so ago. So we're talking slightly below the rates that we have at present.</p>
          <p>In terms of bunker prices, we do expect them to be also more or less at the rates -- at the levels that we see today, which is above the levels we saw in the first half. Coming back to rates, of course, it can seem a bit conservative because we say, what we're saying is that we see the recent rate increases we've announced are actually sticking.</p>
          <p>Our competitors are following, in some cases leading, and the customers accept those rate increases. But when we look at the trend throughout the year, actually, the rates bottomed out in May, June. And that means that we are starting now to increase from a very low level, and even the so-far announced increases are not sufficient to bring up the average to the same level as in the first half.</p>
          <p>So hopefully, we'll get better rates and more rate increases during the year, but there's still quite a bit of way to go. So I wouldn't say that we are overly pessimistic on this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then question number three is regarding the corporate bonds that you are indicating could be the future. I would like to hear is that a function of Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland and all the other international shipping banks reducing their facilities, or is it a measure to lower your interest costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have, I think, very competitive interest costs, and we have really no problems at present to get the facilities we need from banks. So we can't complain about the banking support we're getting at all.</p>
          <p>What we're saying here is simply that when we look at the future, the banks have gone through a major crisis, and we see strong growth in the bond markets at the moment. This is, of course, a development we're following, and we are considering whether it makes sense for us to broaden our financial base to make sure that in the future we can tap into more sources. So that's basically what we're trying to say. It's also an answer to many questions we received in the last visits we made to investors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the final question is when are you going to announce your new CFO?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. One question, particularly on the cost savings. So the plan is about, has delivered so far about one billion to 1.5 billion of savings.  Maybe it's a bit difficult to give us a feeling for it, but I hope you'll try anyway. Could you tell us how much of that is structural? You refer to it somewhat in your statements by saying that this puts the Company in better shape going forward. But how much of it is structural, and how much of it is really one-off, and if volumes come back, you will have to get these costs back in, such as travel, et cetera?</p>

          <p>It's a very good question, and we just gave an overview on the Company level just because it's hard to analyze.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we do make quite a lot of structural changes. If you look at Maersk Line eliminating 6,000 positions over the last 18 months, it's of course structural, and these costs will not come back; quite to the contrary.</p>
          <p>Also moving to less expensive office addresses, these are things that will change the costs behavior going forward. Travel costs and so on, I personally believe that we can make them stick but, of course, there is a tendency when business pick up that you like to see more customers, and so on, but we probably had high level of spending in the past, and we'll work on that.</p>
          <p>We do believe that there are more opportunities going forward, and we've also -- even if the rest of the businesses are doing relatively well, we're still looking at cost-saving opportunities across the Group. We've also reduced the number of head count in our corporate functions, and we'll continue to try to drive a lot of cost consciousness throughout the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if we want to look three years forward or maybe four years forward, and we're thinking about peak margins in Container Shipping, if rates would return to normal, obviously a big if, but let's assume that, then historic peak margins are definitely achievable again given that your cost base is significantly better, for instance, in Container Shipping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at the relative performance of Maersk Line, a couple of years ago, we were definitely significantly below the market. We estimated, at the time, approximately $200 per container on EBIT level. The last couple of quarters, or even three, we've found ourselves to be better than the market. It's hard to say exactly, because there can be many one-offs in quarters and so on, but we're talking to a tune of probably $100 per container.</p>
          <p>So that's a huge swing in relative performance. So that makes us quite confident when we say that when the markets return to normal, and when people start making money in the Container business, we will be among those making money. And that's -- we have to be there, and we feel quite confident that we're moving in that direction.</p>

          <p>Lars Heindorff from ABG is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen; also a couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, getting back to the rates, can you tell us what the second quarter rates was compared to the first quarter rate? You said they were down still compared to the first quarter. Could you quantify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if on the slide if you look at the global picture, we were 30% down on the first half and the last &#x2013; and the second quarter it was down 34% as far, I'll just check just to make sure. It's on the two top &#x2013; on the second bullet point...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But as compared to the first quarter 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then it was down a little bit further, so we saw it drop. I can't give you &#x2013; you can actually see it on the bottom if you look.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll look at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about &#x2013; probably May, May was about 8% below you can say the situation in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly also related to the rates, container rates are going up these days and so is the bunker costs, but what is &#x2013; has anything happened with your ability to pass on those higher bunker costs to the customers right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were quite successful in 2008 at introducing BAF and got broad acceptance of it, ten when the crisis hit most of our competitors went on and said, well, no need to adjust for bunker and so on, so it became a very blurred picture. And I think today it's really &#x2013; it's more reliable to look at the total rate, including the bunker adjustment factors because it more &#x2013; it reflects more the reality of the market.</p>
          <p>We feel at the moment that the customers and, in particular, the competitors are interested in increasing or willing respective interest in passing on, on getting rate increases and we think that will continue for quite a while because the truth is that the industry at the moment is now at totally unsustainable levels. And most container lines are sailing with significant negative cash flows, probably even before paying for new orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And thirdly regarding your utilization in the container business, if you adjust for the lay-offs, I don't know if you can give us an indication of utilization in the second quarter versus the first quarter 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually if you take the second quarter, volumes were down approximately 3% compared to last year and our capacity was down a little more than that. So actually, the capacity utilization in the industry at this point in time doesn't seem to be too bad. Of course we're seeing new container ships coming in, especially large container ships and that means that some of our competitors may be fighting lower utilization rates, but our utilization rates are actually not bad, partly coming from the fact that we see growth in the Asia west to east of 17%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly regarding the oil production and the second quarter oil production was down by roughly I think it was five million barrels compared to the first quarter. Could you give us an indication about sort of what you expect for the second half and particularly in the light of what you write in the report here about the discussions in Qatar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're writing in the report that we expect total &#x2013; our share of production for the year to be in line with last year and since we're up in the first half that means that we will decline our share in the second half. It's part an effect of the decline in the mature fields we have in the North Sea, but also an effect of the conversion factor, once prices go up in the &#x2013; oil prices go up, we will get less oil in Qatar because it's a partly, of course, recovery model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan Togo from Handelsbanken is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned earlier that you saw some things in the Q2 developing a bit better, so that the results in the Q2 actually surprised slightly on the positive side from what you saw at the end of Q1. Could you elaborate a bit on what it was in particular that you saw developing slightly better than expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on a very broad level I would say that most of our businesses, if we discount the container business which where the rate situation really came out worse than we expected and the oil tanker business where also rates have been hit record low after a relatively good first quarter, actually the rest of our businesses are performing quite well. And it's, of course, part of the cost drives we're doing.</p>
          <p>But I have to say that they have adjusted very quickly to difficult market conditions and in some cases, even just within one quarter, have been able to turn into profit improvements. Just an example which was shown earlier, APM Terminals with a very, very quick swing around driven by cost and getting terminals up and running to capacity and so on, I think they've done a fantastic job. So there are trends around in the company which we are very encouraged by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then on the cost saving side, you mentioned you've taken out one  to USD 1.5 billion on cost side, I assume that is first half '09 compared to first half '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you quantify that on the container side how much of that has been done on container and how much cost can you take out of the container business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit hard to say exactly because we tried &#x2013; in order to not get down to on, you can say, untrustworthy details, we've taken really a top level approach to this in making a very broad analysis. But coming back to what I told you earlier about the relative improvement over two years in Maersk Line of 1.5 to two billion, I think it's fair to say that probably, or a major part of this improvement does come from Maersk Line.</p>
          <p>But it really comes from around the Group from being more careful with investments in the oil industry, getting rig rates down and so on, cutting cost in APM Terminals, so it is a broad effort throughout the Group. But, of course, the Maersk Line restructuring, which started already before the crisis struck, has an advantage and is rolling, so that's the major part of the saving, without a doubt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the largest effect of these projects will be in '09 and a small effect in '10, is that how we should look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of reducing the level, we will still have an impact going into 2010. It's hard to say what, I mean some things have been postponed and we'll, of course, have to take some of these postponed things back into consideration, but the aim is, of course, to push the cost level down on a permanent basis and that should help us equally much in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally on container rates, down 34% here in Q2, in my eyes that is somewhat worse actually than what we're seeing in the market, but could you elaborate a bit where you see the market has &#x2013; the market development in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I agree the over the headline figure for us is worse than the market. There are two effects playing into that, one is that the rates in Asia to Europe has gone down more than the global average partly because this is where the big ships will mainly be employed and it's where we are strongest also, so it affects us quite a bit.</p>
          <p>On top of that comes that we've seen a very good increase in the west to east volume utilization and these are, of course, since it's a back haul, it's lower rates, it's wastepaper and scrap metal and other things that can travel slowly and with the best offer, so it's not well-paying cargo. So these are the, you can say, the reason why our headline figure is below the market. In general we feel that we price in line with or maybe even in some cases slightly better than the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, a couple of questions, firstly regarding the tax rate in oil and gas at 79% in the second quarter. Is there anything special affecting the tax rate or is this the run rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there isn't. We don't see anything special, so it's a realistic run rate going forward, but it will, of course, depend a little bit on country mix and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding write-downs in the shipyard, you had $36 million in the second quarter, are we going to see further write-downs in Q3 regarding the closure of Lind&#xF8;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have &#x2013; I can't say no, but it should not be figures that will affect the total Group to any significant extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The impairment level in the Tankers division, you've made some hint in the second quarter, are the current levels based on what you see on forward rates, for example, in the tanker market or should we expect a further drop in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that at the moment the whole shipping industry is really struggling with the impairment issue. We are not too worried because it's not a cash &#x2013; it doesn't have any cash effect, so it's just really a bookkeeping exercise, but what we've done in Maersk in the Tankers business is really going in and looking at market values and expected future earnings and if they were below our book values we've written down the individual ship. It may be that we have other ships or we surely have other ships that are significantly, in our books, significantly below the market value, so in a way it's a kind of theoretical exercise, but we do it in accordance with our bookkeeping principles, but it's not something that really disturbs anybody's sleep here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question regarding Maersk Line, you've been very close to breakeven level on the EBITDA in Q1 and Q2, is that what you think that you'll be able to deliver in Q3 and Q4 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we're not guiding on individual businesses and I really don't have a comment to this. We do believe that it will be difficult in the Container business in the second half, but we'll, of course, work as hard as we can to improve the situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, a couple of questions on the Oil division. We saw that Qatar production dropped from the first quarter to the second quarter and you mentioned that the CapEx program is pretty much completed for 2009. When we look at this in a historical context that would assume that we move from the profitable phase to the less profitable phase, is that a fair conclusion to draw on the basis of this or do we still expect a higher profit contribution from Qatar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not guiding on 2010, but it is a cost and investment recovery model, so, of course, as investments taper off profits will fall as well over a certain period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then the other question on the Oil division, return on invested capital dropped year-over-year from 65% to 22%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I didn't get that, could you repeat it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, return on invested capital dropped from 65% last year to 22% this first half year, what's the explanation for that and is this a new level that we're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Oil division again, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Oil division, okay. I can't give you any forecast on that, but we do expect oil production to fall over the coming years and that will, of course, put you can say, downward pressure on the returns. At the same time, we're also depreciating and in the present fields we'll invest less, but I can't give you any real figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then if you look at the Group level, return on invested capital was at around 0% for the first six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, did you talk about exploration cost or return on investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, return on invested capital. Okay, so we'll go back to the question, you said, in your statement you say that return on invested capital in the first half year in the Oil division was 22% compared to 65% last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's, of course, because the prices of oil have dropped enormously, so the returns will depend on what price levels we see going forward. I think these are return patterns that you will, I mean, our returns last year were probably above any benchmark in the industry almost, but if you look at the global oil players or even regional players, they have seen significant declines in profitability in the first half this year, probably a little higher than the declines we've seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Another question on return on invested capital on Group level, in the first six months you state that you have around 0% in return. When do you think it's realistic to assume a breakeven, let's say, around eight, 10% on return on invested capital and can you come back to the historical levels seen or is there something structural changing in the business that does not indicate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it really goes into we have made loss this year and that means our return on invested capital is not very encouraging. We hope, of course, to come back in a profitable situation in the future, but &#x2013; and I wouldn't say that there's a trend in this. We expect to have &#x2013; to be able to deliver above the weighted average cost of capital on a consistent level. That's our job, but we're not giving any guidance on long-term returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the final question on Container, you've been out in the media stating that we should expect a depressed market for the next couple of years because of supply demand balance and also highlighted that '10 could be a challenging year. With the expectations you now have for higher rates in the second half, does this change that statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I made the statement this morning and the rate assumptions are the same, so I wouldn't say it's changing. We do expect the supply demand balance to be difficult going forward. We are seeing the rate increases that we put in the market sticking, but it's not bringing the container industry as a whole anywhere near an acceptable return, not even back in direction of profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, a question concerning the Container Maersk Line, when you have been through all these rationalizations have there been any change to the ratio between variable and fixed cost? It seems like for the ratio you mentioned for sensitivity that you have got more flexible cost into your equation now than previously, is that correct?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you a real good answer on that, but we are, of course, trying to cut our overhead expenses as much as we can. We'll also work towards getting more flexibility on time charters and so on in the future, but the situation as we see it in near term, near future is that we will get some ships delivered and we will give some time charters back and I would say that doesn't, unfortunately, increase the variable part of the costs. But long-term this is, of course, something that we will try to work on, but we're just, we'll say, locked into investment programs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Concerning Qatar, could you give the &#x2013; what is the remaining outstanding cost for your investment that you need to get paid back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the total project is approximately USD 6 billion and it's about 80% complete, so we're talking about a billion plus remaining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that will be finished in the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about what we need to invest, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and you'll get back &#x2013; you will be paid back as you invest, won't you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well not immediately, no, no. We get &#x2013; we invest and then we get a return on that investment until we've paid, you can say, are fully paid back with a return, so it takes place over some years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For your guidance for the second half are there any one-offs in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not counting on any ship divestments or anything of any significance, so it'll be more or less business as usual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was more thinking about write-downs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not planning any write-downs at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that was the last question, so I'd like to close the conference. Thank you for listening in and thank you for a lot of good questions.</p>
          <p>We are working very hard to improve the results and prepare ourselves for the future and encouraged actually by the last quarter, seeing that the programs we're implementing are actually giving results. So considering that we are in the worst crisis we've seen for quite a while, we're feeling good and ready to battle on and hopefully deliver good results going forward.</p>
          <p>So thank you. Have a good day and thanks for listening in.</p>
