          <p>Good day, and welcome to the U.S. Analysts and Investors Conference Call for Diageo. This conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today's host, Mr. Paul Walsh. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. What I'd like to do is give a very brief overview of our results, as many of you will have participated in the webcast this morning, and then Nick and I will take your questions.</p>
          <p>It has been a challenging six months with economic trends little improved over the second half of fiscal '09. And, as we've communicated before, we did have a tough comparable topline growth in Q1 last year of 6%.</p>
          <p>We finished the half slightly stronger than anticipated with organic net sales up 2% in quarter two, despite being down 6% in Q1. Therefore, organic net sales were down 2% in the half and organic operating profit was down 3% in the half. However, EPS pre-exceptionals was up 5% due to favorable currency movements.</p>
          <p>We're particularly pleased with the free cash flow performance. This has been strong, driven by a number of changes to our working capital management, and we generated an increase of &#xA3;517 million to almost &#xA3;1 billion pre-restructuring charges. We have confidence in the business and we are, again, increasing the interim dividend by 5%.</p>
          <p>I will stop there and open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We now take our first question from Mr. John McMillin of Lord Abbett. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day everyone. Paul, there's a lot of skepticism in terms of you doing your full-year numbers. I just saw you on TV, and certainly, they were skeptical; the market seems skeptical. Can you just kind of go into what type of topline trend you need to achieve this improved second half EBIT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think &#x2013; go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also some &#x2013; what &#x2013; when you say one-offs last year, what specifically are you relating to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me ask Nick to cover the one-off costs. But basically, we are seeking a continuation of the topline trend we saw in the first quarter. That trend line, coupled with the fact that we will not have the same level of one-off costs in the second half, will allow us to deliver on the guidance that we've offered. It's really as straightforward as that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's basically &#x2013; sorry, the organic sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the second quarter we were up 2%. That is the trend line we are expecting in Q3 and Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me add to that. A couple of things &#x2013; that is the fundamental piece of this. We will need some topline growth, as Paul has described. We will also, and we believe we can achieve, some modest expansion of our gross margin from where we are. Our gross margin in the first half, as you'll have seen from the release, did actually deteriorate. A number of factors in that, including some market mix as well as some down-trading within the business. And we are believing and seeing that we will get some of that gross margin back &#x2013; may be not all of it, but we will get some of that back. And of course, any movement in gross margin is very powerful as it drops down through the P&amp;L to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>And then on top of that, as Paul has said there are some what we call non-recurring costs in the first half that we will not be facing in the second half. So, for instance, you know, because we disclosed it, I think, that we have a number of investigations going on right now in places like Korea, and the sheer amount of effort required to delve into those and to answer some questions that the SEC is asking of us right now, is actually adding costs in terms of accounting and legal fees in our first half. They will not appear as incremental costs, if you like, in our second half.</p>
          <p>And then the &#x2013; I think the third factor that should give you some comfort is, if you think about what we have to achieve in the second half compared to the second half of last year, the bulk of our cost savings, which Paul talked about this morning, which will be about &#xA3;120 million by the time we get to the end of this fiscal year, didn't start until this year. So, comparing second half of last year, we weren't really getting much in terms of overhead savings. And by the end of this year, we'll be getting the full &#xA3;120 million.</p>
          <p>So that second half performance is going to look very strong profit-wise, partly because of what we are lapping in the previous year. So it's a combination of the top line growth Paul talked about. The fact that some of these nonrecurring one-off costs that we saw in the first half aren't going to appear; and thirdly, what we're lapping from the prior year in many ways is just a lot easier, not least of all the &#xA3;120 million of cost savings that we're going to be getting running rate by the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take a next question from Thomas Russo of Gardner, Russo &amp; Company. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi Paul, I hope you can hear me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can. Good morning</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Good. A couple of quick questions. The first on the working capital release. To what extent, do you find that the trade still needs to have vendor financing as they continue to suffer with their own credit lines? Are you too tight on the trade with your working capital demands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we have not put any vendor financing. In fact, if you look at the cash flow both last year and this year, our receivables showed a marked improvement. And we think it is just judicious to operate on very keen terms. We haven't tightened our terms, but we are certainly driving our customers to pay on terms. So I'm feeling very good that we have managed our cash in this manner. We have not extended our receivables. And in the face of some companies going into some bankruptcies or whatever, we've managed our way through it pretty well. And I intend that that will remain the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Anecdotes from either the India or Chinese market, if you could? Strengthen your brand and anything in particular with your local relationships in these markets that we should note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me talk about Asia generally. Asia, sort of the brakes went on there pretty fast, but equally with the fiscal stimulus package going in, particularly in China, the brakes have come off and we are definitely seeing growth in that market. India, we did have some over shipments in the first half of the previous fiscal year.</p>
          <p>We are lapping those in these numbers. They were unwound in the second half of last fiscal year, so to the earlier question and Nick's point, it means in India, we are lapping a lot easier numbers in the next six months. That aside, highlights for me is the general economic improvements in Asia, the fact that in Indonesia and Malaysia, we've seen 21% growth on the Guinness brand, stunning performance. In fact, our beer performance overall is up 5%, which I think stacks up pretty well, in fact a very well on a global basis.</p>
          <p>We've seen a return to growth in Australia and we now have our own operations on the ground in Vietnam. So, I'm encouraged by our performance in Asia. As I said, we did have some issues where we overstocked in the first half of the previous fiscal. We've now got beyond those numbers for the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then lastly, the strength that you've got in your position in Sub-Saharan Africa is remarkable. I'm wondering what kind of weight you're putting into that market, either through investment and distribution, marketing or manufacturing &#x2013; your plan broadly across Africa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm down in South Africa in a couple of weeks opening a new brewery in Johannesburg. We've already signed an agreement to move into Angola. We have up-weighted our spend selectively in certain African markets. We are very committed to that country. We see very good returns going forward and we have very, very strong marketing positions. And by the very nature, the M&amp;A opportunities in that region will be limited, but you should expect us to move with prudence but with alacrity, when we see such opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm so sorry, Paul, but if no one else is going to ask, I've got your time. Thank you. Paul, talk a brief moment about Black Label and the announced launch of an extra distilled or special distilled Black Label.</p>
          <p>I'm just curious what you think about the health of the brand and how expandable the Black Label is, up and down need-states versus using other Johnnie Walker Brands to meet those need-states. It seems like Black Label may be expanding into territories once owned by other Johnny Walker colors.</p>

            <mark type="Inaudible" /> bottles. It is unedged. It is priced at a premium. It is a very special blend and we think it will have a role. But we reckon it will be quite small versus the parent, which is Johnnie Walker Black Label. The other variant that has been introduced in Asia, particularly in global travel, is The John Walker, which is a blend of a very rare whiskeys, this sells at $3,000 a bottle. And I heard the other day that we've had to start air freighting some more products into that market, because it's already sold through &#x2013; which just shows that for these markets, we're seeing confidence return. There is still a very strong role for ultra-premium products.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now I take a question Jonathan White of Evergreen. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I just have a question about price mix. I noticed this first half &#x2013; and I apologize, I haven't fully gone through the transcript from the earlier call from the U.K., but there wasn't any price mix on an organic basis this half. And I was just wondering if you could talk about what the drivers were there? And then over the long-term, how do you see that moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are two dynamics at play. The first dynamic, particularly in developed markets, is a shift from the on-premise to the off-premise. You know when people don't have the &#x2013; even if they have the money in their pocket, if they don't have the confidence, they tend to conserve that money and stay in. That means we lose out on the opportunity to up-trade consumers in the on-premise occasion.</p>
          <p>It's hard to replace that consumption occasion through the off-trade channel. Mainly, because if you go out in London and you want a Johnnie Walker Blue Label, it's, say, &#xA3;15. If you want to enjoy that in your home, even if you buy a half-bottle, it's probably &#xA3;80. So there's a sticker shock element there. That means that our Ultra Premium and Super Premium brands have performed less well.</p>
          <p>The brands that have performed very well are our Premium Spirits brands that are in the sweet spot &#x2013; brands like Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, and so on. But because we've lost that top spin that is why you are not seeing the mix improvement coming through as you have seen in the past. Also, you've had a situation whereby, as I said earlier, our beer business has done very, very well. And clearly, there is some mix dilution as a consequence of overperformance from beer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And just also, just longer-term, I don't know in your own model how you see mix as well as price having an impact on the top line, but that would be helpful as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; it's particularly interesting in the U.S. market. When we were faced with some of these economic conditions, many people said that beer would win out over spirits. What's very interesting and very encouraging is that spirits are now getting taken into the home occasion more, and in fact, spirits performance through the up-trade channel is actually outperforming beer. We are very gratified by that. And it shows you that we have actually earned these consumers' respect and they stay with the brand. Maybe they don't purchase the higher-end marks; maybe they don't purchase with the same frequency; but they remain very loyal to these brands.</p>
          <p>Therefore, our expectation is that when you get consumer confidence back, you will see more buoyancy in the higher-end offerings. Now we've started to see some improvement in GDP numbers but understandably, there is a lag between GDP growth and raw consumer confidence. We've yet to see real improvement on the confidence stags. Until we see that, I don't think we will get a kind of return to the previous trends that we enjoyed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did you guys &#x2013; just lastly, did you guys take any pricing across the portfolio in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No &#x2013; minimal. In certain markets that were either high inflation or where we saw devaluation, we would have done; but other than that, no, and I don't anticipate any kind of raw pricing in the balance of this fiscal year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will now take a follow-up question from Thomas Russo of Gardner, Russo &amp; Gardner. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Paul. Any particularly troubling spots in terms of excise tax developments for spirits or beer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, there are some encouraging news. If you look in the U.S., we did not get a federal excise tax as part of the recent budget. In Ireland, you have seen a 20% reduction in excise taxes. Unfortunately, in the UK, they have come out and said that they will increase excise tax by RPI plus 2%, which given that RPI is pretty low, basically means by 2% &#x2013; not ideal, but very manageable.</p>
          <p>So I'm not seeing any huge threats. And I think the reason for this is that, one, it's very unpopular at a time when politicians need some popularity. Secondly, I think there's concern that it may not yield sort of the revenue generation that they would like. And thirdly, if it had negative consequences on the whole hospitality industry, those are low-value jobs, but they would do nothing for the unemployment statistics. So I'm not taking anything for granted. We've got to be on our game in this area. But I'm not seeing a huge threat in this regard.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Kevin Dreyer of Gabelli &amp; Company. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I just had two questions. First, in the U.S., could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? How promotional your competitors are being versus how you are being? And also, if you could talk a little bit about potential acquisitions? Obviously, Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy is one that's bandied about a bit. Maybe you could relay your current thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the U.S., there is no question that the level of competitive intensity has stepped up. But as best we can determine, it's probably notched up around the promotional spend level by between one and two points of sale &#x2013; one to 2%. And we actually believe that we're probably at the bottom of that cycle. We have leading brands, and therefore, you have customers, liquor store owners whatever. It's usually the leading brands they want to promote. And our view is that we want to continue to convey excitement around such brands.</p>
          <p>And therefore, the promotional intensity has increased. I think it's very manageable. Our philosophy is that we want to maintain kind of bottle sale momentum. We need to remain vibrant with our consumers and our customers. And, as I said earlier, when confidence starts to return, we will go back to the trading-up activities that you saw in the &#x2013; in previous periods. So, I think we've demonstrated great agility and I would do it all over again. It's the function of the environment that we're in.</p>
          <p>Regarding M&amp;A activity, we have said that if ever the 66% of Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy is available, we would be interested. It would have to be at the right price. And really, the ball is in the court of LVMH, if they ever wish to sell. I suspect that that is not the case. We have announced recently a modest transaction in Africa to an earlier point &#x2013; where we see opportunity for inorganic expansion in the developing markets, we will take that opportunity. It's relatively modest in the overall context of our cash flow, but I think those are probably the sort of transactions that you would &#x2013; should expect to see more of, rather than any mega-plays at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>As we have no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Paul Walsh. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, thanks for joining us. I believe that in the face of the economic situation that we have seen, these are a very resilient set of numbers. It was a tale of two quarters &#x2013; 6% down in the first quarter but 2% up in sales terms, in the second quarter. It's also a tale of kind of a polarized world. We are seeing very good growth momentum in Asia, Latin America and Africa. We expect that to continue.</p>
          <p>However, in Europe and the U.S. it's pretty flat, and we do not expect that to change in the short-term and our guidance does not rely on it changing. I am very pleased with the way the organization has responded to our call for cash management. This is an outstanding performance on cash. Not all of it can be repeated. But I believe in the current environment, cash is always important, but it's particularly important in the current set of circumstances. And therefore, as I said, I think this is a resilient set of numbers. All the consumer testing that we have done, our equities are strong, and I remain confident that when we see returning consumer confidence, we will see a return to premiumization as well.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your support, and I'll be seeing some of you over the next couple of weeks. Thank you.</p>
