          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Conference Call of E.ON AG. This call is been recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in a listen only mode. After the presentation, there will an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'll now hand over to Sascha Bibert. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the first quarter 2010 results of E.ON Group. We will follow our usual procedure by, first, the presentations then Q&amp;A. This is, however, still a special event today as it is the first regular call of our new CEO, Johannes Teyssen, who alongside our CFO, Marcus Schenck, will run you through the E.ON story. Having said that, I will give the floor to Johannes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everybody and welcome to my first conference call as CEO of E.ON. If you turn for our first, my first chart, it obviously a quite strong start into the year 2010. Adjusted EBITDA is up 17% to 4.7 billion, adjusted EBIT, as already announced to the market, reached 3.7 billion, adjusted net income has grown by also 16% to 2.1 billion and also cash from operation is up 8%.</p>
          <p>Several developments led to this unusually strong quarter. A quite strong performance of UK retail, some significant contributions from our optimization and trading business, Pan-European Gas held up very well supported by the cold winter in the first couple of months here in Central Europe, various positive effects in our German regulated business helped us and further growth of new markets, especially our renewable business driven by increased capacity, as well as better margins in Russia.</p>
          <p>As we expected some of the positive developments of the first quarter to reverse during the remainder of 2010, we keep our full-year outlook unchanged. Adjusted EBIT is expected to increase by 0 to 3%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in line with 2009. Marcus Schenck will go on to further details on those numbers.</p>
          <p>On the following slides, I will discuss some key developments within the power and gas markets, update you on major projects, which we completed, highlight the progress we have made in streamlining our organization and finally, give you a sense some of the areas that I want to focus on.</p>
          <p>Please turn to chart 2 of my presentation. In the Power business, we are starting to see a clear evidence of demand recovery across Europe. In our biggest German markets, demand was up by 1.4% in January and already by 5.1% year-on-year in February. Similar trends can be seen in other countries.</p>
          <p>Our consumption was up also roughly 5% in the first quarter in Nordic; a little shy of that, 4.7% in Spain. Demand in Italy and UK is, however, still weaker. Power demand in England only grew by 1% in Q1 and Italy only by 2%. Similarly, the sales volumes or retail position of the EON Group benefited from the cold weather, especially in the residential customer segment, as well as from a favorable base effect.</p>
          <p>Overall, we should not forget that real GDP, industrial output, and power demand are still well below pre-crisis levels. In Germany, for example, industrial output is still 20% below and power demand year-on-year &#x2013; year-to-date about 3% lower. Accordingly, this recovery remains fragile. While demand is improving, prices and spreads remain under pressure. Since the start of the year, power prices have generally been on a downward path, especially due to declining coal and gas prices. Most recently, robust demand for commodities from emerging markets triggered a general rise of commodity and energy prices. Forward dark and spark spreads on the other side remain at rather depressed levels.</p>
          <p>In this environment, our prudent forward-hedging strategy has put us into a favorable position. For 2010 and 2011, we already hedged outright power to the maximum possible for some time. As a result, we will achieve strong prices especially in Central Europe, &#x20AC;68 a megawatt hour in 2010 and &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour in 2011. Hedge ratios for spread generation are somewhat lower mainly because we've kept some open positions in gas to benefit from low spot gas prices.</p>
          <p>For 2012 and 2013, so the outer years, we have only hedged those outright power spread products at a rather normal pace and not at an expedited pace as in the past. 2012 forwards are now operating at just below &#x20AC;57 a megawatt hour, higher again that the 55 that we have locked in so far, but obviously those prices vary from day to day.</p>
          <p>We now turn to <mark type="inaudible" /> chart 3, there are also positive signs in the gas business but the challenges for our supply and sales business remain. Demand in gas has been very strong in the first quarter. Both in Germany and in the big 6 EU gas consuming countries. Gas demand was up by about 11%. Sales volumes of E.ON Ruhrgas in Germany showed a similar trend. They grew by 12% year-on-year. Even when adjusted for the abnormally low temperatures of the first months, we estimate that sales volumes would have been up by roughly 7%. Growth of gas volumes, sales volume for the Group as a whole was more moderate due to the sale of Kruger and the higher comparison base for residential consumption. As a result, negative margin effect within our supply and sales were offset by positive volume effects during the first quarter. Nevertheless, the situation in supply and sales remains tense. For the current gas year, which runs until end of September 2010, the recent successful renegotiations will help us to stabilize the supply and sales margins. But despite the recent rise of spot forwards, the spreads to oil index LTC prices has in fact further widened as all forwards have risen strongly as well. Therefore, further renegotiations with the suppliers and the producers will be required.</p>
          <p>Please now turn to chart 4. Let me now update you on the progress we have made on our previously announced initiatives, the improvement of our performance, the organic investments and the portfolio streamlining. Perform to Win, our flagship program to improve performance, is progressing well. We have delivered roughly 600 million of performance improvement in 2009. In this first quarter, we've already achieved a quarter of our 2010 Perform to Win target of 1 billion. In 2011, we then plan the full run rate of performance improvements of 1.5 billion per year.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010, we've also completed several organic investment projects. Two new big CCGT Irsching 5 in Bavaria and Emile Huchet in France have started commercial operations. In addition, Scandale in the south of Italy was officially inaugurated. Together these 3 plants have a capacity of 2,500 megawatts, our pro rata interest is 1700 megawatts. The overall environment for new plants remains challenging.</p>
          <p>We are convinced however that these CCGTs will demonstrate their flexibility and optionality in this current low gas price world. Take Irsching 5 and Emile Huchet as an example. On a full-year basis those run 3000 to 4000 hours. We are optimizing our gas sourcing, those could even be increased to 5 to 6000 hours per year. Furthermore, we have opened 2 important offshore wind parks, Robin Rigg is located on the West Coast of the UK and has a capacity of 180 megawatts. With Alpha Ventus, the first offshore wind park in Germany, we are gathering a lot of experience in deep offshore environments.</p>
          <p>We are, for example, testing different turbines in different types of foundations. Finally, the construction of Nord Stream started in March. The twin pipelines with a capacity of 55 bcm should be completed in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The total investment will amount to more than 7 billion, as the majority will be debt financed, our equity contribution should be well below 1 billion.</p>
          <p>Please now turn to chart 5. With the sale of E.ON US Midwest to PPL, we have made a major step forward in our portfolio streamlining initiative. That turns action enterprise value for U.S. alone amounts to $7.6 billion. In Euro and including the pension provision that will be transferred to PPL, the disposal proceeds will amount to slightly more than &#x20AC;6 billion.</p>
          <p>As a result, our debt ratio on a like-for-like basis will decline by 0.3 times. Together with the previous transaction, this will bring total disposal proceeds to around &#x20AC;12 billion, well above our objective of at least 10 billion. We have therefore executed several transactions in a difficult environment at quite attractive prices.</p>
          <p>Coming to the EU commitment, last week we also announced the sale of drawing rights of 265 megawatt Veltheim plant to Morgan Stanley. In February, we had closed the sale of our Transpower transmission &#x2013; German transmission business to TenneT, the Dutch TenneT. With these two transactions, we have now fulfilled the commitment to the EU Commission toward new generation capacity by roughly 5 gigawatts and to diverse our transmission network. Some of those transactions were swaps, which allowed us to gain 3.7 gigawatt of generation capacity predominantly neighboring western countries.</p>
          <p>And the next steps, portfolio streamlining never ends. We will continuously ask ourselves whether we are the right owners and whether we can make a valuable difference for we have now maximum flexibility to pursue the best solutions. We have therefore for example decided to cancel the sale of our GASAG stake, the Berlin gas distributor, as well as not to pursue the sale of our Italian gas distribution network further. On the other hand, we're proceeding with the divestment of the other participations taken out of Th&#xFC;ga.</p>
          <p>Chart 6, on this slide I am giving you some ideas of areas that will receive by personal attention. The recent past has been relatively supportive and simple for the entire sector. The commodity cycle and CO2 provided ample earnings support and accordingly a strong increase in financial flexibility. This financial capacity was partly used to enlarge the scope of companies in the past years.</p>
          <p>The future might become more complicated and we require sharpened skills just to name a few examples. We will have both large central facilities and smaller decentralized conventional generation assets. In addition, we will be faced with 2-way interaction with our customers. Finally, low carbon generation technologies tend to have very high upfront investment cost. This raises questions regarding the timing of such investments as well as necessary compensation structure in order to generate adequate returns on capital for our investors.</p>
          <p>These all result in a need to develop &#x2013; these will all results in a need to develop a deeper understanding of new business models and to apply a holistic energy competence which ranges across the entire value chain. I am however not afraid of this development. Only this complexity will allow adequate margins in the long run, otherwise competitors will come in and simply copy our approach and finally take away our margin, but while the environment becomes more complex, E.ON has to get simpler both internally and externally.</p>
          <p>I will carefully review our Group's structure and leadership structure and ask whether we have the optimum set-up to co-persist this corrupt environment. When planning for the future, we cannot count on commodity prices to start performance upwards. As a consequence, improving operational performance by our own efforts will remain a constant and ongoing focus demonstrating high levels of performance and service will also help to regain public trust and respect prerequisite for good performance in our sector and obviously for good support by our customers.</p>
          <p>On chart 7, I would like to conclude my presentation. We are starting to see evidence of recovery of demand both for power as well as gas. But even though demand is growing relatively strong year-on-year, it remains well below pre-crisis levels. Forward hedging and power generation will protect part of our 2010 and 2011 earnings from the worst of the crisis, the jury is still out in 2012. Currently forward prices are slightly above the prices that we've hedged so far. With the disposal of our E.ON U.S. Midwest operations, our portfolio streamlining program has made a major step forward. The transaction brings us 2 billion ahead of our objective of generating at least 10 billion of disposal proceeds. Furthermore, it will improve our debt factor by 0.3 times. Portfolio streamlining will continue, but we have no maximum flexibility to find the best solution for each as it's under review. Finally, I'll share with you some of our thoughts regarding the future of E.ON. We'll further elaborate on these ideas when presenting the Group's new strategy and targets in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>I remain available to answer your questions later on, but now Marcus, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The investors, the analysts, I have the pleasure to show you a strong set of results in more detail, but I'll also explain to why this outperformance over last year's numbers cannot be extrapolated into the future and why we're hence sticking to our guidance.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the major effect impacting Q1, EBIT on chart number 10. The biggest positive items are the UK retail margin, as the quarter benefited from a cold winter combined with low gas and power wholesale prices compared to last year's first quarter with unusual low margins. We started to see this remarkable return to profitability already during the second half of last year and as you know, end of Q1 of 2010, we reduced our gas prices to retail customers. Hence, do not assume these margins to last throughout the entire year.</p>
          <p>In our German DSO, we have seen a 200 million improvement over last year. This is mainly due to higher allowance tariffs. As expected, we see a better result in the asset optimization within E.ON Energy Trading. We see &#x20AC;100 million more in our new market segment, which is mainly driven by climate and renewables in Russia. The additional contribution from Perform to Win is around &#x20AC;100 million. The main negative effect results from our portfolio measures here mainly from the absence of certain power plants in Th&#xFC;ga in particular.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 11, the divisional adjusted EBIT and EBITDA breakdown basically underpins the picture from the proceeding slides. The big drivers in Q1 were UK, trading and new markets. Now I will explain the detail on a market unit level starting as usual with Central Europe. Central Europe's adjusted EBIT is basically flat. On a like-for-like basis i.e., adjusting for the effects from power plant disposals, the adjusted EBIT was up around 10%. Central Europe West non-regulated is down primarily due to the disposal of certain power plants in 2009.</p>
          <p>Please note that within E.ON Energy Trading we have a corresponding positive effect of around 80 million, which is powerfully offsetting the minus 177 million mentioned on the slide. Central Europe West Regulated is up 86 million. Whilst we see a lower result from the TSO of 92 million, we have higher DSO earnings due to the improved tariff in both power and gas. On the power side, we begin to benefit from reduced transmission charges. The improvement at Central Europe East is driven in particular by higher gross margin in power, yet mainly in Hungary.</p>
          <p>Let me move to Pan-European Gas. The adjusted EBITs in this market unit came down by 13% to 700 million. The major reduction results from the de-consolidation of Th&#xFC;ga which was reported until the end of 2009 in the category other consolidation. The second driver for the earnings reduction was Pan-European Gas regulated business. As we had previously indicated, our gas transportation business suffers from lower tariffs in 2010. Also income from the international participations, in particular SPP was down this year. The non-regulated activities show a mild positive development. Upstream improved due to the 44 million contribution from Yushno Russkoje; positive price effect of around 21 million and negative volume effects in the existing years around 42 million. Supply and sales, there we see a mix picture, price effects as expected continue to worsen, here we see roughly 100 million negative impact, however, volume effects basically the same order of magnitude to offset this. Obviously this in Q1 was strongly supported by the cold weather; we were in total up 29 terawatt hours over last year's quarter.</p>
          <p>On the outlook for the full year; next to the de-consolidation effect resulting from the sales of Th&#xFC;ga as well as the lower tariffs in gas transportation, in particular our supply and sales business, we do expect to remain under pressure.</p>
          <p>Over to chart number 14, UK has shown an extraordinary good performance in Q1 with EBIT jumping almost 500% to 433 million. The regulated business improved to 123 million driven by currency translation and higher network charges. Our non-regulated business saw a continuation of the strong performance as of the end of 2009. Retail was the main catalyst, colder weather leading to higher volumes, low spot prices and ongoing operational improvement were the main factors.</p>
          <p>Let me comment this in a bit more detail on the next slide number 15. Here we highlight that the conditions during Q1 leading to this strong profit growth were quite unusual. Traditionally, the first quarter of the year has been a fairly weak quarter, given high wholesale prices in winter. Furthermore, last year's Q1 was in addition impacted by the crisis. This year, we experienced the coldest winter for over 20 years combined with relatively low wholesale prices driven by the specific situation in the gas markets that is hurting us in other places. All these leads to a material outperformance over last year. We do not expect this to be sustainable until end of the year due to the highly competitive nature of the UK markets.</p>
          <p>Also, I would once again like to remind you of the 6% price reduction for our standard gas customers implemented on the 31st of March this year. In our current projections, UK retail were probably lose, quite some substantial parts of its Q1 outperformance during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>In Nordic, we see a slight improvement compared to 2009, but it was operationally a bit disappointing. The regulated business is up 28 million mainly due to higher tariffs and volumes, again driven by weather, in power distribution and also positive currency translation effects. In our non-regulated business, we saw a reduction EBIT driven by lower nuclear volumes where we experienced a shortfall of 1 terawatt hour compared to last year. Outages of greenhouse one and two, until the end of February have cost us 0.6 terawatt hours and the continuing testing mode at <mark type="inaudible" /> cost us 0.3 terawatt hours. We expect the plants to be fully operational this May. The volume drop is only partially compensated by higher transfer prices for hydropower and increased <mark type="inaudible" /> and electricity production from our CHP in Malm&#xF6;.</p>
          <p>Let me come to E.ON U.S. The story is very simple, higher regulatory earnings and higher retail volumes, 27 million are offset by the delayed timing of cost recoveries, higher OpEx and translation effects, which were negative. Starting in Q2, we will record the results of E.ON U.S. as discontinued operations for the full year. This will include also restating last year's figures. E.ON Energy Trading's adjusted EBIT strongly improved in the first quarter to almost 350 million. Mainly this is driven by the optimization result, specifically the optimization of the power portfolio. This includes around 80 million positive effect related to sold power volumes. In essence, we benefit from existing hedges that were in the money.</p>
          <p>In our prop trading, we see a difficult first quarter with a 2 million loss, I am sorry, but I am losing a bit my voice. On the following page, I will illustrate the impact from the transfer pricing given the power generating market units in each and how this can influence the optimization results. The key element behind our transfer pricing mechanism is that the generating market unit transfer the entire volume to Energy Trading, three years ahead of delivery at the forward market price at this timing of transfer. that point in time is not necessarily the same point in time in which Energy Trading sell the volumes into the markets. Hence, transfer price and achieved prices may differ. Over the cycle, this should balance out.</p>
          <p>First on the transfer prices, transfer prices determine the topline and finally the profitability of the generating market units in the year of delivery, so they do have an impact on our external reporting regarding these market units. For Energy Trading, the transfer prices are the essential cost fact in the year of delivery. Transfer prices are determined in the so called hand over period 3 years ahead of delivery as shown in the first graph. Achieved prices are a result of the hedging of Energy Trading for the year of delivery which started earliest in the hand over period. Achieved prices determine the topline of Energy Trading and together with the transfer price, they are the main determinants for the optimization results.</p>
          <p>You can see the simple formula in the second graph on the chart. If the transfer price is higher than the achieved price, the connected optimization margin is negative and vice versa. The 2010 delivery was handed over during 2007, while hedging externally was mainly done in the high price periods, which we all remember during 2008. Hence, Energy Trading's 2010 figures will be high, but they are only a consequence of the different timing of hand over and external hedging. I know we've explained this very often, but we continue to get questions. Hence, our additional attempt to try to clarify these effects. The &#x2013; some of the two results, the market generation unit results plus the Energy Trading optimization result is the Group's total generation results.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the segment, New Markets, the adjusted EBIT contribution here is up 55% to almost &#x20AC;250 million. The main drivers behind this increase were climate and renewables and the market unit Russia. Climate and renewables improved Q1 performance is mainly done on the back of higher and store capacities compared to last year's quarter, first quarter.</p>
          <p>The attributable generation capacity at the end of the first quarter of 2010 amounted to 3 gigawatt compared with 2.3 at the end of March 2009. Power produced increased by almost 40% or 0.5 terawatt hours. We had indeed hoped for an even better result but we continued to suffer from low U.S. wholesale prices and in Q1 lower than normal wind in particular in the U.S., UK and Germany.</p>
          <p>Russia, liberalization and the cold winter were the main drivers leading to higher price levels and higher outputs. We continue also to see some recovery in the Russian market as far as the overall economy is concerned.</p>
          <p>Italy, in Italy we see the negative impacts from the de-consolidation of the cost, our power stations that A2A received in exchange for their 20% stake in Endesa Italia, excluding this the business would have been stabled.</p>
          <p>Spain was a positive surprise, despite the tough market circumstances with low overall prices and high volatility due to the increase in Feed-in from Renewable Energy, the market unit was able to increase profitability by supplying balancing power, adopting intra-day business as well as hedging.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 21. Improvement of adjusted interest expense is driven by lower net debt, but also increasing construction period interest. Once again to explain what that is, we accrue interest for access on the construction, until completion, these lesser effect we expect to look less favorable in the second half of the year, so that interest result for the full year should be in line with prior year.</p>
          <p>Net bookings increased by almost 0.7 billion, thereof the disposal of the higher voltage grids contributes 130 million, the sale and swap of power generation capacity around 400 million. Other non-operating earnings are basically 0 this year. This represents a drop by 1.2 billion compared to Q1 of last year. Main items here, the mark-to-market of derivatives is down 700 million bucks delay high positive number around 800 million. We charged the goodwill impairment as we announced a few days ago on the future disposal of E.ON U.S. and the 2 main positive effects. In Q1, we had around 80 million storm cost in the U.S. and around 150 million impairment charges on securities had on the balance sheet. Both these effects have not been repeated in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 14, basically my only comment is that the income tax rate is slightly up given the impairment from the U.S. is not tax deductible. Adjusted for the impairment, our tax rate would have been 26%, in line with our general expectations. We often get this question what the tax rate is that we expect for the full year, we can only reiterate what we've been saying. We always expected to be around 27 to 28% and that is also the expectation for the full year 2010.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income, over to chart number 23, increased by 16% at a slightly lower pace than adjusted EBIT. Reason for this is our higher tax rate in Q1, 2010 compared to Q1, 2009. This increase in taxes included in adjusted net income results from 2 effects, we have a lower share of non-taxable result in the underlying results mainly because of <mark type="inaudible" /> and last year's taxes were impacted by the required release of a tax provision in Q1.</p>
          <p>Over to cash flow, on chart 24, we are giving you a reconciliation of the cash flow from operations from overall Group's perspective. I will run you through the effects in detail. As shown on the previous chart, adjusted EBIT increased by 684 million, correcting from non-cash effective items, such as valuation effects. Cash effect to EBITDA grew by another 150 million. We have a 900 million negative working capital effect mainly in gas storage where the gas withdraw was approximately 25 terawatt hours less than in 2009. In Q1 of last year, we reduced CO2 inventory from the unusually high end 2008 level. This positive effect that we have in Q1 of last year was not repeated this year. 350 million positive of other working capital reflects, this include some working capital effects from our disposals. We had 100 million storm damage last year which was not recorded in EBIT, at I mentioned before, we didn't see that impact again this year. And then we have around &#x2013; for the first time around 150 million cash grants that we received within climate and renewables for U.S. wind parks. And we had in total around 110 million higher interest payments and then a number of other effects, which in total sum up to a positive 112 million.</p>
          <p>Investments in Q1 are down 7% or 140 million on a year-on-year basis as is shown on chart 25. For your information, around 70% of our CapEx is spent for upstream activities and the remainder is for infrastructure. Economic net debt was down by 0.8 billion and the main drivers are explained on chart 27. Here main positive movers were the divestments which is here basically the disposal of Transpower to TenneT in &#x2013; which closed end of February and then the cash provided by the operating activities of &#x20AC;3.1 billion. Main negative items, the aforementioned investments, the cash effective investments of around 1.8 billion. We see a change in our pension obligation due to lower interest rates around 4.4 billion and other effects of a total negative 1.1 billion. I think it should be noted at this stage that with the signature of the disposal of E.ON U.S., if you're much more comfortable to be able to take our debt factor back to 3 times or even below that level, we believe this puts further credibility behind our current ratings.</p>
          <p>Let me come to my final chart 28. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect the adjusted EBIT to be between 0 and 3% above the 2009 level. In light of the relatively strong Q1 results, we understand this needs some explanation. After the first quarter, we're roughly 600 million ahead of last year's numbers. We expect to lose some of this advantage during the remainder of the year for the following reasons. The 210 million one-off gain we had in Italy in Q1, 2009, you will remember that was due to the, basically the renegotiation of unfavorable long-term contracts. This valuation effect will not be repeated again. We had a similar albeit smaller effect in our French operations last year, which recorded extraordinary gains from the revaluation of contracts, capped and assigned low values in the context of the original purchase price allocation for SNET.</p>
          <p>In addition, in Q2, 2009 we have reported a further 90 million higher income in our regulated business at Pan-European Gas, which results from a switch to IFRS in 2 transportation subsidiaries. Again, this effect will not be repeated.</p>
          <p>In our U.K. retail business, as I mentioned before, we have seen a very strong improvement over last year's quarter, last year's first quarter. We do not expect to give up &#x2013; we do expect to give up some of that advantage during the coming quarters, in particular Q4 of 2009 was very strong. Finally, the situation in our sales and supply business at Pan-European Gas remains challenging and we expect it to worsen during the coming months. Taking all these effects together, we expect to lose the 600 million lead from Q1, maybe not in total, but to a lion share. Given that the first 2 effects represented one-time &#x2013; sorry, the first and second effect represented one-time items in Q2 of 2009, would like to indicate that we see results to be in line with prior-year level, most likely already with our half-year results. Likewise, adjusted net income for the full year is expected to be in line with 2009.</p>
          <p>Those are my comments on the numbers. And obviously now, all of us are ready for your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Dear, ladies and gentlemen, we are now starting our question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Bobby Chada from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks very much. I wondered with two questions, the first is, weather was obviously a significant influence in many of your market units. Could you give us any idea for the effect that it had on your adjusted EBIT versus normalized temperatures in the first quarter? And the second question refer to EET, the Energy Trading business, you hopefully explained again how the optimization profits or the difference between the transfer price and the achieved price. Given that you have, you have good internal visibility on both of these, is Q1 reflective of the scale of optimization profits in later quarters or should we expect that to be very lumpy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; hi, Bobby, on the weather question, I don't have the EBIT impact. We would really take &#x2013; need some time to accumulate that number. I know that, our assessment is that in gas I think around 7 terawatt hours is an increase we've seen there, basically weather related, but that's only Pan-European Gas. Some of the improvements in UK retail is driven by weather. Those would probably by &#x2013; be sort of my two main picks, but what that means in absolute numbers? So we will have to come back to you on that one. As far as the EET, your question regarding the EET optimization result is concerned, and I understand your question basically, whether this is a run rate for the quarters, did I get that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, I know there are always pieces that will move around, but I expect you have good visibility on what the transfer price is in each quarter and what the achieved price externally as in each quarter, given that it's all locked in, is it a good run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in general what &#x2013; and as far as I remember, we explained that when we presented Energy Trading for the very first time. In general, you will see that Q1 and Q4 of a year will be the weaker quarters and the summer quarters will be the stronger quarters. You will see that, you will also see that in 2010 where also the strongest quarters are going to be or we expect it to be Q2 and Q3, just looking at the optimization results. Prop trading obviously follows different logic.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Martin Young at Nomura. Good afternoon to everybody. A couple of questions. First relates to your latest thoughts around the nuclear lifetime debate in Germany. I appreciate that you and your competitors had said that there will be no comment ahead of the elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, clearly those were on Sunday, we all know the results. What is your latest thinking now on the timeline to getting an answer on the nuclear debate? And what are the legalistic situations around that? And then just to follow up on Bobby's question on the trading business, if you are suggesting that the second and the third quarters are going to be your best quarters during the course of the year, assuming that quarter 4 is not a disaster, then it looks like you could have an extremely positive result from the trading business of well over &#x20AC;1 billion at the adjusted EBIT level, is that something that you're thinking about at this particular moment in time when you've given the guidance for that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Martin, it's Johannes speaking. On the nuclear issue, we understand from the German Chancellor that she will now very shortly initiate official talks on the subject and we have not heard any noise from Berlin that due to the election outcome, there is a change of positions. The legalistic question is a tough one because it depends on how they write the law. We have &#x2013; our constitution makes it different on what is in law and what is let's say in a separate law to answer whether the law needs the approval of the upper house or not. Since there's no legalistic framework on the table, nobody can tell yet whether law will need approval of the upper house or not. Our understanding from legal opinion is that there are let's say workarounds if politicians want so, but that in the end is a political question. So we have to wait and see, but we believe talks will start pretty immediately, but we have to sort of wait for the call, let's say from Berlin. On the EET results, your assumption is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, I would like to add really just one point and hopefully, it's now finally what's really understood by everybody. This unusually high result of Energy Trading is simply this year driven by the fact that at the time when we transferred the 2010 volume, forward prices were low and when we hedged those volumes to the outside world, those were times when we saw oil prices getting close to $150. In the past, all these effects would have happened within the generating market units and now you will see it as a trading result, but please do not confuse that with a prop trading result.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. The next question comes from Mr. Schumacher from UniCredit in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I was just wondering on the recent transfer of the star volumes and there were a quite few press releases, which contained very little detail really. Are you in a position where you can give us a likely impact of subsidy on your 2010 results? That's the first question. And the second one is on Central Europe, West Regulated, you said that the higher earnings due to regulation in power and gas are quite substantial with 132 in power and 22 on gas. Is that run rate we can expect for- of this particular impact for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the star effect, don't overestimate let's say the size of the deal. Just take it as a time optimization. The time volume, the time value of this production rate at this time were higher for EET than for us. We have actually also a right, let's say to call such production rights, similar production rights back to us later if we would decide so &#x2013; so the financial effect is rather limited of that, and therefore, we kept it as low profile as possible and also investors shouldn't work around that with a lot of assumptions. It's a financially limited impact.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; on your second question Lueder with regard to the, our DSO activities in Germany, where as you point out we did see an improvement over last year's numbers of together around 150 million in Q1. This is maybe not exactly the run rate for each quarter, for each of the following 3 quarters but close to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the first question &#x2013; the first question comes from Mr. Steele from Execution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everybody. Lawson Steele with Execution Noble. First of all, Marcus, well done on getting through that throb your throat. My first question is about the gas business, and I just wanted you to talk about the evolution of competition in gas, particularly in light of the recent agreement with the EU about the fine for anti-competitive behavior. Secondly, sort of I am keen to understand to what extent you've been able to take advantage of the current price strength in electricity and whether you managed to hedge anything for 2013? And thirdly, I just want a bit of clarity in some way so talk about the second half, to get more clarity if that's summer or end of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question, the gas competition, I don't think it has changed due to the influence of the EU settlements at all. This is basically a market effect, not a regulatory effect we see. So don't overestimate, for example the settlement that we and others did with EU commission on possible claims they had, they don't say it's market dynamics in a meaningful way, and as Marcus just indicated from the other side of the table they were indicated over time. So limited effect, but also in our outlook we don't think that that would change the world in any meaningful way. 2013 hedging, I think we're on a low pace because it's quite outer year and we've not expediated our hedging for 2012 and 2013, what we did in the past for '10 and '11. But on those years, we're staying let's say on a neutral view towards the price environment, the markets indicate. And coming out in summer, coming out, good term, the definition of summer is different everywhere. So don't expect the Swedish summer, which starts in June rather the later summer, and we'll indicate to you as early as possible, when we're ready and when we see the time is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Could you just go back to the gas a bit, and it wasn't just about EU, I just wonder if you just give us some more clarity on competitive elements within the gas business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Competition is still tough. The differentiation between oil index and spot prices has widened, and it is not easy to gain a margin significantly above the flexible prices. So there is lots of supply available and markets have not &#x2013; don't yet show any sign of tightening. So margins are quite depressed still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Andreas Thielen from MainFirst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two things firstly, there is currently an investigation ongoing also by the Cartel Office in Germany on prices on the electricity side. Do you have any indication when the Cartel Office there is getting to a conclusion? And secondly, just coming back to regulation once more on the gas side, we also have a number here for the impact from gas transport. Would that be similar to the DSO, be a good run rate for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, what the German Cartel Office is pursuing is basically let's say a market test, whether every supplier is bringing in his production on a fair and transparent mode. We feel basically comfortable that we have provided all information. We have no indication whatsoever that there is problems ongoing. I just remember for example that the new President of the German Cartel Office in a public statement said that Germany should be rather happy to have strong utility as us and some competitors living up north from here. And so, no nothing where we are in any way foreseeing trouble. On the gas transport charges, yes, I think your assumption is right.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Benjamin Leyre from BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. First question please on the debt level. Do you still expect to bring debt below 3 times by the end of '11 or do you think you will be there by the end of 2010? And related to that any expectation of special dividends or use of <mark type="inaudible" />? And second question, looking a bit more strategic year ahead, there is a very lose gas price environment, are you considering new investments in CCGTs in Germany and do you see competition considering new business in CCGTs in Germany to take advantage of this very cheap and very low gas market environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the first question. I would like to stick to our target that we put out just a few weeks back namely that we do expect to take our dead factor to maximum three times ideally below that level during the quarter of 2011. Obviously to a large extent this will be driven by also by the timing of the closing of the E.ON U.S. transaction which maybe December, maybe January. So, we'll have to see. Hence, we stick to the number. In this context, you were asking for a special dividend. Clearly this is a decision that finally shareholders have to take but I would dare to say that for 2011 I would almost categorically rule that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the second question whether we have any new pipeline plans for new CCGTs in Germany, I would say no. I think I indicated to you that we're working very hard of realizing value for the last investments and the older investment on the CCGT side through getting cheaper gas and realizing better spark spreads, but we don't see an indication from the market that would support new investment at this time and therefore, the answer is no on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see competition considering this or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All that we hear is that more and more power plans are being canceled in various countries across Europe but also in particular in Germany. But obviously we have no detailed insight into all the plans of our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions please. The first one, could you share with us a bit any feeling you have on the behavior of your industry at the moment? I mean there has been a big increase in power prices in the past month or so. Do you see any change in their behavior, in their willingness to hedge forward on that? And the second question was a bit...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent, sorry we didn't understand, whose behavior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your industrial clients' behavior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question was just coming back on the Lueder's question on the impact from regulation in Central Europe, West Regulated &#x20AC;150 million in Q1 around 600 in the full year. That's sustainable gain or is that clue back on 2009, which might go away again in 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First question, we don't see a general change of behavior in our clients, but especially for the industrial clients, lot of them don't go, let's say to traditional purchasing processes, they go through brokers and whatsoever. So even to detect if there is a significant change of pattern is tough to say. But predominantly we see basically an unchanged pattern at this time. But we will watch it carefully. Second question Marcus is going to take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the DSO, maybe just to make sure that people don't get carried way with our number, my answer to Lueder's question was, it is on the order of magnitude slightly below the Q1 effect. So no, it will not be 600 million for the full year. I do expect the impact in the quarter to be at around 100 million for the coming 3 quarters. For the full year, there is indeed roughly 200 million, which is a recovery of losses incurred last year. Hence, this is not an effect that one can then repeat for the outer years.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Tom Gibney from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a quick question on your gas contract renegotiations, you last time gave an indication of what percentage of spot gas you essentially have in your portfolio, could you give that to us again now and give us an idea of how that's progressing? And you also indicated that you renegotiated successfully around 40% of those contracts by volumes. Again, what would the number be now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Let's say the flexibility element that we renegotiated brought us to the high teens as a volume part of our purchases that are more flexible now and linked more to the flexible prices. There's no new negotiations yet ongoing. We've indicated that the markets stay under stress and the new gas approaches and nothing changes and something new will have to start. But that is different from open negotiations of the past. So, this is an annual process and one of the past has been pretty much closed and the later one has not yet started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as volume flexibility is concerned, as we mentioned during the full year results, we've negotiated around 120 million in take payments of which 90 million has been cash outs in Q1 of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you very much. The next question comes from Patrick Hummel from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions remaining. First one is you mentioned at the beginning your focus on operational excellence and having an efficient organization. So I'm wondering should we expect you to give an update on your future cost cutting efforts et cetera, with the strategy on Investor Day in late summer this year, looking at your Perform to Win program, which expires at 2011, should we expect to rolling forward into the future? And the second question is on prop trading, Q2, sorry, Q1 was obviously not a great quarter for prop trading. Is that something, you would just say okay, you haven't taken the right bets there or is there something you would like to change structurally in that unit going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the second one, that's not a structural problem. We have had some rather low volumes in spots and limited risk capital that we used in the first quarter. Obviously, we were also not happy at all about the results, could have been a little better, were surprised from time to time, but isn't a normal behavioral spot from time to time. But in April, we see some recovery of the speed and the results. So we are &#x2013; we don't see as a structural or fundamental problem. It was a not a good quarter period. And on the first one, obviously first of all cost cutting and raising efficiency is an ongoing effort that every management has to do but maybe new management is especially oriented towards that, but secondly, I would not give you and please excuse that no expectation what the issues of our late summer story will be otherwise I would have it here as it's done. I need the time and I think you will through the course of the next weeks understand that it takes a little extra time. So, I cannot give you an additional indication and have to ask for your -- apologies on that.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Deborah Wilkens from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question for Dr. Teyssen and also for Marcus. Dr. Teyssen, on the gas contracts, you talked about the high teens portion which is more flexible but is it correct to think that your ability to nominate down on your volumes comes on top of that portion that's now more flexible or is that the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that comes on top, and this is more price flexibility that I talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other is a volume flexibility. So they add up with each other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you would add those together, you could take the price flexibility also as a volume flexibility per se, what kind of a level of your volume is flexible either through prices or volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have to look into it a little deeper. We'll come back to you but it has a two upfront I would say and not too far away from the 20, but we have to look in detail and it depends on the precise structure of contracts. It is not so easy, depends on prices and delivery points. So it's not so easy to give you a precise number on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And Marcus can you help us with the outlook for the construction period interest effect in 2010 and even '11, I think that the effect in 2009 was around 340 million; are you expecting a similar level of sort of P&amp;L reduction this year and next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect that number to come down. If you give me a second, I can dig that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we take the question and then Marcus will come back to you, Deborah later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for your question. Next question comes from Ingo Becker from Kepler Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, good afternoon. I also had a question on the gas business, just on the wider trend, the renegotiations that you conducted so far or put another way around: the gas business was down 13% in Q1. Should we expect that number to improve over the course of the year, if everything else remains the same? And maybe you can provide, at least, an indicative outlook also for 2011-12, if you assume that current market conditions and prices remain as they are? And second question would be, given the size of your gas business, if you could share with us your wider view for the future of the gas market. Are we seeing a sustained change in gas market fundamentals or do you view this, the current price behavior and trends as a more temporary thing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously not easy questions. First of all, the Q1 result was significantly supported by the temperature effects that Marcus described. So you can't extrapolate that to later quarters. And secondly, what would help is stronger and earlier recovery of the economy and therefore like gas demands negative could be increasing competition and always depends on the open positions that we have, so tough to prognose. The general question that you had: when do we see our fundamental market recovery or turning point? $1 billion question I would say; and if you read the reports across and our own prognosis, I don't see a consolidated view yet. It is not around the corner, I would say, but how far out, we have not yet a clear view, and then for the next one, two years, we strongly work under the assumption that we still this rather depressed market environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcus wants to add a sentence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that's fine, I would then take the Deborah's question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Deborah's question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the contraction period interest in Q1 of this quarter, we are some 40 million north of last year's quarter. So, again, this is of course positive interest. For the full year of 2010, we expect basically the same number as we have for 2009. So this 40 million lead that we have in interest result will get lost during the remaining quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Schumacher from UniCredit in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry. One follow-up question, just on the UK business, one of the main areas of outperformance in this quarter. It took such a long time for the UK actually to come out with a positive surprise on the earnings front, and now you telling us that it all is going to disappear over the rest of the year. Of the 150 million, I believe it was, you quantify as the &#x2013; the 350 million on the retail margin. Can you give us a split between what portion of this is accounted for by increased volumes and which &#x2013; how much of this is due to operational improvements, i.e. how much of this should be sustainable and won't just disappear in the following quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lueder. The precise split that you asked for, we believe we can roughly give you just looking it up, but I am not sure. Probably I think the main message is yes, we're not a bad operator in retail in the UK while other people have had more issues. I think we've recovered quite well. It is not only driven by margins and volumes, it's also driven by a very hard drive on our cost side. Some of the biggest Perform to Win initiatives resides in our UK retail business, where we've driven down cost significantly. So it's a mix of costs, of margins and volume. And now I think, I used enough time so Marcus can start on the number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for reasons you understand, we don't want to be too precise there. Again please never forget, this is a very competitive market environment. Of the full effect of around 350 million, around 50 that is a function of operational &#x2013; real just operational improvements that we continue to implement, and the remaining improvement, roughly 80 to 90% of that is a function of higher margins, again mainly driven off of low wholesale prices at that stage and the remainder is volume impact to a large extent weather.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a rough idea of where this leaves your supply margin in the UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we would see that uncompetitive information that we should not give. If you remember the Centrica for a while did that, all competitors enjoyed that information, but we don't believe from a market environment that it's appropriate to disclose that because it signals possible price behaviors and that is not in line with our compliance policies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. The next one comes from Tom Gibney from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry to come back to discuss renegotiation question but the full year results, you said that 80% of the portfolio is being renegotiated, about 60% of that was with three major suppliers and 90% of their volumes had been finalized. So, that was about 40% of the contract that had been renegotiated. And now there are no negotiations ongoing. Does that mean that you have canceled negotiations with a large proportion of your supplies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you have to take that we have different renegotiation time settings in each of the contracts. If not always under annual basis, so each of these different supply contracts give us a signal different time to touch these contracts but obviously forward time we would touch each and every one of them. Besides let's say we're on production where we are exposed let's say to the market in any case just can optimize cost but otherwise don't, there's no signal that there are contracts where we are hindered to optimize longer term. It's just sometimes it did allow.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Benjamin Leyre from BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two follow on questions, first one on Gazprom, are you happy what you're stake in Gazprom today, are you considering selling it? And second point on the electricity tariff reform in France, what is your current lobbying position? And are you happy with what you see &#x2013; shaping up in the electricity market in France. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one, I think we have commented sufficiently what we want to comment on the Gazprom stake in the past. If there would be news, we would comment, there is no news yet. And secondly, the France market reform, it's an ongoing political process, the law we have sent in comments. We are not totally happy but we think we should predominately send our signals behind the closed doors to the French government. And we have to basically to wait but we are exposed to a limit extend to the retail markets and the lot of the reform touches that and the influence on non-EDF is obviously much bigger, so limited financial and value exposure of us there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you are not considering expansion in retail in France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're having some retail operations but to a rather limited size, I would say. And that we are pursuing and growing where it creates value but that's said compare to big guys small.</p>
