        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2010. Today we are joined by Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO; and David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and CFO. David will provide a few comments about the results we have released this morning. He will highlight some of EMC's activities this quarter and discuss our updated outlook for 2010. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening in the market, EMC's execution of the strategy, and how EMC is positioned to help customers on the journey to the private cloud. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today in our press release, supplemental schedule, and the slides that accompany our presentation. All these are available for download within the Investor Relations section of emc.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial tables in our news release and on our corporate website. These include a lot of financial detail, so we do encourage you to take a look at them.</p>
          <p>The call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And lastly, I will note that an archive of today's presentation will be available following the call.</p>
          <p>With that, it's now my pleasure to introduce David Goulden. David?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market-leading solutions, our solid business model, and great execution by the team.</p>
          <p>There were many highlights this quarter, including record Q2 revenues of over $4 billion, up 24%; and record Q2 non-GAAP net income of $596 million, up 66%; non-GAAP EPS up $0.28, up a robust 56%. Our Storage business was up 21%. VMware grew revenue 48% over last year; free cash flow was $1.6 billion for the first half, up 47%; and non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% improved 120 bps sequentially. Once again, we achieved our triple play: We gained market share, invested for the future, and improved profitability. Within our consolidated revenue, which was up 24%, we saw excellent growth in Storage, as I mentioned, of 21% year-on-year. Security revenue grew 18%. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue was roughly flat. And VMware revenue grew an impressive 48%.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at some of the details within these business units. Within Storage, in the high end, Symmetrix product revenues were up 32% year on year, as customers are embracing the capabilities of our high-end solution. As the most powerful and scalable storage solution on the market today, VMAX clearly addresses customers' needs as they build out their private cloud infrastructures. Our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software, known as FAST, is driving higher rates of SSD and ATA-based storage in these systems, resulting in huge performance and cost improvements for our customers. As anticipated, following the introduction of FAST, we've seen penetration rates continue to rise in terms of SSD capacity per system, percentage of systems shipped with SSD, and the proportion of systems being shipped with FAST. The combination of SSD and ATA drives with FAST software yields a solution with performance, scalability, and cost effectiveness that's unmatched by our competitors.</p>
          <p>Our VPLEX platform, which we announced in May, is a net new opportunity and is proving to be a unique differentiator that is resonating with customers. Its technology is very complementary to tiered storage, as the combination of tiering with the mobility from VPLEX creates entirely new usage models that are an ideal virtual storage infrastructure for the private cloud. As with server virtualization, where apps are consolidated onto one server and then could be mobilized over many servers, virtual storage creates an elastic pool of storage within which you can tier data, and with VPLEX, move data across arrays within and between data centers.</p>
          <p>Our technology lead also extends to our mid-tier storage offerings. As you will recall, last quarter we expanded our disclosure to give you better insight into our progress in the mid-tier overall, taking into account the mix shift occurring among our mid-tier products. The many use cases and multiple technologies available in the mid-tier have driven customers to demand ease of use and simplicity, as well as the right technology for the right job. The strength and breadth of our technology portfolio helps us satisfy these customer requirements better than anyone else. Our approach is to continue to invest in our market-leading block file and object storage projects while converging technologies and products where it makes sense for simplicity and efficiency. This ongoing strategy resulted in mid-tier product growth in Q2 increasing to 33% year-on-year. Sequential growth was 12%. This is very good growth, especially given the fact that the majority of our mid-tier revenue currently comes from the high end of the mid-tier markets.</p>
          <p>In addition to being the overall leader in mid-tier storage, EMC continues to be the leader in the more mature fibre channel only mid-tier markets. While the fibre channel market is very important, we're also seeing higher growth opportunities in other areas of the mid-tier. Some of this growth is in the form of a mix shift from traditional fibre only products to next generation products like our very successful dedupe products and the fast-growing, unified, multi-protocol NS Celerra offerings we introduced a few years ago. For example, what might have been a &#x2013; traditionally been a CLARiiON disk library sale might now be a Data Domain dedupe deal.</p>
          <p>As the mid-tier market continues to evolve, we're in lockstep with customers making the transition to next-generation solutions. What really sets our mid-tier solutions apart is our technology edge, coupled with simplicity and efficiency, and this is driving our growth across the mid-tier. EMC is considerably more efficient from a capacity standpoint versus competitive solutions, and we guarantee it. EMC enables better scalability for customers wanting to add capacity while retaining high performance and high storage utilization levels. EMC is optimized with virtual environments in ways that make a noticeable difference to the customers, resulting in EMC being the clear storage vendor of choice in virtualized environments.</p>
          <p>Much of this preference is due to the efforts we've made to have the best integration with VMware virtual environments. For example, EMC is the only storage vendor to fully support the four VMware storage APIs for vCenter Site Recovery Manager, Data Projection, Multipathing, and the just-introduced Array Integration API. EMC puts more effort and resources into tight integration, and customers can tell the difference. Today, EMC has far and away the largest installed base in VMware environments, and according to a spending intention survey recently conducted by a major independent analyst firm, VMware customers are more than twice as likely to choose EMC for storage than any other vendor.</p>
          <p>As you know, software functionality is increasingly the key to competitive differentiation in the mid-tier, and this quarter we'll be shipping exciting new next-gen software technologies that further extend the capabilities of our market-leading CLARiiON and Celerra platforms. Since announcing these technologies at EMC World in May, customer anticipation has been very high, as we offer a set of functionalities that no other vendor can match. We're releasing a major step forward in management with Unisphere, with an advanced and easy-to-use interface to manage both Celerra and CLARiiON.</p>
          <p>We're building on our unique FAST technology in the mid-tier with FAST v2, which delivers sub-LUN performance analysis and data relocation. We're providing customers with a new capability called FASTCache, enabling customers to utilize solid-state storage to increase cache size for burst requirements, and we're introducing block compression for primary storage, which yields an average of 50% improvement in storage consumption.</p>
          <p>So to summarize our position in the mid-tier, first of all, EMC is already the acknowledged leader in the traditional mid-tier SAN and NAS environments. Secondly, EMC is also leading in some of the most important new technologies, such as dedupe, unified storage, and virtualization affinity. And third, EMC continues to add major next-generation software functions that further extend our technological lead. When you put it all together, EMC is the only company in this position across the mid-tier. Our competitive edge continues to grow, and as a result, it's pretty clear that EMC should be able to continue to gain share in the mid-tier.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, I know there's been a lot of interest in our strategy around our unified product family, so let me clarify this a bit for you. For a number of years, we've offered multi-protocol storage on one hardware platform, namely SAN, both fibre channel and iSCSI, and NAS in a box. This multi-protocol NS Celerra has been one of our fastest-growing products ever since. As I already said, in a few weeks we're releasing single-management interface Unisphere for our block and file functionalities. What we are maintaining is our market-leading SAN and NAS technologies have been optimized for the different data requirements customers have, because one size does not fit all when it comes to these requirements. In essence, NS Celerra now has best-of-breed file and block functionality with advanced next-generation software, including a single management interface, FAST, FASTCache, dedupe, and compression on one common high-performance hardware platform. This combination presents the most cost-effective, most reliable, and easiest-to-use unified solution, whilst retaining the native functionality that customers value.</p>
          <p>I might also add that we've recently integrated Atmos with Celerra, adding object capabilities to our flagship unified storage platform. And as I mentioned earlier, our success in the mid-tier has come principally from the higher end of the markets. We plan to extend our success in the mid-tier to the faster-growing lower end of the market with a new product family featuring EMC's market-leading technologies at prices that will be very competitive in this space. As such, we're also investing in the right people, the right partners, to aggressively market this new family, which we expect to formally introduce very early next year.</p>
          <p>Our Backup Recovery Systems business had another stellar quarter and continued to overachieve against plan in Q2. When we acquired Data Domain a year ago, we had a pretty good idea of the power that could be unleashed by combining their data deduplication technology with Avamar and our extensive customer reach. And in Q2, revenue from Avamar and Data Domain continued to grow from the billion-dollar revenue run rate we reported last quarter. There is great demand for the simple and efficient next-generation backup technology because it addresses one of the biggest pain points in the data center. We acquired over 350 new Data Domain customers in Q2 alone and more than 200 new Avamar customers.</p>
          <p>Our BRS division continues to make strides against competitors with the release earlier this week of several new capabilities, including a new mid-range system that leverages Nehalem technology to drive high levels of performance and capacity, a deduplication expansion option for EMC Disk Library for mainframe, and increased scalability of the EMC Disk Library series. In short, this division is performing very well, and the acquisition of Data Domain completed a year ago this Friday has already shown itself to be one of our best ever. Clearly we are gaining share in storage, and the reasons for this are straightforward. Customers are not only seeking out large and trusted vendors with established track records, but they want a partner with a clear roadmap, innovative products, and a breadth of capabilities for taking full advantage of cloud efficiencies going forward. EMC fits the bill in both areas.</p>
          <p>Our RSA security revenue growth accelerated in Q2 to 18% year on year, coming in at $173 million. We saw strength across the board in security. Archer is thriving, and we're benefiting from the combination of its audit capabilities with our security information and event management and data loss prevention technologies. More than ever, deal discussions are taking place at the CIO and CISO levels together, as customers seek security that is built in rather than bolted on. Our datacentric approach is especially resonant with customers, and security is an enabler for broad adoption of cloud infrastructures. Accordingly, while &#x2013; we continue to invest to leverage our unique position and take advantage of the immense opportunity to secure these next-gen infrastructures.</p>
          <p>Our Information Intelligence Group, formerly known as Content Management Archiving, reported revenues of $178 million, relatively flat from last year's Q2. Our xCP composition platform and our e-discovery solutions are resonating well with customers.</p>
          <p>VMware revenue within EMC grew 48% year on year to $673 million. This Q2 record revenue was driven by strength across geographies, products, and customer segments from SMB up through the enterprise. Virtualization of the server infrastructure is a first step towards cloud computing, and it's clear that customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. This is not surprising given the gains in flexibility, efficiency, and cost savings that cloud architectures offer, and the fact that VMware's technology is several generations ahead of competitors.</p>
          <p>Our four business units together represent the combined power of information and virtual infrastructures. The same fundamental shift in IT is driving the success of each, and together we continue to move forward under a shared vision and a strategic direction that fully captures the opportunity that bounds over the next several years as customers embark on their journeys to private cloud.</p>
          <p>Our VCE coalition is addressing its mission to accelerate the proliferation of cloud infrastructures. Customers are eager to start realizing the benefits of reduced costs and improved business agility. They're looking to VCE as a means to get there because it provides a way to significantly reduce risks, costs, and time to value with ready-to-deploy cloud infrastructures. A recent survey by Datamonitor and UBS indicates that the VCE coalition is far and away the preferred solution for data center modernization.</p>
          <p>Our consulting business also continues to thrive by guiding customers' transitions to virtual data center architectures, as EMC is a trusted advisor within the enterprise that enables customers to move forward with confidence. As the only player offering virtual server and virtual storage infrastructures, coupled with advanced IT security and compliance and information intelligence, EMC is squarely focused on helping customers make this transition to next-generation private and public clouds.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you a bit more color about what else happened in the quarter looking at our geos. All our geographies contributed to year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, with revenue up 28% in North America, 18% in EMEA, 20% in APJ, and 22% in Latin America. In North America, we did see some weakness in federal governments that was more than offset by growth in financial services, TME and the commercial markets. Our international mix stood at 47% in Q2, with the largest portion of foreign revenue coming from Europe. Within Europe, there was some weakness in Spain, Portugal, and Greece, and this was more than offset by strength in the UK, France, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia. Our growth in APJ was led by strength in India and China. Our focus on the BRIC plus 13 emerging markets is yielding good growth again, with Q2 revenue growth of over 30%. So as you can see, EMC is a global company with operation in dozens of countries.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we do some business in dollars and some in local currencies. Some local currency business is hedged and some is not, and in some markets we have local pricing plans and not in others. Given these and other factors, non-dollar currency effects are obviously a complex internal equation and pretty much impossible to calculate from an external perspective. So given your interest in this topic, I will try to net out the impacts for your modeling purposes. While currency was neutral to our results in Q2, based on where rates were at June 30, we expect that currency will now be a 1 point headwind for the full year 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at some of the income statement and balance sheet items. In Q2, EMC reported non-GAAP gross margin of 60.1%, non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Free cash flow for the last 12 months was $3.1 billion, up over 20% from the comparable period and about $800 million higher than trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income. The excellent growth across these metrics demonstrates that improvements we've made to our business model over the last couple years are yielding the results we expected.</p>
          <p>The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. We now expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be closer to 21%. This increase is due to higher expected contribution of profits from the U.S. due to currency as well as some other factors. We do still expect the U.S. R&amp;D tax rates to take effect later this year. DSOs came in at 45 days compared to 52 for the second quarter of 2009. Inventory turns were 8.2 compared to 7.8 a year ago. And deferred revenue is up nearly $100 million from last quarter.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of cash. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S., with the remainder overseas. We spent $341 million in the quarter buying back 18.6 million shares of EMC's stock, almost twice our Q1 level, bringing us up to over $500 million on EMC shares repurchased so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $99 million buying VMware shares, and VMware spent $130 million buying back VMware shares. Our VMware business is a key enabler to making our cloud vision a reality. While customers' transition to the cloud is under way, the majority of the journey lies ahead of us, which is why we see the purchases of EMC and VMware as excellent investments.</p>
          <p>As we look to the second half of 2010, our expectations for economic growth and IT spending for the full year really haven't changed that much. IT spending still looks to be up around 3 to 5%, with our addressable markets stronger, up around 6 to 8%. At the beginning of the year, we said we expected that economic recovery would be moderate, with some bumps in the road, and this is what we're seeing. There are a few factors we didn't specifically anticipate, such as the relative weakness of the euro and pound, our higher projected tax rates, and more cautious government spending in the U.S. and Europe. And we're obviously monitoring the impact of these very closely.</p>
          <p>However, in spite of these challenges, based upon the level of customer interest in our strategy and solutions, combined with the strength of our businesses, including Storage and VMware, we now expect that we'll exceed our previous outlook of $16.5 billion in revenue and $1.18 in non-GAAP EPS in 2010. Our Q2 results indicate that we're on the right track strategically and executing well on our triple play. We see no reason why we cannot continue to maintain this triple play over the long term. When thinking about this, it is worth noting that since we started expanding EMC's addressable markets in 2004, EMC's growth is impressive, with annual average revenue growth of 12% and annual average non-GAAP EPS growth of 19%. This is excellent performance over a six-year period, which included the '08 and '09 recession.</p>
          <p>So today our strategy is clear. The business model and operating model are in place. Our investments continue to pay off, and the private cloud opportunity is very big. EMC has never been better positioned for success than it is right now, and as a result, we believe we can continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earning growth for the next several years.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will provide some more color on what we're seeing in 2010 and explain why we're confident about double-digit growth going forward. Joe?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, David. I'd like to begin by adding my welcome to all of you who are attending today's conference call. Thanks for joining us.</p>
          <p>Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We posted solid year-over-year and sequential growth numbers while establishing EMC and VMware as a thought leader in the next major wave of computing, namely the transformation of IT to IT as a service, commonly called cloud computing. This success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the more than 45,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I want to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments.</p>
          <p>I believe a top question on your mind has to be around the pockets of uncertainty that seem to pop up around the world and their effect on the global economy, and more specifically, how this will manifest itself in IT spending going forward. As we have said before, we at EMC expected and planned for a recovery in 2010, but we always believed it would be choppy. So perhaps the best way to look at IT spending trends is by geography. The U.S. market continues to be good with good prospects. Our customers here are investing in information technologies to increase their levels of productivity, while managing risk with a maniacal focus on maintaining stellar compliance with their policies, best practices, and laws of the land, while ensuring proper governance and oversight.</p>
          <p>Turning to the international markets, in Europe we are seeing moderate growth in IT spend, except in Southern Europe, where we are definitely seeing a slowdown in IT purchases. In Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, China, Southeast Asia, and in selected Eastern European countries, IT spending is robust and is exhibiting very solid double-digit growth. And lastly, in Japan, we are seeing that spending is now improving a bit.</p>
          <p>And as David has already said, we were not affected by currency rates in Q2, but we most likely will be in the second half of this year. I want to make it clear, however, that with only 47% of our revenues coming from the international markets, I truly believe we have ample opportunity for solid international growth despite likely currency fluctuations. We at EMC believe that international revenues should make up well over 50% of our total revenues, and we are squarely focused on and investing in this growth opportunity for EMC.</p>
          <p>Of importance, the global market for virtualization, storage, data protection, and data security &#x2013; markets where consolidated EMC is the leader &#x2013; will continue to grow faster than the IT market as a whole. And again, what adds confidence to this growth statement is the thought leadership, innovations, and strong product roadmap we have in the next new wave of IT, cloud computing. It is our firm belief that cloud computing will happen in both enterprise IT shops, as customers transform their IT data centers into private clouds, as well as in the service provider community, where we'll build out an extensive number of very large public clouds. These transformations will give CIOs the capabilities to offer their customers, whether they are internal customers or external customers, the massive benefits of IT as a service, namely the ability to run applications more flexibly at a lower cost while ensuring that the attendant policies and service levels are adhered to.</p>
          <p>To assure we capitalize on this massive cloud opportunity, consolidated EMC is focusing our technology and go-to-market resources on providing our customers with a path, a measured journey to the private cloud. First and foremost, VMware is advancing its leading virtualization technologies into a full-fledged next-generation data center cloud operating system, with innovative and integrated management, automation, and orchestration software. Last week's introduction of vSphere 4.1 is a major deliverable towards that goal. VM also uniquely automates both existing applications as well as reaching out to the new wave development communities that tend to develop applications in a framework context, a powerful benefit to customers as they journey to the private cloud. VMware also has a significant technology play in bringing their virtualization technology to client devices, allowing for the provisioning of an individual or user rather than provisioning the constantly changing sea of new devices that seem to come at us almost daily.</p>
          <p>On the information side, EMC is focused on storing, managing, projecting, and securing the incredible amount of new digital information that this world continues to create with price performance levels that the future cloud world will demand. IDC in a recent white paper estimated that the amount of digital information that is created will grow a remarkable, a remarkable, 44 times between 2009 and 2020.</p>
          <p>EMC is heavily investing in innovative information technologies like VMAX, a new category of storage that scales both up and out, offering unmatched cost performance, functionality, and reliability. Technologies like unified storage for converged fibre channel, SAN, NAS, and iSCSI environments, again featuring leading functionality for mid-tier storage platforms. We are investing in game-changing cloud technologies like VPLEX, our virtual storage product. VPLEX provides new capabilities like active-active data over distance and information federation across cloud data centers. Since most of the new information that is being created is object based, EMC is investing heavily on specialized cloud storage for this important category of information storage software called Atmos.</p>
          <p>We are investing in technologies like FAST, or Fully Automated Storage Tiering, that moves data automatically in concert with the policy and service levels our customers choose between flash drives, fibre channel drives, SATA drives, and SATA drives where the data is deduplicated and compressed. FAST is, in short, innovative technology that assures ultra-high performance when called for, but also optimize the total system for lowest cost.</p>
          <p>We are investing in technologies for data protection. Changing the backup paradigm from slow, unpredictable backup to tape to backup to disk with best-in-class data deduplication and compression technologies to offer customers speed of recovery, reliability of recovery, and low cost. We are investing in technologies that secure the data itself and access to the data while assuring stellar GRC metrics.</p>
          <p>A quick preview of things to come is later this year we will release the capability to encrypt data at rest on the array itself that's fully integrated with RSA's key management software that is both cost effective and has very high performance. And lastly, we are investing heavily in our customers to gain value from their information &#x2013; to help our customers gain value from their information. Greenplum, our most recent acquisition, provides organizations with real-time insight from vast amounts of data. Greenplum's unique massively paralleled scale-out architecture provides the ability to handle big data and delivers information intelligence in real time.</p>
          <p>We also continue to extend our Documentum software portfolio to help our customers better leverage information that is vital to their business. With our new Documentum xCP platform, we are enabling companies to move from traditional and complex enterprise content management applications to far more flexible case management applications. In short, xCP dramatically reduces the amount of custom code that is typically required, thus saving customers time and money.</p>
          <p>Another important piece of our cloud strategy is the deep partnership and alliances that we have built with other leading IT companies &#x2013; partners like Cisco, via our VCE coalition. And I am happy to report that under the leadership of Michael Capellas, VCE's reception by our customers has been nothing short of remarkable and Vblock sales are well ahead of plan. I'm also pleased to report that our partnership with Dell is back on track and is very strategic to both companies. Our Q2 mid-tier storage revenues were roughly flat year on year with Dell, and we fully expect to have year-on-year mid-tier growth with them in the second half. Our partnerships with system integrators such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS, and Deloitte and others continue to grow strategically and tactically.</p>
          <p>And lastly on a service provider front, we are building a number of very deep alliances, and we will be talking to you soon about our initiatives and plans here.</p>
          <p>In summary is EMC is executing very well in today's IT market. We have a strong product and technology portfolio, and the go-to-market prowess to create the opportunities that the next wave of IT cloud computing will offer. Thus I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long term.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&amp;A portion of today's call.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Alex Kurtz of Merriman &amp; Company, you may ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking the question. David, given the launch of all these new products in the mid-range, especially around Unisphere, could you just take us through the puts and takes on the gross margin impact, given that the profile of the mid-range business is very different probably going the next couple years than it was when it was just CLARiiON and Celerra as standalone products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Alex, what we've talked about is the fact that the software stack becomes more and more important in the mid-range, and as the software content of the mid-range platform increases, then that's a good thing for gross margins going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if you look at &#x2013; just as a follow-up &#x2013; VMAX seemed very strong in the quarter. Was that sort of the core driver for strength in gross margin within the core business, or were there some other drivers that we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, within the Storage business, we saw a nice sequential growth in gross margin. On the product side, we had some good mix impacts. If you look obviously sequentially actually, VMAX was relatively flat, but we did see good growth in data &#x2013; in the DD products and a couple other things that are driving higher margins. Obviously volume helped us with gross margins on the product side. And on the services side, we actually saw a nice pickup in our professional services margins due to higher utilization. And on the customer services side, our revenue increased, and we continued to keep our cost base relatively flat as we improved the efficiency of that business. So good improvements across the board sequentially in the core business in margins.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, congratulations on the quarter. My question's also on the margin, though more so on the operating margin side. If I look back historically, guys, for the second half relative to the first half of the year, it looks like ex 2009 you were able to drive about 200 to maybe even 300 basis points of operating margin expansion. Yesterday we saw VMware raise their operating margin target for the full year. You guys today talk about lowering or tempering your R&amp;D growth for the full year. So I'm curious of why 20 to 21% can't actually be moved higher here given those puts and takes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aaron, let me just handle that point you mentioned upon R&amp;D. It's a very minor change. Internally it's less than $15 million so it doesn't really move the needle on margins. We still have internal plans to hire up to the 20% level, but we're just not quite on track against that right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add a little color here. We have not cut back R&amp;D budgets. Our R&amp;D teams are still encouraged to find the best people, very high-quality people, and staff up. Obviously they're being very picky in who they hire, and they're hiring a little slower than actually I would like. But we are not cutting back R&amp;D budget. This is just kind of a reality. Go ahead, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So on that basis, that's a very small factor in the overall margin performance. I think what you've got to recognize is that 2010 is not really a normal year, and trying to apply normality to 2010, I think, is going to get us into a little bit of trouble. What I mean by that is clearly, we mentioned in Q1 we saw the impact of composite budget flush. Obviously we've done a little bit better than we expected in Q2. But I've talked to you about some factors in the second half that are going to impact those kind of normal year-on-year compares, and we've got some significant currency headwinds in the second half, which is going to obviously impact our top line. And most of the things that drive the margin improvement historically from a first half to second half are kind of volume related. So you've got to tie it back to that. We still feel comfortable in the 20 to 21% range. Obviously we'd like to come in towards the higher end of that. But we're not going to increase it at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. With regards to the second half outlook, due to some of the potential product transitions that might be occurring down the road in the mid-range, do you think it's likely that VMAX will actually outgrow the mid range and the unified products in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, VMAX because it's a new category &#x2013; and I keep referring to that traditionally, all high-end systems, which is still true today with the exception of VMAX, scale up. VMAX, we can now add what we call engines, which are servers, and have it just scale out. And when we do that, to add a server and put a whole tier of SATA drives or in the future even dedupe SATA drives there, it makes it very effective to consolidate a lot of mid-tier platforms. So some of our growth is coming out of the higher end of mid-tier as we consolidate mid-tier platforms. So while VMAX you can think of as a high-end platform, and it certainly is, it is definitely, definitely having impact on the mid-tier as we consolidate there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joe. And as a quick follow-up, I would assume that that would have a positive margin impact as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, as we've said many times, ironically, they're both good. I mean, if we grow mid-tier, we get good margins. If we grow the high end, we get good margins. So it's not &#x2013; they're not as substantially different as they were at one time years ago.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks a lot. Can you guys talk about velocity of business throughout the quarter and into next and what you think about second half seasonality given currency? I guess it's about 150 million of a currency hit you guys are talking about for the second half that you absorb, so what does that do to seasonality that you expect as we go into the third and fourth quarter and how you exited the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ben, you've got the math right on the currency impact. From where we thought we were back in April, obviously on an absolute basis year on year, the currency impact's bigger than that. But compared to where we thought we were back in April, the currency change is about $150 million because we thought for the full year we'd be roughly flat back then. So that is a factor.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, in Q2, we were back to our regularly normal seasonality. We mentioned that we saw some earlier seasonality in Q1 because of some kind of spillover, but I think what we saw in Q2 was a more normal demand environment. I mean, I think we really put our overachievement down to the fact that people just had a better appetite for our products and services because they were just satisfying customers' pain points well. So I think those are kind of the key factors. I think one of the biggest differences, as you mentioned before, from where we were in April was that currency headwind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then heading into the back half, what &#x2013; do you think that you have enough momentum with the new product that's coming and new software and the VMAX and whatnot to have normal seasonality in the back half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that if you just look at &#x2013; kind of at our guidance, we came out of the first half obviously better than expected. When we look ahead, we're very confident about what we're seeing in the second half in terms of customer acceptance for our products and services. And in fact, we've raised our guidance. We've said that we're going to beat what we talked about in April. So we're more confident now than we were in April, especially when you normalize for some of the headwinds.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on the federal government vertical. There were some big initiatives there to move IT out into the cloud. And that seems like it should be right in your wheelhouse. Can you tell us what you're seeing there? You said there was some weakness. What's the dynamic and visibility in the federal government?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's &#x2013; unfortunately, Mark, it's both. If you talk to the powers that be in IT in federal government, they are very sold on the cloud. And I truly believe they realize the capability that the collective we, EMC/VMware, bring to the party, and that's goodness. On the other side, you also saw that they've kind of tried to put a bit of a freeze on IT spending, so we saw a little bit of weakness in Q2 in, as David said, governments around the world as they try to kind of reign in their spending a bit.</p>
          <p>So we kind of have one good one from column A and one kind of negative trend from column B, and I actually think they're both true. So I do think the government will make a massive play. That's a much more efficient way and a much more flexible way to do IT, into the cloud, and we'll benefit from that. And on the other side as the government cuts back on its day-to-day spending, you get hurt by that side. So...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You know, if I was guessing &#x2013; and it is a guess right now because we'll see how Q3 unfolds &#x2013; but obviously I'd probably, Q3 &#x2013; even though it's the government's fiscal end and it's usually strong, I think it'll be a little softer than normal. You'll see some uptick obviously from Q2, but probably not as big as normal.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and congrats and good numbers. Can you give us some more color on the mid-tier? You mentioned 33% year-over-year growth, but if you take out the backup and recovery, Avamar and Data Domain, what was the growth of the other businesses, CLARiiON specifically and Celerra?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to break out the individual product lines, but let me tell you if you added in the revenues from Data Domain a year ago, the growth actually increased a little bit from Q1. Remember we said that apples-to-apples growth in Q1 was 20%. The comparable apples-to-apples growth in Q2 was 21%. So then of course within that as we mentioned we've got different transitions going on within the products. It doesn't make sense to break out numbers for the individual products themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up with that, in your discussions with your customers given that there's this expectation of a new platform, are you seeing any customers delaying or sitting on the sidelines and waiting for the new platform to come along? Any purchasing decisions delayed because of this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me say two things. I mean, the number that David gave you, that little bit over 21% growth year on year, is the way to look at it, because you really &#x2013; as David said, our sales force is good and has a lot of sway with customers. And for sure we would have sold some more of our own devices, like CLARiiON Disk Libraries, which now we're forcing and incenting our sales force to shift to, say, a Data Domain product. So the best way to look at this, apples to apples is assuming we owned Data Domain a year ago &#x2013; and we obviously do own them today &#x2013; that difference in growth, all in mid-tier, right, which is meeting the product only, is over 21%. So it's very solid growth, and it's real growth.</p>
          <p>The second question you're asking is you want more color, I think, on what our plans are for our mid-tier refresh. We had started, and we worked incredibly successfully with &#x2013; when we announced &#x2013; before we announced VPLEX. What we did is put out a big piece of the software to bake it into our then DMX-4 line, so that you're not announcing all new software and all new hardware at the same time. We basically like that model so much, and customers adopted it so much, we're doing the same thing now.</p>
          <p>So what you just saw and David took you through, FASTCache, flash, Unisphere, several others, and there's a pretty good laundry list of products, that is the new operating system that will be on the refreshed hardware products. We told you &#x2013; David just told you that our new low end, right, our new low end will be introduced in Q1. All right? We also told you that the fastest-growing piece of mid-tier by far is &#x2013; and I mean by far &#x2013; is the low end. So we are very optimistic about this new low end and that &#x2013; the impact it's going to have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the last piece you want to know is when are we going to introduce the high end of the mid-tier. I got to have some surprises in life, so I'm not going to give you that one. But again, software first. We told you when we're going to do the low end, and I like our position in the mid-tier, and I think it's going to continue to get stronger and stronger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. I had just one quick one and then a follow-up. Dave, last quarter you were willing to give us actually a point number for the mid-range revenue. I was wondering if you'd be willing to give that number again this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, I told you it was up 12%, so you can figure it out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. And then I wanted to follow up on an earlier question regarding operating margins. I think you can make a &#x2013; I know that you said you're not ready to take up your operating margin guidance from the 20 to 21 level for the current year, but it does seem like you can make a pretty compelling case for a continued rise in information storage margins thanks to increasing software mix and hardware cost improvements over time. And I'm just wondering if philosophically that's the right way to think about things longer term, or whether you will choose to actively manage long-term operating margins to the 20 to 21% level and invest most of that back into top-line growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, I think I've kind of given you a couple of key hints on that, but let me make it clearer. I mean, first of all, we should be very pleased that we have operating margins to where we are today. For a long period of time, we've been striving to get operating margins north of 20. We are there today, and I think that's excellent progress, and obviously results is a result of what we've done in terms of mix and cost management and a whole bunch of good things across the business.</p>
          <p>Also I've talked to you about our triple play where we wanted to have a balance between gaining market share, investing for the future, and improving profitability. And we said that over the long term, we will be focused on being able to deliver all three of those. There will be some balance between any one over a period of time, but over time we plan to deliver all three. So we do have an eye upon expanding operating margins over time, but also we talked about a significant investment in cloud software, repositioning so we can position ourselves throughout the public and private clouds, so we'll have a balance between all three.</p>
          <p>We've committed also that over the next few years we'll give you at least double-digit revenue and double-digit earns growth. So I think we've given you a number of indicators to say that we are focused upon all three. We're certainly not going backwards, and we will over time be able to expand our operating margins as well. It's really a balance, and we'll play that balance carefully, and we'll communicate to you where we are at any point in time in that balance.</p>

Right, so there are some other things in there including things like SAN switches, some resale product through our Select line &#x2013; there are other things in the total storage product. We gave you the kind of two major parts of it.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the mid-tier product revenues is up 33%. Is it apples to apples? That means does it include Data Domain as if you had Data Domain in Q2?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Apples-to-apples growth in mid-tier is 21%, as we mentioned a little bit before. 33% is the reported revenue growth. Now, as we said, the real way to kind of judge our performance and how we're doing in the mid-tier is the 21%, which again we think is good given our position in the high end of the mid-tier, but also I think our sequential improvements in the mid-tier of 12% quarter on quarter is also a good indicator.</p>

Again, just to net it out in the mid-tier, we're kind of killing it in the higher end, because you've got to also add not only the 21 but part of that reason that VMAX grew 32 is we're consolidating mid-tier there, too. So if you put that together, you can say, wow, you're doing really well in mid-tier in the higher ends. And we really don't have a big play yet in the lower ends, which we know are growing faster. So that's the comment, and we gave you the date for that, which is early Q1.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. Can you talk a little bit about your longer-term enterprise data warehousing strategy, which can be a meaningful adjacent market? It seems like an obvious extension to your current strategy, but I'm curious why you chose to not go after a more established bearer like a Teradata and a Tesa and enter the market with some scale as opposed to what could take some time with Greenplum to capture a meaningful part of the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll do more of this as it goes out. But let me give you the short piece of our thinking. Traditionally the data warehouse market looks at last month's, last week's kind of data. And more and more, customers want to look at real-time data that's in their &#x2013; coming out of their systems right now. And obviously when you get to cloud kind of scale, what do you want to do, take the &#x2013; if you work hard to put data into the cloud, you don't want to put data out of the cloud, specialize it to do analytics on, right? So basically the Greenplum technology works exceedingly well, better than anything else we saw in the market in that kind of environment.</p>
          <p>So when you're talking about real time, when you're talking about big data, when you're talking about cloud scale data, we think the attributes of Greenplum and the way it also works in the virtualized environment is phenomenal. So we went after what we thought was the best technology, and we got plenty of go-to-market prowess around it. And as you said, Wamsi, it's a close affinity to what we do. So we're quite pleased as this plays out for our future strategy.</p>

          <p>Lou Miscioscia of Collins Stewart, you may ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Could we go back to the macro for a second? I guess we can look at this two different ways. One, last night on VMware's call they did express a lot of concern about Europe. And then second, Joe, when you're talking to C-level executives, what are they telling you about their desire to continue to spend on IT given the concern about the macro economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, right now, as I said in my remarks, the biggest thing that executives are interested in is driving their productivity, okay, which you could say on the other side hurts a little bit in terms of the unemployment that's out there. But everybody right now, companies say, "Look, I've got to get &#x2013; it's a uncertain world. I got to get differentiation out there, and I want to drive my productivity." And they know that probably the only way to do that is to invest in technology. And I think that's one of the things that's benefiting IT as a whole right now. And as I said on the other side, the other big macro trend that I mentioned is at the board level, the focus on risk management and compliance is phenomenal. So those &#x2013; as a macro side, those are two things that we see out there, and almost you see that globally. Certainly you see it in the United States and Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if you'd just sync up the comments last night where VMware did seem much more cautious on Europe than maybe your comments, and maybe just clarify your views on Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to flesh it out a little more, we still think Europe will have moderate growth, as I said, with the exception of Southern Europe, where I did say we are seeing a definite downturn in their spending.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. Just to follow up on the last question, IBM had noted some deal push-outs, large deal push-outs, in the services business. Did you see any deal slippage at the end of your quarter? And just qualitatively, how would you characterize backlog or the pipeline of deals going into 3Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Katy, you always see some deal push-out. Was it material or abnormal in our case? The answer is no. And right now so far, Q2, Q3, the customers &#x2013; I haven't seen a huge change -what are we, 20 days, whatever it is, into &#x2013; I don't even know what date it is &#x2013; but into Q3, I haven't seen a marked change in customer attitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. We've got time for one more question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein, you may ask your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Joe, you talked about your longer-term target to grow revenue double digits and EPS double digits. How are you thinking about acquisition in that target set? And maybe &#x2013; I see the chart of the last seven or eight years, 12% revenue growth. Have you rerun that for what your organic growth rate is? And if you think about your assumptions going forward, how are you thinking about acquisitions? Historically you've maybe done a larger acquisition, billion dollar plus, every couple of years. Is that the kind of framework we should be thinking about, sort of a larger acquisition every couple years, and then smaller ones like Greenplum potentially more frequently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes, but let me just kind of qualify that. I would argue that &#x2013; I've always said I favor a string of pearls as opposed to a massive acquisition. And I think from a revenue standpoint, the highest &#x2013; biggest company we bought had $400 million in revenue or something thereabouts. So when you talk on a base of 16.5 billion plus, certainly that's not &#x2013; I don't call that big. Okay? But obviously in dollar value, I would say you're correct. That would be a trend that you should think we're going to continue. It's worked really well, and it's what I like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess that's the last question. So in closing, we believe we are executing well today. Our strategy for the private and public cloud is right on. We have a product roadmap that is well aimed and downright exciting. We have the go-to-market capability and the alliance partners necessary to bring our innovative products to market, and most importantly, we have 45,000-plus great people who believe in our vision and our future.</p>
          <p>So I thank you for joining us, and we'll be talking to you. And I hope to see you all soon. Thank you.</p>
