          <p>Thank you, Blair.  During the opening comments to the conference call, I will focus on what I view to be the key takeaways for Q1 fiscal year 2009; an update on why we continue to be comfortable with our long-term growth goals of 12 to 17%, assuming that the global economy returns to normal growth rates; a very candid discussion about what we are seeing in the markets on a global basis relative to Q1 and its effect on our Q2 expectations; and then finally our revenue guidance for Q2 with the appropriate caveats.</p>
          <p>Frank will follow these opening comments with additional detail on Q1 fiscal year 2009.  The third section of the call will focus on business momentum and strategy from a geographic, product, and customer segment perspective.  Frank will then follow with additional financial parameters around our guidance.  I will then wrap it up with some comments in terms of Cisco's momentum going into Q2, and finally our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Q1 FY 2009 was a solid quarter for Cisco from a revenue and an earnings per share perspective, especially given the many challenges that we are all seeing occur in the global marketplace.  In terms of those areas that we can control or influence, we continue to feel very comfortable with both our progress in the quarter and our long-term vision and differentiated strategy as we move into new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>We exited Q1 with an extremely strong position in the marketplace; approximately 27 billion in cash and investments; solid balance from a product, geographic, and customer segment perspective, perhaps one of the broadest balances across the IT industry; continued success in being the number one or number two player in most of our 20-plus targeted product areas; an innovation engine that results in product leadership across the broadest range of products that we've had in our history combined with a product pipeline of new innovations that we believe is also the strongest we have ever had.</p>
          <p>Not only is our end to end technology architecture from the device to the data center across any combination of networks enabling the next generation of entertainment and business models, but we have had what we believe to be the strongest position in terms of customer relationships at the enterprise and service provider level and helping to enable our customers' business goals.</p>
          <p>Just we led in the first phase of the Internet, IE Web 1.0, from both the internal utilization and the expertise we offer our customers to enable this capability, we believe we are now uniquely positioned to provide very similar leadership in the second phase of the Internet through collaboration enabled by network Web 2.0 technologies. Once again we are leading in our terms of our own utilization and partnering with our customers to drive their goal of changing business models enabled by the network.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the summary of our Q1 financials, we were pleased with the following results.  Revenue was 10.3 billion, approximately an 8% year-over-year increase.  Cash generated from operations was 2.7 billion.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.42, a 5% year-over-year increase, and GAAP earnings per share were $0.37, a 6% year-over-year increase.  Total non-GAAP gross margins were very solid at 65.6, an increase from 64.9% last quarter.  Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for Q1 were 35.8%.</p>
          <p>We continue to drive innovation and product leadership from our core, advanced, and emerging technologies.  The following is a summary of each of those areas for Q1 in terms of year-over-year product revenue growth.  Core technologies and services were solid with switching growing at 8% year over year, routing growing at 1%, and service revenues growing at 10% year over year.  Our first wave of Advanced Technologies grew 15% year over year. Unified Communications within that group grew at 22%.  Wireless grew at 21%. Security grew at 19%, but Network Home decreased 2%, and Storage decreased 4%. Our second phase of Advanced Technologies had a very strong quarter with revenue growth year over year up 22%.  Application Networking Services grew 25% and Video Systems grew 21%.</p>
          <p>Our early stage internal startups that we call Emerging Technologies were also solid in Q1 in terms of year-over-year order growth.  Our strategy is to develop a reasonable percentage of these emerging technologies into what we categorize as advanced technologies with the realistic probability of becoming 1 billion plus in sales and the number one market position in their respective product categories. Overall progress was again very strong in this quarter.  While these numbers are not material financially at this point in time, we believe that with proper execution, they can become very significant to our long-term growth rate in the longer run.</p>
          <p>The Emerging Technology group orders in total grew approximately 180% year over year. We had strong year-over-year order growth from the mid teens to the low 30s in the following countries: China, Canada, Japan, Russia, while we found some of our largest countries such as the US, UK, and Italy with negative order growth year over year in Q1. We'll provide additional details on geographies and customer segments later in the conference call.</p>
          <p>In summary, for those areas that we can control and influence, we feel we are doing reasonably well. The key market transitions relative to collaboration and digital networking, which will drive productivity for the next decade, are evolving even faster than we thought one quarter ago. However, all of us are seeing the same financial and global economic challenges that have occurred over this last quarter, especially in the month of October. At this point in time, I would like to share with you some of the detail about how we will approach the current challenges and our underlying assumptions regarding our short-term strategy while taking these challenges into consideration.</p>
          <p>First, we start with a culture and track record of using economic challenges to gain market share and profit share and move into new market adjacencies. Our long-term growth goals, assuming reasonable global balance and GDP growth, have not changed and will remain in the 12 to 17% range. Third, it was one year ago when Cisco was among the first to indicate we were seeing some challenges in orders from our US financial and global accounts.</p>
          <p>We do believe that these challenges we have seen in the US have expanded to Europe as well as many of the emerging market countries and finally into Asia. But if there is one lesson learned during the preceding economic challenges that Cisco faced in 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2003 is the importance of taking action early while not losing track of long-term objectives. We also want to use this call, as we've done in the past, to share some very &#x2013; to share very transparently what we are seeing in terms of order momentum and feedback from our customers with the appropriate caveat that we could be wrong in our assumptions and strategies.</p>
          <p>Our approach to all of the economic slowdowns that have occurred over the last two decades has remained very similar. We will follow this approach in dealing with the current challenges. When we see these market transitions occurring, we go through our playbook, if you will, for economic downturns, where there are four basic guidelines that we follow. The first is to determine is it the macro environment or your strategy. Candidly determine if the slowing of your business is due to primarily to market forces and that your strategy is working well, or was the challenge largely self-inflicted.  If your strategy was working well, stay focused on its implementation.</p>
          <p>Second, length and depth of the downturn; determine the magnitude of the slowdown and your best estimate on the length and the depth of the slowdown, then adjust and realign your asset utilization appropriately.</p>
          <p>Third, prepare for the upturn. Start preparing as soon as possible for the upturn and how you are going to gain share and differentiate yourself from your peers as it relates to profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Fourth, expand customer relationships. Use the slowdown to take advantage of building even stronger relationships and differentiation with your customers.</p>
          <p>Just as we've done in prior challenges, we will also implement our game plan or action plan if you will for dealing with these challenges while following our playbook with the four basic guidelines outlined above. The game plan for the current downturn will have six major points and will be called our six-point plan.</p>
          <p>Point one of the plan is our vision strategy and execution model and is the fabric for implementation success. First, we believe our vision of how the industry will evolve is being driven by the increasing role intelligent networks will play as all forms of communication and IT are enabled by the network.  This transition is occurring as we expected. Our differentiated strategy enabled by the network collaboration is allowing us to move into market adjacencies with tremendous speed, scale, and flexibility. Cisco will remain focused on both the technology and business architectures to enable our customers' objectives. In short, our vision, strategy, and execution approach is working well and we plan to stay focused on continuing to expand this approach.</p>
          <p>Second, collaboration Web 2.0 driving the future growth and productivity; we will continue our rapid expansion of collaborative technologies and new business models in both our product architectures and our own internal IT implementation. We plan to quickly realign resources to focus on over 2,000 market adjacencies that will loosely, then tightly come together with our core technologies.  And we will be the best example of using Web 2.0 technologies such as TelePresence, WebEx, wikis, blogs, discussion forums, C-Vision, widgets, et cetera, in an architectural process driven approach that drives productivity and new business models.</p>
          <p>Third, resource management and realignment; through our councils and board structures, we have already realigned over 500 million of resources to these opportunities. Beginning in Q2, our goal is to realign another 500 million of resources while at the same time reducing our expenses for fiscal year '09 by over 1 billion from our original budget. Our goal is to achieve these changes by the end of Q4 fiscal year 2009. This includes a pause in hiring as well as reductions in travel, offsites, outside services, equipment, events, prototypes, marketing, and other activities.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we intend to be aggressive on our strategy, prioritize and then execute. We will also be bold in taking good business risks during this downturn to build our market transition opportunities and put our many assets to use in existing and new markets as the recovery occurs. We will prioritize the top five objectives of both the company and then each of our councils and boards. The top five objectives for the company are: next generation company and next generation customer relationships, what we call Cisco 3.0 &#x2013; and Rob, you're leading for us; second, collaboration/Web 2.0; third, data center virtualization; fourth, video; and fifth, globalization.  We will then align our resources to these top priorities both as a company and within each of the councils and boards.</p>
          <p>Fifth, investment in the US and selected emerging countries; we intend to invest aggressively in two geographic areas, the US and selected emerging countries. In our opinion, the US will be first major country to recover.  Therefore, we will make many of our market adjacency investments in the US.  On the other hand, we believe countries like China and India are the best positioned among the emerging country peers to minimize the effect of global challenges on their own economies.  We are also optimistic that we will continue to see strong support by many governments around the world to minimize the effect of these major changes.</p>
          <p>Also built into our assumption is the view that many companies will use network technology for innovation, productivity, speed, and scale both during the downturn and positioning for the upturn.  The strategy in our emerging countries is simple. Over time, we expect the majority of the world's GDP will come to these emerging countries. In expanding these relationships during tough times, our goal is to be uniquely positioned as the market turnaround occurs.  This is identical to what we did in the Asia 1997 financial crisis.</p>
          <p>And sixth, the power of the network as a platform driving the future of commutations in IT; finally, we will remain focused on our stretch goal of evolving into the top communications and IT company, which will be enabled by the expanding role of intelligent networks.  This could be the definition of a very successful implantation of our six-point plan looking three to four years out after the inevitable upturn occurs.</p>
          <p>Now at this time, I would like to give you some additional data and customer feedback for you to understand why we are moving rapidly to realign our cost structure after a solid Q1 fiscal 2009.  There were number of positives in the quarter such as our financial results, balanced product revenue growth, advanced technology growth, and solid momentum from some of our developed and emerging geographies such as Latin America, China, Germany, Japan, Canada, and Russia.  There were, however, even more challenges from an order perspective as well as global customer feedback on the health of their businesses, especially in the US and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Over 70% of our business comes from the US and Western Europe today.  Both experienced negative year-over-year order growth in Q1.  We are seeing customers not just in the financial, automotive, or retail sectors, but across most of our enterprise industries facing what they view as a very challenging business environment. This started in the US.  It then in our opinion expanded to Europe, then to the emerging market theater, and now to Asia.</p>
          <p>Total year-over-year product order growth varied dramatically during the quarter from August to October.  In August, our order growth increased by 7% year over year; while in October, our order growth decreased by 9% year over year.  Overall for Q1, year-over-year product order growth decreased by 3%.  While revenue growth in Q1 was a solid 8%, book-to-bill was below one.</p>
          <p>In summary, we were one of the first high-tech companies to report our quarter that included October.  These challenges that we saw in the US did spread globally in our opinion.  The environment has changed dramatically in the last two months with the financial crisis in September and the economic crisis becoming more apparent on a global basis in October.</p>
          <p>Cisco is uniquely compared to many of our peers in that approximately 84% of our business is non-recurring each quarter, and therefore is a good indicator of new spending patterns.  Also, our balance across all major geographic areas, four major customer segments, and over two dozen product families normally works to our advantage.  But when you are the number one player in many of these categories and the slowdown has truly gone global across all these industry segments, geographies, and product families, we will be impacted.</p>
          <p>It' is very difficult given all the uncertainties going on in the market to provide a forecast given the dramatic variability, and it is probably the second most difficult time in my career in terms of my comfort level with the forecast.  It would not be a major surprise to see these numbers vary on either the positive or negative side of revenue guidance that we provided for Q2.</p>
          <p>In providing our revenue guidance for Q2 fiscal year '09, we are going to assume that what we saw in October in terms of order momentum challenges will continue into the next quarter.  This is also what we are hearing from our global customers as our field rolls up their forecast for Q2.</p>
          <p>As we have said in conference calls over many years, Cisco will always be affected by major economic changes, capital spending patents, new and existing competitors, and our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other factors as discussed in our SEC reports.  For the purpose of our long range goals as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also assuming that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate and we will effectively execute on that vision.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, our revenue guidance for Q2 fiscal year 2009 including our usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports is for revenue to decrease in the 5 to 10% range year over year.  Again as a reminder, during each of the past economic slowdowns, Cisco has always navigated through them very effectively.  We did this in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, and in each scenario we gained both wallet share in my opinion profit share.  As a result, we were better positioned coming out of these transitions versus our peers.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to be aggressive in our investment during this slowdown.  Cisco will use this time as an opportunity to expand our share of our customer spend, and we will be aggressive about moving into market adjacencies during the slowdown.</p>
          <p>As we approach both the opportunities and challenges in front of us, we bring a very experienced and broad leadership team that has been through these challenges together over the last decade.  We also bring our culture that adjusts very quickly to change and has consistently continued to execute effectively regardless of opportunities or challenges, and as we have done before, leveraging market slowdowns to move into many new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>While we all wish these challenges would not occur, it is during these times that we have consistently gained the confidence of our customers, partners, shareholders, and employees to be even stronger versus our peers following these challenges.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe that we are very well positioned in the industry from a vision, differentiated strategy, and an execution perspective.  We believe we are entering the next phase of the Internet as growth and productivity will center on collaboration enabled by network Web 2.0 technologies.  We will do our best to provide the product architectures and the expertise to help our customers in the implementation of these collaborative capabilities from a technology and a business perspective.</p>
          <p>We will also share with our customers how we've done this internally.  In short, we are going to attempt to execute a strategy over the next decade that is similar to what we did in the early '90s.  And as we've said before, it powered our growth for the next decade, except with the obvious differences of being a company that is now at a run rate of approximately 40 billion, with over 67,000 employees focused on our opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn it over to you, Frank.</p>

          <p>As John stated earlier, Cisco has a strong history of successfully navigating market transitions and I remain confident that our financial model enables us to execute in both good and tough environments.  For today's call, I will provide a recap of our solid financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, and then I'll discuss why I believe our financial strength positions us well to manage during the uncertain economic environment we saw, especially in the second half of this quarter, but also more importantly going forward.</p>
          <p>Total revenue for the first quarter was $10.3 billion, an increase of approximately 8% year over year, in line with our guidance.  Switching revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 8% year over year, driven by growth in both our modular and our fixed switching portfolio.  Routing revenue was $1.9 billion, up 1% year over year.  Advanced Technologies revenue totaled $2.7 billion, representing an increase of 17% year over year, with strong performance in Unified Communications of 22% year-over-year growth, Video Systems growth of approximately 21% year over year, Security with growth of approximately 19%, Wireless LAN growth of approximately 21%, and Application Networking Services growth of approximately 25%.</p>
          <p>Other product revenue totaled $442 million, a decrease of 13% year over year related to our optical and cable business this quarter.</p>
          <p>Total service revenue was $1.7 billion, up 10% year over year with solid growth in emerging markets.  We are pleased with our growth in advanced services of approximately 15%.</p>
          <p>Total revenue growth by geography ranged from 1% year over year in the US and Canada to a high of 41% in emerging markets.  Emerging markets revenue growth for the quarter was higher than the order growth rate that John reported due to some increased shipments, recognition of previously deferred revenue, and the effect of our reserves from Q1 of fiscal year '08.  We want to remind you that revenue growth in emerging markets may experience variability and order growth may provide a better indication of future revenue performance.</p>
          <p>Q1 total non-GAAP gross margin was 65.6%, up 0.7 point quarter over quarter and up 0.4 point year over year.  For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 66.2%, up a percentage point quarter over quarter and up 0.6 point year over year.  The quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by higher cost savings partially offset by product mix.  The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher cost savings partially offset by higher product discounts as well as mix.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP service margin for the first quarter with 62.4%, down from 63.1% last quarter and 63.5% in Q1 fiscal year '08.  Service margin will typically experience some variability over time due to various factors such as the change of the mix between our technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of support contract initiations as well as renewals. Total gross margin by geography ranged from 63.4% for emerging markets to 69% in Japan this quarter.  Across the geographies, the margins have remained relatively stable over the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately 35.8% in Q1 fiscal year '09, relatively consistent with the 35.7% we had in Q1 fiscal year '08.  Foreign exchange impact for the quarter was 46 million when compared to the same period last year, which added approximately 0.4 point to this ratio.  Excluding foreign exchange, our non-GAAP operating expenses for Q1 grew 7% year over year.</p>
          <p>Interest and other income was 123 million for Q1, which includes the recognition of realized gains, losses, as well as impairments.  We remain very pleased with our diversified, high quality cash and investment portfolio.  I will provide more detail on our investment portfolio in just a few moments.</p>
          <p>Our Q1 fiscal year '09 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%, down approximately two points from fiscal year '08.  This decline in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by the renewal of the US federal R&amp;D tax credit, which occurred last month, and a more favorable mix of foreign earnings at lower tax rates.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $2.5 billion, which was flat year over year.  As reminder, in Q1 fiscal year '08 we did record a one-time tax benefit of $162 million.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter were $0.42 per share, up from $0.40 per share in the first quarter fiscal year 2008, a 5% increase year over year and our highest earnings per share to date.  The one-time tax benefit in Q1 fiscal year '08 was approximately $0.03 per share.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $2.2 billion, flat compared to $2.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.  GAAP net earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter were $0.37 per share.  That was up from $0.35 per share in the same quarter of fiscal year 2008.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the balance sheet, the total of cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q1 was $26.8 billion, up $528 million from Q4 fiscal year '08.  During Q1, we generated $2.7 billion in cash flow from operations as well as $224 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of common stock or 46 million shares of our stock at an average price of $21.95 per share.  We ended the quarter with approximately $7.4 billion remaining in the current stock repurchase authorization.</p>
          <p>Moving on accounts receivables, we ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, which was down 14% from Q4 fiscal year 2008.  At the end of Q1, days sales outstanding or our DSO was 29 days compared to 34 days in Q4 fiscal year '08, driven by lower service billings due to seasonality as well as improved collections.</p>
          <p>Total inventory at the end of Q1 was $1.2 billion.  That was flat quarter over quarter.  Non-GAAP inventory turns were 11.6 this quarter, which was also flat from last quarter.  Our inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q1 were $2.9 billion, up 5% from the end of Q4 fiscal year '08.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue was $8.8 billion at the end of Q1, an increase of approximately 24% year over year.  Deferred product revenue was 2.9 billion, up approximately 18% from last year, while deferred service revenue was $6 billion, up approximately 28% year over year.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q1, our head count totaled 67,647, a net increase of approximately 1,518 from Q4 fiscal year '08, of which more than 50% were college hires, which we normally experience in Q1 each year.  Separate from our college hires, we added 722 to head count this quarter, which were mostly in engineering, sales, and services.  In mid-October, we did implement a pause in our external hiring, while we did assess the changing macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to discuss how we are managing Cisco's financial position in both good times and challenging times, and why we believe this gives us a competitive advantage and positions us to manage our business well and continue to lead in the future.  We do understand that during turbulent economic times like we are currently experiencing, our investors would like a solid understanding of key areas that we believe allow us to perform well.</p>
          <p>I would start by saying with nearly $27 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, a solid balance sheet, visibility into our supply chain, strong investment portfolio management, and our fiscal capital financing arm, all of which provide a key competitive advantage, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business through any type of market condition.  For example, take the key items that influenced our results this quarter.</p>
          <p>First, we continue to have very high quality receivables as evidenced by our DSO of 29 days.  We continue to conduct rigorous assessments of the quality of our receivables given the current market conditions and we remain comfortable with our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Second, our strong supply chain management continues to be a key lever in our ability to maintain strong gross margins, while at the same time providing visibility and management of our demand planning.  Over the last several years, we have significantly enhanced our supply chain capabilities to better anticipate and manage our demand.  Our Lean Manufacturing model allows us to more fully optimize our supply chain inventory investment.</p>
          <p>We have enhanced processes and systems to provide increased visibility into inventory management and better responsiveness to fluctuations in demand.  Over time, this has resulted in better lead times, on-time shipment predictability, and improved inventory management across our supply chain.  While there is always inherent risk given the current economic environment, we have enhanced the monitoring of our supply base to identify potential issues so that we can take appropriate measures on a timely basis. Key metrics such as inventory turns, purchase commitments, and ongoing review of excess and obsolete inventory remain strong and again contribute to Cisco's consistent gross margin performance.</p>
          <p>Third, our investment strategy has served as well in this turbulent environment.  The overall credit quality of our portfolio is extremely strong with our cash and fixed income portfolio invested in securities with an average credit rating of AA or better.  In light of more challenging market conditions over the last six months, we have more conservatively managed our $27 billion diversified portfolio.  This has resulted in slightly less than a 1% mark-to-market impact on our cash and fixed income portfolio valuation when compared to last quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, our financing arm or Cisco Capital continues to provide financing to our customers and our channel partners, which enables incremental sales of Cisco's products, services, and networking solutions.  In fiscal year '08, Cisco Capital originated or facilitated approximately $4.3 billion in lease and longer term loan arrangements.  While the number of credit requests or inquiries has increased in the current environment, we have adhered to our consistent methodology and prudent financing practices.  Our thorough review process for monitoring a variety of risk metrics has enabled us to effectively balance risk, reward, as well as sales enablement. We believe there has been no material impact to the quality of our portfolio.   Broadly speaking, we believe our portfolio has on average an investment grade profile.  We remain comfortable with the credit profile and the way we are deploying our capital.</p>
          <p>With respect to our accounting policies, we remain conservative in how we account for our Cisco Capital financing business.  Specifically, this comprises gross lease receivables, loan receivables, finance service contracts, and financing guarantees.</p>
          <p>To update the numbers previously disclosed, at Q1 fiscal year '09 we have a combined balance sheet and contingent liability position of approximately $4.4 billion.  Of this $4.4 billion, we have a net reserve and deferred revenue position of $2.5 billion.  This represents an overall reserve and revenue deferral position of over 50% of the financing portfolio position. Again, I would like to remind you that we believe this portfolio maintains an average or around investment grade.</p>
          <p>We believe that Cisco Capital's on-book lease and loan portfolio remains an excellent use of our own cash.  We have not accessed any capital markets for funds to finance this element of our operations.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we have long stated that our financial management and position are a competitive advantage for Cisco and that belief has not changed even in light of the current economic conditions.  In fact, it is precisely during a difficult environment like we are currently experiencing that the strong financial foundation that we have allows us to focus on the things that we believe will grow our company and capture market transitions in the industry.</p>
          <p>I do believe our performance this quarter reflects our ability to manage profitability during a period of uncertainty, and I expect that through continued prudent expense management along with calculated investments in certain areas, we will be able to balance the priorities of growth and profitability as we move through the current environment.</p>
          <p>Through our unwavering focus on customers, a strong financial foundation, and the power of a very talented global workforce, I believe Cisco will emerge stronger coming out of this period and enhance its position as a global business leader.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back over to John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank.  In this section of the call, we will cover our geographies, customer segments, and products for Q1 in more detail.  The products review will be in revenue growth terms while the geographic and customer segments will be discussed in terms of orders unless indicated otherwise.</p>
          <p>First from a geographic and a customer segment point of view in terms of Q1 year over year order growth, Japan; Japan continued their solid momentum in Q1 with growth of approximately 20%.  Leading the way was service provider with growth of approximately 45% year over year, which represents approximately half of our total business in Japan.  Public Sector grew in the mid-teens.  Enterprise and Commercial were relatively flat.  Overall given all the challenges, we feel good about our momentum in the Japanese market.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to Asia-Pacific; year-over-year order growth in Asia-Pacific in Q1 varied dramatically by country.  China grew in the mid-teens while India was down in the mid-single digits.  From a customer segment perspective, Service Provider and Commercial market grew in mid-single digits, while enterprise was down in the high teens.  Asia in total was down approximately 4% year over year in terms of orders.</p>
          <p>Europe, after maintaining growth in our Q4 of fiscal year 2008 in the low double digits, we saw Europe's growth slow to negative mid-single digits in Q1.  Germany continued to do reasonably well, while the UK, Italy, Netherlands, and Spain were challenged, all with double digit decreases in orders year over year.  From a customer segment perspective, Commercial and the Consumer were relatively flat in Europe.  Public Sector grew in the mid-single digits.  Enterprise was down in the mid-single digits, while Service Provider was down in the mid-teens year over year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the US excluding Canada, for the US, orders in Q1 were down approximately 8% year over year.  From a customer segment perspective, Enterprise growth not including Public Sector was down in the high teens.  Commercial, Service Provider, and Public Sector were down in the mid-single digits in Q1 year over year.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets, the emerging market theater not including our emerging Asian countries were down slightly in terms of orders. Enterprise in the emerging markets was down in the high single digits.  While the Commercial grew in the mid-single digits, Service Provider was down slightly Q1 year over year.</p>
          <p>In summary, from a customer segment perspective, Enterprise year-over-year order growth across all Cisco was down approximately 11% while the Service Provider, Commercial, and Public Sector were approximately flat from a year-over-year orders perspective.</p>
          <p>Products, Q1 year-over-year product revenue growth was up approximately 8%.  The detail of our individual product areas was covered in the opening section of our call.</p>
          <p>In summary, although we all would like to avoid the downturns, our vision of how the industry is going to evolve appears to be playing out very much as we expected.  We believe our differentiated strategy is also achieving the benefits both for Cisco and our customers that we thought were possible.</p>
          <p>And finally, our execution is on target in terms of the results as measured by our customer partnership perspective, market share, and share of our customers' total communications and IT expenditures as the network becomes the platform for delivering these capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn it back over to Frank for additional detail of the financial guidance and other financial highlights. Frank, back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John.  Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements.  You should review of our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP.  It is very difficult to provide a forecast given the dramatic variability and the uncertainties going on in the market.  These events increase the potential that our actual results could vary materially from our expectations.  To reiterate John's earlier note, our revenue guidance for Q2 makes the prudent assumption that the order momentum challenges that we saw in October will continue into Q2.  Therefore, we anticipate total revenue for the second quarter to be down approximately 5 to 10% year over year.  At this point, let me remind you that in light or Regulation FD, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you additional details on the Q2 financial guidance.  As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margins has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, variable component cost, customer and channel mix, as well as competitive pricing pressures.  That being said, we believe that total gross margins in Q2 will be approximately 64%, reflecting the revenue guidance I just shared with you.</p>
          <p>We believe Q2 operating expenses will be approximately 39 to 41% of revenue.  As you would expect in this environment and as John outlined earlier, we are focused on managing our expenses through a pause in hiring, further decreasing travel and discretionary related expenses, as well as deferring certain capital related projects.  Also as John mentioned, our goal is to reduce our expenses for fiscal year '09 by over $1 billion from our original budget.  Considering the expense control actions I previously mentioned, this means we are targeting our Q4, fiscal year '09 quarterly expense run rate to be reduced by about 200 million to $300 million as compared to our Q1 fiscal year '09 quarterly expense run rate.</p>
          <p>While we will undertake appropriate expense management initiatives in the current environment, we will also make some calculated investments into areas where we believe we can accelerate development and Cisco's leadership.  We expect the areas will be adjacencies to our current market where we feel it is possible to extend the network as a platform such as next generation company, globalization, virtualization of the data center, video, and collaboration architecture.</p>
          <p>We expect interest and other income to be approximately $130 million in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our tax provision rate for Q2 is expected to be approximately 22%.</p>
          <p>While we expect to continue our share repurchase program, it is difficult to predict the exact weighted average shares outstanding.  We are modeling share count to be down 50 to 100 million in weighted average shares outstanding for EPS purposes. In this estimate of share count, we are not taking in to consideration any further change in stock price that could occur in the second half of fiscal year '09.  As a point of reference, a $1 movement in our average stock price would change the calculated shares outstanding for purposes of determining EPS by approximately 10 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash flow from operations, we would expect to generate 500 million to $700 million per month.</p>
          <p>For our Q2 fiscal year '09 GAAP earnings, we anticipate that Q2 GAAP EPS will be $0.05 per share to $0.08 per share lower than non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to acquisition related charges and stock compensation expense. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.</p>
          <p>Other than those items noted above, there were no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance.  This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.</p>
          <p>Again, I'll turn the call back over to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thank you very much.  I'd like to make some summary comment at this point of my view of Cisco's momentum and opportunities entering Q2 of fiscal year 2009.  In areas that Cisco can control or influence, our momentum continues to be solid in the areas of product leadership, innovation, and thought leadership.</p>
          <p>Balance in a very tough environment given the global challenges continues to be reasonable across our geographies, products, services, and customer segments.  This balance normally works to our advantage when there is a slowdown in a product area, a customer segment, or one or two geographies.  However, when you are often the number one player across these categories and the challenges truly go global across all of these categories, it is almost impossible to avoid the impact.</p>
          <p>As we said before, even if the market slows, we don't see this changing our long-term growth targets if we execute the way we have in prior slowdowns and assuming that the global economy recovers to GDP growth rates similar to those in the middle of the decade.  As we continue into Q2 fiscal year 2009, we plan to aggressively invest in new and adjacent markets for the longer term assuming global recovery, regardless of how long it takes for the macro environment to rebound.  We would not invest as aggressively if we were to determine this current slowdown was going to be long in duration, and that we didn't have a high probability of achieving our 12 to 17% long-term growth objective and normal economic environments as the market recovers.</p>
          <p>In terms of major areas where the momentum appears to be solid and even possibly gaining would be the following areas.  First, innovation and product leadership look very solid across our core technologies, first and second wave of Advanced Technologies, and our new emerging technologies; second, collaboration and network-enabled Web 2.0 acceptance and Cisco's leadership role; third, speed, skill, and flexibility as we move into new market adjacencies based upon our collaboration, teamwork approach, our councils and boards organization structure, combined with our vision strategy and execution model; fourth, emerging markets. While some of the countries may be challenged in the short term, we are position ourselves, especially in selected emerging countries, for the long run in terms of country transformation and partnership with our customers at both the business and government levels; fifth, Japan and service provider next generation build out.</p>
          <p>While we believe there are some more positive areas than there are areas of concern, the areas that we continue to focus on are expanding and include the US, Europe, and part of the emerging countries.  As we stated earlier, we do believe that the challenges that initially affected the US have spread to other countries around the world.  On a global and US basis, we see the same challenges and uncertainties from an economic, political, and capital spending perspective that many of you continue to witness.</p>
          <p>The second area that we are watching closely is service provider CapEx spending.  One way to analyze CapEx growth in service providers is capital expenditures as a percentage of total sales.  The rate of growth in this area appears to be moderating, although it varies dramatically from company to company and by geography.</p>
          <p>While our technology and business partnership relationships in most of the service providers are continuing to get even stronger, there are clearly some very tough comparisons for our Service Provider business to fiscal year 2007 Q4 and fiscal year 2008 Q1 and Q2, which had very strong year-over-year growth rates in Service Provider.  Again, if the market does continue to slow, we believe this will not dramatically change our long-term opportunities with our vision of how the industry will evolve and our differentiated strategy. In fact, it is our intent to expand our share of customer spend during these corrections as we have done in the past.</p>
          <p>We also believe that our opportunities to expand in our current markets and market adjacencies are actually increasing.  This is true from the data center to the home market, from the service provider to the small to medium business and consumer.  Therefore, you will continue to see us invest aggressively where appropriate while maintaining our focus on our financial models.</p>
          <p>Once again with the usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, our Q2 fiscal year 2009 guidance is for year-over-year revenue to be in the negative minus 5 to 10% range.  We believe our long-term growth opportunities remain in the 12 to 17% range, again assuming our usual caveats and global GDP growth.  We will focus on what we can control and influence and attempt to position Cisco to gain momentum in market transitions, whether they are in industry consolidation, product transitions, market adjacency opportunities, or economic.</p>
          <p>In summary, for those areas that we can control and influence, we believe our vision, strategy, and execution are in great shape and producing the results.</p>
          <p>As always, I want to thank our shareholders, customers, employees, and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapid industry consolidation, market transitions, and challenging economic times.</p>
          <p>Now Blair, I'd like to turn it back over to you for some comments and the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, John.  We'll now open up the call to the question and answer session.  We do request that sell side analysts please ask only one question.  So Kim, why don't you open up the call to the first question?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Hi John, the top lines of your segments are clearly very challenging, but at least so far your margins seem to be quite stable including what you're commenting in your guidance.  Can you just give us a better idea of the impact on your margin structure in the scenario of declining revenues next year?  I am especially thinking of the comparison back in '01 when obviously revenues were off quite a bit and margins declined by 13 points on the gross margin line and even more than that on the operating margin line.  Is there any reason you are expecting more resiliency this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Simona, you very creatively asked about three or four questions, but I'll try to answer them as one.  First let me go in reverse order and hit it fairly lightly but if you want or other of your peers want to discuss it in more detail, we will. There are very few comparisons to 2001. 2001 was a different market. It was high-tech driven crisis. Our growth rates went from 50% plus growth rates for nine or ten quarters in a row to minus 45 growth in a period of nearly a month and a half. 25% of our customers disappeared and you were at the end of an innovation cycle, the Web 1.0 run if you will. And Cisco P/E ranges in that time varied even during the height of the downturn between 20 and 100 in terms of going forward ratios from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2003.</p>
          <p>2008 is a different model. The financial health of the majority of our customers is actually pretty reasonable. This is one driven by consumer and financial challenges, credit, and availability of cash. The role of the network has changed dramatically and it's of value to our customers way beyond transport and us selling routers and switches has also increased. Loads on the network will probably grow what nobody thought was going to occur just a couple of years ago, 2 to 500%, and you are starting the next wave of innovation dealing with mobility, collaboration, green, smart grid, data center, virtualization, videos, small businesses, emerging new countries, et cetera. And so I see it as an entirely different model as it affects Cisco.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margins, we're not facing any abnormal pressure, Rick or Rob, in terms of from the customers. You will see this and just normal pressures from our peers as markets tighten up, but that's something we've handled very well before. Too early to say before but I would say, Frank, the odds are in terms of our components, you will see the component pricing not give as much advantage to us on the margins perhaps this quarter, but I think you begin to look to next quarter and the quarter thereafter if it plays out the way our supply chain believes is the most likely scenario. It looks like we will begin to pick up momentum within that. Part of gross margins is dependent upon volumes. We all understand that. It's a nice way of saying we see this playing out fairly normally in terms of a little slowing in the market. That's how we would categorize it. Frank, are there areas that I missed here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would like to add is similar to what I mentioned earlier in the call, I think one of the benefits that we have here as a key benefit is all the work that has been done over the last couple of years in managing the supply chain, as we mentioned. We've been able to stay closely with our suppliers, especially as we've been implementing the Lean Manufacturing. And that has enabled for us as well as suppliers to be very efficient and stay very close in what we're seeing.</p>
          <p>Now from a margin standpoint, in the guidance that I provided for the second quarter, we are seeing a slight decline in margins. That's primarily because of the variability that we are seeing on the top line and taking those volumes down from quarter to quarter is going to have an impact on the cost in this particular quarter. But John, I would agree with you. From a component standpoint, we saw a significant benefit in the first quarter from a component cost. We're seeing less so in the second quarter, primarily because of the change in volume. But just based on what's happening in commodities overall, we do expect to see that continue later in the year.  Hopefully, we'll see that offset some of the other pressures that we are having due to lower volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. John, you're cutting about 1.5 billion in guidance from next quarter in absolute dollars and this despite the fact there is no excess inventory out there and customers are relatively healthy. Is this the kitchen sink quarter or does the booking trends during the second half of October suggest things can actually deteriorate from here? And what does it mean about the duration of this recovery if the loads on the networks are increasing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I counted three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'll try again, but Mark did it smoothly just like Simona did. In terms of the loads on the networks, which we think absolutely will continue because of video and collaboration and Web2.0 and entertainment and many of the areas that I think we're just getting started on. Our own network loads are growing at over 400% a year at the current rate and I anticipate that increasing as well as we look out over the next six months.</p>
          <p>In terms of the kitchen sink question, we don't know. I'd like to give you a better answer than that.  August felt very good. September was a little bit bumpy, but nothing that was a big surprise to us, Rick, on it. But October did slow and we began to hear from customers on a global basis that their business was slowing as well. And so we felt the prudent thing to do was to extrapolate October out going forward. But to answer your question very directly, as I said in my commentary, it would not be a big surprise to see us on the positive side of that projection or on the other side of the projections. There is more variability and I think we'll know a lot more in 45 days.</p>
          <p>Most of the time being on the off quarter, one month behind our peers on announcements, works to our benefit. This time we didn't have as much advantage of listening to what others were seeing other than what they told us anecdotally. So Mark, I think we're in a little bit of uncharted waters, but it is something that on things we can control and influence, we feel still pretty good. And our role in terms of our customer environment actually is feeling pretty healthy, Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was easy, very good. I see pricing is coming down. Quick question on &#x2013; John, as you look a little bit further out, what is it that you'll need to see to say we need to be much more aggressive on OpEx cutting? And Frank, maybe you could clarify one billion below your budget.  How much was your budget up on a year-over-year basis versus last, so meaning are we still going to see up year-over-year OpEx in '09 as of now after your cut plan versus '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So breaking it into several segments, yes, we have a lot of weaknesses as a company and we have a lot of strengths. But one thing that I think most people would give us credit for is how we handle economic challenges. We've been through this four or five times. Our leadership team, I think 66% of us of the Senior VPs and above who were here in the year 2000. So it's a team that knows how to handle this very, very effectively and we have a culture that accepts change well. Our strategy if you will, our playbook around those four basic guidelines, that's what we followed every time and we executed to it remarkably well. And coming out of each of these downturns looking out, whether it's 6 or 12 or 18 months, you watch us really come back to our financial models or even stronger. So, we're not backing off of our traditional financial models over the longer term.</p>
          <p>However, part of that playbook and following the game plan is if your strategy is working well and you're moving into market adjacencies and you're taking market share and you're being successful on that, and they are going to play architecturally together, for example, as they will in the service provider environment, where we will bring all 26 of those cross-functional priorities together architecturally, this is a chance really to break away from our peers and we fully intend to do that.</p>
          <p>So while we use good guidance in terms of taking the expense run rate down from about 3.7 billion plus in this last quarter run rate, that probably doesn't count our hires into that number, to in the area of 3.45 to $3.5 billion exit in terms of Q4 at the current plan, we think that's the right way to go after this. And so our game plan, if you will, being based on that playbook, we'll built it in on speed and skill and flexibility, and we'll adjust along the way. But we think we do this well, and I think you would probably have to agree. Each time we've done this, we've come out of this in very strong financial shape, and got our models to where you would expect. But we won't do anything dumb in the short run that's going to affect our long-term growth and long-term profitability.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Evenson with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well, thanks. I am wondering how the weaker oil prices might affect your growth rates in Middle East and other emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, it's a fair question. I am going to shoot a little bit from the hip on this one. In countries in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia, they make money on $2.50 oil prices. And so, on countries that have a pretty fair amount of oil and a reasonably good base in terms of their expenditures, I don't think you're going to see major changes. There will be countries like Russia to where they've modeled probably in terms of the expenditures of government and others at a higher run rate than what they've got and they will have to make some decisions on programs et cetera. But this last quarter, Rob, you might want to look real quick, but I am pretty sure Russia grew over 20% year over year in this last quarter.</p>
          <p>Our challenges in Russia &#x2013; 22, thank you, Rick. Our challenges in Russia actually are the reverse. Our problem in Russia is availability of credit and currency. They have 1,000 banks, but only a couple of them have credit available at the present time. So that's really where we're looking at our channels and seeing what we could do to help them in a way that also maintains our fiscal carefulness.</p>
          <p>I guess that's a nice way of saying that while there will be some impact in some of the countries, overall I think the benefits of the other countries will far outweigh the disadvantages in terms of the economy and the defects on discretionary spending. But Jeff, it will vary dramatically by country and if you would like to sometime perhaps one on one, I'd be happy to go through everything from Azerbaijan to Saudi Arabia to Dubai to Russia on what we think will occur. That probably would bore a lot of people on the line at the present time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, one more thing on this one. Certainly lower oil prices will have impact on the oil producing countries, but they're much stronger in this particular downturn in terms of reserves et cetera, and I'm taking about financial, not just oil. And so they're more prepared to deal with the situation, plus they didn't bring about this situation in any way. So they're reacting to a global situation and in a stronger position.  I think the same thing is true even in Latin America that oftentimes has had the ups and downs. They have strong reserves.  It's not to say that they can't have issues and currencies shift as rapidly as they have been shifting now, but I think the position is a little bit different.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have question on the trends of the various activities, mainly switching versus routing. What happened this quarter is counterintuitive. Switching grew 8% accelerated and the routing went down, while you were saying in your comments that enterprise, you had seen the declining order versus service providers you had seen relatively flat orders or better orders than enterprise. So that means you should see the opposite trends in switching versus routing. And I'm wondering if you can shed some light on that.  And also related to the guidance, when you look at next quarter, do you expect switching trends to reverse and routing trends to reverse or vice-versa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Tal, that was exact question I asked when I got the data the very first time that were watching the trends because historically, routing and service providers correlated and switching and enterprise correlated. If you watch, our enterprise marketplace was the most challenged; you're right on that.  However, our commercial marketplace and public sector were relatively flat. So, we want to look at how you balance within those categories.</p>
          <p>In terms of the service provider side of the house, while routing will swing up or down based upon both loads in the networks and where they are out in the build-out cycles and that will vary geography-wise around the world and as we showed in the various theaters, it did vary geography-wise around the world; you are seeing service providers as a percentage of CapEx, as a percentage of sales, tighten up a little bit on that. And the reason service providers actually grew pretty well was the area of video. Our video group grew over 20% year over year. The Scientific Atlanta group grew very well and we also did a pretty good job in IP set-top boxes, which were up I think both bookings and revenue-wise in the 100% type of range give or take a percent or a little bit above that. Ned, would you add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's exactly right, John. And the other thing I would just add is the new product launches and the move with the Nexus 5000 and 7000 has been extremely well received in the enterprise. So even in a tough environment, the focus on virtualization and product innovation is increasing the strategic relevance in the conversations we're having with customers.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question about cash; at the end of last year, last fiscal year, your US cash balance had dipped below $2 billion, I'm wondering if you can talk about what level of cash you need in the US and how these levels might impact buyback, particularly since you're guiding for lower cash flow on a monthly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, we'll disclose this further when we send out the Q, but for the first quarter, we had cash in the US of 2.5 billion in part of that approximately 27 billion that we talked about. When we look at our cash position on a global basis, which we look at it from a net realizable cash standpoint, so that's taking the 27 billion and then netting it for any of the debt that we have plus the tax effect of the non-US portion; and if you look at that, we try to keep that from a model standpoint in the 10 to $15 billion range.  And as of the end of the Q1, we're at $11 billion, so clearly within that range.  Within the US, we try to also look at a balance. And if you look at how that has been trending, in the 2 to 5 million range or $5 billion range, so again at 2.5 at the end of Q1, we are still within that range.</p>
          <p>As far as the buyback, as I've mentioned earlier, we did about 1 billion, approximately 1 billion in the first quarter. We have over 7 billion left that's authorized, and we do expect to continue that buyback and we feel comfortable with amount of cash that we have and that we generate in the US to be able to continue to do that over a longer period of time.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you very much. I'm going to try to sneak three questions in here. On the tax rate, Frank, you did 22% in your guidance for the quarter, 22% all deal. What brought us down there so that it's lower.  Then also on the financed receivables, I appreciate the commentary; that's really very helpful. There are two kinds of financed receivables, some that you backstop to a third-party guy, and some that you actually originate yourself.  Was there any shift between those two pieces?  And then finally the $1 billion of cost savings, OpEx savings that you plan to have by the end of this fiscal year, where is that coming from?  Is that head count reduction, is that facility reduction?  If you can give us a sense as to the kinds of things that you're going to cut back on; and if it's head count, if you quantify that, gives a sense from there how you get to the $1 billion, that would be awesome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Frank, why don't you handle the first two questions on that in terms of the financial side of the house, and I'll do the $1 billion in savings. And maybe if you need to look something up, Frank, I'll go ahead and answer the third question first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the tax rate, we had a 22% tax rate and that's a reflection of what we believe the tax rate will be on an annual basis for fiscal year '09. The biggest change that we had coming from the 24% tax rate that we had last year to this year is now the renewal of the R&amp;D tax credit in the United States. Now we had assumed going into the year since that had been scheduled to expire that we were not going to have it. And as you know, that has been approved in the October bill that was passed by Congress; so we were able to get that in. That's the first benefit.</p>
          <p>The second benefit is how much of our business that is outside the United States, which gives us a little bit more of a benefit on the tax rate. So between those two, we feel comfortable with the full year right now at 22%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, just one thing; Frank, in '07 your tax rate was 25 &#x2013; 26% even with the R&amp;D tax credit. And so that's why I had assumed it would not get much below 24 when you finally got that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the full effect of what we had assumed coming into this year. We have also some retroactive piece of that credit since it had expired and now it has been renewed that affects us. And again the second point that I mentioned has to do with the percentage of our business that's outside the United States, which does have a lower effective tax rate. So again the combination of the two give us comfortable, make us comfortable with that 22% rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for time purposes, Ehud asked about Cisco Capital as well as $1 billion; do you want to take one of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the $1 billion and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll follow up with Ehud after.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...follow up on the other pieces. If you were to look at what we've done, we've in a fairly short time period, literally a week and a half, looked at where we wanted to go on cutting expenses. The hiring pause is one area that you pick up on. Our attrition runs let's say about on an average year, the combination of voluntary and involuntary, anywhere from 6 to 8% to give you an idea on that. Some of those will be replaced but very few. We will realign the resources within that. We are going to move into new market adjacencies and we are going to be moving around resources and that's where a lot of that 500 million, the second 500 million will come from in terms of the balance.</p>
          <p>But if you watch, we can literally go down through almost every category. We can go down through travel and meetings and events and you'll see us cut our travel even at a faster pace than we have;  put pressure on TelePresence, use it even more. We'll cut down the number of people traveling to each meeting. We have canceled, as you would expect, all offsite meetings unless they're with customers. We're looking at events, how we skinny back on those. And these are just normal reactions. In fact, it's actually healthy to do this every couple of years to go back through and cut out some of the &#x2013; not fat, but probably not muscle either that you develop in these areas. There are a lot of other related costs in terms of relocation and training programs and recruiting that will not be as much. We'll look at outside services, which is how much, Frank, about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in excess of $2 billion on an annual basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're looking at outside services carefully in the light of the core versus context concepts, but really take a look at where we stand on outside services. We'll look at where we're investing from the facilities and the capital perspective. And I think I went through with Frank and Randy Pond, who are the two people leading this program for us, and we identified probably over a dozen major areas that we can make progress in, head count just being one of them. And we'll evolve that, Ehud, as you'd expect, as we go through this. But this is something again we know how to do pretty well, and we're pretty disciplined on doing it well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, just one thing I'd add on that. 30% of our spend is variable from an expense standpoint, so that's the piece that you're talking about that gives us the ability, the flexibility to be able to manage the $1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but it looks like a pretty reasonable number off the run rate exiting Q4 this year. Next question, please.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, how are you doing?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good, thank you, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate getting in under the wire. I apologize, I know this question has been asked in multiple forms throughout the call. But my question would be, John, to the extent you have visibility and I recognize that's a very fuzzy thing right now, how much of what you're seeing in January off of the month of October, how much of that you think is a function specifically of the credit crisis and how much of that is fundamental economic downturn? And as part of that if I may since I am the last question, you're talking about January, which I trust is really not a reflection of calendar 2009 budgets which are being set as we speak by both enterprise IT departments as well as carriers. I recognize you're not giving guidance for calendar '09 on this call. But when you think about budgets being set for next year, in light of what has just transpired, any thoughts in terms of what we can expect and what you're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's very difficult to separate what might be a problem with credit availability and how much that contributes to both capital purchasing but also job creation as you look around the world. And they go hand in hand because many of our channels when they ask for help in some of these geographies, their issue is as much credit for their own jobs and head count as it is on the products themselves. So, I have to think about it, Paul, a little bit on if I can break the two apart. I think credit absolutely contributed to this and then it's a catch-22. Did credit just contribute to not purchasing products or did credit slow down a market to where it actually begins to slow down an economy in the given geographies and there is probably a combination of both those factors going on.</p>
          <p>In terms of the CEOs and their attitudes overall, they are pretty conservative in terms of the approach. I was at a business council meeting just a couple of weeks ago, where you have probably 70 of some of the top CEOs in the world. And most of them are pretty conservative on their business approach et cetera. But it's different for two reasons both for us and for the market than it was perhaps looking back seven or eight years ago. Most of the CEOs are understanding the leverage that they can get in terms of both flexibility in the market, productivity, market adjacencies with these technologies. And the CEOs especially of the service providers on a global basis are looking at moving into new markets. And they are getting competition in a way that our role with service providers will expand.</p>
          <p>That's a nice way of saying that we'll probably get &#x2013; if we do this right, get a larger share of their budgets over time, and that I think the budgets will probably be more flexible, including Cisco's, not just for the next quarter, but for the next year than normal. So we probably will not have a hard and cold budget for next calendar year on IT.  We'll use IT to enable our capabilities and so we'll probably provide some flexibility into that.</p>
          <p>I know that didn't answer your question. I'm sorry, Paul, I didn't know that didn't answer your question quite as directly. If you want to get one last question in under the line, I would be happy to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So gentlemen, if I can push you relative to your comment in terms of the discretionary nature of com equipment, data networking spend; I hear you saying you'd argue that it's less discretionary today than it was earlier in the decade, albeit it appears anecdotally that routers and switches and even unified communications gear is still something that enterprises find a way to push out and lengthen in periods like this in terms of upgrade cycles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have several, but in terms of unified communications, we did not see that. Actually it was very solid in this quarter, a 20% type growth. If there is one area that CEOs literally can do an advertisement for us on, it's TelePresence, and it would shock you how many dozen CEOs actually do that regularly in terms of saying this changes business models. We're going to use this time to really instill the products that will allow us to dramatically cut our travel expenses as well as the business models that go with it.</p>
          <p>In terms of routers and switches, can they run their networks hotter for a period of time and will they? The answer is yes in terms of the environment. How long that cycle looks will vary by customer and will vary by what type of loads they're doing with video and the applications to go with it. We do, however, and this is why perhaps we saw the impact quicker, with 84% of our business being non-recurring, in other words we don't do large outsourcing bids. We don't do large data center build-outs et cetera, which tend to have a &#x2013; once you commit to them, including large software deals, you're in the middle of it. You have got to finish them up in terms of the approach. We don't have that buffer in our numbers like some of peers do. Our recurring is only about 16% of our business each quarter in terms of the direction.</p>
          <p>But I would say for most of our customers, if you were to ask the large CEOs of enterprise or the CEOs of service providers, Cisco's role is dramatically stronger in those environments than we were just two years ago, and light years stronger than we were perhaps seven to ten years ago during the last major economic slowdown.</p>
          <p>So we'll see, Paul, how it plays out and again when you're go into slowdowns fast and with the governments around the world putting a lot of resources into it, none of us know for sure how quickly it's going to come out. We're just going to maintain flexibility to adjust, and I think that's the way most of us will approach our IT budgets as well.</p>

          <p>Okay, so Cisco's next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our second quarter fiscal 2009 results, will be on Wednesday, February 4, 2008 at 1:30 PM Pacific time of 2009. Additionally, downloadable Q1 financial statements will be available following the call, including revenue segments by product and geography, income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information.  Balance sheets and cash flow statements can be found on our website in the Investor Relations section. Just again click on the financial section to find those.</p>
          <p>Again, I would like to remind you that in light of Regulation Fair Disclosure, Cisco plans to retain its longstanding policy not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This does conclude our call</p>
