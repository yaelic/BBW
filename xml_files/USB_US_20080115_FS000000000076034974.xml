        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Judy, and good afternoon to all of you joining us today.  I'd like to begin today's call with an overview of our fourth quarter results and a review of some of the highlights.  I'll then turn the call over to Andy, who will provide you with additional comments about the earnings.  After we've completed our brief formal remarks, we'll open the line to questions from our audience.</p>
          <p>U.S. Bank recorded net income of $942 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Earnings per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of $0.53, or $0.13 lower than the earnings per share in the same period of 2006, and $0.09 lower than the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>As we announced in December, the fourth quarter results included two items that in total reduced the earnings per common diluted share by $0.13.  The first was a pre-tax charge of $215 million or $0.09 per diluted common share, representing our proportionate share of certain litigation involving Visa and a number of Visa banks.</p>
          <p>The second item was a pre-tax market valuation loss of $107 million or $0.04 per common diluted share, related to the purchase of certain asset-backed commercial paper holdings from certain money market funds managed by a subsidiary FAF Advisors.  Excluding these two one-time items, our earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 would have approximated $0.66 per diluted common share.</p>
          <p>We achieved a return on average assets of 1.63% and a return on average common equity of 18.3% in the fourth quarter.  Excluding the Visa charge and the market valuation loss, our return on average assets and return on average common equity would have been 2.01% and 22.6% respectively.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter net interest margin improved from 3.44% in the third quarter to 3.51% in the fourth quarter, a seven basis point increase.  This improvement in our margin in addition to good quality growth in average earning assets resulted in an increase in net interest income on a linked quarter basis as well as on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>As we have said in the past, a stable margin is a key component of our long-term revenue growth assumptions.  Our assumption going forward is that given the current rate environment, yield curve and our balance sheet mix, the margin in 2008 should settle in the mid 3.40's range comparable to that of 2007.  Andy will discuss our rationale for these expectations in a greater detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>Once again, our fee-based businesses exhibited excellent momentum.  Payments related fees were very strong this quarter, recording year-over-year core growth in the high teens.  Trust and investment management fees increased by almost 8%, while treasury management fees, commercial product revenue, and mortgage banking revenue also improved over the prior year.</p>
          <p>As we discussed at our September Investor Conference, treasury management and commercial product sales have been specifically targeted for improvement via several revenue growth initiatives. This quarter's results demonstrate that these initiatives have begun to gain traction.</p>
          <p>Although revenue growth in the fourth quarter is seasonally not as robust as in the second or third quarters for our company, payments, trust and investment management fees along with commercial revenue all posted solid core growth over the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Mortgage banking revenue was lower on a linked basis by quarter by $28 million, as an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedging activity, was partially offset by higher servicing revenue and production gains.  Our mortgage banking division continues to benefit from the recent market conditions with what we would call a flight to quality.  Our mortgage products and service are first grade and our customers and business partners know that we are committed to originating and servicing high quality credits.</p>
          <p>The growth in total revenue, net interest income and fees, was 3.4% year-over-year.  However, revenue growth excluding the $107 million money market related asset valuation loss in the current quarter and a previously reported $52 million gain from the sale of the 401(k) business posted in the fourth quarter of last year would yield more than an 8% year-over-year increase in total revenue.</p>
          <p>The growth in total revenue on a linked quarter basis was approximately 1% annualized.  Excluding the money market related asset valuation loss, total revenue grew by over 13% on an annualized basis demonstrating the powerful impact that a stable margin, coupled with our strong fee-based business, can have on our overall revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Noninterest expense in the current quarter was $322 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year and $191 million higher than the previous quarter.  Although certain expense categories tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter, the majority of the dollar variance from both time periods was due to the $215 million Visa litigation charge taken in fourth quarter.  A large portion of the remaining increase in expense year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis can be attributed to core growth and continued investment in both our fee-based businesses and our banking franchise.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency ratio as reported for the fourth quarter was 54.7%.  The decline is to a more comparable 47.2% when adjusted for the fourth quarter Visa litigation charge and market valuation loss.  We are one of the most efficient financial institutions in the industry.  As a company, we will continue to have a disciplined approach to expense control.  It is our efficiency after all that allows us to continue to invest and maintain our industry-leading profitability metrics.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet; total average loans grew by 5.4% year-over-year, led by solid growth in average total retail loans of 7.5% and commercial loans of 6.4%.  As we indicated last quarter, commercial loan growth began to pick up during the latter half of the third quarter.  Our fourth quarter results reflect that activity as average commercial loans grew by almost $3 billion or 6.4% year-over-year and over 18% on an annualized linked quarter basis.  A significant portion of this growth came from the corporate banking and business equipment leasing groups and represented growth in both current and new relationships, again demonstrating that our growth initiatives are beginning to have an impact on our overall results.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect that our company's growth in both commercial and commercial real estate loans will be slightly lower than the industry average, as we continue to concentrate on originating principally high quality credit and compete on price for the best customers.</p>
          <p>We saw a very favorable change in our deposit trends this quarter.  Average total deposits increased by 3.7% in the fourth quarter over the same quarter of last year and by more than 5% on an unannualized basis over the prior quarter.  This deposit growth is in part the result of our company's continued focus on and execution of our revenue initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our credit quality metrics remain very manageable.  As predicted, net charge-offs and nonperforming assets rose moderately this quarter.  Net charge-offs were 59 basis points of average loans for the fourth quarter of 2007, above the 54 basis points in the third quarter of this last year and higher than 47 basis points of average loans in the fourth quarter of 2006.  These ratios represented a $26 million increase in net charge-offs on a linked quarter basis and a $56 million increase year-over-year.  The increases over both the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of 2006 were expected.</p>
          <p>On the commercial side, stress in the homebuilding and mortgage industry led to an increase in net charge-offs albeit small at just $8 million.  The most significant increase year-over-year on the consumer side was in the credit card loan net charge-offs, as growth in outstandings and a return to normalized net charge-off ratios led to this increase.</p>
          <p>The credit card net charge-off ratio of 3.29% this quarter remains below our expected rate for this loan category as we anticipate this ratio to decline over time to its pre-bankruptcy reform rate of slightly over 4%, which will be still very low by industry standards.</p>
          <p>Residential real estate related charge-offs including consumer first and second liens grew modestly over the same period of last year and over the prior quarter.  We anticipated the growth in total net charge-offs to accelerate as we move into 2008 as stress in the commercial mortgage and homebuilding industries continue and the upward trends in delinquencies and the consumer residential real estate related categories migrate to charge-off status.  The increase in net charge-offs is expected to be manageable and within the expected through the cycle range.</p>
          <p>As expected, nonperforming assets also increased during the quarter to $690 million at December 31st from 641 million at September 30th, a 7.6% increase.  Given the current economic environment, we anticipate that our nonperforming assets will continue to move higher, but the increase will be very manageable.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Andy who will make a few more comments about the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Richard.  I would like to begin by summarizing the significant items that have impacted the comparison of our fourth quarter results to prior periods.  As Richard discussed, the current quarter included two significant items, first, the $107 million asset valuation loss, and secondly, the $215 million Visa litigation charge.  Earnings per diluted common share without these items would have been $0.66.</p>
          <p>The third quarter of 2007 also included a charge of $115 million related to Visa litigation.  This charge represented the company's proportionate share of the litigation settlement between Visa and American Express.  Third quarter earnings per diluted common share without this charge would have been $0.67.</p>
          <p>Finally, the fourth quarter of 2006 benefited from three notable items, including a $52 million gain on the sale of the company's 401 recordkeeping business; a $22 million charge to prepay certain debt and a reduction in tax liabilities related to the resolution of certain state and federal tax examinations.  After consideration of these items, the fourth quarter 2006 earnings per diluted common share would have been approximately $0.61.  Hopefully, this gives a little clear view of our core earnings moving into 2008.</p>
          <p>Net interest income in the fourth quarter was higher on both the year-over-year and linked quarter basis.  The $68 million increase in net interest income over the fourth quarter of 2006 was the result of a $10.6 billion increase in average earning assets, which was enough to more than offset the 5 basis point drop in the margin.  The $78 million increase in net interest income on a linked quarter basis was the result of a 7 basis point increase in the margin and a $5.4 billion increase in average earning assets.</p>
          <p>The margin contraction year-over-year can be attributed to slightly tighter credit spreads, primarily due to competitive loan pricing and a decline in net refunds relative to a year ago.  An increase in loan fees and a relative improvement in wholesale funding rates partially offset these negative factors.</p>
          <p>As Richard mentioned, we are comfortable with the expectations that our net interest margin will settle in the mid-340s in 2008, which would be comparable to the full year margin in 2007.  The fourth quarter margin was slightly higher due to a number of positive events, including the lag in the reprising of a portion of our consumer products in conjunction with the last rate decrease, higher yield related fees, our ability to garner favorable short-term funding rates during the current market turmoil, and an increase in net refunds due to the absence of share repurchases in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Going forward, our expectations for a stable net interest margin is based on steady-to-slightly improving credit spreads, continued growth in higher spread products, including credit card and other retail loans, normalization of funding and liquidity in the overnight markets and the resumption of our share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains strong.  In anticipation of the need to purchase certain securities from the rated money market funds managed by FAF Advisors, the company did not buy back shares of stock in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the full year 2007, however, 58 million shares were repurchased.  These repurchases combined with our quarterly dividend resulted in 111% return of earnings to shareholders for the full year 2007, well above our 80% goal.</p>
          <p>We remain well capitalized at quarter end with the Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.3%, just slightly below our target ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 12.2%.  We anticipate that we will return to our target Tier 1 capital ratio by March 31st 2008.</p>
          <p>Richard covered the highlights of our credit quality statistics for the quarter, but I wanted to update you, I wanted to update our exposure to subprime lending.  Our exposure to subprime residential loans is minimal and very little has changed from the end of the third quarter of 2007.  As of the end of this quarter, we had $4.2 billion of residential real estate loans and home equity and second mortgage loans outstanding to customers that could be considered subprime.  Those two portfolios represent 2.7% of total loans, loans outstanding as of December 31st.</p>
          <p>Although the percentage of subprime loans is very small, we have taken steps to address concerns related to the re-pricing of the adjustable rate mortgages and the impact that may have on our current customers.  This program was instituted in the spirit of the model introduced by the federal government, but we feel that it contains additional flexibility.  The result of this program will be an increase in the total of restructured loans reported by the company as we move into 2008.</p>
          <p>My final comment relates to an accounting change that will impact the results in 2008.  Effective January 1st 2008, the company will adopt Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements and No. 159, Fair Value Option, as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  The impact to our financial statements from the adoption of these accounting standards will be an expected reduction in earnings per common diluted share of approximately $0.02 at the time of adoption in the first quarter of 2008 and approximately $0.03 for the full year 2008.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call back to Richard for his closing remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy.  Last September, at our Investor Day meeting, I announced the formation of a new division in our company focused on revenue growth.  We are calling this new division the enterprise revenue office, the ERO, and appointed Mac McCullough, a name familiar to many of you to lead this effort.</p>
          <p>As you might also remember, I discussed the first group of activity the enterprise revenue office will focus on, a set of 15 initiatives focused on building deeper relationships with our customers.  These 15 initiatives are expected to generate between 500 and $750 million of incremental annual revenue beginning in 2009.  I am very pleased to report that we will have 6 or 7 of these initiatives up and running in pilot form in the first quarter, including three of the largest opportunities.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are finalizing a number of activities that will allow us to become more proactive and disciplined in the pursuit of new sources of revenue, in particular, as it relates to leveraging our broad payments capabilities.  I will continue to keep you updated on the progress we are making as these important activities begin to gain traction.</p>
          <p>December marks my one-year anniversary as CEO of this company.  Although the first year of my tenure proved to be anything but business as usual, for us and the others in the financial services industry, I am very pleased with the stride we have made in positioning of this company for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the quarter's results, we have managed through this environment well.  Our management team is focused on the future and working on initiatives that will capitalize on current products, services and our geographic reach while working with our new ERO to innovate and deliver new products and services for our current and our future customers.</p>
          <p>As a company, we will continue to utilize our core financial strength, including our profitability, efficiency, prudent credit culture, capital management and customer service, while selectively investing in growth of our businesses and people, both organically or via small strategic acquisitions to lead our long-term goals without taking risks that could jeopardize our future.  This company is well-positioned to produce a consistent, predictable and repeatable earnings stream going forward for the benefit of our customers, our community, our employees and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>That concludes our formal remarks.  Andy, Bill and I will now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.  Operator, we're ready.</p>

          <p>Hi Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick questions.  It sounded like from Andy's remarks that you would not be repurchasing stock in the first quarter, but would expect to resume repurchasing stock in the second quarter and beyond, is that the right read?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed.  We did not repurchase in the fourth quarter.  This is Andy.  We did not repurchase in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the FAF transaction.  We will start to repurchase late in the first quarter.  Our first objective is to retain &#x2013; get back to the 8.5% Tier 1 ratio but we do expect some, albeit a low level of purchases, in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And back to normalized level in the future quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then second question, it looked like operating costs even after backing out the Visa litigation charges were stepped up pretty noticeably, I guess obviously related to a number of the revenue growth initiatives that you touched upon.  Is that sort of core expense level sort of a base level now from which we can think about sustaining or growing from, given the fact that you're moving forward with Power Banking and a number of other revenue initiatives that you discussed, or would you expect a step down a little bit from the fourth quarter level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, the answer is, I believe it represents the direction I would like to go in having a higher expense base, but offset when the revenue starts to show.  So, let's agree that we are starting to move that number up.  We still seek and will have positive operating leverage for the year of 2008, but in the beginning stages of an investment curve that we are in, I suspect that we'll probably be a bit of the expenses ahead of some of the revenue, and at this point I hesitate to cut back on that to the point that I will either delay or lose the benefits that we are creating now and the momentum.  So for the near-term I think you are seeing us at a new run rate base and as we deliver the revenue that I am expecting, that will continue to keep the positive operating leverage and the industry leading efficiency ratios that you've come to expect.  And you can have my word that should we not find the revenue coming about, we have all kinds of opportunities to reduce the expense flow to make sure that we protect our ratios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  That's very helpful and very good quarter especially relative to what we are seeing from peers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Nancy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Also known as Nancy Bush.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, could you just speak to the deposit growth?  I mean is this coming in a particular geographic area or product, because it's rather startling to see so much deposit growth in such a short period of time.  Is there something here that has sort of kicked in and should we expect more going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Andy, you want to speak to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, two things.  I would say part of the deposit growth was unique to the fourth quarter.  We had some acceleration in broker-dealer growth and activity that I would call more temporary in nature, but even peeling that back, we are starting to see growth in our core consumer deposit products.  We are advancing a number of new products and a couple of pricing strategies still well within our constraints and within our range, but we are seeing some core growth in both consumer deposits on the savings and checking side, so I think we are starting to see a turn to the curve that we have experienced in the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so Nancy, you are right; it is a meaningful change in the past and I think it's one that a lot of people hopefully will do someday.  It's not at the cost of the increment of our margin, but we are taking advantage of some of the margin attributes that allow us to firm up and at the same time start being more competitive in some of these markets.</p>
          <p>Power Bank, to Ed's earlier question, is one of those areas that you will see us take different approaches in our community markets or in the markets that we have low market share, which we're calling a program called Self Banking where we will be more aggressive in markets where the disintermediation risk is so much lower.</p>
          <p>So if we do our job well, you will see a slight increase in the cost of deposits managed against the overall margin remaining flat and the growth of core relationships is just something we've been long coveting for many years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Great. And secondly, if you could just speak to the profitability of mortgage banking right now; I mean there has been a great deal of hope that the remaining players would see better quality loans, better profitability, increased market share, if you could just speak to whether that is yet being seen?</p>

          <p>Nancy, it is for us; I'm happy to report didn't have to change any of our protocols, our products, our broker streams.  We were doing exactly the business a year ago that we're doing today.  We're seeing a highlight now though, the flight to quality that we called out in our notes.  It's a funny way to say it, but we do have customers and partners wanting to do business with us because we haven't changed our product set, we haven't changed our return on the focus of customer service and under the leadership of Dan Arrigoni, our First Mortgage business, we are in the high-teens as a national ranked mortgage provider and mortgage servicer.  That's a great place for us to be because it's a great business.  Our own customers get our own business.  We do a lot of business for others, but it is for us a high-quality business and actually the margins have improved because of the flight to quality.  That along with the hedging acumen that Andy has to bring to the table to make sure that the business is managed in this difficult time has given us a very robust view of the future of mortgage banking.  It's one of our, I'd say, growth initiatives based on the size that it has in the company.  Andy, do you want to add to that?</p>

          <p>The only thing I'd add, Nancy, is in the fourth quarter given the dramatic change in interest rates day to day and the turbulence that occurred, our hedge results were a little less than &#x2013; were less than the third quarter and that is some of the decline you're seeing on a linked-quarter basis.  But the core underlying servicing and production revenue is very strong.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard, can you talk a little bit about how you can take advantage of the current downturn?  Obviously, you've held up a lot better than others from an earnings point of view.  Your capital is intact.  Your stock's held up better.  You mentioned some opportunities in the commercial lending side, but are you looking at other opportunities in this downturn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand where the question's headed.  Let me answer on two parts.  The first one, not exactly what you meant, but while a majority, and I mean the majority of our peers I believe, are focused on internal actions not the least of which should be capital preservation, dividend reviews, line of business reductions and perhaps contraction of employees.  We're not working on any of those things and so, issue #1 is we have the ability to be focused on continuing to power through on the initiatives that this company has long been focused on which is to be as great an offensive stock as you've known us to be for years as a defensive stock, and we would be doing that anyway but given that our peers might be focused on other things, that's a distinct advantage.</p>
          <p>Follow-up to that is we have made that I think very clear to our 54,000 employees by emboldening them to be all the more advantageous in dealing with the very best customers and prospects we may heretofore have not seen and take advantage of our window of opportunity and be very aggressive in the pride that they should feel about the company that they keep.  So, we're getting a lot of, I'll call it the 12th man on the team kind of benefit, and we're not shrinking away from that advantage.  In terms of the real technical and financial advantage, let's agree that to have that distinct PE advantage to your peers is something to understand and to manage.  In this case, we just finished our board meeting here this morning.  We were off-site today in Atlanta where, you know, NOVA is headquartered and during the board meeting, we discussed issues about being very prudent with our advantages, keeping our, if you will, powder dry to make sure we understand what materializes in the next quarter or two in this great environment.  And let me say for anybody who wants to not be confused, we have no desires or needs to do any transactional event or transformational event to keep this company moving forward as well as it can.  And yet, when you have advantages, you must understand them, evaluate them and make sure you don't leave them uncluttered; and we will continue to look at those advantages and make sure that we don't miss the chance where something may come along.  But we are not seeking it, we are not looking for it.  We like who we are, where we're headed.  I love the fact that we are not under any disruption, but I'm not going to look a blind eye to opportunities if something comes along.  So, it's not a goal, but we're not going to overlook an opportunity if something comes along, but it certainly would have to present itself and it hasn't yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Richard, just a follow-up on the last point.  You might be in a position where you're in the driver's seat where there is lot of potential sellers, just a few potential buyers.  Are you looking at it just prioritizing in terms like what's most important from a financial point of view, strategic new business lines?  It seems like you might have your pick to go to new places or new geographies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I would say in order of things, #1, #2 and #3 is financial.  This has just got to make sense for our company in the near term and the long term.  So, you're not going to hear us consider deals and then while away the issues of two years of dilution or marginally accretive or, that's not smart.  This company is in a great position, in fact, arguably, at the sixth largest size.  Maybe at the last point of large enough to be able to understand and manage without being too big to be complex.  So, I'm going to be very prudent with the use of our capital and our position and not dilute what got us here.  And then, if that financially made sense, then strategically, it would have to fit.  That would be the second gateway because we would only do things that make sense.  And as I know it today, Matt, we're still focused on small, in-market acquisitions that make sense in the deepening of the markets we're in, small but meaningful and perhaps strategic payment opportunities anywhere on the globe that make sense and continue to look at that trust and wealth management business where there are businesses I think that will come to us in the next quarter or two from some companies downstream that say, I really think I don't want to get into this business anymore, I want someone else to do it for me and you guys have a track record.  So, financial first, strategic second and both are required before we can go to any third or fourth considerations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am doing well.  I think the first question, Andy, could you itemize the things that caused a benefit to the fourth quarter margin again.  That went kind of fast and I couldn't write them down, and then maybe provide how much each of those items benefited the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  There are three principal reasons for the margin improvement.  Number one, is that we did not purchase stock in the fourth quarter, so our free funds were actually higher because of that lack of repurchase.  Number two is that we did benefit from the downward trend in rates.  As you know we are liability-sensitive, and as we projected in the downturn in rates we benefit and that helped us out in the margin.  And then finally as you also probably know, the last month of the year and principally the last half of the last month, there was a lot of turbulence in the financial markets which allowed us to actually benefit quite substantially in terms of our wholesale funding cost day-to-day.  There was a bit of a flight to quality and we had some days that were, on an overnight basis we were borrowing at a low rate.  My expectation is all three of those things would begin to normalize and as we talked about our expectation is for '08 to get back to that sort of mid 340 margin for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you say those three items provided you seven basis points, ten basis points of margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again I don't have each one itemized specifically but the combination of all of those things I would say are sort of the seven basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But the Fed keeps cutting interest rates as aggressively as some may suggest, wouldn't you still benefit from at least the second, you know, the trend in rates going down further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're correct.  We are still liability-sensitive but I will also say that given that where rates are today on some deposit products we are going to start to reach a floor on our downward pricing so that the benefit, while still there, will begin to diminish as rates continue to go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and if I can ask one follow-up question.  On the asset qualities, clearly it's going to look better than most that are going to report over the next couple days but I guess the one that you could look at is the 90-day past due was up 30% sequentially.  Is there any concern there that's a harbinger of things to come in terms inflows into NPAs at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, this is Richard and I want Bill to answer that but yes that's a concern and yes so is the fact that 30 and 89 continue to be finding themselves back down to more normalized levels.  So if anyone in the next couple of weeks tells any of you differently, we have a pretty good view of the next 90 days in banking.  We have a very blurry view after that.  I mean we just really can't possibly predict much beyond your delinquencies and your charge-off routines.  Bankruptcies can come in faster from the sides than they used to be and the valuation losses, not dependent on how predictable you are on your loss by customer's ability to repay, the actual loss per in this case autos or homes or other things are much more difficult to predict than they used to be because the market has so many moving dynamics.  So we are concerned about that.  We did plan, as you know, we've telegraphed that our net charge-offs and our non-performs will grow over the course of the year.  We expect that, if it changes the trajectory we will telegraph that to all of you.  At this point it's definitely as it was expected to be, and we're not immune but we don't see any reasons to pull the trigger or call in for any kind of one-time event in order to account for any surprises that we didn't see at this point.  But that would be the CEO's approach but let the Chief Credit Officer give you the real facts that might make more sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we did see some stickiness in the 90 days over the holiday season.  That was probably a little more than we normally see but as Richard said, the good news was on our residential mortgage portfolios including home equity we were actually flat to down on our 30 to 89 day delinquencies, so that was a positive development for us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everybody.  A couple of questions, just a follow up along those lines just in terms of the comments that you made before just in terms of expectations for accelerating delinquencies and so forth and higher charge-offs, that Richard I think you mentioned that the expectation is that it will still remain within through cycle type of a range.  Could you just kind of frame that out for us in terms of how you're thinking right now and whether or not the Board and senior management has kind of thought through the potential in terms of recession scenario and how that may impact those figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to have Bill answer the first question but Todd let me go with the last one.  You might expect that we're fairly good students of our own numbers and we have a recession scenario that we've built in our profit plan which is particularly watching for these signals, the early indicators and then reacting as need be on the expense side of the equation to respond to that so that we protect our original commitment.  We are not seeing any events yet that would cause us to trigger our recession scenarios, neither at the company level or at an individual line of business level, but you can rest assured we have done our homework, we know exactly what that looks like.  For U.S. Bank, we are a fairly large consumer based company, so should there be a recession or a technical slowdown either way, it affects us on the credit side, it also affects us in the customer demand side and it affects our payment businesses both on the acquiring and issuing side.  So yes, we and the Board have talked about that and we're good stewards of what's possible but we're also operating in what we know today which is still fairly decent growth, albeit a bit slowing. It's manageable for us and based on the mix of our businesses there are some counterintuitive activity that goes on where some areas are actually strengthening at times and others are weakening.  So on the recessionary preparations we are prepared for that and have looked at our moving parts.  In regards to the rest of it in terms of the actual credit performance, let me have Bill add that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you referred to the through the cycle comment and we find that before as between 60 and 80 basis points.  If you look at our balance sheet we do have a fairly sizeable card portfolio relative to the size of our balance sheet and as we stated we do expect those losses to move up into the low 4% range and as it does that we will move up in that range with that through the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Todd, I think we are &#x2013; I think making clear to you guys we say what we know.  We've said 60 to 80 over the cycle and in our mind that too would be the range in a more traditional time post of bankruptcy reform and all the other things.  These numbers could move on the high end or it's slightly above that range that we just said depending on how the performance of credit cards and the real estate businesses perform.  We are not seeing it go above that yet we are definitely seeing it in that range and it's a high end and we'll telegraph that to you guys as quickly as we see anything otherwise, but we would not as I said be immune and at this point, as we did not have the provision we don't feel we need to, what we have adequately provided before we're going to launch the earnings of the other banks and fees that they are addition to provisions might play that's an irrelative ranking, on an absolute basis we feel very well provided and we want to make sure on a comparative basis we are as well so we'll continue to visit that but at this point of time I think you would agree if you've looked at our numbers that we are in a good position and a strong healthy balance sheet right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate those comments and if I could just add a follow up just again along the lines of the &#x2013; on the mortgage side, the reference to the increase in the restructured loans this quarter could you just provide a little bit more color around that specifically you made reference to the sub-prime piece and being a driver of that increase could you just talk a little bit more about what exactly kind of proportionally the composition there and any other whether it's accounting changes are or I should say policy changes that may have been made within the residential mortgage portfolio that allows you to become a little bit more proactive in terms of managing these elevated delinquency levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we looked at in our &#x2013; these are sub-prime first mortgages residential mortgages and what we looked at was a pool of customers in our sub-prime portfolio that have always made they payments as agreed at a certain level for two to three years and they were facing interest rate resets which would cause a higher payment level and what we did was chose to provide relief to them in the form of allowing them to maintain their current level of payment.  So it's still a performing mortgage but accounting treatment would say you have to report it as a restructured loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Todd, this is Richard.  I'm actually quite proud of that action because we contemplated and built the rules before the president's recommendation and well it may not be five years as was recognized by the president's commission, it's an extensively larger set of customers based on a different measure of need, in our case let it be said US Bank doesn't want to own a house.  We don't want to put people out of their houses and we want to do what's right.  Our profit plan predicted that we would not enjoy those increases for the next couple of years and it's to that extent that it protects people and protects our assets and that makes a lot of sense to us and for our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know we talked before about competitive pressures and I thought you said it's easing up some on mortgage but more generally, are you seeing the competitive conditions getting better, worse or are they the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Richard.  I'll go first.  I'm seeing them to be the same, maybe a little different variation on things but for us pricing is not quite as aggressive as it's been in part because I think of just the inward focus a lot of companies are looking at and when you're inwardly focused you kind of try to shave off the edges on everything, in this case it might be shaving down some of the pricing comparisons.  So for us, we've always been a low-cost provider and a challenger in the market for price for the very top customers, that is a little better than it's been in times past in part because I think we are leading with a certain level of certainty that we may not have had on a relative basis before.</p>
          <p>On the positive pricing side, the actions not the least of which were &#x2013; that were taken yesterday do assist us in some of the less rational deposit pricers moving away from the competitive view and that's not to say we don't give our customers what they deserve, but it is nice to have less pressure on some of these unrealistic deposit gatherers with the FDIC insurance that's been provided to them it's very hard to compete.  So I think there is current and will be slightly beneficial deposit pricing going forward.</p>
          <p>And absent that, everyone is out there clawing for the next customer and doing what they can to make sure that they offset some of these pressures with decent revenue growth. On that side, it's just as competitive as it's ever been and I think in our case we just have a slight few advantages that we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about your willingness to extend credit?  Have you pulled back even just a tiny bit based on what you are seeing with the credit losses for the industry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Bill answer that technically but the answers is in certain things, yes, but for the most part, no, because this is my moment to say to you all we weren't doing most of this for the last few years and many folks criticized us for not growing our assets more robustly and now that we haven't changed our formats we are still growing at the same levels we were but I think it's &#x2013; it appears to be a little more core than may be it was known to be before.  So for us, overall no, we are not changing our approach or our policies, but on the other hand, Bill, there are a couple of categories we'd be crazy if we didn't.</p>

          <p>Hi Brock</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Just wanted to confirm your over the cycle comment.  I am assuming that's an average number 60, 80 basis points over a cycle, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So at a peak period of losses, what would that imply, 100?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our mind, the 90 to 95 is on the high end of that range and the 50 to &#x2013; 55 to 60 is on the low end.  So when we get to the core that 60 to 80 is right in the center of that curve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And I'm relatively new to this story, if you could just review your home equity exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I can do that.  90% of our home equity portfolio is originated out of our branches.  That's all prime and it's has the weighted average loan-to-value of 71% and then there was the other piece, the only other piece which is this less than $1 billion I have referred to that's in the finance company.  That's that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And of the home equity paper, what percent do you have the first mortgage in front of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think about 20 to 25% where we have the first mortgage so...</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brock welcome to the story.  If we had an hour, I'd tell you the rest of it, but I will say that our finance company is a wholly owned startup from 1995 when we started from the old Star Bank in Cincinnati.  So it has always been a homegrown product that has been led by a guy named Randy Griffith who has led us through all of these difficult times with no remorse and no regrets &#x2013; the kind of businesses we offered our customers.  And subprime for us has always has been first and foremost customers who qualify at a different price point and in this case they are stressed for sure, but there's never been a single point of failure for our company nor has it been a major earnings stream.  It's just been part of the composition of building customer relationships.  All of them, by the way, as they graduate to prime have been welcomed into the bank at the prime level and have been part of our long-term growth, you just wouldn't see it over the years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will just add on the prime portfolio that this branch portfolio which is 90% of the business, the net loss rate on that in the fourth quarter was 21 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And finally on the 90-day past due, is that mostly a seasonal impact that you would expect to kind of settle back down here in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should come back down, and there is the seasonality to it but as I said earlier, there was some stickiness that we did not see in the previous holiday seasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Well, thanks for taking all the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brock to follow-up on that for everyone's sake. As I said earlier, we do operate under the traditional old fashioned banking knowledge that 90-day delinquencies are a predictor of future charge-offs, 30 &#x2013; 89 delinquencies are a predictor of potential problems. A bankruptcy is a kind of out of the side &#x2013; comes out as a surprise sometimes, but you get that information and all of a sudden it's your new bankruptcy, and the valuation of both homes and automobiles is probably the one thing that's most volatile now because our predictability has been proven to be absolutely on point.  We have a really good idea of who is going to go delinquent or who is going to have a charge-off. What we don't know as well as we used to, by no fault of our own is the amount of that loss until which time the valuations are clear and either deals are settled in the marketplace or we get the results after the fact.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's important we are one of the first banks to report that as you look at this course of the credit, most banks are quite good at understanding risk of charge-off, the risk of default and loss for commercial and consumers but the ability to size the absolute loss is probably more difficult than it's been.  So, we are not hedging. We are not trying to act like we don't know and we are also not sitting on something we know that's bad either because we simply can't see much beyond 90 days probably most certainly within 45 and after that we just watch the signals and we will adjust to it as we learned.  And for me, as the head of a company that's got its basis on risk management and understanding customer relationships, it's not only what happens but it's how we treat our customers through this period and how we manage with them to try to help them get through this time that will forever build a relationship that will go generations forward if we are there to help them when the times are tough and that is our number one objective, not at the cause of the shareholder but at the benefit of the shareholder and that's the art of the science here.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>There are, thank you operator.  Thank you, Tina.  I just want to thank you all once again for following this company and showing an interest if you're an investor, thank you for that.  I've always closed my presentations, and I won't hesitate today, to close with a commitment that this company focuses on being among the very best banks in the country in every measure but to be consistent, predictable, and repeatable, and I can't think of the time that will mean more than it does in this very volatile time.  We are not savants, we are not mind readers, we don't know exactly what's going to happen in the future, but we know our company very well.  We know everything going on inside of it and we are quite pleased to present you these results for quarter four and for 2007 despite my chagrin as a shareholder did not gain a return last year from U.S. Bank, over the long course of time they have and it's our hope that over the long course of the future they will again as well.  So, we look forward to continue to communicate with you especially during the quarter as we progress through this challenging time and if there's any news to tell you we'll be the first to tell you.  Thanks operator.</p>
