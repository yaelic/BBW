          <p>Yeah, good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this presentation for the results for the Half Year to 31 January 2008 (sic) [31 December 2008] for the Commonwealth Bank. Special welcome to those on the phone and those on the webcast.</p>
          <p>The process this morning will be pretty much as we've done it in the past. So Ralph will give you a overview of the result followed by David Craig who will then run you through the results in greater detail. We'll then open up for questions. There is a media briefing this afternoon at 2:00 o'clock, so if there are media on the phones, if they could save their questions till this afternoon.</p>
          <p>So thank you all for coming and I'll hand over to Ralph. Thanks so much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Warwick. And actually these are our interim results to 31st of December 2008. So great to see you all here this morning, and I would like to say that the Commonwealth Bank has today reported a solid operating result in what has become an increasingly difficult environment. Obviously, it's always disappointing to report a decline in cash earnings. However, in a very challenging market to be able to report a $2 billion net profit should still be seen as a good outcome. This is a result which reflects the Group's cautious and conservative approach in the current environment as well as the underlying strength of our franchise.</p>
          <p>From the outset of the global financial crisis, the Group has taken the view that this would be protracted, requiring careful and cautious and considered management. Our position on this has not changed, but has rather been further reinforced by the progressive deterioration in conditions over the past six months or so, particularly internationally.</p>
          <p>We've therefore taken steps to further strengthen our capital and liquidity positions to ensure we are able to support and meet the needs of our customers. We've also significantly increased our level of provisioning as a further prudent measure, given the uncertainty that lies ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, despite the negative sentiment which prevailed in the first half of our financial year, our underlying business performed strongly. Income growth in our banking business has been very strong, underpinned by good volume growth and improved market shares. Sound cost management practices also contributed to this result.</p>
          <p>Our strategy remains on track and is delivering outcomes which are helping us to navigate these difficult times. Our customer satisfaction ratings continue to improve, directly contributing to the volume and market share growth we've achieved despite the slowing economic environment.</p>
          <p>Our focus on profitable growth has underpinned our selective investment and acquisition strategy, which is positioning the Group well for the medium to longer term. So while the outlook is uncertain, I remain confident that the Group is well-positioned to manage through this challenging period and to be in a position of relative strength when we emerge from the current downturn.</p>
          <p>As is our usual practice, I'll leave it to David Craig to run you through the financial results in detail a little later. By way of summary, I would like to call out some key features of the result. Operating income was up 15%, a very good outcome in any environment. Statutory net profit after tax was up 9%, which reflects the gain on the acquisition of BankWest and St Andrew's. Headline cash net profit after tax was down 16%, due to the increase in impairment charges. This has in turn impacted cash earnings per share, which declined by 19%, although we still delivered a credible return on equity of 15%.</p>
          <p>Whilst recognizing difficult market conditions, the Group has taken the view that it is able to maintain the interim dividend at $1.13 per share, which is unchanged from last year's interim dividend. However, in the current uncertain economic environment, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain future dividends at past levels.</p>
          <p>The relative strength of the Group's position and the underlying quality of today's result reflects the concerted efforts of a strong and experienced leadership team across the Group. This has enabled us to meet external challenges while not being distracted from our day-to-day operations and strategy. You may recall that six months ago, I mentioned that as part of an organizational capability improvement program initiated soon after I arrived at CBA, we undertook an extensive review of our risk functions. This included a global best practice study led by Rob Nimmo and First Manhattan Consulting Group. As a result, we introduced more sophisticated risk methodologies and made a number of organizational changes to better align our risk function with the needs of the business.</p>
          <p>From an organizational perspective, a key outcome was the creation of a new role of Group Executive, Risk Management, reporting directly to me, and the appointment of Alden Toevs in the middle of last year to fill that role. Prior to his appointment, as many of you will know, Alden was head of First Manhattan Consulting Group's global risk management practice based in New York. Since coming on board, Alden has provided strong leadership of the risk team and has worked closely with his people, his peers and the Risk Committee of the Board, to build a coordinated and proactive risk management framework.</p>
          <p>Since the onset of the global financial crisis, we've introduced regular management and review meetings on a daily and weekly basis, in-depth portfolio stress testing and extensive and ongoing reviews across various sectors, industries and geographies &#x2013; all of which have helped to minimize the impact of deteriorating conditions on the Group's lending portfolios. Recently, we completed a comprehensive review of our lending portfolio, which in particular, the focus was on our top 600 clients. This has provided us with additional insights into our risk profile and given us comfort around the level of our provisioning.</p>
          <p>Our treasury has achieved outstanding results. Our funding team is highly respected internationally and ensured that the Group remained in a strong funding position throughout the crisis. Treasury has responded quickly to challenging market conditions, and particularly changing market conditions, with the Group adjusting its asset pricing as soon as the sustained nature of high market funding costs became apparent. This responsiveness has been critical in ensuring that the Group's pricing appropriately reflected the changed economic circumstances in which we now operate, thereby minimizing the impact on our operating income line.</p>
          <p>Our Treasurer, Lyn Cobley and her team have managed extremely well in difficult conditions and their ability to replace $17 billion of BankWest's parent company funding at the time of the acquisition is a great tribute to their skill and professionalism.</p>
          <p>While the Group has responded well to external challenges, this has not distracted us from our underlying business. The strength of today's results, including a strong income growth, market share gains and tight cost control, all reflect on the hard work and commitment of everyone in our organization from the leadership team down.</p>
          <p>One of the most pleasing elements of this result was the continuing improvements we have seen in customer satisfaction scores across all of our businesses. As you know, this has been a leading strategic priority, and we are now well on the way of achieving our goal of being number one in customer service by 2010. As you can see from this slide, the gap to the number one rated peer has halved in the last year, and recent results would suggest that our ongoing momentum will see us moving up another spot very quickly. In business banking, we still have some way to go, although as you can see, we're making significant gains against our peers. I'm also told recent survey results have confirmed our FirstChoice platform continues to be ranked first with financial advisors.</p>
          <p>While these results are obviously pleasing themselves; the real point is that these improvements are in part responsible for driving our good operating results.</p>
          <p>Not only are we seeing better survey results, but this change in customer sentiment, together with our focus on better understanding the needs of our customers, is translating into a healthy growth in referrals between our various businesses. The number of successfully converted referrals between specialists in different business units grew 20% in the first half. This supports our cross-sell targets and leverages the breadth of financial services that we offer as a Group.</p>
          <p>Another pleasing aspect of today's results is the strong income growth, particularly as this was underpinned by solid volume growth in key markets. While economic conditions are clearly slowing, it is pleasing that the Group has been able to achieve strong market share gains, which have helped to offset lower system growth.</p>
          <p>These share gains have been achieved without relaxation of our credit standards. Our performance in home loans has been good. Following prolonged erosion in share, the Group has turned this around with 21 consecutive months of market share increases. What is particularly pleasing is the turnaround in the performance of our branch network, which having performed below market, is now consistently generating volume growth well above system. This outcome is no accident; it is the direct result of the hard work of Ross McEwan and the RBS [Retail Banking Services] team as they have extensively restructured the network and rolled out our sales and service program.</p>
          <p>Our deposit growth, both household and business, has also been very strong. Particularly, prior to the introduction of the government guarantee on domestic deposits. As well as benefiting from a flight to quality response, our decision to prioritize deposit growth, combined with the strength of our brand and distribution network, saw us grow well above system and has resulted in further increases of the proportion of our book which is funded from retail deposits.</p>
          <p>Since the introduction of the government guarantee, our deposit growth has continued to be strong but we have experienced a couple of months where we have dropped below system, primarily because we've not been willing to compete for low margin business.</p>
          <p>Our strategy remains on track and continues to deliver results. In recognition of tougher economic conditions, we've reviewed all our programs to ensure maximum focus on those actions which best support our core strategic objectives. Customer service remains a priority and we've continued to invest heavily in this area, which you can see is having results.</p>
          <p>The recently announced restructuring of our Premium Business Services division, with the appointment of Ian Narev, to head up a separate business banking segment, will further strengthen our customer service focus in this part of the business, through better alignment to specific customer segments.</p>
          <p>Core banking modernization remains a key strategic priority, one we believe will give us a clear and distinct strategic advantage over the coming years.</p>
          <p>Michael Harte, Dave Cohen and their team are making excellent progress with the initial phases of this project already launched ahead of schedule and confirming a significant promise.</p>
          <p>Our people remain our single most important resource, and they've continued to deliver outstanding results under difficult conditions. Key metrics, such as employee turnover and absenteeism, have continued to improve, as has our safety record with our lost time injury frequency rate falling yet again.</p>
          <p>The Group continues to pursue a disciplined profitable growth strategy, with focus on targeted investment and acquisition opportunities, which are on-strategy and which offer value and longer term benefit for our shareholders. In buying BankWest at such an attractive price, we leveraged our financial strength to take advantage of a unique opportunity to expand our presence in Western Australia. We also secured a strategic stake in Australia's lending home loan mortgage broker, Aussie Home Loans. We were subsequently in a position to support Aussie's acquisition of Wizard while acquiring a portfolio of around $2.5 billion of seasoned prime residential mortgages from GE.</p>
          <p>In December, we elected to increase our shareholding in our Chinese venture with Jinan City Commercial Bank from our existing 11% to 20%. While we remain cautious about the immediate future, we're also conscious that the current environment may provide the Group with unique opportunities that can add significant value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the outlook. With domestic and global economies slowing or in recession, sentiment about the prospects for the Australian economy continues to deteriorate. While key indicators such as credit growth and unemployment remain reasonably benign; conditions are expected to become more difficult in the second half. However, recent stimulation packages, both here and overseas, have the potential to soften or delay the impact of the global slowing on the economy and on our customers.</p>
          <p>While the Group's impairment expenses increased significantly during this period, much of this increase was driven by exposure to a limited number of high profile corporate customers whose business models have been under pressure for some time. While there's been no evidence of a systemic deterioration in credit quality in the commercial portfolio, it is clear that our business customers are being increasingly impacted by the slowing in the real economy. Arrears rates in the consumer portfolios have begun to trend upwards, although they still remain at low levels. As economic activity slows, and unemployment rises, pressure on customers is expected to increase.</p>
          <p>Forecasting exactly how the economy will perform, and what impact this will have on the Group and its customers, is extremely difficult. What is clear, however, is that both domestic and global financial markets will continue to be dominated by uncertainty and volatility for at least the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>On a slightly more positive note, we are fortunate to be operating in a well regulated economy, which has a strong banking industry and where the government and Reserve Bank have been willing and able to move quickly to address the country's economic challenges.</p>
          <p>In this environment, the Group remains cautious and will continue to manage its business prudently. The Group's top priorities will be to maintain an appropriate level of capital, ensure continuing access to a broad funding base, retain high levels of liquidity, and maintain a conservative approach to provisioning. This will also allow the Group to take advantage of attractive opportunities that may arise.</p>
          <p>So thank you and I'll now hand over to David Craig, who will run you through the results in greater detail. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning and thank you, Ralph, for that. It's a pleasure to be able to describe to you in a little bit more detail our performance this six month period. And I hope that the headline results aren't a surprise to you after our announcements last week. Our operating income was up 15% and our operating expenses up five, which meant that the underlying operating performance was up 24%. However, as we know, that gain was entirely eroded by impairment expenses of 1.6 billion, which led to our net profit, cash net profit after tax, being down 16% to just over two billion.</p>
          <p>The statutory profit, of course, included the gain on BankWest. This gain arose because we bought BankWest for less than net asset value. In establishing this preliminary profit &#x2013; and I have to stress that it's only preliminary; we've only owned the bank for a short period and we are still to receive completion accounts from the auditors &#x2013; we've set aside an additional $450 million of collective provision, management overlaying collective provision against BankWest in striking the profit of 547.</p>
          <p>Now before this profit is finalized, as well as getting completion accounts and making sure that they're fully provisioned, we have to value the identifiable intangible assets, and as we flagged at the time of the acquisition, set aside a restructuring provision for the work that we need to do to bring this into the Group. But 547 is our estimate for the moment.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to say that we've been able to maintain strong positive jaws. I'm often asked the question are we managing expenses to manage expenses down, or are we managing expenses for growth? And it really is this latter; and our promise to you, or our target certainly, is to maintain strong jaws throughout the cycle, and I am pleased to see that we've been able to do that this period, with three out of four business units are showing strong jaws, pretty hard for the Wealth business, with income dropping through the floor with the stock market to exactly match it, but they've kept the expenses very much under control.</p>
          <p>If we look at expenses overall, period-on-period they're actually down 3%. Compared to last year the headline number is that they're up 5% on 12 months ago, but you got to remember that 12 months ago we had an abnormal GST credit, that came into our expenses, and also since then we've integrated IWL and IMK in Indonesia, which has obviously led to increased expenses. So on a normalized basis year-on-year, the expenses are up 3%.</p>
          <p>So in managing expenses, we moved quickly early on in the period of downturn to manage expenses appropriately, but at the same time, we're continuing to invest in the future, and it's pleasing that our investment in total is 32% up from the prior year, and as Ralph has said, the most significant part of that investment is in the core banking modernization project.</p>
          <p>Now net interest margin, as always in these turbulent markets, is a choppy thing to look at. As you can see, although the net interest margin is up five basis points over the last six months, it's down three basis points on the corresponding period last year. It's pleasing to see some recouping of the asset pricing pressure that we've been under, with nine basis points up on that, but we're still one basis point down over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>On deposit pricing, as Ralph has mentioned, we've come under &#x2013; with the war for deposits there has been pricing pressure and we've lost two basis points on deposits. Liquid assets, we are continuing our strategy of holding prudent liquid assets, and those have led to three basis points for that, and a further two basis points as we've stored up the $17 billion we needed to pay for BankWest. So, overall, five basis points up.</p>
          <p>Now I know that you are all interested in what happened with impairment expenses. This period for the six months impairment expenses came in at 81 basis points. Fully half of that was due to just five single names that I'm sure you can all guess, and as well as that, we've taken the liberty of adding a significant further management overlay of 14 basis points. So, when you back those two items out, you can see that the underlying loan impairment expense is certainly going up, but it's not going up at an astonishing rate. It's gone from 17 to 22, and now 28 basis points.</p>
          <p>When you turn that into dollars, you can see that &#x2013; it's first worth pointing out that we have included within impairment expense the write-down this period of the ABC notes. That is a change in accounting approach due to a change in the standards. Previously, because those notes were an underwriting, &#x2013; the first part of the write-down was written down last period through trading income, but this period it's being included in impairment expenses. So, that in the sense is a new one-off, and you can see that we've set aside a further $270 million here in management overlay.</p>
          <p>When we look at that on the balance sheet, provisions on the balance sheet is split between individually assessed provisions and, as you would expect, single name exposures make up a significant chunk of that as well as, obviously, adding BankWest into the mix. When you look at the collective provision, you can see that we have now got $1.1 billion of management overlay on top of the modeled, automatically calculated collective provisions.</p>
          <p>Now a number of you, I think three in particular analysts, have produced excellent reports analyzing the Pillar 3 disclosures of the various banks. And all of those reports highlight the fact that the CBA's portfolio mix is less risky than the average of our peers. It doesn't matter how you look at it, how you cut the cake, that's the case. We've just drawn out one example here. We've looked specifically at the disclosed advanced treatment asset mix, and as you can see, CBA is particularly strong in the areas where our expected loss, which is the right hand column, is lower. So, for example, residential mortgages, which over a long-term period we expect a loss of eight basis points. We have 49% of our assets are residential mortgages, and that compares to averagely in the 30s for our peers. By contrast, our corporate and SME lending which has a relatively higher loss rate at 39 basis points over the entire cycle, we have a 31% share of our book compared to the other banks in the 40%.</p>
          <p>And as you go down this column, unsecured retail lending, again, we're relatively low as a percentage of our book, and that has a very high hit and so on. So you can see that that's why that mix leads to a less risky portfolio. And that being the case you'd obviously expect that our provisions on balance sheet would be less than our peers. But in fact, overall at the moment, they are sitting well and truly in the pack, on five different measures here. I particularly draw out for you that individually assessed provisions are 42% of our impaired assets. So we've been very prudent in providing for those specific accounts.</p>
          <p>If we now go in little bit deeper and have a look at the consumer portfolio. The home lending portfolio has seen a slight uptick in arrears, but we're still comfortable with the quality of this portfolio, and it's for a number of reasons. Firstly, fully 70% of our customers, of our home loan customers, have paid their mortgages in advance to some degree, and averagely they've paid seven months in advance. Now, this comes about because, particularly when interest rates decline, most of our customers choose to continue paying their mortgages at the old rate. And so by doing so, they are paying of principal more quickly, and that means that if they do ever get into any trouble, they've got a buffer in their home loan. It's also pleasing to see that the average loan to value ratio across the entire home loan portfolio is 37% of current valuation. And finally, and as I know you're aware, we mortgage insure loans when they go over 80% loan-to-value ratio.</p>
          <p>Our personal lending portfolio is looking good. Arrears are still well and truly within past years' experience. On credit accounts, we've seen an uptick, and that's partly because we have changed repayment terms. We've increased the average monthly repayment on credit cards as a prudent measure. And that's seen an uptick as our customers adjust to the new repayment terms.</p>
          <p>In commercial lending, firstly, from our perspective all known single names are now completely covered. Looking at the book, 68% of our book is to investment-grade customers. You will see there the green AAA category dropping a little bit &#x2013; or AAA, AA category &#x2013; that's because, as you'd be aware, many banks around the world have been downgraded from AA down. And so we've seen a migration from the AA categories for banks up the line a little bit, but I think we're still comfortable with those exposures.</p>
          <p>As Ralph mentioned, we did an extensive portfolio review. In fact, we looked at 627 different accounts, and this was done by an independent team. They covered $93 billion worth of accounts, which were 62% of all of the non-bank institutional lending. They focused on risky industries, locations, looking for all the obvious problems. And I'm pleased to report that out of that 627 accounts they found no new issues requiring provision.</p>
          <p>Let's turn back to the performance and it's been a solid operating performance, as I mentioned, up 24%. On this slide, I particularly want to call out the corporate center, which substantially is the treasury department. You'll recall that last year at this time we called out that we had retained in the center $100 million of funding costs as a strategic decision, and that depressed &#x2013; it;  that meant that 66 million you see there was depressed by 100, in other words it's more like 166.</p>
          <p>In our first quarter update this year, we highlighted that in treasury we have taken positions to prudently protect against declining interest rates, and those positions have well and truly paid off. And you can see profits emerging on that and those profits will continue to emerge as interest rates decline.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at the Retail Banking business, this has been an excellent period for Ross McEwan and his team, with profits up 15% in obviously a turbulent market. Home loan volumes were up 16%, but this only translated to an 11% increase in profit. Because of margin pressure, we're still 12 basis points below where we started on home loans.</p>
          <p>On deposits, again, 22% up in volume, but only 10% up in profit because of a mixture of mix issues: people obviously choosing the very high margin products, and also competition. Expenses are very well under control in this business, &#x2013; 6% up on the corresponding period, but flat half on half, and that's driven our expense-to-income ratio down to 42.4% for retail banking.</p>
          <p>If we just have a look at a dashboard for the retail bank, here you see clearly the 12 basis points that we haven't yet &#x2013; we weren't able to recover on home loans. It's very pleasing to see on the top right hand chart the branch channel is performing strongly. This was an area, when Ross McEwan took over that was underperforming market, but you can see that home lending in the branch is up 6.2% whereas system growth is only 2.7%. So that's a very strong performance indeed.</p>
          <p>Deposits, as you know, were up 22% on the corresponding period, and it's particularly pleasing to see that transaction accounts, which tend to have a higher margin, have actually grown from 17 to $19 billion. And you can also see a significant growth in the number of transaction accounts in the bottom right hand corner there.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Premium Business Services, this business has had very good volume growth and improved margins, probably the &#x2013; I should just call out the Private Client Services business, which has a concent in margin lending. Not surprisingly, volumes are down a little bit in this business, and particularly in margin lending, and that's why its profit's only grown 5%. Business banking overall, though, income up 16%; that's where we're concentrating one of our core efforts, and deposit balances are up 21%.Expenses, again in this business 8% year-on-year, but down 2% on the corresponding half.</p>
          <p>Looking at a dashboard for this business, you can see there that business deposit growth far outstripping the market, expense to income ratio now down to 38.2% for this business, and as Ralph called out, strong growth in customer satisfaction, but a little way to go yet.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the Wealth business &#x2013; and this is, as you're aware, three separate businesses. Firstly, our Global Asset Management business. Funds under management have dropped 22%, but they've been able to cut expenses by 6%, and that's led to a 15% decline in profit, which I think is a remarkable result in the circumstances. Colonial First State has had a 21% drop in funds under administration, and that's led to a 24% drop in profit. But pleasing to see that FirstChoice remains the second largest platform. And CommInsure has had extremely strong premium growth across all categories, which has led to a 19% growth in profit.</p>
          <p>Now, I just want to comment briefly on investment experience, which of course takes into account the fluctuations in the market, and in particular we've suffered significant unrealized annuity mark-to-market write-down in our life insurance underlying investment portfolio where we've written down 132 million after tax. Now over time that should reverse, so it's not a permanent loss, but mark-to-market accounting causes us to bring that to account. And we've also looked at all assets to ensure that they're not impaired. And in the case of our holding in the Commonwealth Property Fund, we've written down our holding in that fund by 43 million after tax.</p>
          <p>Our dashboard for this business sees that funds under administration, the decline is primarily, as you'd expect, from stock market declines. It's pleasing to see that both FirstChoice and Avanteos have had strong positive inflows throughout the period, and what's most pleasing on this slide is that fully 74% of our funds are performing above benchmark.</p>
          <p>Turning now to International Financial Services, ASB in New Zealand, I know that New Zealand is in recession, but it's extremely pleasing to see that ASB Bank has nonetheless turned in an increase in profit of 6%, in local currency. Our growing Asian business, you can see that the Other category has increased 35%. Now Sovereigns business is little confusing here: while the headline income is down 11%, net profit after tax for Sovereign is up 12, and that's because of a change in the way income tax is treated for New Zealand insurance companies. And finally, very pleasing to see that Sovereign is now capturing fully 34% of all the new business in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Turning to funding and liquidity, and as you're aware CBA is now one of only, I think, 11 AA-rated banks around the world, and we've maintained our stable outlook and our rating. We're very well advanced in our funding. Now, this is an extraordinary &#x2013; Ralph called it out as well &#x2013; this is an extraordinary achievement when you consider that we've taken on an additional $17 billion of funding for &#x2013; to fund the BankWest acquisition. But as of today, we're 88% into task of funding through to the 30th of June. So in a very strong position indeed.</p>
          <p>Of course, we're helped by the fact that fully 59% of our funding now comes from retail deposits across the Group, and that means that the task treasury is a little eased, only having to fund 41% through the wholesale market. And we've made a point of continuing to lengthen our overall funding and it's maintained at 3.4 years for the long-term funding. And, as I mentioned before, we've also prudently increased our access to liquidity, with 82 billion in liquids, which would be sufficient &#x2013; not that we want to use this &#x2013; to fund maturing wholesale debt for the next six months, just to put it into some context for you.</p>
          <p>Our capital position is strong at 8.75%. The Board has reviewed capital, and affirmed that the capital target is to be above 7% on Tier 1, so we're carrying at the moment $4.2 billion buffer above minimum target. I should point out to you that in striking these numbers, we are accounting for BankWest as a non-consolidated subsidiary at the moment because we haven't yet got accounts to formally bring them on. When that is consolidated, I should think that we will see about a 30 basis point decline in that capital margin &#x2013; capital ratio I should say.</p>
          <p>As you can see, our capital ratio is comfortably ahead of the other banks in Australia, and as well as that on the FSA measure, which enables us to compare ourselves to other banks around the world. Our Tier 1 capital is 11.7%, which compares to 9.6%, the average of the European banks, and I think that we are right at the top of the list of global banks in terms of capital ratios.</p>
          <p>So let me summarize for you some key messages. The five key strategic initiatives that we've been following and focused on, have continued to deliver. We're delivering on all five measures and they are seeing the core businesses all performing well. Income was up 15%, helped particularly by banking income up a strong 21%. We have been disciplined in our cost management and that's seen expenses actually decline by 3% on the prior half. And we've taken a considered approach to strategic opportunities, ensuring that all opportunities where we've made acquisitions accretive. I think that this is once in a generation opportunity for strong banks to find acquisition opportunities and I am pleased to say that we've done some to date.</p>
          <p>This places us very well in these challenging times. We have a strong capital position. We have been prudent in our provisioning, and we have 1.1 billion of additional management overlays on our collected provisions. And we are very well funded, with 88% of our funding task completed for the financial year.</p>
          <p>So with those opening remarks, I will hand it over to Warwick, who is going to handle the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Just a couple of rules. Can you wait for the microphone please. Just two questions initially, two questions here, live first and then I will go to the phones. Richard?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. David, just some questions on the margin. In the first half there was some good evidence of asset repricing. Do you expect those benefits to increase in the second half, given that there is a lot of repricing coming through on new loans? And what impact do you think the deposit spread for the reduction in cash rates will have on deposit spreads going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two good questions, Richard. On the asset pricing, you are right to say that, particularly in our business book, that reprices is over, averagely I think, 2.5 years. So, as, there is no doubt that as loans are coming up for repricing the margins are going up. It's pleasing to see that credit risk is being recognized in the market, and so certainly in that business we are going to continue hopefully to see improvements.</p>
          <p>But it's equally right to say that we are going to continue to see pressure, I think on deposits, as cash rates decline, so there is less margin for profit to be made, so to speak. But we have a replicating portfolio, as you're aware, as I am sure all the banks do, which protects to a degree against that declining market. So having paid away for years a premium, as it were, in the replicating portfolio to protect against falling rates, we should see some of the falling rates impact on the deposit book profit. But there is no doubt that this will be under pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David, can you comment on the capitalization of IT expenses in the context of overall cost performance? And also, if you could make a comment on the IRRBB deduction, and how sustainable that might be in future periods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two more great questions. Well, you can see that on page 28 of the pack we split our investments up between those that are expensed and those that are capitalized. So in the growth projects area, which includes core banking, you can see that we've capitalized 229 million. Now that isn't all core banking, but obviously that's what a big chunk of that will be about. There's also new branches and so on in that category. And I think in the detail in the accounts we've certainly set out what capitalized software is, and we can get that number for you.</p>
          <p>On the question of interest rate risk in the banking book, and again there is a slide in the pack, which is slide 126. We're still obviously, as everyone knows, there is still an inherent interest rate risk in the book, but that's offset by the fact that we have a substantial embedded gain on the positions that we've taken. And so the net of those is actually a negative $70 million risk, and so we've recorded a zero risk against that category. But that gain of course has come about because of the 4% decline in interest rates over the period. That will come &#x2013; that gain &#x2013; and of course, it all depends what happens to interest rates. If interest rates drop further, the gain will actually increase. But otherwise, what will happen is that that'll be amortized over the period of the underlying hedge, which is roughly four years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when you say gain on positions you have taken, you are talking about the replicating portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This is other positions, so it's not the replicating portfolio. This is the positions I referred to that we took to protect against declining interest rates, rather than the replicating portfolio which is a specific protection against deposits.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jon Mott from UBS. Question first for David on the bad and doubtful debt line, you called out 405 million bucks single loan exposures, I think you previously said Lehman is about 150 million exposure. That only leads us to assume that you're not going to get much back for Lehman, about 255 for four other single names. Are you comfortable with those provisions, given the exposures that you've got, and could you see further losses coming through on those single name exposures?</p>
          <p>And a follow-up question for Ralph is we're seeing a lot of foreign banks expatriate capital back to Europe and the US at the moment, which is leaving a gap. How much of your balance sheet are you prepared to utilize to fill that hole, and have you got much left in your concentration limits so that you don't run up against barriers and exceed those limits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To take your first question, which is obviously a good one, as I mentioned we're pretty comfortable with the amount of our provisioning against specific names. Don't forget, this is only this period's expense that you're seeing here, so obviously we did have provisions building up, particularly in the collective, that have now gone into impaired.</p>
          <p>One of the exercises that we did this year was just review our track record of how accurately we assess provisions once they've become impaired. Because once they become impaired we get independent accountants to go and look at it and tell us what's going to happen and give us a range and then we make a provision against that. And that review indicated that we've been pretty accurate in estimating provisions at the time accounts turn impaired. So we're reasonably comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just give us a number that was transferred from the safe A to the specifics for those four names ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to look that up for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think it's also worthy to note that a significant proportion of those exposures were secured.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the other question, in regard to the repatriation of capital &#x2013; and obviously offshore banks having a reducing exposure to the Australian economy, or Australian lending &#x2013; that is obviously a concern. And one of the reasons why obviously there's an initiative by the government to look at a particular partnership arrangement between the four majors and the government to put some backstop funding in place, if that is to occur.</p>
          <p>Obviously, all of us have exposure limits, have industry concentration limits. And certainly, we are not going put ourselves into a position where we would exceed those prudential limits that we have set ourselves. So certainly we do have some capacity, but we don't have obviously unlimited capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you see a situation where you get to companies not being, or have a shortfall of capital for some companies where they actually are forced to sell assets because you can't provide, the other major banks can't provide, or the government can't provide capital? Is that a scenario that you could see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are obviously concerned about that scenario, and that's one of the reasons for the initiative that's being put in place currently in regard to the ability to fund those sorts of situations that may occur. Obviously, we would only be interested in funding Australian-based assets, and we'd obviously only be interested in funding strong Australian corporates who so &#x2013; would not be a situation where it's last resort lending to poor business propositions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jared Martin, ABN Amro. A question for you, Ralph. If you cast your mind back to mid-December, you increased your guidance for bad debts, which was interpreted by the market at the time as a downgrade. And then a week ago, a week or so ago, you've provided guidance that effectively was an upgrade, driven by increased revenue and good expense control. I would have thought that 5 1/2 months into the half, back in mid-December, that your view on revenues and expenses, which are a lot less volatile than bad debts, would be understood. So I just wanted to get a comment from yourself in terms of what's happened there, and is there an issue with management systems that you're not getting that information in a timely manner to actually fully interpret?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jared, again, that's a very pertinent question, and I think that the answer to that is that we do have very good management information systems, so there's no issue around that. If we go back to the quarterly update that we gave, we did make the point &#x2013; we weren't specific obviously &#x2013; but we didn't make the point that our underlying business was performing strongly and that we were making market share gains, and so we indicated that that was the case.</p>
          <p>If we go back to December at the time that we made the announcement in regard to increased potential for bad debt expense, we had I think around four analysts who had forecasts out in the market as to what our half year results would be, and they were reasonably accurate at the time. But after we obviously released what was interpreted as a downgrade, because obviously we're going to have a greater cost in regard to bad and doubtful debts, there was obviously a situation where analysts reduced their expectations in regard to our forecast.</p>
          <p>And by the time we reached the situation Monday of last week and the decision we took then, there were then 10 analysts with their forecasts in the market, and all those had taken a somewhat more bearish position than had been the case previously or before. And as a result of that, we were left with a view that we obviously should advise the market. So I think that there was obviously a down rating of views, which was probably greater than we would have anticipated when we saw the forecasts for those 10 analysts that made up market consensus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I might make an observation first and then ask my two questions, but that it seems that you've turned your back on homeland, Ralph, only to Australian corporates now. But with respect to, couple of questions, firstly on slide 123 the regulatory expected loss, the growth of that &#x2013; of a billion dollars, half on half, outside of book growth, what are the key drivers you're seeing behind that?</p>
          <p>And second question with respect to taking advantage of opportunities as you've discussed today, I note with respect to slide 16, banking retail deposit growth &#x2013; retail deposit market share now up to about a third of the market. I'm just wondering whether or not you'd pass any comment with respect to how much headway you think you've got? In that respect how much of a barrier that might prove in terms of consolidation opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, obviously in regard to the additional blend in is 450 million in there from &#x2013; in regard to BankWest, and certainly that's based around expected loss numbers, rather than actual and incurred, but we obviously have got to go through the finalization of the acquisition accounting of that. So that is a reasonably significant number, and there is issues around granularity, and David probably can talk in a bit more detail about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Craig, the issue particularly here is, as you know, home loans are significantly penalized with this 20% hit in the regulatory expected loss calculation. So because our home loan growth has been so strong, that's led to growth in that particular category, which is the unprovided portion, so to speak. And that's the main component of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In regard to obviously deposit growth, the larger you get, the incremental growth does become obviously more difficult as you become a bigger proportion of the market. And so for us obviously, we have been very much a beneficiary in the last half, particularly before the implementation of the domestic government guarantee, of a strong inflow of funds from other sectors. We're obviously seeing growth that's coming from people that are obviously holding cash rather than investing in equities. And again, I think it comes down to the fact that we do have a very strong core franchise.</p>
          <p>But the issue in and around potential acquisitions and getting up to levels where we may have some competition issues if we were to look at other opportunities, that's obviously an issue. But as far as I'm concerned, organic growth comes at a much lower cost than acquired growth, generally.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross Brown from Deutsche Bank. If we can also cast our mind back to that fateful day in December, one of the other comments made then was a 60 basis point expected loan loss to average gross loans. You haven't mentioned that since, and you did flag that the first half would be higher, it's around 80 basis points. So given the review you did of your loan book, which identified no new problems, I'm assuming you're still comfortable with 40 basis points in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ross, as you know, this is a very sensitive issue. But I think that that's not a bad conclusion to draw, but we've obviously got 4 1/2 months to go. And at this stage, there's nothing that suggests to me to change that view, but I'm not going to cast that in stone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I then draw your attention to slide 110, which refers to the aptly named troublesome exposures, which excludes impaired exposures, and your footnote indicates that these have potential to default within 12 months, and there's been a material increase from June to December. And given these aren't existing impaired assets, so this is your pipeline of potential future defaulters. I sort of don't understand then, how you can expect your impaired or your loan loss between the halves to almost halve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to get into a debate over that at this point. I think we've obviously covered that in some degree, Ross, and obviously the outcome is going to be the outcome. But I think that the issue is we've gone through, and if you look at the 81 basis points, a substantial amount of that was the pre-existing issues or problems that we already knew in regard to single names, and that's come through. And so certainly, I don't want to get into a debate around the numbers right here and now, but certainly our view going forward is that I think that specific forecasting obviously has its perils.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just add one comment to that. Ross, obviously, using small font gray type and then giving you poor light in the room makes it difficult to read. That footnote says it includes the impaired assets, not excludes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Ben Koo, Goldman Sachs. Just a question on New Zealand. With the margin decline that we saw at the half and over the year-on-year in PCP is very dramatic and when you're looking at mortgage spreads in New Zealand right now relative to the swap curve, it seems like mortgage spreads should actually be expanding rather than contracting. Can you just give a bit more color on the New Zealand spread? And I've just got a broader follow-up question on capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's no doubt that in New Zealand there has been a significantly greater pressure in regard to mortgage margins. And you have a, obviously a very aggressive new entrant, which is obviously Kiwibank, which has been putting a lot pressure in that market. And I would suspect that going forward, because obviously this will be impacted by the ability of banks to fund, that in the New Zealand situation, I don't think that you will see a continuation of that sort of decline.</p>
          <p>I mean, there's no doubt that New Zealand is like Australia. It has a significant current account deficit that has to be funded by offshore borrowing, and that offshore done by banks. And so my view is that there will be a more rational approach to pricing over time in that market, and I hope it's sooner rather than later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a broader question on capital, with your Tier 1 ratio being very strong, 8.45 post-BankWest, that's well above &#x2013; it's a conservative number by Australian standards and well above any UK peers. We've seen downward pressure in the UK on Tier 1 ratios. What's your thinking on the capital ratio going forward if you do see a reduction in Tier 1 ratios globally? Is it something that CBA would consider seeing trimming down? What's the implication for dividend policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly our policy and determined by our Board is that we will hold a Tier 1 capital ratio of in excess of 7%. It's interesting to note the reaction of the central bankers around the world who are saying that these buffers should be regarded as cushions, that they should move up and down, they shouldn't be regarded at as being cement, and certainly that's a quotation from the head of the Canadian central bank. And certainly I think there's a view that central banks and governments around the world are wanting to see banks lend. And so I think that you will see, as confidence comes back into the industry worldwide, you will see a situation where those capital ratios will start to fall back to, not necessarily levels of the past, but levels that are closer to the past than they are currently.</p>
          <p>I think the situation at the moment is that a lot of capital buildup in various financial institutions, because of obviously the uncertain conditions and what it means as far as they get write-offs etc. in regard to the ability of banks to retain a reasonable level of capital. And you've got to remember that the minimum ratio is under Basel II is 4% and that on top of that obviously the Reserve Bank here in Australia makes a decision in regard to with &#x2013; I'm sorry ECA &#x2013; in regard to what is the appropriate level of minimum capital that the bank should hold. All of us have a confidential number in that regard, but with a significantly below the minimums that our Board policy suggests, and that's calculated individually for the bank. So each bank will have a different number based around the perceived risk in its portfolio and its mix. So I think we have a situation today where the market is taking a view that banks should hold high levels of capital because of the uncertainty, and so at the moment we do hold, I think, a very comfortable level of capital that I would see over time coming back closer to somewhere in the sevens, but that's going to be based around confidence.</p>

          <p>James Ellis from Credit Suisse. A question on bad debts and then also on capital. Look at risk of laboring this point, on the 60 basis points, the fact that it wasn't mentioned in the official releases would have suggested that necessarily in a tough environment that the guidance had been withdrawn, but listening to your answer to Ross's question a couple of minutes ago that that wasn't so clear. And then on capital, how much do you expect you'll benefit from the retail share purchase plan coming up and then further down the track from the Basel II accreditation within BankWest? You've given us obviously the number for the regulatory consolidation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think obviously, as far as the basis points are concerned on bad and doubtful debts, I've said that I don't really want to give any forecast in that regard. I think that that's pretty clear, but all I can say is that you shouldn't necessarily read that as the fact that there's been any substantial change since the end of December. Because certainly we've gone through and completed this process in regard to the 600-odd largest exposures that the bank has in its corporate and institutional bank outside of financial organizations, and at the same time we obviously have not seen anything of any concern in the last six weeks. So at this point I'm reasonably comfortable. I'm not going to give you a forecast because we do have 4.5 months obviously to go.</p>
          <p>In regard to the capital situation and BankWest, well, first the SBP, we'll see what will actually be taken up on that. I would suspect that there would be a pretty good commitment from our shareholders, our retail shareholder, to the SBP, so at this point it's still &#x2013; we don't know what is going to be till we've got it, but I'm reasonably confident it will be a significant number. And obviously in regard to the BankWest warrant submission Basel I to Basel II, that's going to have a, we would expect a positive impact, but David could make some ...</p>

          <p>I think actually we're expecting it to be roughly neutral. We haven't obviously we have only owned the business for a very short while, but our preliminary view is it's going to be pretty level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just following up on an earlier question on margins. On the liability side of the equation in deposits, I think if you look at the change in the cash rate they were very rapid towards the end of the period, and also you probably saw an uptick in the competition for those deposits once the guarantee came in place as well, again towards the end of the period. Therefore, I can understand why deposit spreads were only down a little bit during the period. If you then also think about housing loans were pretty much fully repriced during the period as well, there's probably less chances to reprice there as well. Can I get a feel on the spread and the margin that you saw in the first half, rolling that forward into the second half, who would have thought there is less opportunities for repricing versus more opportunities for downside on the deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we look at home loans for example, we're sitting at the moment 17 basis points below two of  the majors, and around about the same as the other. The issue for us obviously is &#x2013; and we've made it very clear &#x2013; that going forward we are not in a position to pass on the full level of production in OCR, and certainly if you look at our funding profile, we are about a third of the way through the rollover of our wholesale debt, and therefore that is going to be priced at a significantly higher level over time. And so that's going to have an impact on funding costs as well. So therefore, our ability to pass through these rates is going to obviously provide us with the ability to maintain our margin. In fact, we should be increasing our margin because our margin has actually fallen from where it was prior to this crisis.</p>
          <p>And it's interesting to note that if you look at mostly jurisdictions overseas, UK, US in particular, there has been significant interest rate reduction there, but they have not been passed on to any extent like the way they've been passed on in Australia. So therefore, I think that we do have some, a little bit of flexibility in and around the home loan margin.</p>
          <p>Deposits is obviously going to be challenging, but that's one of the reasons why we do have the replicating portfolio that will be providing us with gains over that period that, which will be directly related to deposit margin. And so that will soften that impact, and you'll see that over the second half in particular.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just secondly, on the capital, the first one, one time I can actually recall seeing your pro forma Tier 1 ratio. I just want to confirm the 8.75 includes the 30 basis points of BankWest. Does it also include the PERLS that are going to get redeem next month, which is another 30 basis points?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically we've already raised the funding for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It does. It's the position at the 31st of December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so that we'll probably say together, 8.15.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then &#x2013; not, not 8.15, it wouldn't be that low, but then of course there is ESPP....</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. Couple of questions on BankWest. Looking at the impaired assets, about 750 million also looks pretty high relative to the book, given that there's no institutional exposure there. Just wondering how that tracked relative to your initial thoughts and the trend in the last few months, and whether you've taken a significant additional overlay in terms of the collective provision against that? And the second part of the question was just where you are at in terms of the strategy on the East Coast with BankWest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two excellent questions. In regard to BankWest, part of the contractual arrangements with BankWest was with HBOS, and which has now been inherited obviously by Lloyds TSB, is that we will take possession  of an appropriately provisioned and appropriately capitalized bank. So going through, and there will be obviously price adjustments based around, obviously, provisioning, if provisioning is regarded as not being appropriate as at the time of acquisition. That process is in train right now, with the acquisition accounting going through. That is being done by KPMG. And on completion of that, there will be a review process undertaken by our auditors, PWC, to ensure that the capital position and the position in regard to bad and doubtful debts is appropriate. So what we had done is taken a further view based around expected loss on that portfolio. So I think you could &#x2013; your view is that that could be regarded as being reasonably conservative.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the East Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the East Coast we are in the process right now of reviewing that. We have a new Chief Executive appointed to BankWest who led every business here at Commonwealth Bank, Jon Sutton. We have Jason Clifton, who was in our PBS Finance team, who has taken on the role of Chief Financial Officer. And we have Peter Deans, who has come out of our Risk Group, taking on the role of Chief Risk Officer. So they are right up to their armpits in growth at the moment, obviously looking at all of the issues in and around finance accounting, risk and also strategy.</p>

          <p>Operator, are there any phone questions? No? We've got time for probably two more questions, I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one question on appendix five, trading income was up from 200 million PCP to 448 million. Just query, what type of trade income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Source there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like the other banks, we've seen very strong growth in our global markets business in serving customers with interest rate hedging and foreign currency hedging, both here and New Zealand. So, the major growth in that area is in that, and of course, some of the treasury gains that we referred to are there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that there's a significant number of customers who have moved business to us as a result of the fact that a number of international banks and investment banks have reduced their exposure to that sort of business in Australia. We've also seen a situation where a lot of clients who previously would have gone directly to capital markets for funding have seen that it's probably appropriate to make sure that they're giving us some of the other business that we probably wouldn't have been getting previously, from the point of view of providing debt facilities but also providing market facilities as well.</p>

          <p>A final question down here from Richard...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A second question, sorry. Just on terms of the loans overdue they've jumped up sharply from right about $4 billion, including 1.5 in non-retail, and yet you're still comfortable on the credit quality, and yet you're not concerned about those. Can you just give us some background to that large increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously it is a concern and you'll have seen that there was an uptick in the graphs on both 30 and 90-day arrears. The collective provision automatically increases for those, and so the increase in provision that you'll see in the retail bank is entirely due to what you've just referred to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Ralph, you've flagged the potential for a dividend cut at the full year. Could you just outline the relative importance of the number of factors you've taken that decision, including your desire to reach a sustainable payout ratio at this point in the cycle, how it would be seen as a signal for future profit expectations and also whether the absolute level of capital is an influence in coming up with the dividend in a certain period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, I think it's fair to say that obviously this was going to be an issue of some focus, the fact that we have held the interim dividend at $1.13. Obviously, we didn't want to make a binding commitment or leave people with the view that we were of the view that the final dividend would be kept at the same level as last year. We haven't made a decision on that. We won't make a decision on that, obviously, until we get to the end of the full year and understand exactly what the profit outcome is at that point and then the Board will take a view. But we thought it was prudent to just make sure the people clearly understood.</p>
          <p>A lot of retail investors, who are obviously very focused on dividend, that we wanted to make sure with an SBP coming up, etcetera, that the fact that we were paying an unchanged dividend at the half year did not necessarily mean that we would pay that same level of dividend in the second half. We may, we may not, but that will depend on the circumstances as they prevail at that time, and there are number of factors that obviously come into that, and some of those that you've touched upon.</p>
