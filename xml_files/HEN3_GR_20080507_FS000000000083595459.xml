          <p>Good day and welcome to the Henkel Conference Call. With us today are Kasper Rorsted, CEO, Lothar Steinebach, CFO and the Investor Relations team. For your information, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host Mr. Kasper Rorsted. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our conference call. Lothar Steinebach, our CFO and I would like to give you a brief summary of our performance in the first quarter of this fiscal. We will also be talking about our expectations for 2008 as a whole and then progress on our two major projects, the National Starch integration and Global Excellence. Afterwards, we will be glad to answer any of your questions.</p>
          <p>Please note that with regard to any forward-looking statement, the presentations and discussions are conducted subject to our usual disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call. Copies of the speech and presentation containing the formal disclaimer can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. This is the first time I am speaking to you in my new capacity. Communication with you is a particular importance for me and I look forward to additional opportunities such as this in the future.</p>
          <p>Naturally, I would have preferred to start in a more favorable economic environment. The financial markets are in depressed state, and in America, there are increasing signs of a mild recession. In addition, we of course are also affected by the weakness of the dollar and the high price of oil. Nevertheless, we are satisfied with the result we achieved in the first quarter of this year. Despite the adverse economic climate, we continued to grow. In our growth regions, organic growth was a very good 16.2%, earnings per share increased 6.3% and what's particularly important to me, the two projects National Starch and Global Excellence are progressing to plan.</p>
          <p>In specific terms, after adjusting for negative foreign exchange of 4%, we increased sales by 1.7%. Our organic growth, that is to say the increase in sales adjusted for foreign exchange, acquisition and divestments was 3.3% compared to a strong prior year quarter. At 320 million euros operating profit, our EBIT figure remaining at the same high level as in the previous year. After adjusting for foreign exchange, we improved our EBIT by 2.5%. Net earnings for the quarter after minority interest rose by 6.8% to 219 million euros. Earnings per preferred share increased by 6.3% to 0.51 euro cent.</p>
          <p>Now let me come to some of the topical issues affecting us, and in particular, the integration of the National Starch business. This project is the number one priority for us and we are giving it our utmost attention. As you know, the acquisition closed on April 3rd. On the very same day, we welcomed our new colleagues at over 50 sites throughout the world. At this event, we succeeded in personally addressing almost all of the more than 5,500 new employees. And moreover, it took us just four weeks to define and communicate the managerial positions of the new merged business. In all, around 120 managers were assigned to their new functions.</p>
          <p>The high speed at which the integration process is proceeding is also evident from another example. At numerous industrial shows that have taken place in the last four weeks, such as the World Adhesive Conference in Miami, we've already appeared as one company. We expect synergies from the merger to be around 250 million euros per year with the full synergy potential being realized from 2011 on. These figures compare with onetime charges of around 250 million euros.</p>
          <p>This acquisition has taken Henkel a major step forward. As did the acquisitions of Schwarzkopf, Loctite and Dial, and they put Henkel today far out in front as the world leading adhesive supplier. This is an advantage for both us and our customers who we can serve even better. Also a particular importance is the current fiscal year is of course the implementation of our worldwide Global Excellence program. In February, we established the framework for this initiative, which is aligned to enhance our efficiency and optimize our processes and structures.</p>
          <p>As you know, we've defined projects in all our business sectors, all our regions and all our functions. Through these, we intend to substantially strengthen the profitability and long-term competitiveness of Henkel. The initiatives will require onetime charges of approximately 500 million euros. Our calculations indicate that as a result, we will realize annual savings of 150 million euros from 2011 on. And we expect a major part of the annual savings to start accruing as early as next year. We anticipate that taken together, the Global Excellence program and the integration of National Starch business will generate annual savings of around 400 million euros from 2011 on with a large portion of this annual amount already accruing in 2010.</p>
          <p>Before I come to our outlook, I would just like to briefly mention the intended sale of all or part of our stake in Ecolab. The process we put in motion at the end of February is proceeding as planned. We will of course inform you as soon as details relating to the scope, date, method and form of divestment have been finalized.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to review our updated outlook for full fiscal 2008. We are confident that excluding the National Starch businesses, we will be able to meet the previously announced sales and profit targets. Taking into account the acquired National Starch business, our sales and profit forecast now reached as follows. We expect to achieve organic sales growth after adjusting for foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments of 3 to 4% points. We expect to increase operating profit adjusted for restructuring charges and onetime gains and charges in the mid teen percentage range. And we expect earnings per preferred share adjusted for restructuring charges and onetime gains and charges to increase in the mid single-digit percentage range. Included in this forecast are the initial savings arising from the Global Excellence program and the integration of National Starch businesses.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the end of my statement on performance in our first quarter 2008. Allow me now to summarize. We've started the new fiscal year well despite the challenging market environment characterized by rising raw material prices and a weak dollar. With the fast integration of National Starch business and our Global Excellence initiative, we further increased our global competitiveness. This way, we consistently expand our strong position in the consumer goods and industrial businesses and increase shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is now the end of my statement and I would like to hand over to Lothar Steinebach, CFO of Henkel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, also welcome from my end. As usual, we start my presentation with a thorough reading of our disclaimer, while I'll guide through the agenda of my presentation.</p>
          <p>First of all, we'll deal with sales and EBIT performance. Secondly, we'll take a look at the income statement. Thirdly, we'll give you an update on the National Starch acquisition. Fourth, an update on our Global Excellence program and finally an updated outlook for total 2008.</p>
          <p>I'll start with highlights of the first quarter of 2008. First of all, we have experienced organic sales growth of 3.3% with particular emphasis on sales growth in our emerging markets, plus 16.2% organically. We've progressed in our margin compared to our prior quarter by 130 basis points to 46.6%. That is pretty much in line with the first quarter of 2007. EBIT without foreign exchange effects plus 2.5%, adjusted EBIT to which we will take a look during my presentation minus 4.2%, earnings per share plus 6.3, adjusted earnings per share plus 2%.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we have been able at the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter to successfully close our National Starch acquisition. On April 3, we went through the exercise of closing the National Starch acquisition which will have a big impact on the Group and our year 2008. And finally, as an overview, we have defined the measures for our Global Excellence Program for improving our structures in the total Group.</p>
          <p>Let me start with sales growth by business sector and a brief look at the price volume composition of our total growth.</p>
          <p>As you can see, Laundry and Home Care have grown organically by 2.8% of which 0.8 is price impact and 2% volume impact. Personal Care has grown 6.1% of which 1.8 is price, 4.3 is volume. And finally, growth machine of our past years, Adhesives Technology has grown 2.4% organically with 2.9 coming from price and a setback in volume of 0.5%. That's obviously due to the fact that we have emphasized margin retention and improved our mix in that business driving prices and as opposed to driving volume. Total Henkel Group with total growth of minus 2.3%, exchange rate adjusted 1.7 which obviously results in a negative impact from the exchange rates of 4% on the total company.</p>
          <p>Take a look at the Laundry and Home Care division first, organic growth of 2.8%. We have made progress particularly in adjusting prices in the emerging markets and we have increased our situation in Western Europe and North America. We do expect to be able to continue with our drive which is increasing our prices during the rest of this year. Strong organic sales growth in our Personal Care division, 6.1%. That is even beyond the level of 2007, the average level of 2007. So, we've continued with our dynamic in the Personal Care division through the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>As you have observed, we have a significant pricing impact in this total growth of 1.8%, which is obviously due to the fact that we have made price increases in the second half of last year. We do expect to have continued pricing activities although on a lower level than what we have experienced in the end of last year. We have been able to increase prices more in emerging markets where we are enjoying very strong market positions particularly in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Growth in our Adhesives division again was impacted by a very strong prior year quarter. First quarter of 2007 with 9.1% organic sales growth was a strong comparable against which Adhesives Technologies has been working in the first quarter of 2008. And we've also communicated in the first quarter of 2007 that we had an unusually mild winter which has increased our organic sales growth in 2007 beyond the normal level. So in other words, some of the positive one-offs, one may call it that way, have not been present in the first quarter of 2008. We have implemented price increases in order to pass on raw material price increases and that accounts for the big impact from pricing in the total growth. Pricing increases has been continuous throughout the first quarter of 2008 and we do expect to continue with our pricing activities through the full year of 2008.</p>
          <p>Brief look at organic growth and growth in our regions. First of all, Europe, Africa and Middle East, we have adjusted for foreign exchange effects 1.7 and organic sales growth 4.2. Obviously, that regional delineation includes Eastern Europe with a stronger impact from Eastern Europe. North America, 3.1 both organic and FX adjusted. Latin America 8.8, basically the same FX adjusted and organic and Asia Pacific almost double digit. Therefore, results in a look at our emerging markets, share of sales and also organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>We have again experienced double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets, and that may remind you, it's Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia excluding Japan. So, again strong a performance and that in turn was driven by all business divisions with all business divisions contributing to a double-digit organic sales growth for all divisions' double-digit sales growth. We've achieved a sales share for the total company, 35% and that's very much in line with the increasing development and increasing share of sales of emerging markets in the Henkel Group over the past one and a half years. And it's also a good reminder that we had targeted the sales share of 30% for 2008 and are well above that and we continue to drive organic sales growth quite strongly in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth by business sector. First of all, Laundry and Home Care, Personal Care and Adhesives Technologies compared to prior year quarter Q1 '07 we have change in, without foreign exchange effects in the Laundry and Home Care division by minus 8.4% resulting in an EBIT margin of 10.1, that's a change of 80 basis points. The same increased 80 basis points for Personal Care to 12.5% and Adhesives Technology with slight increase of 60 basis points. Obviously, that includes a one-off in the first quarter. Of the total company, we've had a negative exchange rate impact of 3.4% on our EBIT.</p>
          <p>With respect to Laundry and Home Care, the negative minus 80 basis points results from the significant raw material cost increase which had not been fully offset in the first quarter. And I mentioned earlier that we intend to have pricing activities during the rest of this year, particularly in the second half of this year. And therefore, we do expect for the full year that we will be able to increase at least most of the raw material price increases also in that division.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings as we have reported in the past, we are adjusting EBIT by onetime gains and restructuring charges. And if you look at adjusted EBIT 2007, we ended up at 332, and Q1 2008 in the same structure ends up at 318 with a change of minus 4.2%. Looking at the adjusted EBIT margin, it's a decrease by 20 basis points, the same calculation now for net earnings, adjusted net earnings after minorities adjusted with the same parameters that I've described for EBIT results in an increase by 3.3% and adjusted earnings per share by 2%.</p>
          <p>Look at the income statement, let me look at the gross margin first. As I mentioned earlier, it's about at the same level that we had experienced in first quarter of 2007, 10 basis points below the first quarter of 2007. Major impact is from higher raw material packaging costs which had been almost offset over that period of time by higher output prices, higher prices to our customers, but nevertheless, we will continue to work towards increasing again for the rest of this year in all our divisions.</p>
          <p>Gross profit to EBIT, change in net other operating income and charges, that's a minor item given on a full-year basis, that's a special gain from the divestment of the water treatment business which we have divested in the first quarter of this year. The divestment as such is obviously due to the fact that we do not expect to be able to eventually turn this water treatment from an isolated interesting business into a core business of Henkel. And therefore, we have divested the water treatment business earlier in the first quarter with a gain of 8 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Change in the financial results, financial result has improved by 36%. Financial result broken down into the investment result, that's very much the &#x2013; our equity income from our Ecolab participation which has remained unchanged while it has increased in US dollars. US dollar has decreased over the prior year's period in the first quarter of 2007. So therefore, there is no change. The change in net interest is very much due to the positive effect from decreased net financial debt. I think that it is important to note that we look at the average or need to look at the average financial debts in the first quarter as opposed to the same period last year which was significantly lower than the same period in last year. So at the end of the first quarter, we have increased our net debt and therefore, the balance sheet information that you will find is a little bit higher than last year, that's at the end of last year I should say. That is due to the fact that we have an anticipation of providing the financing for the National Starch acquisition, already end of March, taken on additional debts. We have issued commercial paper in order to enter the market and then be prepared for paying for purchase price on closing. So therefore, the average level of debt has been lower during the first quarter, and the quarter end level is higher than at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Development of net working capital that again shows positive development. We have set out in the first quarter of 2005 with 18.3% and then decreased year-on-year first quarter 2008 at 13%. That again results in a higher generation of cash which otherwise would have occurred. And therefore, it has been an important element in our managing of our cash flow.</p>
          <p>Short update on the National Starch acquisition, as I mentioned at the very beginning, we have closed the transaction on April 3rd that therefore constitutes the consolidation date for this activity. We've paid the purchase price which was quoted in British pounds, 2.7 billion British pounds. And there is as a result of some hedging activity, we have translated that amount into 3.7 billion euro. We've conducted welcome sessions around the world which have been highly appreciated by the National Starch personnel, and we have indicated to the personnel that as from day one, then our Henkel personnel and there is no differentiation between the two organizations going forward. We have appointed the management levels one and two for the new organization, now more appointments to be following through and we have confirmed our savings targets from realizing the synergies that we had defined when setting out to conclude the transaction.</p>
          <p>That's the way we financed the purchase price and paid the purchase price on April 3rd, 3.7 billion euro as I mentioned earlier.  We had issued additional commercial paper, about 300 million.  We've utilized about 800 million of our existing cash and the 2.6 billion remainder have been financed through two tranches of bank loans, one tranche with the duration of 12 plus, 12 months and another tranche of 6 plus, 6 months, totaled 2.6 billion euro, giving us long flexibility to refinance the purchase price obviously from a number of activities that are going on amongst others, intended disposition of all or part of Ecolab.</p>
          <p>That's the first impression of the welcome sessions that have been conducted at National Starch, and I think it is apparent that the National Starch personnel have been receiving and looking forward to be integrated into the new Henkel organization very much.</p>
          <p>Now that's an update on the savings that we expect on the National Starch integration.  We have communicated expected savings of between 240 and 260 million.  In other words, in average, or midpoint of 250 million euro per annum starting from 2011. Now, we will be realizing first savings in the year 2008.  Our current expectation is 10 million. And we will build up savings over the next three years to reach the total of 250 million.</p>
          <p>Our expectation for next year at this point in time is round about 100 million, and for the year 2010, our expectation is 225 million.  We still expect to take a restructuring charge in the range of 250 million euro, to be taken this year.  We don't know exactly what quarter it will be, but it certainly will be this year.</p>
          <p>The way forward from making that integration, we will implement the findings from the so-called clean rooms.  Clean rooms are those rooms where both parties have delivered their information which we did not have access to because of the competitive situation prior to closing the transactions.  We have launched joint integration teams, which are now working towards defining the new organization in detail and obviously at the same time, not lose sight of their normal job that is to sell products.</p>
          <p>We will announce the organization for all management levels, capture first synergies of around 10 million from day 100 and to keep focus on the existing business that is very much true for both organizations, which eventually will be merged into one organization.  In summary, the integration process is well underway and we do expect to be able to reach our targets that we have defined for this project.</p>
          <p>An update on Global Excellence, we have defined when we communicated our Global Excellence program that we expect to take the charge, that is total volume of expenses and investments that are needed to realize the ideas that we had of -- in total 500 million euro.  First of all, allocation of projects by business sector, we do expect on the basis of what we have been able to work through so far, 31% of the projects to be Laundry &amp; Home Care projects, 34% Cosmetics and Toiletries, Adhesives Technologies 20% and corporate 15%, corporate functions I should say.  That is based on already specifically defined projects and the volume of more than 300 million.</p>
          <p>Adhesives Technologies seems to be lower than the others compared to its size but that's due to the fact that major part of the restructuring in Adhesives Technologies will be due to the integration of National Starch and therefore, the big chunk of restructuring as a result of National Starch will augment all the actions that we are taking for the total group and Adhesives Technologies.</p>
          <p>By region, major part of our Adhesives -- Global Excellence program will be in Europe, Africa, Middle East 65% according to our current expectation, 6% in Asia-Pacific, North America close to 30%.  Total Global Excellence program restructuring charge of 500 million still in our expectation will be composed of about 350 million cash out that is around 70% and special depreciation or special write-offs of 150 million constituting about 30%.  So that's been our expectation going into the program and that's been our -- the results of the projects that we've worked our way through already.</p>
          <p>Savings in Global Excellence, how do we ramp-up our savings that we expect from the Global Excellence program to the total of 150 million, which we again expect to be able to realize in 2011. There again we do expect to be able to realize the first savings in 2008 with about 10 million, so minor part obviously lots of actions will be taken but the major impact will not be in this year.  First major impact will be in 2009 with expectation of about 100 million, 2010 about 125 million, and then the total in 2011.  Again the total restructuring charge will be booked in 2008 and we will ramp-up the savings or at least we'll give an update on some minor changes, which may occur as we work our way through all the projects.</p>
          <p>Update on the total outlook, first of all based against or seen against the trading conditions, for North America we do expect a mild recession.  That obviously is something which has been debated for quite a bit of time.  The mood in North America tends to be quite subdued.  We do however see that objective data are not as bad as the mood and therefore my expectation is that the recession will be there, but it will be less pronounced than what might have been visible at the very beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>Western Europe will continue to grow albeit at a slower pace than in the years before with further dynamic expansion in the emerging markets.  We've not seen any slowdown there and for the time being we do not expect to see a slowdown.</p>
          <p>With respect to raw material and packaging cost development, we continue to stick to our outlook of middle -- mid-single digit increase, which however in this case may be more at the higher part of mid-single digits than we might have expected at when going into the year.  Overall, the total environment will be more challenging, less growth, strong impact from raw material and packaging cost somewhat mitigated by weak dollar but again the weak dollar is not positive for us.</p>
          <p>Therefore, results in a more detailed outlook for the sales development of Henkel, 3 to 4% of organic sales growth.  We do expect the same for the National Starch business that we consolidate for the quarters through &#x2013; two through four of 2008, 3 to 4% organic sales growth. Reported EBIT Henkel as you can see and as we have given in the quarter one statement, reported 1.344 billion.  Adjusted for one-time gains and restructuring charges resulted in adjusted EBIT of 1.370.  That again looking or given out &#x2013; giving an outlook on 2008, we do not expect more one-time gains. At this point in time we do obviously take the restructuring charges together.  That's the 500 million that we have communicated for Global Excellence, round about 250 million for National Starch and then an additional 20 to 30 that we expect from the normal business that therefore then results in total restructuring charges of 770 to 780 million.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT based on the 1.370 billion euro EBIT in the mid-teens and adjusted earnings per share based on earnings per share of 2.19 euro per share, again in the mid-single digit.  All of this needs to be understood pre a potential sale of Ecolab, which obviously then would have one-time implications but also changes in financial results.  It is also pre-purchase price allocation because that is something which is very difficult to predict if not impossible, and also tax implications that may result from our restructuring programs and other one-time activities, which we need to work through in more detail in order to be able to define the tax implications.  So all of this is now taken out from our outlook.</p>
          <p>What are our priorities in 2008?  Obviously integrating National Starch remains our top priority, offsetting raw material price increases in all our divisions particularly in Adhesives but also detergents remains at the top of our list. We'll continue to execute Global Excellence, our restructuring program, continue to work towards disposal of non-core assets particularly in order to finance or refinance our major acquisition and we will communicate as we have observed earlier, new elements of our strategy and financial targets of November 6 in London when Kasper Rorsted will have his first big appearance in front of you and the remainder of the interested community.  Our major summary therefore is we will continue to lever on our promise and we will continue to deliver on the outlook.</p>
          <p>Thank you and that opens now the line for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I have two questions.  My first question is on your new guidance. If I look at the guidance on the EPS level you are now looking at mid-single digit EPS growth, and prior you were saying that EPS will grow obviously towards another base that above organic growth.  Now looking a bit into more detail, it would suggest that at best ICI addition to your earnings is at best neutral and I was wondering why was that, I think that when you communicated on EBIT you had said that it will be earning financing from year one.  So could you may be -- you gave us your assumption for synergy, which is 10 million this year.  Could you give us may be your assumption as well for the financing cost or maybe if I'm mistaken does it mean that maybe something in the Henkel business is slightly below what you anticipated at the beginning of the year, that's my first question.  My second question is on Technology Adhesives, I wanted to, just to clarify that basically, the 8 million exceptional gain from the water treatment was as well booked in the 60 basis point margin expansion of the Adhesive performance and margin performance in Q1.  And if you could as well kindly give us ICI performance in the first quarter both in terms &#x2013; the National Starch business that you've acquired in terms of sales and margin, that could be very nice.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with guidance on the mid-single digits which in your calculation then results in the additional earnings from the National Starch acquisition to be only neutral.  I think that you need to take into account that the closing of the National Starch did not occur until April. So therefore, we will have only nine months of earnings from National Starch. And therefore, the additional operating earnings that we generate through National Starch will be lower than what we initially expected based on a full year.  With respect to our expectation for the interest result, the impact from the financing, which we expect at this point in time is in the range of 140 million euro based on the 3.7 that we need to -- needed to finance.</p>

          <p>Yes, 140 million yes.  There is no impact or no expectation from our end just to confirm into the Henkel base business that there is a negative development over the time that we made the initial outlook in February.  With respect to the next question, which was actually two questions, but we will take it anyway.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's the 8 million which is obviously not booked in basis points, but it's in EBIT, so that's in the first quarter for the Adhesives division and it is also contained in other operating income.  On an annual level, that's not a large number, but in the first quarter, it's obviously impacting -- positively impacting the EBIT margin of UA or Adhesives Technologies business.  With respect to National Starch first quarter, we don't have that, the level of information and quality of information that we have for our own business.  So therefore, I will refrain from being as specific as we are on our own business.  The information that we have seen is that sales have been pretty flat, and that margin has been down slightly.  So I cannot at all tell that this is based on the same quality of information that we generate for our own business. So therefore, the more important aspect for us is whether there is a development in the business or in the markets, which are negative, and then have an impact on us because obviously what National Starch or ICI did in the first quarter is of no impact to us.  It's important what remains with us, and therefore may have an impact either negative or positive on us.  So therefore, we have looked at what is going on in the markets in which National Starch has been active, which obviously as you know are the same markets in which we have our activities.  We've seen a slight downturn in the electronics markets in the first quarter.  Our expectation for the full year is that this will recover, and we will see growth in the electronic markets for the full year.  So therefore, that's not a concern to us.  We've also seen weakness in North America in the markets, and that again is something which we've seen to a less extent in our own business.  And therefore for a full year, our expectation is that we will be able to realize the outlook that we have provided for National Starch before we concluded the acquisition, which I have reiterated right now. With respect to, what else did you ask, I think that was it.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions from me.  The first is on the input cost environment.  You mentioned again that you expect that the guidance of mid single-digit increases on cost of goods sold of 4.8 billion is still valid despite the increased input cost environment.  Could you please clarify why you still expect between 4 and 6% cost of goods sold increases?  Are you offsetting it somewhere else?  The second question is on Laundry.  We've seen the negative impact on EBIT.  Is this just the first quarter impact or are there some impacts going to continue in the second and third quarter because you mentioned that in the second half, pricing will catch up.  So maybe you can clarify, should we be looking still at margins of 11.1 for the full business for the full year in Laundry or not?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  First of all with respect to input costs, let me perhaps explain a little bit more in detail what we mean when we look at input cost.  First of all, we look at raw materials, which is roundabout 3.3 billion euro.  We look at packaging materials which is a little bit more than 1 billion.  We look at finished materials results and we also look at services.  That's the total of our spend on which we apply the percentages that we've been giving as an outlook. Obviously, raw materials have a stronger increase than for example packages, which have a lower increase, and again services has different dynamics from the other elements that I mentioned.  So, this all in all together, that's our spend on which we look at in order to determine what the input price impact will be on the business going forward.  And we've given the outlook, 46% when going into the year.  And I mentioned that based on a higher oil price than what we had anticipated and by the weaker US dollar which mitigates that impact, we do expect still to be within that outlook because the impact of the higher oil price or the derivatives, the higher prices of derivatives will be just on the pack, on the -- sorry on the raw material section of what I described and to the lesser extent on the packaging part.  And therefore, we will be able to counter-manage some of the impact of rising derivative prices, and that's why we believe we'll be able to stick with our guidance although I mentioned that we'd probably end up at the upper end of our guidance rather than at mid or lower end. That's with respect to input costs.  With respect to Laundry, negative impact on EBIT, there again, we've had an impact from raw material prices in the first quarter, which is quite an impact on the Laundry and Home Care sector, and we've also obviously worked against very strong comparable in the first quarter of last year in which we had a strong sales increase, which we did not experience in the first quarter of this year and did not expect to be experiencing.  So therefore, the negatives have come together in one quarter and that's why EBIT impact has been negative. That's not our expectation for the full year.  We do not -- obviously do not provide margin outlook for business unit, but we'll certainly end up better than in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello.  Two questions, first on the raw material, second on price increases.  The raw material cost increased in the first quarter, can you quantify the volume in terms of, in euro terms as well as in percentage wise?  And secondly, the price increases, you mentioned that you will continue with price increases in the course of the year.  Does that mean that you will accelerate to 2.0% price increase effective first quarter in the remainder of the year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's with respect to the raw material price increases, as I mentioned earlier, our guidance is towards our spend, which is not just raw materials, it's also packaging, it's also finished products and its services.  So that's the total volume that we look at, and I mentioned it's 3.3 plus 1 billion plus about 1.1 for the other.  So that adds up to 4.3 &#x2013; 5.4. 5.4 billion is the basis, and the mid single digits that we have provided as an outlook for the full year has also been experienced in the first quarter. So that's with respect to input cost rises. With respect to price increases, may I remind you that the numbers that we have provided, that's the total growth impact from prices. So therefore, that's not necessarily the price increases. However, and I will mention that in more detail, we'll be taking or we will be continuing to take pricing actions which will be in the range of 2 to 4% in the Adhesives sector, will be lower in the Personal Care sector. And as I mentioned with emphasis on the second half year, there will be price increases in the Laundry and Home Care sector as well which then obviously since they take effect only in the second half will have a lesser impact on the full year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon. Just a simple question actually. You had an adjusted EBIT which was down 4% in the first quarter. Making some few calculations on your guidance, you're implying for the rest of the year an EBIT excluding National Starch of 6% growth. So what is the big difference between the first quarter and the rest of the year if there is any just to understand how you change selling your, let's say, pace. And second, in your guidance, I guess there is also an assumption on the dollar if we could have an indication on that. And I'm sorry just a third question, if you can, on the tax rate, if you can, we can expect this to be as low as in the first quarter for the rest of the year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think you are comparing two things which are not comparable. Our outlook which we've provided in February was based on foreign exchange adjusted EBIT. The outlook we are now providing is as reported; so that's not directly comparable. Second question, assumption for the US dollar, assumption for the US dollar, I don't know to what you refer, maybe you refer to our input price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean -- I guess that you're expecting a dollar at certain range to put for your guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do expect that the impact, the foreign exchange impact which is not just the dollar, but other currencies which is currently in the first quarter 4%, this remains at about that level. And then finally, tax question. We do expect that and that's been our guidance that the tax rate for the full year will be between 25 and say 26%, so pretty much the same level that we had in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to make it clear in my first question, perhaps I wasn't clear enough. You have 1.37 billion of basis in 2007 of EBIT, and you say mid-teens growth for '08 which, if we add the, let's say four, three quarters of National Starch which is 150 million roughly means that roughly 50 million of growth for the remaining of the year in terms of EBIT while in the first quarter you went from 332 to 318 adjusted. So, I was just wondering if there is any particular change that explains this change in impact of growth. Sorry, if repeat it, I don't know if you understood my question now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Firstly, some questions on especially the Laundry segment. How do you assess the inventory situation in your retail channels, and of the marketing increase you had, was that primarily related to Laundry or how was the split of this increase? And secondly on pricing in Adhesives, we see at some competitors a slowing momentum of price increases. How certain or how comfortable do you feel concerning the pricing outlook for distribution and do you not have to accelerate actually your pricing increases in order to make up for these accelerating raw material prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the first question, inventory in retail, I am not sure I understand what exactly you're driving at. There is not particular -- there is not particular development of which we are aware, there is no particular buildup in inventory. And also what we see is that sales development in the retail channel is not, I mean the markets are not growing in the mature countries. But they are growing strongly in the emerging countries. So from that perspective, there is no particular negative development, which would tend to affect inventories in the retail channels. With respect to the increase in marketing costs, we've increased our marketing costs, and both our major divisions will have an impact in the marketing costs with a bigger emphasis on cosmetics and toiletries. Pricing for Adhesives, do we have to accelerate or I think your question was also whether we could execute pricing activities in the first place. First of all, it is entirely possible that with the pricing activities, we do have a negative impact on volume. We've seen that in the first quarter. And therefore it's something which we need to manage very carefully, but obviously we will use to manage our business very carefully. Our current expectation is that we will continue to be able to pass on price increases, to execute price increases particularly in the Adhesive sector. We've not seen a slowdown of magnitude that others may have expected or may have feared. So therefore, the industrial markets are still growing. We've seen a weakness in the electronics sector in the first quarter which I alluded to earlier, but apart from that, there is no particular sign that there is breakdown in the economic environment imminent. From our perspective, and that's been something which has been perhaps different between Europe, Asia and the US, we still see quite a dynamic activity particularly in emerging counties, but also in Europe.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Andrew Wood with Sanford Bernstein here. Two questions. Firstly relating to the savings of 250 million that you're now guiding to from the National Starch acquisition. When you originally announced the acquisition, I understood that that was a synergies figure. You're talking in terms of, about three quarters of that would be cost savings, and about a quarter would be top-line synergies. Now, you're specifically talking about savings of &#x20AC;250 million, and you're talking about the timing of that savings. I am wondering whether or not there has been a change in the expense of the cost savings or the split between cost savings and acquisition synergies, or is this just a communication interpretation issue? Secondly relating to the Global Excellence plan, you had promised to explain to investors what you're going to spend &#x20AC;500 million on. All we have is a regional split and a business line split. I was wondering if you would be able to give us more detail on what types of projects you have in terms of looking at your infrastructure, SG&amp;A, headquarter cost reductions, number of employees affected and so on, particularly given of course that you already identified for your figures over 60% of the project as we sit here today. And if you can't give us that detail, when might you be able to do that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, welcome Andrew, first of all, the 250 in National Starch, that's not change in communication just to be sure. We communicated the 240 to 260. We just now stick with one number. It may still be 245 or 255. That's not what we plan on doing to kind of nail down ourselves on 250. That's just the number, and as you might imagine, that's still based on big numbers for big projects. The division between cost and top-line synergies has also not changed. That may be in the future, but that currently is not something which we have worked our way through. Right now, we still expect a quarter of it to be top-line synergies and three quarters to be cost synergies. As we get more detail, we'll communicate this obviously. Similarly, with respect to Global Excellence, we've given you a split on the regions. Obviously, we could also give more detail on the types of projects. Let me describe it as such &#x2013; as follows. It is composed of a number of projects that relate to changes in our markets. That is to say in some of our production environment, our current production capabilities I should say, we have observed that markets are changing and that therefore we need to adapt our production capacity to the new demands of our customers. So that's kind of taking into account changes in the market environment thereby reducing production capacity in a particular area and moving to what the market then wants in the future.</p>
          <p>The second is simple rationalization. That is to say we've been working our way through a number of our organizations, that is true of sales and marketing, it's also true of SG&amp;A, other organizations. And we've determined that again was done with benchmarking our organization against our peers with the help of outside consultants. We determined that we should be able and will be able to reduce the total number of head counts that we have in that particular organization and still do the same job with respect to our markets. So that's rationalization that ends up in a lower number of head count in particular organizations and still permits us to do the job that we've done in the past.</p>
          <p>And the third element is shared services. We've communicated on many other occasions that we are working towards shared services, particularly in the finance organization, but we've also determined that we can employ shared services in HR. We can employ shared services in the IT organization. So therefore in all the administrative functions, we will be able to employ shared services resulting again in probably a modest reduction of head count, but a much lower cost base because we are moving shared services into the two locations that we have established for that purpose; one in the Philippines, the other in the Slovak Republic. So, we've established the locations already. The location in the Philippines is already working for our US operations and we'll continue with that. That's the type of projects that we are working on. The more detailed particular information of our projects will be first disclosed to the employees and their organizations. That's required and that anyway could style the way we'd been operating in the past and will continue to operate in the future. So once we've done that, we will give an update on where exactly we are doing this. We do expect to be able to give an update then for the second quarter. That will include probably the rest of the portfolio in more detail.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. The first one is just to clarify a bit more on the National Starch guidance. You're looking for around 140, 150 million a year as a profit from that business in the final nine months of 2008. And can you just quantify roughly what you think the comparative figure in 2007 was for that period? And secondly, on your second quarter trading more generally, I remember at the full year results meeting, you mentioned that Q1 was likely to be unusually weak. Are there any sort of particular observations you can make on your second quarter trading at this particular juncture? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, with respect to National Starch, I believe it has been reported that National Starch, and I should say the businesses that we've purchased from ICI, it's not total National Starch, it's just the Adhesives and Electronic Materials business, head and trading profit, that is comparable to EBIT as far as we're concerned about, of about &#xA3;140 million in 2007 which translated into about &#x20AC;200 million trading profit for the full year of 2007. And that obviously then translates into nine months. That's an easy calculation. There again, we will have to look in more detail at what the FX impact on that number will be in the remainder of 2008, but our expectation is that as this will grow again towards or compared to 2007, there will be a negative impact from foreign exchange. Remind you that our outlook is without FX impact. So therefore, that's as reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, but it sounds to me that basically you're not expecting a huge improvement in the underlying profitability of this business in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed not for 2008. That would be pretentious because the major job in 2008 will be to preserve the business as is, and integrate it into the Henkel organization. So therefore, that's not the time to improve the underlying business indeed. Your second question was kind of relating to the second quarter and trading conditions. I've given the outlook on the trading conditions for the full year. We do not see anything in the second quarter which would obviously otherwise I wouldn't have done it, which tends to give me a reason not to believe that the second quarter will be different from the trading outlook that I'd provided for the full year.</p>

          <p>Hi there, good afternoon. Just a point of clarification on your expectations for the growth of the adhesives market. I just wanted to make sure you are reiterating you expect that market to grow around 3 to 4% for this year. I think that's what you alluded to earlier in the quarter, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's -- what I would say though is that that does not refer to the total adhesives market. That refers to those parts in the adhesives market in which we are represented. But then, the answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So no change, are you able to say how that market performed in the first quarter because I mean it looks like you are running behind that number? Now clearly, you have a very tough comp which gets easier for you through the course of the year and pricing which you expect to come through. I was wondering how much of your expectations of that growth to improve through the course of the year is based on market or how much of it is price, how much of it is comparison?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the first quarter, I don't have any particular figures on the market. What I have tried to describe is that we have had a negative impact in North America from first of all the weakness in the market, which is there and won't change that I have described earlier. And also we've been attempting at disposing of part of our consumer and craftsmen business in North America which did not go through. So therefore, that was not helpful for that particular business. So there is a little mix of let's say some special impacts and also some of the market impact. But for the full year, we not negative, not pessimistic on the market.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, just two quick questions. I appreciate earlier on, you said that all of your divisions were growing double-digits in emerging market. Wondering if you could tell us about the Adhesives division whether it was growing faster than the Group average of 16%, maybe in line or below the numbers, so that's my first question. Second question is if I have a look on your priorities slide, can I assume by the absence of it that acquisitions are not a priority for 2008. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to our Adhesives business in the emerging markets, that was a little bit higher than the average, but not significantly. So that that's within the range of the 16 that we've reported as organic growth. Second question, I did not understand it very well, but I thought you were asking whether we were doing acquisitions in this year. And obviously, as we do not comment on any specific acquisitions, I think it's time for us to integrate and we'll focus on Global Excellence and National Starch integration.</p>

          <p>Okay, we have one last question from Harold Thompson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just say thank you. Yes good afternoon everyone. I've just got two quick questions for me, one for Lothar and one for Kasper if I may. From a financial perspective Lothar, you've said that the interest charge relating to the debt for Natural Starch would be &#x20AC;114 million. I think you said the interest charge for the ongoing business would be around 70 million for this full year. How come is there such a substantial step down in interest cost this year on the core business given the big cash outflows to pay for the restructuring? And the second financial question effectively is on depreciation. As always, when you restructure, there is an element of depreciation write-down. So what will be you think the depreciation charge for the Group this year? And my question for Kasper if I may, given that you're an expert on input costs and supply chains and so on in your formal role at Henkel, can you maybe try and help us understand from the outside how contracts with suppliers are evolving in terms of how long they last and how direct the impact of oil prices which we may look on our screen can have on your end business on a quarterly or six-monthly basis? And maybe if you can help us in that field, that will be extremely useful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Harold, I was worried that you wouldn't ask a question, so thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The interest charge, a big cash out for restructuring, we do not expect to have a big cash out this year for the restructuring. Most of it will be a provision, but most of the cash out will not occur until next year. So therefore, that's not been factored into the base business. Second, depreciation charge for this year, we still look at the 150 million which I communicated earlier. Right now, there is no change in that. There might be if we determine that we &#x2013; based on the projects that we are working on are not worth it, then the number may still change, but for the time being, that's our expectation, the 150 million out of the 500.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My question was more what your Group depreciation charge will be this year given that you're writing down some depreciation through restructuring. That was more my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I don't know yet frankly. We'll most probably be able to give an update on that after the second quarter. That depends obviously then on the timing when we take charge, when and if we take charge, that's something which we need to take a look at more closely because if we do it in the second quarter, it will be having a different impact from when we were doing it in the third quarter. But we will provide an update on that once we worked our way through. Second question to Kasper, obviously he would like to answer the question, but since I am now responsible for purchasing, I'll answer it anyway. First of all...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can let you. I guess what we're trying to get to is, I look at the oil price going up...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's gone up substantially based in dollars and euros. You've told us repeatedly that about a third of your input costs are oil related. And we basically want to get a feel how quickly is the effect going through to your business, and what kind of contracts have you got, and have the timing of those contracts changed over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the timing of the contract is that, about a third of the contracts have longer duration than six months. So, the other part is more short-term oriented, about a third is longer than six months. For the increase in pricing to take impact in our numbers, that's between six and nine months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that gives you plenty of time to raise prices in the meantime, is that what you are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously that's one thing. The other thing is we tend to take price increases once it hits us rather than taking price increases provisionally. In other words, there is always a time delay nevertheless despite what I've explained, there is a time delay between the price increases taking impact in our numbers and then passing on the price increases. While one could obviously argue with our customers that we do experience the price increase in nine months and therefore we want to increase our prices today, that's not something which they take lightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Can I ask one additional question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last one &#x2013; clearly, you're debt financing National Starch for the moment which is a charge of 140 million. When you will sell some or all of Ecolab, is the costs to your P&amp;L of using Ecolab versus debt higher or lower than debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our initial expectation that this is &#x2013; that it's going to be a wash, but that then obviously depends on when exactly we're doing a transaction and whether it's some or all. So, that will have an impact on that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
