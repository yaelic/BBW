          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2008 Simon Property Group Inc. Earnings Conference Call.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another strong quarter. And I would like to just take a few minutes at this time to review highlights for the quarter and then we'll open the call up for your questions. Third quarter FFO, fund from operation, was</p>
          <p>$1.61 per share, up 10.3% over the prior year. All of our property platforms continue to perform well. Occupancy in the mall portfolio was 92.5% as compared to 92.7% in the year earlier period.  Despite the fact that square footage lost to bankruptcy for the first nine months of 2008 totaled 435,000 square feet as compared to 53,000 square feet during the first nine months of 2007. Our Premium Outlet portfolio remains nearly fully leased at 98.8%. Comparable sales in the mall portfolio was $493 per square foot, up 0.04% as compared to the year earlier period. Sales have been affected by the weak U.S. economy. Premium Outlet sales growth remains strong, increasing 4.2% to $520 per square foot, driven by our centers with substantial international tourist exposure as well as the U.S. consumer seeking value. Comparable property NOI was up 3.1% for the mall portfolio and 6.6% for the Premium Outlet portfolio for the nine months ended September 30. The re-leasing spread of our mall portfolio was $8.65 for the first nine months, representing 23.6% increase. The releasing spread for our Premium Outlet portfolio was $13.02,  representing a strong 49.4% increase</p>
          <p>We recently completed significant re-developments at Tacoma Mall in Tacoma Washington, University Park in Mishawaka, Indiana, and started construction on our <mark type="inaudible" /> Premium Outlet Center in Japan. In the last month, Nordstrom has opened new stores at the Fashion Mall at Keystone in Indianapolis, Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh, and Tacoma. And this week, we will open the fully leased expansion of Orlando Premium Outlets, and next week we will open Jersey Shore Premium Outlets, which is over 90% leased. We will continue to remain diligent in allocating capital only to those projects that meet our return requirements. And in fact, given the current economic conditions, we anticipate our capital spending will be down significantly in 2009.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, SPG completed six financings that totaled $1.220 million of proceeds with a weighted average term of six years at an average interest rate of 5.72%. During the quarter, we also unencumbered six assets that generate over $57 million of annual EBITDA, and our unencumbered portfolio today generates annual EBITDA in excess of $1.7 billion and sales of</p>
          <p>approximately 500 per square foot. We have addressed all of our 2008 debt maturities. We are well positioned financially given our significant cash position of over $950 million including our share of joint venture cash, and our availability on our corporate credit facility of over $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Before I get to guidance and my concluding remarks, I would like to address two items out in the public domain, the first of which relates to traffic and occupancy. There are a number of firms that monitor and report shopper traffic and occupancy at U.S. malls. These firms issue releases and are interviewed by national media sources purportedly as industry experts on a topic. I would like to go on record and state definitively that we do not report any data to these firms. I believe that several other owners of high quality retail real estate assets also do not participate. Therefore, I leave it to your judgment as to whether or not their data is representative of the industry and certainly not us.</p>
          <p>Additionally, there has been a great public -- great deal of public speculation about the possibility of our acquisition of General Growth Properties. While our policy is generally not to comment on specific rumors like this, I will tell you that in the current environment, I can't envision a set of circumstances that would result in such a transaction. Now let me turn back to guidance and my concluding remarks</p>
          <p>Based upon third quarter results, projected activity for the rest of the year, and our view of current market conditions, today we gave 2008 FFO guidance of $6.40 to $6.45 per share, increasing the lower end of our previously provided range by $0.02. Our initial guidance for 2008 was $6.25 to $6.45 per share, and did not anticipate the second quarter 2008 debt extinguishment charge of $0.07 per share. I believe with the drastic change in the economy, we're probably one of the few real estate companies that have effectively increased our 2008 guidance. These are clearly challenging times, but I believe we will continue to be successful, including generating positive NOI growth from our portfolio and FFO growth in 2009. We anticipate obviously a slower leasing environment, and have worked diligently to execute leases for upcoming expiration. As a result, we are ahead of where we were at this point in time last year in leasing our upcoming years' expirations. We are aggressively managing our cost and our capital spend, and we have a strong balance sheet. I'll remind you that we are more than a Regional Mall company, with substantial income generated by our Community Center and Premium Outlet portfolios, both of which should benefit -- offer benefits in a challenging economic environment as consumers continue to look for value</p>
          <p>With that said, we're pleased with our results, and we're now open for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And your first question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs.  You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, here with <mark type="inaudible" /> as well. I guess, David, just to start, clearly the change in outlook in the credit markets, can you talk about sort of the 2009 outlook for debt maturities and what options remain available? I mean you did do a substantial amount of refinancings in the quarter, and that's certainly positive news. But it sounds like you're keeping some powder dry here. You want to keep cash on the balance sheet as well as your line sort of free and clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's accurate. I mean, we have $900 million of senior unsecured</p>
          <p>notes that come due next year as well as our share of secured debt around 900 million. We don't anticipate any concern about refinancing the secured debt. We are making progress. Obviously, the capital markets currently are more or less shut down. I think we've been anticipating for a year now that the world was about to change. We're well positioned to handle that as evidenced by our credit facility as well as the amount of cash on our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jay, this is Steve. I'd just add one comment on the secured debt that's coming due in 2009, it's properties that average 500 bucks a foot. It's properties that even at pretty conservative cap rates are 50% loan to value. So I think even in a relatively difficult market, we feel good about our ability to roll that over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sounds good. And you mentioned as well reducing sort of the CapEx for next year. Can you comment on specifically what percent decrease you expect? And also, David, your comments with regard to a large competitor, I mean would you look at one-off acquisitions in terms of individual assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me talk about capital spending. Our -- we anticipate kind of a flexible number, because we continue to work very diligently to add a lot of value to our portfolio.  We feel that there are going to be a number of unique opportunities to do that in the upcoming years. I call it kind of a flex offense, flex defense. Right now, we're in the flex defense. Our share of capital spending, we anticipate being just under 400 million next year in '09. That can certainly increase opportunistically if the world stabilizes, which I think it will in '09, but we're certainly planning that it won't. That's just my judgment. And, listen, I don't want to say anything -- I mean, I went outside of our corporate policy on not commenting on M&amp;A transactions, but I felt like given the size of the transaction, the importance of what's going on there, I felt like I had to answer it. Other than that, Jay, I really can't shed any more light on that, other than, we've been really good stewards of capital here. We will not do anything stupid, and we are very focused on continuing to grow our company prudently. Beyond that, I don't want to comment other than those statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds good. And then just last question, in terms of the NOI growth, you gave the year to date statistics. The quarter was, obviously the third quarter result was a bit of a deceleration from the previous quarter. Was there anything in there specifically, whether it was higher bankruptcies you referenced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, Jay, let me just focus on that. I mean, I would always look to the year to date number. I go back, for instance, in the second quarter of '07, the Malls had 1.6% NOI growth, and the quarterly numbers have a lot of variability to it. We still think very comfortably that in '08 we're going to grow the comp NOI of the mall portfolio consistent with the guidance we gave. The third quarter was a little bit lower than that, but what we see in the fourth quarter we think will make it up, so we're within that 3 to 4% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if Rick's there, any comments on October sales or any thoughts on the Gap, the announcement to close stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll just add, Rick, while Rick is gathering his thoughts, what Gap is doing is not unusual. And it's something that we've frankly have seen and been dealing with over the last couple of years. We don't have October sales. We get those anywhere from 20 to 30 days in arrears. But anecdotally, we think the October sales are going to be tough. Rick, now that you've gathered your thoughts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think October sales are going to be tough. I will say to you that this environment from the credit side is certainly more unique. But in terms of the give and take with our tenants, we've gone through this a number of times before. We're working through with our tenants, and we're still proceeding with all of our leasing activities, and that is continuing apace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, but it sounds like the spreads are still holding up, which</p>
          <p>is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Lou Taylor of Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. David, can you talk a little bit specifically about your January unsecured bond maturities and just philosophically how do you plan to address those, either through secured financing, just using cash, using the line, just how do you specifically think you're going to refinance those bonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, we're going to use our corporate facilities and/or our cash. Assuming -- we're assuming right now that the unsecured market is not going to be that attractive. So at this point, that's why we have husband our capital appropriately, and we don't -- obviously that's not an issue for us. I think we think strongly. We believe that there's lots of opportunities for us to access capital of a company of our position and our liquidity. But right now, we're not anticipating that, and we'll just use our cash that we have husband on the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then second question for Steve, Steve in terms of the JV share of FFO or contribution FFO this quarter, it looked like kind of other income and other expense bounced around a bunch from Q2. Any major events or drivers there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lou, there was just one thing. We sold the residential component of The Domain, which was as you know, a mall that we opened in Austin, Texas about 18 months ago. And our share of the gain, that was a 50-50 venture with a multifamily developer, and our share of that gain was about $9 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Banc of America.  You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning everyone. Just following up on same store sales</p>
          <p>growth, can you kind of break that out by month during the quarter? I know that you said that October is not going to be great, but I'm specifically curious about the trend in September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, look, we don't do it by month. But September was worse.  September brought us basically, we were up July and August, and September was a tough month in terms of sales. We still ended up 0.04%, but the important thing, and we are not a retailer, so we don't live and die by monthly sales. And September was a bad month. I mean, you saw the retailers, but beyond that, we do this on a quarterly. I think it's more importantly -- more important to do it on a quarterly basis because, in fact, we're not a retailer. And what happens in one month really doesn't have any bearing on us at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I noticed in The Mills regional mall portfolio, there was</p>
          <p>about a 2% decline in comp store sales. Would you say that type of a decline was fairly characteristic of the class B, C malls in your portfolio in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. I think you've got to look at where the malls are and any new competition that comes to the market, nothing there that would cause us to be overly concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then regarding development leasing in this environment,</p>
          <p>how much more difficult has it become over the last month to get a retailer to sign a lease on a new development project, both in the U.S. and internationally? And have you seen any tenants pulling out of projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fact is we don't have much new development. We have the expansion of Domain under construction, and we have Cincinnati Premium Outlet, and we're opening New Jersey, and we have the option of starting some new stuff next year, but that's it.  We don't have new development really undergoing this year. I will say though it's clearly there are a handful of retailers that have cut their open to buy. A handful of retailers that are essentially waiting to decide how much they're going to spend next year in terms of CapEx, kind of waiting to see what happens for the next three or four months. Some plans are on hold, and frankly, we anticipated that. That's why we've been pretty prudent on new development, but, Rick, you can add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only other thing I will tell you, at Domain, we are done with our anchors, and we're probably about 65% leased as we sit here today for an opening in November of '09. So what we're finding is that on the good opportunities, people are still interested. And happily we do not have a lot of inventory out there right now that we need to deal with that's new.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say that redevelopment leasing has been a lot easier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is, but we have been successful on our new development as well. So for us, right now, even though we've had some volatility with certain retailers on a few stores here and there, we feel that we're executing both our redevelopment and our development pipeline according to plan. Now, we expect '09 for new store openings to be at a reduced level. That's why we're being a little bit cautious. We're listening to our clients. We're not forcing the issue. We certainly could in some cases, but we're choosing not to. But we're still seeing success in what we're accomplishing both through our redevelopment and development efforts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as evidence, I mean, Rick and I were in Pittsburgh, I don't know, was it last week?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I was in Boston the week before with Burlington, and what we've done there, so we're getting the job done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On your lease expirations in 2009, I know you said you're ahead of last year, but how much of that is already addressed to date? And what should we be looking for in terms of kind of re-leasing spreads versus '08 levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just give you a sense of the activity that we've had in the mall portfolio. Year to date, we have -- and this is all fully executed -- we have 6,900,000 square feet of leases that have been fully executed in '08. That includes new deals, relocations, expansions, and renewals. And that's 2,451 deals through September 30. We have out for signature, now these are in process, but once they get to a certain port in our system, we have a relatively high confidence that they're going to be executed, an additional 4,213,000 square feet of space representing another 1,336 leases.</p>
          <p>So as we've been saying for the last several quarters, we have been very focused on dealing with our tenants on a much broader outlook in terms of years. We are substantially ahead probably 10 to 15% as we sit here today on '09 renewals, where we were as against '08 renewals. And we're now substantially into renewals that are coming up in the first quarter of '10. And that was a increased focus on us. We instituted it back in '06, and it's standing in very good stead with us. To date, our spreads are holding up as we reported, and certainly we are going to continue to make sure we price our space appropriately</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. David, my first question is regarding the redevelopment development pipeline. When you look out to '09, what are you guys raising your hurdle rates to when you assess new projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a good question. I mean, clearly, our cost to capital has increased reasonably, right, not more than the marginally? So, now, we do think that the volatility associated with it and its rapid rise is not a stabilized number. So we're trying to get a handle on that. But I</p>
          <p>think from new development standpoint, thankfully the returns, the new development focus continues to be with the Chelsea product, the returns continue to be north of 12, probably in the 12 to 14% range, conservatively underwritten. That will continue to motivate us to build, assuming we can still achieve those. And the redevelopment is a little bit lower than that. We still are looking for double digits. I think we can justify that given also what it does to the other parts of that asset, and also how it positions it in the marketplace. But I would tell you that new development would be north of 12 to 14, and redevelopment would clearly, we would be looking to try around 10. And if the current volatility and rapid rise in our cost to capital and the industry's stabilizes at that level, then we're going to have to reassess, but my guess is we're dealing with a temporary phenomenon right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how temporary in your view do you think that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wish I knew. I really don't. But I don't think, I think historically our cost of capital has been a lot lower than that, and I think it will trend toward the mean. It may not reach where we were in the 2007 period, but I do think it will revert back to the mean. And those kind of investments will add to our net asset value and the value of our firm overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then Rick, if you can talk a little bit about the back fill, or the pent-up demand you might have in any of your malls in terms of the replacement tenants for those that are closing, stores like <mark type="inaudible" /> and the inline retailers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've demonstrated over the years that we have been very successful in replacing those types of tenants. An important thing to point out with the <mark type="inaudible" /> stores that are closing, those are currently owned by others, all the Mervyn's stores that are closing are owned by others. So we are working with those owners in order to coordinate activities. We have been actively soliciting interest, and we have identified a number of users, and it's a combination of working with the people that own those stores and identifying users to come up with a way to go. There are still Boxes that are interested in taking these locations. But frankly, as you saw with our Macy's stores, a lot of the opportunity comes from just adding additional small shops. And in the properties that are better properties, that is a significant advantage for us, because we want additional small shop space to take advantage of the demand. In the better properties, demand is unabated. There is still people that are interested in coming into the better properties, and if we can obtain these Boxes back, it gives us an opportunity to do that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. If I just stick on that point for a second, does that suggest that this is one area where you still do have an appetite for investment in buying back some of these Boxes like you did with Federated May or is there less of an interest than there was than given the market now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, look, I think there is. I think the fact is, though, the people that bought those or refinanced those Boxes bought them in a robust market, and they have to understand that values associated with those Boxes are different in our view than their view. So the answer is, yeah, we're interested in buying them. It's probably not at the prices they have either on their books or what they would like to get, and we'll see how it shakes out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There have been a lot of retailers putting out various releases and comments about aggressively renegotiating their rents and requesting relief and various things like that, and could you just give your comment about when you see those, what your view of what is going on right now? And for example, are you giving the type of relief of going to percentage rent only type structures or what your stance is in those negotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sure. It's safe to say this is -- we have dealt with rent relief and rent relief requests basically since I have been here since 1990, right? So that's about 18 plus years.  And it really is very retailer specific. And ultimately, the only thing -- the judgment call mostly comes in if we think that the tenant is about the file Chapter 11, and whether we can help offset that through some combination of rent relief or negotiated store closings, and we'll look at it.  We're very -- we have a basically, an unbelievable staff that can assess viability and what we might get in Chapter 11 Reorg versus the prospects of them going forward if we grant them rent relief. A lot of that times, it's an industry issue. So if we're doing it, we'll find out what the other developers are doing, and more or less come up with a consistent format. So that really is retailer specific. If it's an interesting lease, and if it's a healthy retailer, we really won't entertain rent relief.  And the only other item is if it's at the expiration of a lease, and that's typical, depending on the market value of the space, what the tenant brings, and so on. And I will tell you that there is anecdotally some increase in rent relief. But our policy and procedures in how we deal with that hasn't changed in this market. And I will say that, I have been doing this for a while, not as long as Rick, but I will tell you that our approach to this has not changed, and what we have seen really isn't anything that causes us, by any stretch of the imagination, alarm. I mean, this is consistent with a down economic cycle. and one that we know how to navigate through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would only add two things. One, we have made it incumbent upon our leasing agents to look out a year to identify those tenants that David just mentioned that are coming to an end of the lease term with lower than appropriate productivity. And we want to make sure that we have already started leasing their space to another tenant. Which will enable us to hopefully maximize our ability to either renew that tenant at a better rent or just say thanks, we appreciate that you have to leave, good-bye, because we have a replacement tenant at market rates. And the only other thing I would say, and this is to David's point that we're not a retailer, we're very focused on the credit of our tenants, and we have an entire department here that is constantly assessing that credit. And happily in this cycle, the credit of the tenants that we're doing business with happens to be substantially firmer than it was in previous downturns, say in '80 and in '90. So you have many less people walking in and saying, I'm out of business, now let's talk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only other thing I would add to that, Paul, is obviously, our position in the industry, our quality portfolio, our Premium Outlet portfolio allows us to be best positioned to negotiate with the retailer the best possible outcome for us and for the retailer. So we have tools available to us that are somewhat distinctive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. My last question on the rent spreads, there's a big healthy spread between where you're expiring rents show up on your lease schedule versus where you have signed the rate at which you've signed leases so far this year. Is there any reason that we might be cautious in interpreting that as just a very healthy cushion?  Is there some vulnerability? Or I don't want to just all the sudden assume that you're going to get the same spreads, or even assume that their spreads will be positive. But is there anything we should think about in terms of the size of that spread now and where you think it will come out next year given what retailers are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Paul, this is Steve. The mix of leases that are expiring does change from year to year. So looking at, for example, the leases that we signed in '08 and trying to compare them to '09 expirations is a bit of an apple and an orange. But what I would tell you is that you can go back and look at five years of history in our K, and our rollover spreads in the mall business have been pretty consistently between 15 and 25%. And I think we would expect that same range of outcomes in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. This question is aimed at Steve. Just wanted to try to get a more numerical sense of what is going on at the mortgage level with respect to your JVs. Compared to a year ago, maybe two years ago, where can you -- what kind of a cap rate are the lenders putting on the properties now versus then?  And what are you seeing in terms of the bids on the rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the market is obviously much different than it was a year ago. The cap rate specifically is going to be very dependent upon the quality of the assets. But I think it's fair to say that cap rates are higher, loan to values are lower, and spreads are wider. And we have clearly seen all three of those move in that direction over the course of the last six to 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add, though, I mean, if you look at our historical finance policy, <mark type="inaudible" /> we have never been looking for that last marginal dollar, that last marginal cost. And so even though cap rates have moved up, and they can -- and the cap rates have moved up say to 9%. As we run through our maturity schedule on secured assets, it will be something abnormal for us not to be able to refinance our existing secured debt. We may have a couple of ones that even in today's environment that may require some level of capital contribution in terms of dealing with the amount of new mortgage, but we have never been the max proceeds guy on secured financing. And remember, we also have partners in these, and where you see most of the secured financing is with our JV partners. So to the extent that that does happen, our partners are going to have to come up with a capital contribution. But I will tell you and underline that we don't anticipate, other than a couple of mortgages here and there, assuming the world stabilizes even in the higher cap rates. In addition, and the most important fact that I can tell you is that we have a 1.7 billion of EBITDA that is unencumbered, right? So put whatever cap rate you want to put on that. I think I made it in my statements, 500 bucks a foot in sales. That gives you a sense of the firepower that we have to deal in today's volatile financial market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I just want to clarify, you said that 9% is not out of the question in terms of cap rate on some of these assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  As a follow-up, I'm curious as to there's a lot of noise out there at the life insurance companies might be pulling back on direct real estate investment and lending. I was wondering if you can just kind of sort through who is really out there in the market right now? And who is pulling back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's safe to say, and that's why '08 is done for us. We have a lot of life insurance companies that are on hold for the rest of this year. We have been told by them they're anxious to replenish their investments next year. They're on the sidelines. That's fine for us. It doesn't matter, because we're done. But there are a number of life insurance companies that aren't making commitments for the rest of the year, no big deal. We anticipate them coming back into the market. It would be awkward for us to go through and list them, other than we have been a wonderful borrower from life insurance companies. Sponsorship is more and more important as they go through Credit Committees. They're going to want to put dollars out. We have tended to perform for them, so we think when things normalize or stabilize in '09, that we will be able to</p>
          <p>tap into that market. As we did in the third quarter, we closed a life insurance company deal at the end of the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great quarter. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilermann of Citi. You may</p>
          <p>Proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="inaudible" /> is on the phone with me as well. David, just going back to your comments on GGP, you were very specific to say that you can't envision a set of circumstances that would result in an acquisition of the entire company.  What are those circumstances that led you to say that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Michael, we're important stewards of capital here. We will look at any and all transactions, but we're also realists about capital markets, return expectations, and so on.  And that has kind of led us to the conclusion that we are where we are today. Beyond that, I mean, it's awkward for me. I would rather not comment more than what I have done. There has been lots of public speculation, so we felt it was important to address it. But obviously, the size of the transaction is probably the biggest reason, and where capital markets exist today for size, we are realists, so I think that's important to communicate to the market given the speculation out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess at the same time, based on your relationships and your capital position, if you're able to de-risk the transaction somehow, by bringing in partners, by carving up the portfolio. And getting it at the right price, and working with the lenders, it's not off the table, right?  I mean, this is just saying, look, in its entirety, I'm not, me alone, going to go do it in the current state?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, beyond what I said, I can't elaborate. But I just want to reinforce the fact that in all of our transactions that we have done, we have done them appropriately. I think in hindsight, I think the market can attest to that. The last thing we want to do is absolutely make a mistake or take an undue risk in today's environment, and that's where we stand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's <mark type="inaudible" /> here. You commented that same store NOI and FFO growth would both be positive next year. Can you just comment on the drivers behind that assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I mean, just so everybody knows, we have a consistent cycle on how we budget at the company. We do that basically unfortunately in the month of November, so we're -- actually we have been at it a little bit longer, so we have been doing that. Then we announce our growth kind of at the end of -- I'm sorry, at the beginning of '09 somewhere near our earnings first quarter earnings or year-end earnings call. We're going through the same process, but obviously we know what we have developed. We know what we re-developed. We have preliminary budgets that we're going through from all of our various platforms, and we can put it in the blender and get a sense of where things are headed. And that's what gives us confidence to state that. The exact range and numbers, we'll communicate that to the marketplace. I also want people to get some sense of comfort that even in today's world, I mean we feel like we'll produce positive NOI growth. And we'll do that through leasing, cost containment, and then what is coming in the pipeline. So I think that's the important statement that I wanted to convey to people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just in relation to Liberty, you have increased your stake, and there is obviously a lot of rumors out there at the moment. Are you able to make a comment on that at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, other than we continue to own the stock. We believe we're -- the stock we own is under the intrinsic value of the company even in -- as the world adjusts in terms of what cap rates are, and beyond that, we don't have any additional comment.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>The same as we disclosed at the end of the quarter, Michael.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the U.K., you have to disclose additional increments of over 1%. So it's safe to say that we're -- we have not increased the stake beyond the 5% or else we would have to disclose it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess when you're talking in terms of same store growth for next year, I guess wrapped up in that is not a huge falloff in unexpected closures on the retail front?  Occupancy declines that are just really out of your control?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, we're certainly budgeting what we know in these numbers. And we're certainly being conservative, but as much as we would like to say, I mean, there are things out of our control. That is correct. Biggest of which is that, but the biggest one also is to some</p>
          <p>extent, percent sales. And it's not a huge number, but it's obviously hard for us to predict where sales for particular retailers are going to be in '09, so sure, there is some volatility, that's why we give a range, and we'll treat that the same way we treated our earnings guidance. In addition, the good news is I think I have had Shelly look at this thing, and I think we have gotten really good at this. I think if Shelly knows these numbers, I mean, I have looked at the last 20 quarters. I think we have beat 17 or whatever it is, once, twice. It's really good performance. We would hope to be able to continue to do that next year.</p>

          <p>Yeah, let me -- I'll take mea culpa for the team, even though it wasn't my typo. We accidentally dropped off the deal in Sicily. It's not a Premium Outlet. It's actually a hyper market anchored mall in Katanya That is still all systems go. It's under construction. We just</p>
          <p>had a typo. Don't lose confidence in the other data. It happened, and <mark type="inaudible" /> turning into our China expert with a little guidance from me, we have actually -- we have put that in kind of a holding pattern, waiting for just a little bit more data from some of our existing four centers there.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's the same metrics that affect us every year. I don't think it's any different '09 versus what has transpired historically. It's lease-up, it's occupancy, it's sales growth, it's rent spreads, and then it's what we can do on the cost side. So I mean, all of the same fundamentals apply. Even in the more difficult retail environment that exists, as I said, we still feel pretty good at the moment where we stand today that we're going to generate positive NOI growth out of both the material parts of our business, being the mall business and the outlet business.</p>

          <p>David, in the past, you have talked about your expectation that the company might take advantage of certain distressed real estate opportunities. And not necessarily pertaining to GGP, given what is happening in the retail and credit markets, yet it sounds like you're clearly concerned about the availability of credit as well as your own capital needs probably a few years from now. So in light of that, how do you balance the desire to pursue attractive real estate opportunities versus maintaining a healthy balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, that's what a CEO does, right? So let me just say this, I'm not worried. I just want to underline what you said, which is I have no worries at all about our ability to deal with what we have to deal with here. So there was a phrase in your question that suggested that we might have a worry about what our capital needs are here, and how we're going to deal with it. I have, I want to underline this strongly, I have no worries about our ability to deal and meet with our capital needs here. Now I love opportunities. I think we have been opportunistic historically. I think in this environment, we will be able to do that, Ben. But on the other hand, we have got to be thoughtful on how we do that. And the world is a little bit unstable, and I think we're just being extremely cautious, which is what we -- I think appropriate to do given the environment. Now, my instinct is to be aggressive and opportunistic. And I think we will continue to find those opportunities, but we have got to balance that with caution in this market.  We are not nervous. We are all steam ahead. We are doing pretty much what we want to do, but we're just -- we're adding a little bit more caution to our approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Is it premature to start thinking about your maturities in say 2010 and 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. And obviously, 2010, we have our secured debt. We have got a fantastic group of assets coming due, including Forum Shops, Copley, West Chester. I think if you look at all of those and the amount of outstanding all those, I think you'll see that those are underlevered, and again, I just reinforce, it's never too early to plan for the future. That's what we're all about. We don't see any issue there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. David, earlier when you were talking about lenders and</p>
          <p>underwriting, you said some of the weaker assets. You think the lenders would use maybe a nine cap.  When you look at the opposite end of the spectrum for your strongest assets, where do you think lenders are underwriting those today, and do you think they're appropriate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think everybody is being cautious right now, right?  So I mean they're clearly under that. The debt service coverage is higher than it was, but the important point that -- let me -- I thought I had stressed, but let me stress again, our model has never been the max leverage on individual assets. So even with today's more stringent underwriting requirements, the vast, vast, vast majority of the mortgages that we will refinance in the upcoming years, we don't see any issue with refinancing the existing indebtedness. In addition, if you look at our corporate cash, you look at our corporate facilities, and then you couple that with the 1.7 billion of unencumbered EBITDA, which is unprecedented in the real estate industry. So I mean these are things that we're obviously focused on, but the stricter underwriting requirements, it will not have an impact on us other than on the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mike, this is Steve. Just to add one comment, our financing model isn't dependent upon the ability for us to roll over mortgage debt and generate excess proceeds. I mean, in an environment where we can do that and it makes sense cost wise, we will do that, but our business model doesn't depend on that. So as David said, if we're in a scenario for '09, 2010, what have you, all we're doing is basically rolling over existing debt. That's fine.  Because we have got other avenues of capital like the bond market, like free cash flow, like our unencumbered EBITDA to draw from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. But when you're looking at where others are pegging the</p>
          <p>value of the assets on the lending community, the stronger assets, are they using somewhere in the neighborhood of a seven, are they in the sevens? Is it higher than that or lower than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, it depends on the asset. It would be in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. Hey Rick, do you have the list or thoughts on</p>
          <p>retailers that are opening stores in 2008, I guess 2009, really?  Or has that sort of shrunk to irrelevant at his point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the specialty area, we are continuing to do business with the retailers that we have done business with historically.  We have got significant openings scheduled in '09 with Coach, Aeropostale, Forever 21, Limited Brands, Express, Sephora, Buckle, Tween, Wet Seal. And all of those are things that have been reconfirmed in the last few weeks. So I think David made the point that are retailers becoming more cautious? Certainly. Are they evaluating how much incremental open to buy they're going to have in '09? Yes. Is it going to be like May of '07 when retailers would come in and say guess what, I want to open 20 new stores that I didn't have in my budget? Probably not. But where they have had budgets, they're maintaining the budgets and they're continuing to open stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd just underline another important point to that, Rich, is that two things. One is there is no new development.  So the open to buys that exist will reside in existing centers, which is a really important point for us in that what's happened with the economy and capital basically eliminates new develop. And I mentioned this last quarter, quarter before, it could be as long as a decade of new development, in a material sense, there will always be a few deals here and there. Additionally, the retailers are as focused on sponsorship and who they do business with as lenders, as shareholders, and as other constituencies, and again and again, that reinforces where we are in the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Good. Thank you, David. And then on the debt side, Steve, you guys were talking about where you stand with insurance companies. What is your feel for what the bank guys are saying? I mean, I realize you don't necessarily have to give mortgages. But when you talk to these guys, as I'm sure that you do, the Loan Officers in particular, do you sense any improvement in their tone, or is this just sort of -- we're dead in the water at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a little early to sense an improvement, Rich. Don't forget that the financial institutions have gone through a dramatic re-pricing of their own cost of capital. And I think they're still ferreting out what their business model looks like. They're in the business of lending money, but I think it's a bit early yet to say that they're back active in the market. We expect that to happen. It may not be until the back half of 2009, but there is very little activity in that market right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hate to say it, Rich, but again, sponsorship and quality of assets, and the team is an extremely important criteria that they'll do. And I think they want to go with the proven player.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. And then the last thing, guys, is same sort of thing on the private equity side, is there anybody out there who has any interest in working with you to find again GGP type things aside, just distressed opportunities? Or is that sort of capital interested at this point, or are they sitting on the sidelines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tell you that there is capital for those kind of investments. And again, I hate to -- I think that they would love to align themselves with someone like us. The good news is we have again been able to kind of avoid a mine field in a sense. We looked at the fund business. We chose not to do it after thoughtful consideration, I think given where that business I, in hindsight, it was the right decision to make. But on the other hand, we have been very successful in our Mills deal, and align ourselves with opportunistic capital. Rich, there is no doubt in my mind that that kind of capital is available for us, depending upon the situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. This might be for Steve, but I think David you</p>
          <p>mentioned in your comments about 2009, about cost containment as one opportunity. Are those costs that can be trimmed away today, or are you speaking more about at the margin in terms of trimming expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look. We have prided ourselves on always being reasonably run, but so it's a little bit of both. I mean, it's all on the margin given the size of our company, but look, we're out to be as profitable as we can. So there's things that we can do in different environments. The good news at the property level again is if we are able to generate the savings at the property level, that adds to our bottom line given the fixed CAM scenario. Obviously, inflation is out of the system, which is really good. That's going to help on utilities. I think that's going to help on real estate taxes in terms of assessments. You can go down the road. We were looking a few months ago at a tougher economic environment, higher utility costs, and the like. And now we've got the tough economic environment, but we're seeing savings on the cost side. So we're going to pull as many levers as we can to be as profitable as we can, but yet we're not -- this is a company that has been reasonably run. We can always be better. So I don't think it's going to be dramatic savings in totality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a question concerning occupancy given what you're hearing from retailers, can you give us an update on when you think industry occupancy might hit a bottom in the future, what that bottom looks like versus say today, your occupancy this year?  And maybe even beyond that, when you think that turns the corner? I could ask you questions about that all day long.  I'm guess I'm trying to figure out the variability between market size and mall productivity at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a really hard one. I don't -- I do think it will bottom sometime in '09, but that's a crystal ball thing. And the important point here is even with the retailer restructurings that exist, the slower sales, the somewhat reduced open to buys, we still think we're going to generate positive NOI growth, and that's the important metric to look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a last question or two for Rick, if I could. How is demand looking for</p>
          <p>your 2008 seasonal business around inline and kiosk temporary tenants? And I know it's early, but do your gift card sales pace at this point provide any indication for holiday sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me address the former first. We are on track for our inline business. And we really don't have any indications that that is going to set back. And in terms of the gift cards, the vast significant percentage of that business is done in the fourth quarter. And so it's really not a leading indicator as we sit here today. But on the seasonal business, we are -- we still have the demand, and there's still the entrepreneurs that want to take advantage of that. And we have been much more focused now interestingly, another I think enhancement is that we're now really looking at those tenants as a source of incremental permanent tenants. And we've been able to convert a number of the tenants that started in our portfolio as temporary tenants <mark type="inaudible" /> into very successful full inline tenants with good, unique local businesses. So that's an important source of leads for us as well, as just revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last question concerns the Nordstrom's in Boston. I know you don't have time for a case study here, but it opened in Burlington in the recent past and I think Liberty Tree opens this week. What is the new and renewal leasing discussions been like around these deals? And how is that shaping up for South Shore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would just say if you go, Liberty Tree is a Nordstrom's rack, so it's a different animal, it's not a full line, full price Nordstrom. I will tell you, If you look at Burlington and the lease-up, Nordstrom is a wonderful retailer, and they add a lot to the mall environment. And they bring -- they allow us in a lot of cases to execute an upgrade of the tenant mix, which is what we did at Burlington in their wing. And even though the timing is not great, it's a great long-term situation for us there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just -- David alluded to this earlier, but an interesting study is Ross Park, where we added Nordstrom in lieu of a Macy's. And with an announcement of Nordstrom's, we got an L.L. Bean and there's a Tiffany and a Louis Vuitton and a Michael Kors and a Juicy Couture. So we have substantially transformed Ross Park Mall into the unambiguous place to shop and a trade area of over 1.5 million people. And that's what we do here.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of James Elman of Seacliff. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  Could you give us a little bit of outlook on how your business would have the ability to have -- show flexibility or what happens to your business if some of the prognostications of same store sales before this holiday sale -- this season being down 10 to 15% due to loss of consumer credit as well as slowing economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, not a lot of our earnings is tied directly to sales.  Most -- the vast majority in the mall portfolio is tied to fixed rent. So and then as <mark type="inaudible" /> -- the part that is tied to sales, it's a combination of sales throughout the whole year, and what we've noticed is that if some people go out of overage rent, and others go in, and it kind of is a pretty static environment. Now, with the Outlet business, the Outlet business we have more of the anchors are tied as a direct percent of sales. But we think the Outlet business is somewhat counter cyclical in that consumer and certainly with gas, I mean, there was a lot of questions on gas prices and how that may affect the Outlet. We actually think the consumer may look for more value, and so maybe there is better sales there despite the environment. We don't know. We'll find out. So the long story short is it's a couple of cents here and there out of 6.40 to 6.45, so that's not to say that in my view it is somewhat immaterial. I will let you judge whether that is material or not. But it's not going to make-or-break us one way or another.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well I understand the percentage rent is a relatively small size in your revenue statement, but if we had a 10 to 15%, a significant drop in holiday sales, I imagine that would put many of your tenants to the wall. How do you deal with that, how do you react to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I think as Rick said, if you look at the vast majority of tenants that we're doing business with, they are well capitalized. And so it would depend on the tenant and so on, in terms of reaction to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would also make the point that the tenants have not been operating their business in a vacuum, and they have been substantially reducing their inventory, reducing their in-store employees, because they're running their businesses for bottom line EBITDA as well. So while they care, that's another thing going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So last question would be if they have been cutting back inventory significantly, is there a chance you're going to have significant empty shelves this holiday season?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, at this point, the question I had, the rollover of secured debt was probably beaten to death, but let me ask a slightly different angle. Would you refinance maturing unsecured debt with secured debt, thus changing the mix?</p>

          <p>I just had a follow-up on Las Vegas and what you're seeing at the</p>
          <p>Forum Shops, and trends, and sort of how you're looking at the market overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, Forum Shops continues to be the leader in Vegas. Clearly, I think we had said this in our first call, first quarter call, I believe, that we had seen softness in Las Vegas. It continues to be that way. There is no -- the drop in sales that we saw over the first half of the year continues to be that kind of drop, in other words, the drop percentage is not increasing. It's kind of at that same level that we saw kind of in the 5, 10% drop. But even with that said, it's still the No. 1 performer, so in Vegas, but Las Vegas, obviously, has had it's issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess in this sort of environment, would you be less willing to put more capital to work in Vegas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have something that's specific in mind, Michael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not a broker, so I'm not hawking anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we can underwrite Las Vegas reasonably well, given our knowledge of it. And beyond that, obviously we're pleased with the Forum Shops, but I think we have to take into account the fact that Las Vegas economy is not doing so well right now</p>
